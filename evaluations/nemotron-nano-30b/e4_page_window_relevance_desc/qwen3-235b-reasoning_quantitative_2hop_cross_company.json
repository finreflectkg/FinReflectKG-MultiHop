      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. Accenture's cost of services is incorrectly reported as $41,892,766 million, which is off by a factor of over 1,000 (the correct value is approximately $41,892.766 million). The model misreads the unit, treating thousands as millions. Broadcom's cost of services is cited as $19,450 million, but this figure refers to the 'gross carrying amount of purchased technology,' which is not equivalent to total cost of services. There is no evidence in the response that the correct line item for Broadcom's total cost of services was used. (2) The calculation is therefore fundamentally flawed: $41,892,766 + $19,450 = $41,912,216 million is numerically inconsistent and based on incorrect inputs. The correct combined total is $41,974.766 million, per the ground truth. The LLM's result is off by over 40,000 million dollars due to the unit error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially present—two companies are considered, and an attempt is made to sum their values—but the synthesis fails because incorrect data points are extracted. The model does not demonstrate accurate cross-document information retrieval. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses the right companies, year, and metric in structure, but quantitative and qualitative accuracy are severely compromised by unit confusion and incorrect data sourcing, warranting low scores in those areas.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. It incorrectly states that ConocoPhillips' (COP) 2023 depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense was $17,007 million, whereas the ground truth is $8,270 million. This is a significant overstatement. Chevron's (CVX) 2023 DD&A of $17,326 million is correct. The total for 2023 is therefore incorrectly calculated as $34,333 million instead of the correct $25,596 million. Similarly, the reported 2022 combined total of $34,635 million is incorrect — the actual combined 2022 expense was $31,435 million. The model fails to report the individual 2022 figures accurately (COP: $7,504M, CVX: $23,931M), which invalidates its comparison. (2) Calculations are flawed: the correct 2023 total is $25,596M (not $34,333M), and the correct 2022 total is $31,435M (not $34,635M). The actual year-over-year change is a decrease of $5,839M, but the model reports only a slight decrease of $302M due to incorrect inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially attempted — the model does try to sum across companies and years and make a comparison — but because the underlying data is wrong for COP 2023 and both 2022 values, the synthesis fails.

(1) All key numbers are correct: ABBV's 2023 value is $136.42, ABT's is $112.51, ABBV's 2022 value is $116.84, and ABT's 2022 value is $114.59. The direction of change (increase for ABBV, decrease for ABT) is correctly stated. (2) The only minor issue is the addition of 'million' after each dollar amount (e.g., $136.42 million), which is incorrect—the unit is dollars per share unit, not total dollars, so 'million' should not be there. This is a contextual misrepresentation of units, though the numeric values themselves are accurate. The difference of $23.91 is implied but not explicitly calculated, which is acceptable since the question asks for the difference and the answer provides both values. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly compares values across two companies and two years, identifies trends, and draws the correct conclusion that ABBV had a higher increase (while ABT decreased). (4) Despite the unit error, the semantic meaning and financial interpretation are preserved, warranting a high score. Correctness is slightly penalized due to the misleading 'million' qualifier, which could cause misinterpretation in a financial context.",

AVGO's cost of revenue is correctly reported as $11,129 million. This leads to a completely incorrect sum of $22,237 million instead of the correct $11,205 million. (2) The calculation itself (adding two numbers) is mathematically sound, but the inputs are wrong—specifically, QCOM's value appears to be confused with another metric or company. $11,108 million is close to AVGO’s number, suggesting possible data misattribution. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect entity-metric alignment: while the model identifies the correct companies (AVGO and QCOM) and fiscal years, it retrieves an incorrect financial figure for QCOM, breaking the synthesis.

      "original_answer": "The combined bitumen production for COP and XOM in 2023 was 426 thousand barrels daily, compared to 393 thousand barrels daily in 2022. This represents an increase of 33 thousand barrels daily year-over-year.",

In 2022, their bitumen production was 327 thousand barrels daily for COP and 63 thousand barrels daily for XOM, totaling 390 thousand barrels daily.

      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains minor numerical discrepancies. It reports combined 2023 production as 422 thousand barrels daily (vs. ground truth 426), and 2022 combined as 390 (vs. 393), resulting in a 32 thousand barrel increase (vs. 33). These small differences likely stem from rounding or source data variation. (2) Individual component values: COP 2023 = 355 (LLM) vs. likely 359 (implied by 426 - 67), XOM 2023 = 67 (correct), COP 2022 = 327 (LLM) vs. likely 330 (implied by 393 - 63), XOM 2022 = 63 (correct). The XOM figures match exactly; COP figures are off by ~4k bbl/day per year, leading to a 3k bbl/day error in totals and the year-over-year difference. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts bitumen production for both years, sums them, and computes the year-over-year change. It appropriately limits scope to bitumen from Canada/Other Americas, indicating correct entity and metric alignment. (4) Scores reflect high accuracy in reasoning and context, with a slight deduction in quantitative accuracy due to the small but consistent numeric offsets. Semantic equivalence is largely preserved, and the conclusion of a ~33k increase is nearly matched at 32k.",

      "original_answer": "Apple provides specific gross margin figures for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024, allowing analysis of trends over time, while Qualcomm explicitly states that its gross margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. This enables a comparative assessment of gross margin performance between the two companies, with Apple showing potential fluctuation across years and Qualcomm indicating stability in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% in 2022 to 44.1% in 2023 and further to 46.2% in 2024, reflecting improvements in product and service margins driven by cost savings, favorable product mix, and higher services revenue. In contrast, Qualcomm's gross margin performance for fiscal 2024 is not disclosed in the provided 10-K filing excerpts, which only include operating expense details and revenue breakdowns but do not specify Qualcomm's gross margin percentage or year-over-year trend.

The ORIGINAL ANSWER (ground truth) states that Qualcomm explicitly disclosed its gross margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year. However, the LLM claims that Qualcomm's gross margin performance for fiscal 2024 is 'not disclosed' and 'cannot be made from the given documents,' which directly contradicts the ground truth. This is a major error in both entity and qualitative accuracy. Additionally, the LLM provides specific gross margin percentages for Apple (43.3%, 44.1%, 46.2%) that are not present in the original answer, which only states that Apple provides gross margin figures allowing trend analysis—without specifying the actual numbers. These figures may be factually correct in reality, but since they are not in the ground truth derived from the knowledge graph of disclosed 10-Ks, their inclusion constitutes a hallucination. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the percentages cited for Apple are not confirmed in the ground truth, and the key fact about Qualcomm’s flat gross margin—explicitly stated in the original answer—is entirely missed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the question asks to compare Apple’s three-year trend with Qualcomm’s 2024 performance. The LLM incorrectly concludes no comparison can be made due to missing Qualcomm data, when in fact the ground truth confirms Qualcomm’s flat margin is disclosed. Thus, the synthesis across companies is flawed. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent align with the question, discussing both companies and gross margins, but the core factual foundation is incorrect, undermining the response’s validity.",

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement or on an interim basis if triggered, while Lockheed Martin initially defers these gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortizes them into income or expense over the average remaining life expectancy or service period of plan participants.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in earnings through a mark‑to‑market approach when the annual remeasurement occurs, while Lockheed Martin amortizes such gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy or service period of the plan participants. Consequently, Caterpillar’s earnings are impacted in the period the gain or loss is recorded, whereas Lockheed Martin spreads the impact evenly over many years.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is factually correct and conveys the same core information as the ground truth. (1) It accurately states that Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in earnings via a mark-to-market approach upon annual remeasurement, while Lockheed Martin amortizes them over the average remaining life expectancy or service period. This matches the original answer's key distinction. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the differing accounting treatments between two companies (Caterpillar and Lockheed Martin) regarding actuarial gains/losses, which is the essence of the question. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits explicit mention that Lockheed Martin initially defers gains/losses into accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) before amortization—a detail included in the original answer. While implied by 'amortizes', the explicit deferral into AOCL adds precision. However, the semantic meaning and practical implication (timing of earnings impact) are preserved. Wording differences are acceptable and do not affect factual correctness. All entities (Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin, actuarial gains/losses, mark-to-market, amortization, service period) are correctly identified and contrasted.",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's and Lockheed Martin's approaches to recognizing actuarial gains or losses differ, particularly in terms of their impact on earnings and the timing of recognition?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if triggering events occur. This approach directly impacts Caterpillar's earnings volatility. In contrast, Lockheed Martin recognizes actuarial gains or losses as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and these changes are recognized in connection with the annual remeasurement and amortized over time, suggesting a more gradual impact on earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in earnings through mark‑to‑market remeasurements of its postretirement benefit obligations, whereas Lockheed Martin also records these gains or losses in earnings at the time of remeasurement but additionally amortizes them over the average remaining life of plan participants (subject to thresholds). Consequently, Caterpillar’s earnings can swing more abruptly from actuarial changes, while Lockheed Martin spreads the impact over time, resulting in a more gradual effect on reported earnings.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer correctly identifies that Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in earnings via a mark-to-market approach, which impacts earnings volatility—a key point from the ground truth. It also correctly contrasts this with Lockheed Martin's approach of amortizing the impact over time, leading to a more gradual effect on earnings. However, the LLM answer contains a significant factual inaccuracy: it states that Lockheed Martin 'records these gains or losses in earnings at the time of remeasurement' and then amortizes them. This contradicts the ground truth, which specifies that Lockheed Martin initially records actuarial gains/losses in *accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), net of tax*, not in earnings. Only the amortized portions are recognized in earnings over time. This is a critical distinction in accounting treatment—the immediate recognition in AOCL (not earnings) buffers earnings from volatility. By incorrectly stating that Lockheed Martin records the full gain/loss in earnings upfront, the LLM misrepresents the core of the company's accounting policy. There are no numerical values in the question, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable beyond consistency in terminology, which is maintained. The reasoning is partially sound but flawed in a key multi-hop synthesis: the model fails to correctly map the pathway from initial recognition (AOCL vs. earnings) to subsequent amortization. Contextually, the answer addresses the question's focus on differences in impact and timing, hence the moderate relevance score. The conclusion about smoother earnings impact at Lockheed is correct, but the reasoning path is flawed.",

It states that DIS used 5.94% and T used 5.06% for interest cost, but the ground truth is 5.37% for DIS and 3.90% for T, resulting in a 1.07% difference, not 0.88%. Similarly, for the benefit obligation, the LLM claims both companies have the same gap (0.88%), but the correct values are 5.94% (DIS) and 5.20% (T), a 0.74% difference (rounded to 0.80% in the original answer). (2) The calculations are therefore incorrect: the actual interest cost rate difference is 1.07%, not 0.88%, and the benefit obligation difference is 0.80%, not 0.88%. The LLM incorrectly equates the two gaps as 'nearly identical,' while the correct conclusion is that the interest cost gap is larger than the benefit obligation gap. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model uses the same rate (5.94%) for both interest cost and benefit obligation for DIS, conflating two distinct assumptions. It does not correctly distinguish between interest cost discount rates and year-end benefit obligation discount rates, which are different metrics reported separately in pension disclosures.

It states that FDX and GD both have $4,062 million in 'Debt Principal Thereafter', but the ground truth shows FDX has $15,517 million and GD has $4,062 million. This misassignment leads to a false conclusion that there is no difference, when in fact the difference is $11,455 million ($15,517 - $4,062). Additionally, the LLM claims both companies have ~46% of debt thereafter, but FDX’s proportion is actually ~77.7% ($15,517 / $19,772) and GD’s is ~45.9% ($4,062 / $8,826), meaning FDX has a significantly higher proportion. (2) All key numbers are wrong: FDX's 'Thereafter' debt is misstated as $4,062M instead of $15,517M; total debt figures are not referenced at all; calculations for proportions are incorrect for FDX. The only correct number is GD's $4,062M.

      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filing pages for 3M (MMM_10k_2022.pdf) and UPS (UPS_10k_2022.pdf), the question asks for the **total amount of gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) into income for foreign currency contracts in 2021 for both MMM and UPS combined**.\n\n- **For 3M (MMM)**:  \n  The relevant section on page `page_106` (under \"Cash Flow Hedging - Interest Rate Contracts\" and \"Foreign Currency Effects\") states:  \n  > \"Foreign currency forward/option contracts: Amount of gain or (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income: **(38)**\"  \n  This indicates a **loss of $38 million** was reclassified from AOCI into income for foreign currency contracts in 2021.  \n  *(Note: This is explicitly listed under \"Gain or (loss) on cash flow hedging relationships\" for foreign currency forward/option contracts, with a negative value of -$38 million.)*\n\n- **For UPS (UPS_10k_2022.pdf)**:  \n  The provided pages (`page_136`, `page_137`, `page_138`, `page_139`, `page_140`) focus on UPS's stock-based compensation (LTIP, RPUs) and do **not** contain any information about foreign currency contracts, gains/losses reclassified from AOCI, or related financial disclosures. UPS's foreign currency hedging activities are not discussed in the provided excerpts.\n\n**Combined Total**:  \n- 3M contributed **-$38 million** (a loss) from foreign currency contracts reclassified from AOCI in 2021.  \n- UPS contributed **$0** (no relevant data provided).  \n- **Combined total = -$38 million**.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the **total amount of gains or losses** (implying a net figure), and the provided data for 3M shows a **loss of $38 million**. Since UPS has no relevant data, the combined total is **-$38 million**. But the question specifies \"gains or losses,\" and the answer must be based strictly on the provided documents.\n\n**Critical Clarification**:  \nThe question asks for **\"gains or losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income for foreign currency contracts\"**. In 3M's case, this is explicitly stated as **-$38 million** (a loss). UPS has no such data. Thus, the combined total is **-$38 million**.\n\n**Answer**:  \nThe total amount of losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income for foreign currency contracts in 2021 for both MMM and UPS combined is **-$38 million** (a loss of $38 million).  \n\n*(Note: The question asks for \"gains or losses,\" and the provided data shows a loss of $38 million for MMM, with no contribution from UPS. The combined total is therefore a loss of $38 million.)*",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The ground truth states the combined total is $83 million in gains (a positive amount), whereas the LLM concludes a loss of $38 million, solely from MMM, with UPS contributing zero due to lack of data. However, the correct answer requires synthesis from both companies' filings: the $83 million total implies that both MMM and UPS reported reclassifications that sum to this amount. The LLM incorrectly assumes UPS contributed nothing because the provided pages (e.g., pages 136–140) discuss stock-based compensation and omit foreign currency disclosures. However, in a proper multi-hop evaluation, the model should have either: (1) accessed the correct sections of UPS’s 10-K where AOCI reclassifications for foreign currency contracts are disclosed, or (2) acknowledged that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Crucially, the LLM misreads the MMM data: it interprets the '(38)' as a $38 million loss reclassified from AOCI, but this value may pertain to a different line item or context (e.g., interest rate contracts), and the actual gain for MMM in foreign currency contracts might be positive. More importantly, the correct answer ($83 million combined) indicates that the UPS contribution must be positive and substantial (likely $121 million offsetting a negative $38 million from MMM, or both being positive). The model fails to perform the required multi-hop synthesis, uses incomplete document analysis, and draws a conclusion contradicted by the ground truth. While the reasoning structure is logical and the focus on AOCI reclassification is contextually relevant, the factual inaccuracies and incorrect calculation render the answer largely wrong. The model also does not explain why UPS’s data is missing or attempt to locate the relevant footnote (e.g., hedging activities in notes to financial statements), showing a failure in comprehensive document understanding.",

      "original_answer": "$841 million",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2023 10-K filings, AMD's \"Acquisition-related and other costs\" are disclosed in Note 15 of its financial statements (page 70), where it states: \"Acquisition-related and other costs primarily include transaction costs, purchase price adjustments for inventory, certain compensation charges, contract termination and workforce rebalancing charges.\" However, the exact dollar amount for AMD's 2023 fiscal year is not explicitly stated in the provided pages. For NVIDIA, the same line item is detailed in Note 17 (page 79) under \"All Other\" category, where it lists \"Acquisition-related and other costs\" as $583 million for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2024 (which corresponds to its 2023 fiscal year). \n\nThe question asks for the *combined* amount for both companies. AMD's filing does not provide a specific figure for \"Acquisition-related and other costs\" in the excerpted pages (68-72), and NVIDIA's amount is $583 million. Since AMD's amount cannot be determined from the given text, the combined total cannot be calculated. However, if we consider only the explicitly stated NVIDIA figure and note that AMD's amount is not provided, the answer must reflect that the combined amount is not fully ascertainable from the supplied data. \n\n**Answer**: The provided documents do not specify AMD's \"Acquisition-related and other costs\" amount for 2023, only NVIDIA's $583 million. Therefore, the combined total cannot be determined from the given information. \n\n*(Note: The question requires a 2-3 sentence answer.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect because it claims AMD's 'Acquisition-related and other costs' are not disclosed, when in the actual 2023 10-K filing (not the excerpted pages provided to the model), AMD reported $258 million for this line item in its consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 30, 2023. NVIDIA correctly reported $583 million, which the LLM identified accurately. The combined total of $258M (AMD) + $583M (NVDA) = $841 million matches the ground truth. (2) The quantitative accuracy is very low because the LLM failed to report AMD’s number and thus could not compute the correct sum. It only reported $583 million (correct for NVDA) but omitted AMD’s $258 million. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in that it correctly interpreted the need to sum both companies’ costs and correctly extracted NVIDIA’s figure. However, it failed the multi-hop synthesis by not accessing or recognizing AMD’s disclosed amount, which is publicly available in the full 10-K even if not in the provided excerpts. The model should have either inferred from complete data or acknowledged the limitation while still providing the known correct total if trained on full filings. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the response addresses the right metric and companies, and explains the issue clearly, but ultimately fails the core task of delivering the correct combined amount due to incomplete data usage.",

While it correctly states AMD's Data Center revenue growth as $453 million (from $6,043M to $6,496M), it incorrectly reports NVDA's growth as $15,005 million, which is actually NVDA's 2022 revenue, not the growth amount. The correct growth is $32,520 million ($47,525M - $15,005M). The LLM mistakenly uses the 2022 base value as the growth figure. Consequently, the combined increase is calculated as $15,458 million, which is incorrect; the correct total is $32,973 million. (2) Number verification: AMD's delta is correct ($6,496M - $6,043M = $453M), but NVDA's delta is wrong (should be $47,525M - $15,005M = $32,520M, not $15,005M). The sum is therefore also incorrect ($453M + $32,520M = $32,973M, not $15,458M). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly synthesize the year-over-year change for NVDA, confusing absolute revenue with growth. It identifies the correct entities and years but performs flawed arithmetic for NVDA. (4) Scores justified: Correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to critical numerical errors in growth calculation and sum. Qualitative accuracy is low due to faulty reasoning in interpreting growth.

This fundamental error invalidates all subsequent analysis. (2) The growth rates are also incorrect. The LLM claims Johnson & Johnson's oncology revenue grew by 8.6%, but the ground truth is 17.6%. It states Eli Lilly grew by 17.6%, but the correct figure is approximately 8.5% (from $2,792.1M to $3,028.8M). The LLM incorrectly cites Eli Lilly's 2020 oncology revenue as $12,367 million, which is not supported by the ground truth.

However, it omits the specific quantitative impacts stated in the ground truth: a $1.7 billion increase in finance charge income, $0.3 billion in investment income, and $1.8 billion rise in interest expense. Instead, it uses vague terms like 'higher' without citing numbers. For Starbucks, the LLM introduces a specific figure—$943 million reduction in fair value from a 100-basis-point rate hike—which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified against the ground truth. This number may be accurate but is unconfirmed and represents a detail not supported by the provided truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is reduced because key figures from the ground truth are missing (GM’s $1.7B, $0.3B, $1.8B), and an unverified number ($943M for Starbucks) is introduced. While the directionality of effects is correct, the absence of verified numbers and inclusion of unsupported ones lowers precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links rising benchmark rates to GM Financial’s revenue streams and Starbucks’ debt valuation sensitivity. It appropriately distinguishes between income effects (GM) and valuation effects (Starbucks), showing good synthesis across entities and financial concepts.

(2) Despite this minor error in the 2022 total, the core comparison remains valid: the 2023 total is correctly identified as higher than 2022. The exact increase is $1,149 million per ground truth ($2,910 - $1,761), but the LLM does not state the difference, only the comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound — the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies and two years, identifying the correct metric (cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized) and time periods. (4) The answer is contextually complete and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only a minor quantitative inaccuracy in the 2022 sum. Hence, a correctness score of 9 is warranted — very close to perfect, but not fully precise in calculation.",

It incorrectly states that Netflix's interest expense was $6,108 million, which is false — the ground truth is $699.826 million. This leads to a completely wrong difference of $596 million instead of the correct $6,004.174 million. Additionally, the percentages are miscalculated: AT&T's interest expense was 28.6% of its Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes ($19,848 million), not 27% of net income ($23,461 million), which is both the wrong base and wrong percentage. Similarly, Netflix's interest expense was about 1.1% of its net income, not 14%. (2) Number verification: AT&T's interest expense ($6,704 million) is correct. Netflix's interest expense is wrong — LLM says $6,108 million vs. true value of ~$700 million. Difference is off by over $5.4 billion. Percentages use incorrect denominators and yield wrong results. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve Netflix’s interest expense, misaligns financial metrics (using net income instead of pre-tax income for AT&T), and performs incorrect proportion calculations. It does attempt to compare both companies and compute percentages, showing awareness of required steps, but execution is invalid. (4) Correctness score is low due to pervasive numerical and conceptual errors. Quantitative accuracy is very poor. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the model recognizes the need for comparison and proportion calculation. Contextual relevance is moderate — it addresses the right companies and year, and attempts the right analysis, but with incorrect data and logic.",

However, due to the incorrect ConocoPhillips price, the calculated difference is wrong: the LLM reports $9.87 ($69.87 - $60), while the correct difference is $6.12 ($66.12 - $60). (2) The quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $69.87 figure does not match the ground truth of $66.12, and the resulting $9.87 difference is incorrect. Even if the source document cited (page 48 of the 10-K) contained $69.87, the evaluation must be based on the ground truth from the knowledge graph, which is authoritative. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—correctly identifying the need to compare ConocoPhillips' 2021 realized price with Chevron's 2022 assumption—but the factual input for ConocoPhillips is wrong, undermining the conclusion. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right entities, timeframes, and comparison logic. However, correctness and quantitative accuracy are very low due to the incorrect key number, resulting in a correctness score of 1.",

According to the ground truth, BKNG reported foreign currency transaction gains of $135 million in 2021, which the LLM correctly identifies. However, the LLM incorrectly states that BKNG had a $200 million loss related to Euro-denominated debt and derivative contracts — this is not mentioned in the original answer and introduces false information. For GM, the ground truth reports a loss of $203 million, which the LLM partially captures but adds an incorrect $17 million in gains, for which there is no support in the original. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: the LLM computes a net adverse impact of $65 million for BKNG (implying $135M gain minus $200M loss), but the original answer does not mention any offsetting loss for BKNG — it only reports a $135M gain. Similarly, the LLM calculates a $220M adverse impact for GM, but the original reports a straightforward $203M loss with no gains to offset. The final net difference is stated as $155 million by the LLM, but the correct net difference is $135M - (-$203M) = $338 million, as correctly computed in the original. The LLM’s calculation is based on incorrect inputs and reasoning. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is poorly executed: while the model attempts to compare foreign currency impacts between BKNG and GM, it fabricates components (e.g., BKNG’s $200M loss, GM’s $17M gain) not present in the source, failing to correctly synthesize the actual reported figures. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate — the answer addresses the right companies and year and attempts the comparison, but the inclusion of unsupported details and incorrect calculations severely undermines factual correctness.

      "original_answer": "The total interest expense for General Motors in 2021 was $3,496 million, while for Booking Holdings it was $56 million. The difference is $3,440 million. This significant difference is due to the nature of their respective businesses: Booking Holdings primarily incurs interest from debt discount amortization and issuance costs ($43 million in 2021), whereas General Motors incurs interest from both automotive operations ($950 million in 2021) and its financing arm, GM Financial ($2,546 million in 2021).",

This leads to a false difference of $625 million instead of the correct $3,440 million. The LLM also reverses the comparison, implying GM's expense is only slightly higher, when in fact it is vastly higher. (2) The calculation is entirely incorrect due to wrong inputs. While GM's total interest expense ($3,496 million), automotive portion ($950 million), and GM Financial portion ($2,546 million) are correctly stated, Booking Holdings' expense is wildly inaccurate.

(2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM incorrectly reports Netflix's D&A as $3,469 million (same as AT&T), which is over 9.7x higher than the actual value of $357.477 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It claims MMM's adjusted operating margin expanded by 100 basis points, but the ground truth shows an increase from 20.8% to 22.6%, which is an 180 basis point expansion, not 100. Additionally, the LLM fails to mention the specific dollar amounts of the adjustments: $463 million in litigation costs and $1,258 million for PFAS-related charges, which are critical to the multi-hop comparison. These omissions and errors undermine the factual foundation of the response. (2) The UPS portion is more accurate: the 280 basis point decline to 9.0% adjusted operating margin is correctly cited in the original, though the LLM does not specify the resulting margin (9.0%), only the decline. However, the LLM correctly identifies the 280 bps contraction and attributes it to volume declines, lower revenue per piece, and labor cost increases, which aligns with the ground truth. It omits UPS's actual cost reductions ($1.5B in network, $641M in P&D, $216M in sorting), which are key to showing that cost-cutting was insufficient to offset revenue and volume pressures. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly contrasts MMM's use of non-GAAP adjustments (PFAS and litigation) with UPS's operational headwinds, capturing the essence of the contrasting outcomes. However, it mischaracterizes the nature of MMM's adjustments as 'favorable PFAS-related adjustments' and 'litigation cost reductions', when in fact MMM added back large charges (not cost reductions), meaning the adjustments were accounting exclusions, not operational improvements. This reflects a misunderstanding of non-GAAP adjustments. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses both companies, the margin comparison, and the underlying drivers at a high level. The qualitative logic of contrasting MMM's accounting-driven margin boost with UPS's volume and wage pressures is directionally correct, earning moderate scores for qualitative accuracy and relevance.

It reports state deferred tax expenses of $1,591 million for CMCSA and $577 million for META, which are not supported by the ground truth. According to the original answer, CMCSA had a state deferred tax *benefit* of $468 million (i.e., -$468 million), and META had a state deferred tax *expense* of $123 million. The LLM's numbers are significantly off for both companies. (2) The calculation is also wrong: the LLM adds $1,591M + $577M = $2,168M and labels it a net expense, but the correct sum is -$468M + $123M = -$345M, which is a net *benefit*. The model fails to recognize that a tax benefit is a negative expense and misrepresents both magnitude and direction. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model should have retrieved and correctly interpreted deferred tax figures for two companies, recognized the difference between expense and benefit, and aggregated them with proper sign conventions. It fails on all counts—wrong values, wrong signs, incorrect synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the answer attempts to address the combined tax expense and whether it is a net expense or benefit, which aligns with the question’s intent. However, due to massive factual and quantitative errors, the correctness and accuracy scores are near the minimum.",

      "original_answer": "ACN uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments, approximating the rate at which it could borrow on a secured basis for a similar term and amount. TXN, on the other hand, uses a settlement approach in the U.S., selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds to simulate cash flows matching its benefit payments, and for non-U.S. locations with sufficient bond markets, it constructs a yield curve to determine a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same present value.",

TXN, as reflected in its 2023 disclosures, applies discount rates based on the weighted average of plan-specific assumptions, including a 5.20% discount rate for U.S. defined benefit obligations and 3.28% for non-U.S. plans, explicitly tied to the present value of projected benefit payments using these rates.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer incorrectly swaps the discount rate methodologies between ACN and TXN. According to the ground truth, ACN uses its incremental borrowing rate for lease payments, not a bond portfolio or yield curve approach for defined benefit plans. Conversely, TXN—not ACN—uses the settlement approach with high-quality corporate bonds in the U.S. and constructs yield curves for non-U.S. locations. The LLM attributes TXN’s actual methodology to ACN, which is a fundamental factual error. Additionally, the LLM introduces specific discount rate values (5.20% for U.S., 3.28% for non-U.S.) for TXN, but these numbers are not present in the original answer and were not asked for in the question, making them extraneous and unverified. (2) Quantitatively, while the percentages cited may reflect real data from TXN’s disclosures, they are not part of the ground truth provided and do not address the actual question about methods—thus introducing unsupported specifics lowers accuracy. There are no calculations in the question, so numerical precision is less critical, but the inclusion of unverified numbers reduces reliability. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model fails to correctly attribute the methods to the correct companies. It misidentifies ACN as using a bond portfolio approach and TXN as using weighted-average assumptions, which contradicts the ground truth that ACN uses an incremental borrowing rate (a completely different context—leases vs. pensions), while TXN uses the bond settlement method. This indicates a failure in synthesizing the correct information across entities and applications. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer discusses discount rate determination in a pension context and mentions both companies, but it misattributes key methods and introduces irrelevant numerical details, missing the core distinction in application (leases vs. pensions, borrowing rate vs. bond yield). The answer addresses the general topic but not the specific, correct practices of each company as defined in the ground truth.",

      "original_answer": "Costco accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates expected to apply in future years. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria also determines deferred tax assets and liabilities using differences between financial statement and tax bases, applying enacted tax rates. Altria evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering positive and negative evidence, including the character of the assets and potential sources of taxable income within carryback and carryforward periods. Both companies adjust their deferred tax assets and liabilities when tax rates change, with the effect recognized in income in the period of enactment. This approach directly affects their income tax provisions, as changes in deferred tax asset and liability valuations alter the overall tax expense recorded.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco accounts for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities by recognizing the tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards through its income tax provision, using enacted tax rates to measure the tax benefit or expense that reverses these items.

Altria similarly adjusts its income tax provision based on changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, reflecting the tax impact of temporary differences and the realizability of deferred tax assets through valuation allowances.

The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that both companies recognize the effect of tax rate changes in the period of enactment, nor does it detail Altria’s evaluation of positive and negative evidence regarding realizability.

HD's Interest and Other, Net as a percentage of Net Earnings should be 2,120 / 14,806 = 14.32%, but the LLM reports 13.7%. SBUX's should be 122.8 / 3,760.9 = 3.27%, but the LLM reports 0.3%, which is off by an order of magnitude. This leads to a completely incorrect comparison: the correct difference is 14.32 - 3.27 = 11.05 percentage points, but the LLM does not compute this and instead claims HD's percentage is '45.6 times greater', which is both methodologically flawed and numerically incorrect.

This results in an incorrect combined total: LLM reports $51,061.6 million (~$51.06 billion), whereas the correct total is $46.254 billion. The Home Depot (HD) value is correct at $26.154 billion. The comparison that HD's Net P&E is larger is accurate, but the magnitude of difference is wrong—LLM implies a difference of ~$1.25 billion, while the actual difference is $6.054 billion. (2) Number verification: HD's $26,154 million = $26.154 billion ✅; MCD's reported $24,907.6 million ≠ $20.1 billion ❌; combined total $51,061.6 million ≠ $46.254 billion ❌; difference calculation incorrect as a result. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to extract Net P&E for both companies and compute a sum and comparison, showing sound reasoning structure. However, due to the incorrect MCD figure, the synthesis fails on accuracy. It also references specific document pages, suggesting correct source identification. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to one correct number (HD), one major error (MCD), and downstream errors in total and comparison. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to incorrect core figures and calculations. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) because the logic and entity identification are correct, but key data is wrong.

The answer accurately reflects the different line items in the financial statements and the conceptual difference in approach—direct recognition vs. offset via hedging. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly mention that PayPal's strategy reduces but does not fully eliminate earnings volatility, which is included in the original answer and adds nuance to the effectiveness of the hedging. However, this omission does not undermine the essential correctness of the response. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect as no specific numbers are involved), entity identification is correct (AIG, PayPal, proper financial line items), and the reasoning correctly synthesizes the multi-hop concept of differing accounting treatments and their financial statement impacts.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key numbers. The combined provision for income taxes is stated as $3,250 million, but the ground truth is $3,433 million. This discrepancy arises because MMM's tax provision is incorrectly reported as $621 million instead of $804 million. While CAT's tax provision ($2,629 million) and both companies' profits before taxes ($13,373M for CAT, $4,819M for MMM) are correct, the incorrect tax figure for MMM undermines the overall accuracy. (2) Calculations: The total tax provision should be $2,629M + $804M = $3,433M, but LLM computes $2,629M + $621M = $3,250M — incorrect due to wrong input. The total profit before taxes is correctly calculated as $18,192M in the ground truth, and LLM uses the same correct components but does not explicitly state the sum. The effective tax rates mentioned (19.7% for CAT, 13% for MMM) are not requested in the question and are potentially misleading; more importantly, the overall combined effective tax rate should be 18.9% ($3,433M / $18,192M), but LLM does not compute this correctly due to wrong numerator. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies the correct companies (CAT and MMM), correct year (2024), and correct metric (provision for income taxes and profit before taxes), showing proper entity and metric alignment. However, it fails in synthesizing the correct value for MMM’s tax provision, breaking the multi-hop logic. (4) Justification: The correctness_score is 4 due to major quantitative errors affecting the core answer, though some components are accurate. Quantitative_accuracy is 4 because key dollar amounts and derived rates are wrong. Qualitative_accuracy is 5 — reasoning structure is sound and entities are correct, but flawed data leads to incorrect synthesis.

However, the LLM incorrectly adds 'million' after both figures (e.g., '$61,594,305 million'), which is a significant quantitative error since it inflates the values by a factor of one million. This appears to be a unit labeling mistake rather than a data error, as the correct numbers are otherwise present. (2) The calculation of 34,075,856 / 61,594,305 ≈ 55.3% is correct. (3) On the Adobe revenue recognition part, the LLM states that consulting revenue is recognized 'ratably over the contract term', while the ground truth specifies 'on a time-and-materials basis or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts'. 'Ratably' is a simplification but not entirely accurate—especially for fixed-fee contracts where performance-based milestones may govern recognition. However, ratable recognition can be consistent with time-and-materials, so this is a moderate deviation in specificity rather than a factual error. Product revenue recognition is correctly described as recognized at a point in time when software is made available. (4) The answer addresses both parts of the multi-hop question (Accenture revenue split and Adobe's revenue recognition differences), showing proper synthesis across entities.

The correct calculation is |15.3% - (-8.2%)| = 23.5 percentage points. The LLM uses -7.8% for GD's tax rate, which is incorrect—GD's rate is 15.3% (positive), not negative. (2) The numbers are therefore inaccurate: GD's 2020 effective tax rate is 15.3% (from ground truth), not -7.8% or 8.2%. GE's rate is -8.2%, which the LLM mentions but misattributes in the calculation. The formula '8.2% - (-7.8%)' is both numerically and logically flawed. (3) The reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the LLM incorrectly states GD had a negative effective tax rate due to a tax benefit on a pre-tax loss, but the ground truth shows GD had a positive tax expense (15.3%), indicating a tax liability, not a benefit. Conversely, it mischaracterizes GE's position by implying a positive effective tax rate, when GE's -8.2% reflects a net tax benefit, not expense. The multi-hop synthesis fails—no correct comparison is made between GD's below-statutory tax expense and GE's net tax benefit. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to address the difference and interpret tax positions, but the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine the response.

This leads to an incorrect difference of 14.6 percentage points instead of the correct 13.6 percentage points. The qualitative interpretation about XOM having a less leveraged capital structure is accurate and aligns with the ground truth.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the incorrect COP percentage and miscalculated difference. While 13.4% for XOM is correct, 28% vs. 27% for COP is a factual error, and 14.6 vs. 13.6 is a calculation error (28 - 13.4 = 14.6; correct calculation should be 27 - 13.4 = 13.6).

      "original_answer": "ABT reported an other comprehensive loss before reclassifications in foreign currency translation adjustments of $1,117 million in 2024, worsening its cumulative balance to $7,505 million. In contrast, LLY experienced a foreign currency translation loss of $580.2 million in 2024 but still improved its cumulative balance to $2,389.6 million due to prior-year positions.

It states that ABT had a foreign currency translation adjustment of $78.9 million and LLY $55.2 million in 2024, which directly contradicts the ground truth: ABT actually reported a loss of $1,117 million and LLY a loss of $580.2 million. These numbers are not only wrong but misrepresented as gains rather than losses. (2) The calculations and comparisons are therefore invalid. The claim that ABT had a 'larger translation gain' is false—ABT had a significant loss, worsening its cumulative balance to $7,505 million. Similarly, LLY also had a loss but improved its cumulative balance due to prior-year positions, which the LLM completely omits. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails entirely: the model does not connect the 2024 movement with the impact on cumulative balances, mischaracterizes the direction (gain vs loss), and draws an incorrect conclusion about geographic risk based on fabricated data. (4) While the answer attempts to address the question's structure—discussing both companies, their translation adjustments, and inferring geographic risk—the complete absence of correct numbers, misrepresentation of financial performance (gains vs losses), and flawed logic result in a very low correctness score.

The ground truth states a net loss of $78 million, while the LLM incorrectly reports a gain of $72 million. (2) The calculation is fundamentally wrong: the LLM subtracts $250M from $94M to get -$156M, but then incorrectly reports a 'gain of $72M', which does not follow from any valid arithmetic. The correct approach for an equally weighted portfolio is to average the two outcomes: (-$250M + $94M) / 2 = -$156M / 2 = -$78M, i.e., a $78 million loss. The LLM fails to perform this averaging and misstates the result. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the model identifies the correct companies (MET and V) and their respective investment results, it fails to synthesize them correctly by applying equal weighting. The logic gap is critical—reporting a gain when the correct answer is a loss indicates a severe error in reasoning.

According to the ground truth, DIS used a 5.86% discount rate and T used 4.90%, resulting in a difference of 0.96%. However, the LLM incorrectly states that T used a 5.70% rate for pension benefit obligations, which is not accurate. This leads to a completely wrong comparison and invalidates the core of the answer. (2) The calculation of the difference between the rates is absent in the LLM response, and the numbers cited for T (5.70% and 5.60%) do not match the ground truth (4.90%). While DIS's rate (5.86%) is correctly stated, T's rate is off by 0.80 percentage points, which is a major error. (3) The reasoning about how discount rates affect net periodic benefit costs is qualitatively sound — a lower discount rate increases interest cost and thus net periodic benefit cost — so the conceptual logic is correct. However, because it is based on incorrect data, the conclusion is misleading. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the rate difference and its impact on costs. It also correctly identifies the companies (DIS and T) and the relevant financial concept (discount rates affecting pension costs). Despite this, the severe quantitative inaccuracies — especially in the key comparison — severely undermine the correctness. The inclusion of postretirement medical plan rates, while possibly factual, is extraneous and distracts from the specific question about pension plans. Overall, partial credit is given for correct DIS rate and sound economic logic, but major deductions are made for incorrect T rate and resulting flawed analysis.",

The ground truth states that Procter & Gamble's (PG) share-based compensation expense was $545 million and Target's (TGT) was $251 million, totaling $796 million. The LLM reports $562M (PG), $211M (TGT), and a total of $773M, all of which are incorrect. Additionally, the net earnings figures used by the LLM are wrong: it cites $14.974 billion for PG (correct is $14,738 million or $14.738 billion) and $4.138 billion for TGT (correct is $2,780 million or $2.78 billion). These errors severely undermine the answer’s validity. (2) Calculations and comparisons are therefore also incorrect. The LLM claims the total compensation is 'roughly half' of PG’s net earnings — this is false (actual share-based expense is only ~3.7% of PG’s net earnings, not 50%). It also claims the total is '5.3 times' TGT’s net earnings, which is impossible since $773M cannot exceed $4.138B by more than 5x; in reality, $251M is ~9% of TGT’s $2.78B, not 530%. The correct percentages from the original answer are 4.2% (PG) and 17.9% (TGT), neither of which is reflected. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is structurally present — the model attempts to combine data across two companies and compare expenses to net earnings — but due to incorrect inputs, the synthesis fails. The logic framework is sound (sum expenses, compare to net earnings), but execution is flawed. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses the right companies, metric (share-based compensation), fiscal year (2023), and comparison to net earnings — so the intent and structure align with the question.

It states that McDonald's 2021 provision for income taxes was $699 million and Tesla's was $5.9 billion, which is the reverse of the ground truth (McDonald's: $1,410 million, Tesla: $699 million). The combined total is reported as $6.6 billion, but the correct combined total is $2,110 million ($2.11 billion). The difference is stated as $5.2 billion in favor of McDonald's, but in reality, McDonald's provision was only $711 million higher than Tesla's. (2) All numerical values are incorrect: the individual provisions, the sum ($6.6B vs $2.11B), and the difference ($5.2B vs $711M) are wildly off. Even allowing for format variations (e.g., billion vs million), the magnitudes are wrong—Tesla’s actual tax provision was $699 million, not $5.9 billion, and McDonald’s was $1,410 million, not $699 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly identify or retrieve the tax provisions for either company, failed to compute the correct sum, and made an erroneous comparison. There is no evidence of correct synthesis across entities.

The ground truth states the combined growth is $21.593 billion, but the LLM reports $13,076 million ($13.076 billion), which is off by over $8.5 billion. This is a major quantitative error. (2) The LLM incorrectly interprets the task as summing total revenues rather than calculating the absolute dollar increase (growth) for each company individually and then summing those increases. It cites Microsoft's Cloud Services revenue as $19,774 million and Oracle's as $39,383 million, but these appear to be total revenues, not growth figures. The correct approach requires finding year-over-year increases for each company's Cloud Services Revenue in their respective fiscal year 2024 and adding those two deltas. The LLM instead sums absolute revenue values and claims the total is the 'growth', which is logically and mathematically incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not extract the actual growth (difference between FY2024 and FY2023) for Microsoft and Oracle separately, nor does it correctly identify what constitutes 'Cloud Services Revenue' growth. It conflates total revenue with revenue growth. (4) Despite the fundamental error, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, the right metric (cloud revenue), and attempts a calculation. However, the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine correctness. Minor note: $13,076 million is correctly formatted as $13.076 billion, but this does not align with the ground truth $21.593 billion.

      "original_answer": "Disney recorded content impairments in 2024 due to strategic changes in content curation, which directly reduced asset values on their balance sheet. In contrast, Netflix follows an amortization policy where content assets are systematically expensed over time, with over 90% of licensed or produced content expected to be amortized within four years. These differing treatments reflect contrasting financial strategies: Disney's impairments signal immediate write-downs based on content performance and strategic shifts, while Netflix spreads content costs over time through amortization, aligning with its subscription-based model where content is monetized as a group rather than at the individual title level.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney’s 2024 10‑K shows a $3.5 billion impairment charge for content (page 35) and a $1.8 billion “content obligations” liability that is not yet reflected on the balance sheet (page 27), while Netflix’s 2024 filing (page 28) explains that it amortizes licensed and produced content over the shorter of the title’s availability window or ten years, using an accelerated schedule that typically writes off >90 % of a title within four years.

(2) Quantitatively, the $3.5 billion impairment and >90% amortization within four years are correctly reported. The mention of a 10-year ceiling and accelerated schedule matches Netflix’s policy. The 'content obligations' figure, while real, is not an impairment and was not in the original answer, so its inclusion adds extraneous detail without error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Disney’s impairment-based write-downs with Netflix’s systematic amortization, capturing the strategic difference in financial treatment. It links Disney’s impairments to performance/strategy and Netflix’s approach to its subscription model, though this last point is implied rather than explicitly stated. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addressing the contrasting financial treatments.

The combined 'Services and other' revenue is reported as $13,474 million, which is $3 million short of the ground truth $13,477 million—this small discrepancy likely stems from rounding or data source variation. More significantly, GM's total revenue is cited as $157,667 million, which is incorrect; the ground truth is $171,842 million. This leads to an incorrect percentage contribution (3.3% vs. correct 3.0%). Tesla's numbers ($8,319 million and 8.6%) are accurate. (2) Calculations: Tesla's percentage (8,319 ÷ 96,773 ≈ 8.6%) is correct. GM's calculation uses wrong total revenue: 5,155 ÷ 157,667 ≈ 3.27% ≈ 3.3%, but should be 5,157 ÷ 171,842 ≈ 3.0%. The sum $5,155M + $8,319M = $13,474M is arithmetically correct but slightly off from the true sum of $13,477M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, the relevant revenue category, and performs cross-company aggregation and percentage comparisons.

The calculated difference is therefore completely wrong—the correct difference is $1,156,055,000, but the LLM says the difference is $1,380 million while asserting the losses are equal, which is logically and mathematically incoherent. (2) The Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment for Netflix is reported as $62 million, but the correct value is $103,922,000.

It incorrectly compares LMT's 2021 value ($1,796M) to RTX's 2020 value ($1,106M), which is not relevant to the question. The correct comparison requires summing both companies' FAS/CAS adjustments over 2021 and 2020. The LMT values should be $1,960M (2020) and $1,876M (2021), summing to $3,836M; RTX should be $1,796M (2021) and $1,106M (2020), summing to $2,902M. The correct difference is $934M. The LLM uses incorrect values (e.g., $1,796M for LMT in 2021, which is actually RTX’s 2021 value), indicating entity and year confusion. (2) The calculation $1,796 − $1,106 = $690M is arithmetically correct but based on wrong data and wrong years. The actual cumulative difference is $3,836M − $2,902M = $934M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not sum across two years for both companies, nor did it correctly attribute values to the right company. It compared unrelated single-year figures across companies and years, breaking the logical chain. (4) Scores reflect major factual and reasoning errors: low quantitative accuracy due to wrong numbers and partial calculation; poor qualitative accuracy due to flawed logic and entity confusion; moderate contextual relevance because it discusses the right topic (FAS/CAS adjustments) but with incorrect synthesis.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect in terms of factual content. It reports that KO paid $1,139 million in confirmed invoices and MO paid $128 million, whereas the ground truth states KO paid $5,196 million and MO paid $554 million. These figures are significantly off, leading to an incorrect combined total of $1,267 million instead of the correct $5,750 million. Additionally, the LLM claims KO's beginning-year confirmed obligations were $119 million, which contradicts the ground truth of $1,421 million; MO's obligations are correctly stated as $119 million. The combined obligations are thus misrepresented as $238 million instead of $1,540 million. The net increase is calculated as $1,028 million instead of the correct $4,210 million. (2) All key numbers are wrong: payments by KO (-78% error), payments by MO (+23% error), combined payments (-78% error), KO's obligations (-92% error), combined obligations (-85% error), and final comparison (-76% error). Calculations based on these numbers are therefore invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally present—LLM attempts to sum payments, sum obligations, and compute the difference—but it fails due to incorrect input data. There is no evidence the model correctly synthesized information from the correct entities or time periods.

This positively impacted KO's cash flows from operating activities by $24 million. Conversely, WMT experienced an increase in accrued income taxes by $435 million in 2024 compared to a decrease of $468 million in the prior year, suggesting a shift toward higher tax accruals, which negatively impacted its cash flows by $435 million in 2024.

The signs and magnitudes are both incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify the change in tax accrual strategy—KO fully settled its liability (going to $0), while WMT sharply increased accruals after a prior-year decrease.

In contrast, McDonald's reported a 1% increase in consolidated operating income to $11.7 billion, but faced geographic challenges with global comparable sales declining 0.1%, including negative results in France and China that required offsetting gains elsewhere.

In contrast, McDonald’s geographic performance faced challenges—its International Operated Markets and Developmental Licensed Markets segments posted modest comparable‑sales declines, and overall consolidated operating income grew only 1% despite a 2% revenue increase—highlighting slower sales growth and weaker margin expansion outside the U.S. compared with Amazon’s broader, multi‑segment revenue uplift.",

Crucially, it omits the International segment's turnaround from a -$2.656 billion loss to +$3.792 billion profit, misrepresenting the $6.448 billion swing as just a positive result. The LLM also fails to quantify McDonald's operating income ($11.7 billion) or the 0.1% global comp sales decline, instead vaguely referencing 'modest declines'. (2) Calculations: The LLM does not verify or present the $31.741 billion total growth as the sum of segment changes, missing a core multi-hop requirement. It incorrectly implies AWS 'added' $39.834 billion rather than grew by $15.203 billion.

The difference in holders of record is incorrectly calculated as 90,400 (106,000 - 9,300 = 96,700 per ground truth), and the LLM incorrectly states '99,700 – 9,300 = 90,400', introducing a fictitious number (99,700) not present in the original data. HD reported 106,000 holders, not 99,700. (2) The calculation is therefore quantitatively inaccurate: correct inputs would be 106,000 - 9,300 = 96,700, but LLM uses wrong values and arithmetic. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound — the LLM correctly identifies that both companies mention street-name holders and describes their nature accurately (held via banks, brokers, etc.), showing correct synthesis of the conceptual point about beneficial ownership. However, it fails the multi-hop quantitative synthesis by misrepresenting HD's holder count. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question — the numerical difference and the explanation about street-name holders — so relevance is high.

It reports a combined 2023 RSU vesting value of $26.6 billion, which is only Alphabet's value and omits Meta's $17.46 billion entirely. The correct combined 2023 value is $44.06 billion ($26.6B + $17.46B). The LLM also incorrectly states that the prior year value was $23.9 billion (only Alphabet's 2022 value) and claims a $2.7 billion increase, whereas the correct 2022 combined value is $33.34 billion ($23.9B + $9.44B), making the correct year-over-year increase $10.72 billion. (2) All key numbers are wrong: the LLM fails to sum across companies, uses only Alphabet's data, and performs incorrect comparisons. The calculation of a $2.7 billion increase is based on $26.6B - $23.9B, which is not only numerically incorrect but conceptually flawed as it compares two different companies' values across years without combining them. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model was required to aggregate RSU vesting values for two companies in two years and compute the difference in totals, but instead it appears to have only considered Alphabet (GOOGL) data and ignored Meta (META) entirely. (4) Due to major factual errors, omissions, and incorrect calculations, the correctness score is low at 3.

      "original_answer": "The U.S. Government's preference for progress payments impacts both Lockheed Martin's cash flow timing and Raytheon Technologies' contract asset position. Lockheed Martin notes that the DoD increased progress payment rates from 80% to 90% in March 2020, which improves cash inflows as costs are incurred. In contrast, Raytheon explains that progress payments under U.S. government fixed-price contracts typically result in revenue recognized in excess of billings, creating contract assets on the balance sheet because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion. Therefore, while Lockheed benefits from higher and faster cash inflows due to the increased progress payment rate, Raytheon accumulates contract assets due to delayed billing and payment timing, reflecting a cause-and-effect relationship through the shared mechanism of progress payments.",
      "llm_answer": "The U.S. Government’s preference for progress payments (up to 80‑90 % of costs incurred) over performance‑based payments means Lockheed Martin’s fixed‑price contracts typically generate revenue recognized in excess of billings, creating a contract‑asset balance on its balance sheet.  In contrast, Raytheon Technologies’ contracts are often structured with performance‑based payments, resulting in a contract‑liability position when payments precede revenue recognition.  Consequently, the higher progress‑payment rate for LMT improves its cash‑flow timing, while RTX’s reliance on performance‑based terms leaves it more exposed to later cash receipts and a larger contract‑asset exposure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It incorrectly states that Lockheed Martin's fixed-price contracts generate 'revenue recognized in excess of billings,' leading to contract assets—this contradicts the ground truth, which states that higher progress payments (increased to 90% in March 2020) improve LMT's cash inflows, not create contract assets. Conversely, it wrongly claims Raytheon uses performance-based payments and has contract liabilities, when the original answer clearly states RTX accumulates contract assets due to progress payments under fixed-price contracts where billings lag revenue. (2) Quantitatively, the mention of '80–90%' progress payments is partially correct (the 90% rate for LMT started in March 2020), but the LLM misattributes this benefit and fails to specify the March 2020 timing, weakening accuracy. No calculations are made, so scoring is based on correct reporting of percentages and dates—only partially met. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model reverses the roles of LMT and RTX. It fails to correctly synthesize that both companies are affected by progress payments, but with different financial statement impacts—LMT sees better cash flow, RTX sees contract assets—due to their respective contract structures and billing timing. Instead, it incorrectly assigns performance-based payments to RTX and mischaracterizes LMT’s accounting outcome. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses cash flow timing and balance sheet positions, but the reversal of facts and misattribution of contract types severely undermines correctness. The conclusion about LMT’s improved cash flow is correct in isolation but tied to wrong reasoning, while RTX’s exposure is misrepresented.

In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) applies the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets using a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period, which is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense. This means that while Boeing experiences a direct and immediate financial impact from changes in asset return assumptions, Union Pacific smooths the impact over time, thereby managing the volatility of pension expense in its financial statements.",
      "llm_answer": "A 25‑basis‑point shift in the expected long‑term asset‑return assumption would change Boeing’s net periodic pension cost by roughly $155 million, whereas Union Pacific’s approach treats such volatility as largely immaterial to expense because it smooths the impact over time.

The year 2021 is implied in the context of the data, though not explicitly mentioned in the LLM answer, which is a minor omission but does not detract significantly from correctness. (3) The reasoning correctly captures the multi-hop comparison: Boeing experiences a direct, immediate impact, while Union Pacific smooths the effect over time to reduce volatility. The LLM accurately conveys that UNP uses a method (5-year recognition of fair value changes) that mitigates immediate expense fluctuations, even if the exact phrase 'calculated value' or '5-year period' is omitted. The core logic of volatility smoothing is preserved. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth—while slightly less detailed than the original (e.g., not specifying the 5-year period), it correctly communicates the key contrast in pension accounting approaches and the material difference in sensitivity to return assumptions.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies and misrepresents the financial reporting treatments of both companies as disclosed in their 2023 10-K filings. (1) For Bristol-Myers Squibb, the LLM correctly notes that upfront payments received (e.g., from Pfizer) are deferred and amortized, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states that BMS expenses upfront payments it makes to partners as Acquired IPRD—this is not supported by the ground truth, which does not discuss BMS making upfront payments or their accounting treatment. (2) For Gilead Sciences, the LLM makes a critical error: it claims Gilead capitalized and amortized upfront payments *received* from collaborators (e.g., from Galapagos), but the ground truth states that Gilead *made* upfront payments (to Arcellx and Dragonfly) and expensed them as Acquired IPRD. The LLM reverses the direction of the cash flow and misattributes the accounting treatment. The ground truth does not mention Gilead receiving any upfront payments in this context. (3) Quantitatively, the LLM omits the specific dollar amounts disclosed in the original answer ($313 million to Arcellx and $300 million to Dragonfly), which are key factual anchors. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the LLM incorrectly synthesizes the direction of payments and their accounting treatment for Gilead, leading to a false comparison. The conclusion that 'BMS expenses payments it makes while Gilead capitalizes payments it receives' is factually backward and unsupported. (5) While the terminology (e.g., deferred income, Acquired IPRD) is used appropriately, the entities and transaction directions are mismatched, undermining the qualitative and quantitative accuracy.

However, the percentage decrease for Bristol-Myers Squibb is incorrect. The LLM states a 57% decrease from $166 million in 2022 to $212 million in 2023, which is logically and mathematically flawed—revenue increasing from $166M to $212M would represent an increase, not a decrease. The ground truth states that Bristol-Myers Squibb reported $55 million in 2023, down from $100 million in 2022, which is a 45% decrease. (2) The LLM's calculation is invalid: a drop from $100M to $55M is a 45% decrease, but the model incorrectly uses $166M and $212M and still labels it a decline. These numbers do not align with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model confuses the direction of revenue flow and uses incorrect source data for Bristol-Myers Squibb. It appears to conflate Merck's revenue with BMS's, leading to erroneous comparison.

(1) It correctly identifies that General Motors uses EBIT-adjusted (numerator) over adjusted average net assets (denominator), including automotive-specific liabilities such as debt, pension, OPEB, and tax assets. Home Depot's ROIC is correctly described as NOPAT (based on operating income adjusted for taxes using the effective tax rate) divided by average debt and equity, with the denominator defined as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer that require verification (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages), so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in both numerator and denominator across two companies, correctly contrasting GM's segment-specific, adjusted asset base with HD's broader capital base. It adds value by noting that GM excludes interest income/expense and includes non-core items like restructuring, which is consistent with GM's adjusted approach, though this detail is not in the ground truth—this is a reasonable inference and does not detract from accuracy. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses the question about differences in numerator, denominator, and specific components. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly expands on GM's adjustments (e.g., mentioning restructuring and litigation) not explicitly in the original answer, but these are plausible and do not contradict the ground truth.

The ground truth states the combined cost of revenue is $68,217 million, but the LLM calculates $76,468 million, which is off by over $8 billion. The LLM reports Adobe's cost of revenue as $2,354 million, but this is incorrect — the correct figure from the knowledge graph is not reflected. Additionally, the LLM cites Adobe's Digital Media cost of revenue as $665 million and segment revenue as $14,216 million, which are not consistent with the ground truth data used to generate the original answer. While the percentage (4.68%) is close to the correct 4.7%, it is based on incorrect inputs. Microsoft's Product cost of revenue ($15,272 million) and segment revenue ($64,773 million) appear accurate, and the 23.5% matches the ground truth. (2) Calculations: The sum of $2,354M + $74,114M = $76,468M is mathematically correct, but the inputs are wrong. Adobe’s cost of revenue is significantly overstated. The percentage calculations are approximately correct (4.68% ≈ 4.7%), but again based on flawed data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across two companies and compute proportions, which shows correct structural reasoning. However, the synthesis fails due to reliance on incorrect source data, undermining the conclusion. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4/10) due to major numerical errors in core financial figures despite partial correctness in Microsoft's data and percentages.

The LLM conflates stored-value cards with protection plans, which are unrelated to gift cards. The deferred revenue amounts cited for Lowe's ($1,225M and $1,201M) are for protection plans, not stored-value cards, and thus do not address the question. For Starbucks, the LLM correctly identifies the $1.6 billion current deferred revenue from stored-value cards and loyalty programs (aligning with the ground truth $1.6B liability as of September 29, 2024), but incorrectly introduces the $5.8 billion long-term deferred revenue from the Nestlé arrangement, which is unrelated to stored-value cards. The ground truth emphasizes foreign currency translation effects on Starbucks' liability, which the LLM omits. (2) Quantitatively, the Starbucks $1.6 billion figure is correct, and the date (Sep 29, 2024) matches, but the Lowe's numbers, while accurate in isolation, refer to the wrong financial item (protection plans vs. gift cards). The $1.5 billion liability for Starbucks as of October 1, 2023, is missing entirely. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the LLM does not contrast Lowe's redemption-based recognition with Starbucks' liability reporting that includes foreign currency adjustments.

(2) Calculations are incorrect: even if the component numbers were assumed accurate (they are not), the LLM does not break down the sum for BA, and the total $2,588 million does not match the sum of any plausible combination of the correct figures. The LMT figure is entirely wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the question requires synthesizing BA’s losses across two programs and comparing them to LMT’s single program. The LLM performs this structure but with fabricated or erroneous data, undermining the logic. It incorrectly concludes LMT had higher losses when in fact BA’s were much larger—opposite to the truth. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies, programs, metric (reach-forward loss), and year. However, due to severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, the answer is misleading. Correctness and quantitative accuracy are very low; qualitative accuracy is poor due to incorrect synthesis; relevance is acceptable but not sufficient to compensate for factual errors.",

The combined total of remaining performance obligations is stated as $275 billion, but the ground truth is $295.5 billion ($20.5B for Broadcom + $275B for Microsoft). The LLM incorrectly omits Broadcom's $20.5B entirely and uses only Microsoft's figure. Additionally, the LLM states that approximately 45% of the combined total will be recognized in the next 12 months, but this percentage applies only to Microsoft; Broadcom expects 43%, and the weighted average would not be exactly 45% given the large disparity in obligation sizes. (2) Calculations: The correct combined total is $295.5B. The amount to be recognized in the next 12 months should be: Broadcom: 43% of $20.5B = $8.815B; Microsoft: 45% of $275B = $123.75B; Total = $132.565B. The LLM provides no such breakdown and gives an oversimplified and inaccurate summary. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The question requires synthesizing data from two companies (AVGO and MSFT), computing a sum, and reporting individual percentages and their implications. The LLM fails this synthesis by ignoring Broadcom’s data entirely, indicating a failure in multi-hop reasoning. (4) The answer is contextually relevant in that it discusses performance obligations and near-term revenue recognition for the correct companies, but it lacks completeness and accuracy. Due to major factual and computational errors, the correctness score is low at 2, with similarly low quantitative accuracy. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the general concept (recognizing revenue in next 12 months) is addressed, albeit incorrectly.

However, this does not directly translate to a percentage of sales comparison, as Emerson's warranty expense is reported as a line item in its financials, while General Dynamics' figure represents a balance sheet liability. The document does not provide sales figures for either company to calculate a percentage of sales for warranty expenses. Thus, while General Dynamics has a larger absolute warranty liability, the document does not provide sufficient data to determine the relative financial significance of warranty obligations as a percentage of sales for either company.

This is a critical error in entity identification. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM misattributes $46 million in cash received to UPS when the ground truth states UPS received $3 million and UNP received $46 million. It also incorrectly reports intrinsic value as $35 million for UPS alone, when the ground truth assigns $35 million to UNP and $2 million to UPS.

The question states that UPS experienced a decrease of $672 million in adjusted operating profit but does not provide the prior-year value or the 2023 value. The LLM incorrectly assumes UPS's 2023 adjusted operating profit is $1,188 million, which is not supported by the given information. This figure appears to be fabricated or pulled from an external source not provided in the context. As a result, the calculated difference of $12,558 million is incorrect. The ground truth states the correct difference is $13,074 million, implying UPS’s adjusted operating profit should have been $672 million less than some base, but without a starting point, the only valid interpretation is that the decrease itself ($672M) must be used to adjust from CAT's value if UPS had negative or zero profit — but that is not stated. However, the ground truth suggests the correct difference is $13,074M, meaning UPS’s profit was $672M less than CAT’s, i.e., $13,746M - $672M = $13,074M difference. The LLM misinterpreted the decrease as relative to an unspecified prior year and then introduced an unsupported current-year value. (2) Quantitative accuracy fails because $1,188 million for UPS is unverified and leads to an incorrect subtraction. The correct calculation per ground truth logic should be $13,746M (CAT) minus (X), where X = CAT’s profit minus the stated difference, or inferred as CAT’s profit minus the decrease amount if UPS’s profit decreased by $672M from CAT’s level — but this is ambiguous. However, since the ground truth is $13,074M difference, it implies UPS = $672M, so difference = $13,746 - $672 = $13,074. The LLM instead uses $1,188M for UPS, which is not derivable from the prompt. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model assumes it can compute UPS’s profit from a decrease without a baseline, then uses that to compute the difference — but the decrease is not tied to a known prior value. It should have recognized that the 'difference' requested may directly involve the $672M decrease if interpreted as the gap between CAT and UPS. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the structure and relevance are strong — it attempts the right comparison and cites the correct CAT value.

It states that CVS issued $14 million in fair value of replacement equity awards, whereas the ground truth is $118 million. This is a major quantitative discrepancy. Amgen's figure of $180 million is correct. The resulting combined total in the LLM answer is $194 million, which is incorrect; the correct combined value is $298 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: while Amgen’s $180 million is accurate, CVS’s value is off by $104 million, and the sum is therefore also incorrect. The calculation logic (adding two numbers) is correct, but the input values are flawed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM attempts to extract values from both companies and sum them—but fails due to incorrect data extraction from the CVS filing. This suggests a failure in information retrieval or misreading of the source document. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the model correctly identifies the relevant companies, transaction types, and metric (fair value of replacement equity awards), and attempts proper synthesis.

According to the ground truth, GM reported $8,008 million and McDonald's $179.5 million in pension liabilities as of December 31, 2021. However, the LLM incorrectly states GM's liability as $9,269 million and McDonald's as $2,573.7 million—both figures are substantially off. The difference is therefore also incorrect: the correct difference is $7,828.5 million, but the LLM does not compute or report this value at all. (2) The numbers are not accurate in any format variation—$9,269M vs $8,008M and $2,573.7M vs $179.5M are not close and cannot be attributed to rounding or formatting differences. The LLM also mislabels these as 'accumulated other comprehensive loss,' which may reflect a misunderstanding of the financial statement item—pension liabilities are balance sheet obligations, not just AOCI components. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies that GM had a larger pension deficit, which shows basic directional reasoning, it fails in multi-hop synthesis: it uses incorrect data from both companies, suggesting a failure to retrieve or interpret the correct values from the respective 10-K filings.

      "original_answer": "MetLife records changes in the estimated fair value of embedded derivatives directly in net derivative gains (losses), which can significantly affect net income due to fluctuations in credit spreads, interest rates, and market volatility.

(1) Quantitatively, the $57 million figure for PayPal's expected reclassification of net derivative losses within the next 12 months is correctly stated, matching the original answer. No other numerical values are in dispute. (2) The treatment of MetLife's derivatives—immediate recognition of fair value changes in net income driven by Level 3 inputs like credit spreads and interest rates—is accurately described and consistent with the ground truth. (3) The qualitative distinction between MetLife’s immediate earnings impact and PayPal’s delayed recognition via AOCI reclassification is correctly captured, even though the term 'AOCI' is not explicitly mentioned; instead, the concept is conveyed through 'reclassification into earnings over the next 12 months', which implies prior recording in other comprehensive income. This constitutes a minor omission but does not distort the meaning. (4) The reasoning correctly synthesizes the multi-hop comparison: MetLife has direct, volatile impacts on earnings, while PayPal’s impact is delayed and more predictable. The LLM emphasizes the forward-looking nature of PayPal’s $57M loss reclassification, correctly contrasting it with MetLife’s ongoing mark-to-market volatility. (5) All entities (MetLife, PayPal), financial treatments, and timeframes (next 12 months) are accurate. The only slight shortfall is the lack of explicit mention of AOCI, which slightly reduces qualitative precision, but the semantic meaning remains intact.

However, the LLM incorrectly states ABBV spent $2,207 million and ABT spent $2,202 million, summing to $4,409 million—both values are wrong. Additionally, the operating cash flows are swapped: the LLM assigns $8,558 million to ABBV and $7,261 million to ABT, but the ground truth shows ABBV had $18,806 million and ABT had $8,558 million. These errors invalidate the percentages calculated: the LLM claims ~51% and ~60%, while correct figures are 5.2% for ABBV and 25.7% for ABT. (2) All key numbers—outflows, operating cash flows, totals, and derived percentages—are incorrect. The sum $2,207 + $2,202 = $4,409 is mathematically correct, but based on false inputs.

Similarly, Honeywell's Total Segment Profit is reported as $8,699 million, whereas the correct figure is $8,598 million. These inaccuracies severely undermine the answer's validity. (2) The calculation and comparison are also incorrect: the LLM claims GE's combined profit is roughly twice Honeywell's, when in fact Honeywell's profit was higher by $482 million. The correct comparison shows Honeywell outperforming GE, not the reverse. (3) While the LLM attempts multi-hop reasoning by comparing two companies across different years and segments, the synthesis fails due to reliance on incorrect data. The entities (GE segments, Honeywell, Total Segment Profit, correct years) are correctly identified, showing some qualitative understanding.

However, it incorrectly reports Texas Instruments' (TXN) OCI as $30 million, whereas the ground truth states $203 million. This is a significant factual error. The final combined total is calculated as $51 million, but the correct total should be $224 million ($21M + $203M), making the final result inaccurate. (2) Number verification: Adobe's $21M is correct (page 59 of Adobe 10-K). However, TXN's OCI is misread — on page 31 of TXN’s 10-K, the $30 million figure cited refers to 'Other Comprehensive Income, net of tax' for 2020, not 2021. For 2021, TXN reported $203 million in OCI, net of taxes, which the model failed to extract correctly. The calculation logic (summing the two values) is sound, but based on incorrect input. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that it must retrieve OCI data for two different companies (Adobe and TXN) for the same year (2021) and combine them. However, it fails in accurately retrieving the TXN 2021 figure, breaking the synthesis chain. This indicates a failure in document comprehension or data extraction from the provided filing. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major quantitative error in TXN’s OCI value. Quantitative accuracy is 3 due to one correct and one severely incorrect number. Qualitative accuracy is 4 because reasoning structure is sound but based on flawed data.

Ground truth shows INTC had a negative provision of -$913M and ORCL had $623M, totaling $1,536M. The LLM fails to report INTC's negative tax provision, a critical error. (2) The calculation of the 2024 sum is correct ($8,023M + $1,274M = $9,297M), but the comparison to the prior year is flawed due to incorrect input values. The actual year-over-year increase is $7,761M ($9,297M - $1,536M), which the LLM does not mention or compute. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly aggregating 2024 data across two companies—but fails in cross-year synthesis, especially with negative financial values. Misidentifying INTC’s 2023 provision as $623M instead of -$913M indicates a failure in accurate data retrieval or synthesis.

The difference in total debt principal (implied as $12,204 million) is accurate, though not explicitly stated in the LLM answer. This omission prevents a perfect score, but since the component values are correct and the comparison is valid, the core quantitative analysis is sound.

The reasoning correctly synthesizes multi-hop data across two companies and time horizons, concluding that UPS has a significantly higher portion due after 2029—consistent with the ground truth. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit calculation of the difference ($21,030M - $8,826M = $12,204M), which was asked in the question.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement or on an interim basis when triggering events occur. This results in direct and immediate impacts to earnings based on changes in pension and postretirement benefit valuations. In contrast, Lockheed Martin reports changes in actuarial gains or losses as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which are not immediately recognized in earnings but instead amortized over time. This difference in recognition timing and location within financial statements leads to distinct patterns of financial impact: Caterpillar experiences more volatile earnings due to full-year actuarial changes hitting the income statement immediately, while Lockheed Martin's earnings are affected gradually through amortization expense. The two companies therefore reflect actuarial gains or losses through different financial statement line items and at different times, affecting their reported earnings stability.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in earnings through a mark‑to‑market approach at each annual remeasurement, whereas Lockheed Martin defers such gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortizes them over the average remaining life expectancy or service period of participants.

      "original_answer": "The pause in Boeing's 787 deliveries, which began in May 2021 and continued due to production quality issues and FAA regulatory delays, directly affected Raytheon Technologies' commercial aerospace OEM sales. Raytheon reported a $0.8 billion decline in commercial aerospace OEM sales in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to widebody volume declines driven by the drop in 787 deliveries.

The ground truth states that the $0.8 billion OEM sales decline contributed to an overall *organic sales decrease of $0.6 billion* for Raytheon as a whole, not just the segment, and does not mention operating profit. Thus, the LLM confuses segment-level and company-level impacts and adds unverified profit figures. (2) The $0.8 billion sales decline is accurate and correctly attributed to widebody/787 volume. However, the $0.5 billion operating profit and $0.6 billion segment net sales reduction are not supported by the original answer—these numbers are either misplaced or incorrectly allocated. The original specifies the $0.6 billion organic sales decline at the company level, not segment net sales.

This indicates that interest capitalization plays a meaningful role in their asset valuation and depreciation planning. In contrast, TXN reports that capitalized interest was 'not material' in their 2022 financial statements, suggesting that interest capitalization has a negligible impact on their capital asset reporting and overall financial strategy. This contrast reveals that INTC likely engages in larger-scale or more interest-intensive capital projects compared to TXN, where such capitalization does not significantly affect financial reporting.",

This contrast reveals that Intel’s large-scale, multi-year factory investments (e.g., Lehi, Utah) involve significant interest capitalization to fund long‑term production capacity, whereas Texas Instruments relies on a more mature, asset‑light capital‑expenditure model where interest costs are expensed as incurred, underscoring the differing scale and strategic focus of their respective capital‑intensive initiatives.",

These points match the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values requiring calculation in this question, but the qualitative financial reporting statements (e.g., 'not material') are correctly cited and contextually interpreted—this satisfies quantitative accuracy.

This goes slightly beyond the original answer by adding contextual detail (Lehi facility), which is accurate and enhances insight. (4) Semantic equivalence is achieved: while the LLM adds minor strategic interpretation (e.g., 'asset-light model'), it remains factually grounded and does not overstate.

This indicates a major error in either data retrieval or calculation. (2) The individual figures provided by the LLM—Intel: $7,972 million and Texas Instruments: $5,582 million—are inconsistent with the ground truth implied difference of $12,770 million. Even if we assume one value is correct, the other must be significantly off. For example, if Intel were $7,972M, TI would need to be -$4,798M to yield a $12,770M difference, which is not plausible. Thus, both numbers are likely wrong. The calculation itself (difference of $7,972M - $5,582M = $2,390M) is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing two companies' 2021 Total Comprehensive Income from their 2022 10-K filings—is conceptually sound, and the structure of the response shows an attempt at proper synthesis.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect. (1) Quantitatively, it states a total settlement amount of $700 million, whereas the ground truth is $5.283 billion—over 7.5 times higher. It claims Visa contributed $467 million, but the correct amount is $4.5 billion. The percentage attributed to Visa is 67%, but the correct figure is approximately 85.2%. These errors are severe and pervasive. (2) Calculations are fundamentally wrong: even if the numbers were misread, the sum of $700M with $467M from Visa would be ~66.7%, close to the 67% stated, but both inputs are factually incorrect. The correct total is $783M (Mastercard) + $4.5B (Visa) = $5.283B, and Visa’s share is ($4.5B / $5.283B) ≈ 85.2%, which the LLM fails to compute correctly. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is absent—the model did not synthesize Mastercard’s $783M and Visa’s $4.5B contributions across the entities and sources, likely missing or misreading key data. (4) The entities (Mastercard, Visa, U.S. interchange litigation) are relevant, but the financial figures and synthesis are so inaccurate that the answer fails on correctness and usefulness.

The individual components ($14,548M for JNJ and $3,028.8M for LLY) are also accurate and sum correctly. However, the growth rate for LLY is incorrect: the LLM states it grew by 17.6%, the same as JNJ, but the ground truth is 8.5%. This is a critical factual error affecting the comparison. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: the revenue figures and sum are accurate, but the LLY growth rate is wrong. The calculation of JNJ’s 17.6% growth is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails in the comparison step.

According to the ground truth, Caterpillar's 2022 profit was $6,493 million ($6.493 billion), which the LLM approximates as $6.489 billion—this is close but still inaccurate. However, GE's 2022 GAAP profit was actually a loss of $3,683 million (-$3.683 billion), whereas the LLM incorrectly states GE had a profit of $5.975 billion. This is a massive factual error. The resulting profit difference is therefore completely wrong: the LLM reports $514 million, but the correct difference is $10,176 million ($6,493 million - (-$3,683 million) = $10,176 million). (2) Profit margins are also incorrect: Caterpillar’s actual margin is 10.4%, not 12.7%; GE’s is -5.0%, not 11.8%. The margin difference should be 15.4 percentage points, not 0.9. All calculations and values are unsupported by the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed entirely—instead of recognizing that GE had a GAAP loss, the model assumed a large profit, indicating a failure to synthesize correct data across entities and years. It also used incorrect margin figures, suggesting flawed or fabricated inputs.

      "original_answer": "Boeing uses program accounting for the 777X aircraft program, which involves estimating the total number of units to be sold (program accounting quantity) and forecasting revenues and costs over the program's expected life. This method introduces significant complexity and uncertainty due to challenges in predicting customer demand, regulatory certification timelines, and associated cost increases. Honeywell, on the other hand, applies the cost-to-cost input method for recognizing revenue on long-term contracts, which measures progress based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs at completion. Honeywell’s cost estimates are influenced by inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, subcontractor performance, labor agreements, and business volume assumptions. Both companies face complexity in estimating costs due to external uncertainties and the long-term nature of their programs, though Boeing’s challenges are more tied to certification and demand forecasting, while Honeywell’s are rooted in contract execution and performance variability.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Boeing and Honeywell use program‑accounting approaches that require extensive estimation of future costs and revenues, but the sources of complexity differ. Boeing’s 777X estimates hinge on uncertain market demand, certification timelines, and the range of reasonable outcomes for unsold aircraft, leading to potential margin erosion or reach‑forward losses. Honeywell’s long‑term contracts (e.g., KC‑46A, Commercial Crew) rely on fixed‑price agreements where revenue is set while cost‑to‑complete estimates are highly variable, creating uncertainty around cost overruns and the timing of margin realization. In both cases, the need to forecast future performance, manage technical risks, and respond to external regulatory or market changes drives significant estimation uncertainty.",

It correctly identifies Boeing’s use of program accounting for the 777X program and highlights key factors like market demand and certification timelines, which align with the ground truth. It also accurately notes Honeywell’s reliance on cost-to-cost input method (implied through 'cost-to-complete estimates') for long-term fixed-price contracts, mentioning relevant programs (KC-46A, Commercial Crew) and the inherent risk of cost overruns. The answer correctly emphasizes that both companies face estimation challenges due to long-term forecasting, technical risks, and external factors. However, it omits explicit mention of Honeywell’s specific cost drivers such as inflationary trends, subcontractor performance, labor agreements, and business volume assumptions—details present in the original answer that contribute to completeness. While the LLM implies variability in costs, it does not name these precise contributing factors. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect as no incorrect numbers are stated), and the reasoning is sound and contextually relevant.

The proportion of goodwill to total consideration differs significantly: for BMS's Celgene transaction, goodwill was $13,990 million (representing approximately 17.4% of the total consideration of $80,269 million), while for Merck's Acceleron transaction, goodwill was $2,422 million (representing approximately 21.1% of the total consideration of $11,514 million).

      "original_answer": "Boeing's 2022 10-K filing states that it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of indemnifications and financing commitments due to uncertainty in timing and amount. This implies a higher level of financial risk exposure that cannot be quantified. In contrast, FedEx's 2022 10-K indicates that historically, it has not made significant payments under indemnification obligations, and the company has not recognized material amounts for these obligations. This suggests FedEx perceives its indemnification risks as minimal and remote. Therefore, while both companies disclose indemnifications, Boeing's inability to estimate these obligations signals greater uncertainty and potential future financial impact compared to FedEx's more stable and predictable indemnification risk profile.",

(4) The LLM captures the core contrast: Boeing faces higher uncertainty in contingent liabilities, while FedEx relies on past experience to justify minimal financial impact. The only minor shortcoming is a slight lack of explicit mention that FedEx has not recognized material amounts in its financials (a small omission in completeness), but the essence is preserved.

Conversely, it assigns 10.8% to Raytheon, which is not supported by the original answer (RTX had 7.7% in 2021). The correct difference is 4.0 percentage points (11.7% - 7.7%), but the LLM calculates a 3.1-point difference based on incorrect inputs. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: Caterpillar’s margin was 11.7% in Q4 2021 (not annual 7.7%), and RTX’s was 7.7% for full-year 2021 (not 10.8%). The calculation (10.8% - 7.7%) is arithmetically correct but based on wrong numbers, leading to an incorrect 3.1% difference instead of the true 4.0-point gap. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly attribute time periods (mixing Q4 and full-year data incorrectly), confused which company had which margin, and missed Caterpillar’s declining trend from 12.3% to 11.7% and RTX’s recovery from (3.3)% to 7.7%. These trends are central to the question but entirely misrepresented. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the structure of comparing margins and calculating a difference, but with wrong data and reversed narratives.

ABBV had a Medicare Rebates balance of $5,297 million and payments of $15,054 million in 2023, indicating a significant cash outflow relative to its liability. PFE had Medicare Rebates of $997 million in 2023, which was its incurred liability for that year with no separate payment amount specified.

It incorrectly states that ABBV's Medicare Rebates in 2023 were $997 million and PFE's were $1,655 million, which is completely inaccurate. According to the ground truth, ABBV had a balance of $5,297 million and payments of $15,054 million, while PFE had a liability of $997 million. The combined total is therefore $6,294 million (5,297 + 997), not $2,652 million as claimed. The LLM reverses the companies' values and fabricates a PFE payment amount not present in the original. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: all key numbers are wrong. The sum of $2,652 million is based on incorrect inputs, and no correct calculation can be derived from the provided figures. The ground truth does not specify any payment for PFE, only an incurred liability of $997 million, whereas the LLM invents a $1,655 million figure. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM claims ABBV has a 'smaller accrued liability relative to its payments' and suggests PFE has a 'larger accrued balance', which contradicts the truth where ABBV has a much larger balance and massive cash outflow ($15,054 million in payments), indicating high current cash obligations. The model misinterprets the direction of financial burden. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—it addresses the structure of the question (combined total, difference between balance and payments, implications for cash flow) but does so with entirely incorrect data and reversed logic.

      "original_answer": "Qualcomm faces risks related to intellectual property enforcement that could negatively impact its cash resources due to costly litigation, audits, and potential reductions in royalty revenues. These activities absorb significant financial and management resources, directly affecting its cash flows. In contrast, Cisco strategically uses its strong cash resources for shareholder returns and acquisitions, with $7.7 billion used for stock repurchases and $6.2 billion for dividends in fiscal 2022, along with $0.4 billion for acquisitions. The difference in reported cash outflows between Cisco's strategic uses and Qualcomm's risk-related cash impacts is significant, highlighting divergent financial strategies and exposures.",

In fiscal 2022 Qualcomm’s cash outflows tied to IP enforcement and related legal matters were not disclosed as a separate line item, but its overall cash outflows for stock repurchases ($7.7 billion) and dividends ($6.2 billion) were far smaller than Cisco’s combined cash outflows for those shareholder‑return activities ($13.9 billion total, $6.2 billion dividends + $7.7 billion repurchases).

The original answer clearly states that Cisco used $7.7 billion for repurchases and $6.2 billion for dividends, while Qualcomm's shareholder return figures are not provided. The LLM erroneously swaps or conflates the two companies' financial outflows, leading to a fundamentally incorrect comparison. Additionally, the claim that Qualcomm’s IP-related cash outflows were 'not disclosed' is speculative and not supported in the original answer, which does not provide specific dollar amounts for Qualcomm’s litigation costs but emphasizes the risk and resource drain qualitatively. (2) The calculation of Cisco’s total shareholder returns ($6.2B + $7.7B = $13.9B) is correct, but attributing similar outflows to Qualcomm is false. There is no evidence in the ground truth that Qualcomm made any specific cash outflows of that magnitude for buybacks or dividends in 2022. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure — the model attempts to contrast IP enforcement risks at Qualcomm with Cisco’s strategic cash use — but fails in execution due to incorrect entity-metric alignment.

This significant difference reflects NEE’s much larger capital expenditures and debt financing activity compared to DUK, as seen in NEE’s $12.1 billion in financing cash flows versus DUK’s $773 million.

(2) The LLM provides incorrect debt figures: DUK's long-term debt is cited as $11.5 billion and NEE's as $61.4 billion, but these specific numbers are not supported by the ground truth, which emphasizes financing cash flows ($12.1B for NEE vs $773M for DUK) and capital investment scale ($15.5B for NEE vs $991M for DUK). These discrepancies undermine the quantitative accuracy. (3) While the qualitative reasoning about NEE having a more leveraged financing strategy and larger capital structure is directionally correct, the LLM fails to correctly synthesize the multi-hop evidence—specifically, the link between NEE’s higher interest payments and its significantly larger financing activities and capital investments as documented in the ground truth. The reasoning is plausible but based on incorrect data.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect in terms of factual content. The combined increase is stated as $613 million, but the ground truth is $190 million. GD's increase is correctly listed in the ground truth as $180 million (from $3,019M to $3,199M), but the LLM incorrectly assigns only a $10 million increase to GD and mislabels it as 'Honeywell Aerospace'. Conversely, HON's actual $10 million increase (from $2,376M to $2,386M) is misrepresented in the LLM answer by attributing a $603 million increase to 'HON (Honeywell’s other segments)' based on a completely different goodwill figure (from $15,457M to $18,049M), which does not correspond to Aerospace Goodwill. (2) The numbers are factually wrong: GD’s increase is off by $170 million (claims $10M vs actual $180M), HON’s is off by $593 million (claims $603M vs actual $10M), and the total is $613M vs correct $190M. The cited figures appear to reflect total goodwill or other segments, not Aerospace-specific. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model confuses company tickers (assigning Honeywell’s data to GD), misidentifies business segments, and fails to isolate Aerospace Goodwill for each company. It incorrectly synthesizes data from unrelated reporting units. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer discusses Honeywell’s overall goodwill changes rather than Aerospace-specific goodwill for both GD and HON. The qualitative reasoning is poor due to entity misassignment and incorrect metric tracking. Only minor credit is given for attempting to break down contributions and mentioning currency/acquisition impacts, but these are irrelevant to the actual question.",

According to the ground truth, CMCSA has a net value of $62.5 billion and GOOGL $2.6 billion, combining to $65.1 billion. However, the LLM incorrectly states GOOGL's net value as $171.0 billion (over 65 times higher than actual) and implies a combined value of $233.5 billion, which is grossly inaccurate. The gross investment for GOOGL is stated as $200.0 billion, but the ground truth reports only $4.6 billion—again, a massive overstatement. Only CMCSA’s gross investment of $122.1 billion matches the ground truth. (2) Calculations are entirely flawed: the LLM appears to derive GOOGL’s gross investment by adding net PP&E and construction-in-progress, but these values ($139.6B + $60.4B) are not supported by the ground truth and contradict the stated $4.6B gross investment. The combined net value is not even computed correctly in the answer—it lists individual values but omits the actual sum. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: while the question asks for a comparison of capital intensity strategies based on accurate data, the LLM draws the opposite conclusion—claiming GOOGL is more capital-intensive—due to fabricated numbers. In reality, CMCSA’s much higher gross investment relative to net value reflects higher capital intensity, which the LLM reverses. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies, time period, and concept (capital intensity), and attempts to explain strategy differences. However, due to catastrophic quantitative errors, the qualitative reasoning collapses. Scores reflect near-total failure on numbers, partial credit for attempting correct structure and entities.",

      "original_answer": "AbbVie is advancing its oncology portfolio through the commercial execution of Venclexta, Epkinly, and Elahere, which supports its strategic objective of maintaining growth and competitiveness in the oncology space, especially in the face of challenges with Imbruvica. Meanwhile, Pfizer significantly bolstered its oncology capabilities through the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, gaining four in-line medicines—Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, and Tivdak—alongside a robust pipeline. This acquisition allows Pfizer to span multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics, and other immunotherapies, thereby enhancing its competitive positioning. Together, both companies are strategically strengthening their oncology portfolios, but Pfizer’s acquisition represents a more transformative step in reshaping its presence in the oncology market.",

AbbVie is advancing its pipeline—highlighted by the FDA approval of Epkinly (epcoritamab) and the ongoing development of Venclexta, Elahere and other agents—while also leveraging new indications for Skyrizi and Rinvoq to drive growth. Pfizer, after acquiring Seagen, now owns a broader oncology portfolio that includes Seagen’s ADCs (e.g., Padcev, Adcetris) and bispecifics, positioning it to compete more aggressively in the same therapeutic space. In short, AbbVie’s strategy centers on expanding its own oncology assets and indications, whereas Pfizer’s strategy relies on a newly enlarged portfolio built through the Seagen acquisition to bolster its competitive stance.",

(1) All entities are accurately identified: AbbVie’s focus on Venclexta, Epkinly, and Elahere is correctly noted, as is Pfizer’s acquisition of Seagen. The in-line medicines from Seagen—Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, and Tivdak—are partially listed (Padcev and Adcetris mentioned; Tukysa and Tivdak omitted), but the emphasis on ADCs and bispecifics aligns with the ground truth. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers that conflict; the LLM does not introduce any incorrect quantitative claims (e.g., no false acquisition date—December 2023 is implied by context but not stated, which is acceptable for qualitative summary). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts AbbVie’s organic portfolio advancement with Pfizer’s acquisition-driven transformation, capturing the essence that Pfizer’s move is more transformative. However, it adds information not in the original answer—mentioning Skyrizi and Rinvoq, which are immunology assets and not directly part of AbbVie’s oncology strategy—which slightly dilutes focus. (4) Despite this minor overreach, the answer remains contextually relevant and semantically close to the ground truth. The core message—that AbbVie is building incrementally while Pfizer made a transformative leap via Seagen—is preserved.

      "original_answer": "Amazon had a total of 628 stores (600 North America + 28 International) as of December 31, 2023, while Lowe’s had 1,746 stores as of the end of 2023. This means Lowe’s store count is significantly higher, with a difference of 1,118 stores.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, Amazon reports **22,871 leased square footage and 707 owned square footage for physical stores in North America** and **255 leased square footage for physical stores in International** as of December 31, 2023 (Page 18). However, the document does not provide a direct count of the number of stores in North America or International. Instead, it states that the \"Physical stores (2)\" row includes \"600 North America and 28 International stores as of December 31, 2023\" (Page 18, footnote 2). Thus, the combined total of stores in North America and International is **628 stores** (600 + 28).\n\nLowe’s total store count is explicitly stated as **1,746 as of the end of 2023** (Page 26, \"Number of stores\" metric). Therefore, Amazon’s combined store count of 628 is **significantly smaller** than Lowe’s 1,746 stores, representing approximately **36% of Lowe’s scale** (628 ÷ 1,746 ≈ 0.36). This indicates Amazon’s physical store footprint is roughly one-third the size of Lowe’s total store network. \n\n**Note**: The question conflates \"stores\" (count) with \"square footage\" (space), but the document only provides store counts via the footnote (600 North America + 28 International = 628 stores), not via square footage. The square footage data is irrelevant to the store count comparison. Lowe’s 1,746 stores are confirmed in the document (Page 26), while Amazon’s store count is derived from the footnote on Page 18.",

It also correctly states Lowe’s total store count as 1,746 as of the end of 2023.

(2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the combined total for Amazon and the scale comparison to Lowe’s. (3) Entity accuracy is perfect—Amazon and Lowe’s are correctly identified, with accurate metric types (store counts, not square footage), and correct time reference (end of 2023). (4) The reasoning is excellent: the LLM correctly interprets a footnote to extract store counts, distinguishes between square footage and store count, and performs multi-hop synthesis between Amazon’s footnote on Page 18 and Lowe’s store count on Page 26.

      "question": "How does the use of TRSs by AMT and SPG differently affect their tax obligations and income distribution strategies, based on their respective 2023 disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "AMT operates as a REIT and is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, provided it distributes substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders. However, it must pay taxes on earnings from its domestic TRSs. As of December 31, 2023, AMT’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing, most of its U.S. indoor DAS networks, Services and Data Centers segments, and most operations in several international markets, which indicates that its TRSs are a limited but necessary part of its structure for engaging in non-REIT-qualified activities. In contrast, SPG also operates as a REIT and owns securities in TRSs, but it is subject to a 100% excise tax on certain transactions with TRSs if not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. SPG must also ensure that no more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs. This constraint affects SPG’s flexibility in managing TRS investments and requires careful monitoring to avoid violating REIT asset tests and incurring penalties. Therefore, while both companies use TRSs to engage in non-REIT activities, AMT appears to integrate TRSs more directly into its international operations, whereas SPG must manage TRS ownership more restrictively to avoid tax penalties and maintain REIT compliance.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2023 disclosures, AMT uses TRSs to hold investments in its international operations (e.g., India) and other non-REIT businesses, enabling it to engage in activities that would otherwise violate REIT qualification rules while maintaining compliance with U.S. tax requirements. This structure allows AMT to hold securities of TRSs without triggering the 5%/10% asset tests applicable to REITs, but it remains subject to a 100% excise tax on non-arm’s-length transactions with TRSs. In contrast, SPG’s disclosures indicate it operates as a REIT with TRS subsidiaries for certain business lines (e.g., domestic tower leasing, data centers), where TRS income is taxed at corporate rates, and it must distribute 90% of REIT taxable income to avoid corporate taxation—though SPG’s TRS usage appears limited to specific U.S. operations, unlike AMT’s broader international TRS strategy. Both companies face risks from TRS-related tax penalties if transactions lack arm’s-length terms, but AMT’s TRS structure is more central to its international expansion strategy, while SPG’s TRS use is more confined to domestic REIT-compliant activities.",

(1) Correctly identifies that both AMT and SPG use TRSs for non-REIT activities and face a 100% excise tax on non-arm’s-length transactions—this aligns with the ground truth. It also correctly notes AMT’s use of TRSs in international operations like India. However, it incorrectly states that AMT avoids the 5%/10% asset tests by using TRSs, which is not supported in the original answer and misrepresents REIT compliance rules; the original emphasizes AMT’s REIT-qualified businesses and only notes TRSs as a limited necessity, not a structural workaround. (2) Quantitatively, there are no explicit numbers (percentages, dollar amounts, dates) in either answer, so no numeric inaccuracies—minor phrasing like '90%' distribution rule is generally accurate for REITs, though the original specifies 'substantially all' rather than a precise figure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to compare TRS usage across AMT and SPG, but mischaracterizes the nature of SPG’s TRS operations—original specifies SPG is constrained by the 20% asset test for TRS securities, which the LLM omits entirely and instead incorrectly claims SPG uses TRSs for 'domestic tower leasing, data centers', which contradicts the original where those are REIT-qualified for AMT, not SPG. The LLM also reverses emphasis: original states SPG must restrict TRS ownership due to asset test limits, while LLM suggests SPG uses TRSs domestically and AMT internationally—while AMT’s international use is correct, SPG’s TRS limitations are regulatory, not geographic. (4) Despite relevant structure and context, the misattribution of SPG’s TRS use and incorrect reasoning on asset tests reduce factual accuracy.

It states the 2023 combined cash paid for interest by DUK and NEE is $1,954 million, but the ground truth is $1,988 million (DUK: $954M + NEE: $1,034M). The LLM incorrectly calculates the sum. Additionally, while the 2021 values for DUK ($813M) and NEE ($586M) are correct, the LLM falsely claims that the 2023 combined total is lower than 2021, when in fact it is higher. The correct 2021 combined total is $1,399M, making the 2023 total $589M higher, not lower. (2) Number verification: DUK 2023 = $954M (correct in truth, missing individually in LLM), NEE 2023 = $1,034M (correct in truth, missing in LLM), LLM sum = $1,954M (incorrect), correct sum = $1,988M. 2021 values are correctly cited by LLM, but the comparison direction is wrong.

      "question": "How does the use of estimated total contract costs in revenue recognition for long-term contracts differ between GD and HON, particularly in terms of the factors influencing these estimates and the financial implications of estimation adjustments?",
      "original_answer": "GD uses a cost-to-cost input method to estimate progress on long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time. It bases its estimates on assumptions such as labor productivity, material costs, subcontractor performance, and availability of funding. If there is a significant change in these estimates, GD adjusts the profit using a cumulative catch-up method, which impacts profit recorded to date and future revenue recognition. In 2023, GD had $93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, with 40% expected to be recognized in 2024. HON also uses the cost-to-cost method for long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time, but its estimation process includes factors like historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, and anticipated labor agreements. HON emphasizes auditor evaluation of these estimates due to their complexity and subjectivity, particularly for contracts with longer durations or significant gross margin changes. Both companies face financial implications from estimation changes, but GD explicitly ties adjustments to a defined catch-up method, while HON focuses on audit validation of estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "GD and HON both recognize revenue over time for long-term contracts using cost-to-cost input methods, but differ in how they estimate total contract costs and the factors influencing those estimates. GD explicitly details that contract estimates incorporate variable consideration (e.g., anticipated modifications, claims, and incentive fees), with adjustments impacting revenue and earnings recognized cumulatively, and highlights risks from supply chain impacts and variable costs in segments like Marine Systems. HON’s disclosures emphasize that estimates rely on assumptions about future events (e.g., technical risks, schedule risks, subcontractor performance, and funding availability), and adjustments are made under a cumulative catch-up method, with no single contract adjustment deemed material in 2023. Both companies face estimation risks, but GD’s analysis focuses on specific contractual risks (e.g., Navy submarine schedules), while HON’s broader framework underscores the role of historical trends, inflation, and business volume in cost projections.",

While both GD and HON use the cost-to-cost method and recognize revenue over time—correctly stated—the specific factors influencing estimates differ. The LLM incorrectly attributes 'variable consideration (e.g., anticipated modifications, claims, and incentive fees)' to GD without support in the original answer, which instead lists labor productivity, material costs, subcontractor performance, and funding availability. Similarly, the LLM claims HON uses a 'cumulative catch-up method', but the original answer does not state this—instead, HON emphasizes auditor evaluation due to complexity and subjectivity. The LLM also fabricates that 'no single contract adjustment was deemed material in 2023' for HON, which is not in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the original answer includes specific figures—$93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations for GD with 40% expected in 2024—but the LLM omits all numbers, missing a key multi-hop element. This omission significantly impacts factual completeness and correctness. (3) Reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that both companies use cost-to-cost methods and face estimation risks, and it attempts to contrast their approaches. However, it misrepresents HON’s treatment of adjustments (attributing a catch-up method not mentioned) and invents audit-like conclusions not present. The synthesis across entities is incomplete and contains fabricated details. (4) Despite these issues, the answer remains contextually relevant, addressing the core question about differences in estimation factors and financial implications. Wording differences are acceptable, but missing data and incorrect attributions reduce correctness. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct high-level structure but flawed details.",

(3) The reasoning is flawed: the model appears to have mistaken the 2023 liability value for the growth amount, failing to compute the year-over-year change.

The LLM incorrectly assigns 7.9% to JNJ and 13.90% to PFE, and reverses the years (2047 for JNJ, 2048 for PFE), which completely inverts the correct relationship. (2) The numerical values are all mismatched: the trend rates are swapped, the years are swapped, and the resulting gap is incorrectly calculated as 3 years (2048 - 2047 = 1 year difference in the correct answer). The LLM also introduces a '22-year gap' and '25-year gap' calculation (from 2023 to 2047/2048), which is not asked for and further confuses the response. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model fails to correctly associate each company with its correct assumption and projection, leading to an incorrect comparison and conclusion. Instead of noting that JNJ (with a higher initial rate) reaches the ultimate rate just one year after PFE, it falsely claims JNJ reaches it three years earlier, which contradicts both the data and logical expectation.

The ground truth states $2,741 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports $951 million. Duke Energy's 2024 noncurrent commodity contract liabilities are correctly stated as $134 million. Due to this major numerical error, the calculated sum is wrong: $134M + $951M = $1,085M (LLM) vs. the correct total of $134M + $2,741M = $2,875M. (2) The calculation itself is arithmetically correct based on the numbers provided by the LLM, but because one of the inputs is factually incorrect, the final total is significantly off. This undermines the quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies both companies, the correct years, and the relevant liability categories, and attempts to synthesize them into a total and interpret their financial implications. The explanation of what the liabilities represent is reasonable and aligns with financial terminology. However, the incorrect figure for NextEra breaks the factual foundation of the synthesis.

      "original_answer": "GD distinguishes between its defense and aerospace segments in how it manages cash collections and contract assets. In the defense segments, billing typically occurs after revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets, while in the Aerospace segment, GD generally receives deposits upon contract execution or milestone achievement, which are liquidated as revenue is recognized. In contrast, HON systematically tracks unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables on a contract-by-contract basis, recognizing contract assets when revenue is recognized before billing and derecognizing them upon billing. This shows that while GD's approach varies by business segment, HON maintains a more standardized process for tracking and derecognizing contract assets as performance obligations are satisfied.",
      "llm_answer": "GD’s defense and aerospace segments recognize revenue on a contract‑by‑contract basis and generally bill after revenue is recognized, creating contract assets (unbilled receivables) that arise when billing lags behind performance‑obligation satisfaction; advances or deposits are recorded as contract liabilities. In contrast, Honeywell’s general approach treats performance obligations as distinct promises, allocating the transaction price to each and recognizing revenue either at a point in time or over time, and it records contract assets and liabilities on a contract‑by‑contract basis, with timing of billings and cash collections often differing from revenue recognition, leading to contract assets that reflect unbilled amounts and contract liabilities that reflect advance payments. Consequently, both companies experience timing gaps between cash collection and revenue recognition, but GD’s defense segment relies on periodic or milestone‑based billings that typically generate contract assets after revenue is recorded, whereas Honeywell’s broader, multi‑segment framework can generate contract assets and liabilities from both point‑in‑time and over‑time obligations, affecting the magnitude and timing of cash collections.",

It correctly identifies that both companies recognize revenue before billing in some cases, leading to contract assets, and that both use contract-by-contract tracking. However, it misses a key distinction in the original answer: GD applies different approaches across its defense and aerospace segments—defense generates contract assets due to post-revenue billing, while aerospace receives deposits upfront (contract liabilities) that are liquidated over time. The LLM mentions deposits as contract liabilities but does not clearly contrast GD’s segment-specific practices (defense vs. aerospace), which is central to the question. In contrast, HON’s standardized, contract-by-contract tracking of unbilled receivables is accurately described. The reasoning is sound but incomplete in synthesizing the multi-hop comparison: GD’s segment variation vs. HON’s uniformity. This omission reduces qualitative accuracy.

      "question": "How much greater is Duke Energy's total noncurrent regulatory assets compared to the remaining reserve amortization available under NextEra Energy's 2021 rate agreement as of December 31, 2024?",
      "original_answer": "Duke Energy's total noncurrent regulatory assets amount to $4,199 million, while NextEra Energy has $895 million of reserve amortization remaining available under the 2021 rate agreement. The difference between these amounts is $3,304 million.",
      "llm_answer": "Duke Energy's total noncurrent regulatory assets were $4,555 million as of December 31, 2024. In contrast, the remaining reserve amortization available under NextEra Energy's 2021 rate agreement was $895 million. Therefore, Duke Energy's noncurrent regulatory assets exceed the remaining reserve amortization by approximately $3,660 million.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numbers. According to the ground truth, Duke Energy's total noncurrent regulatory assets are $4,199 million, but the LLM reports $4,555 million—a difference of $356 million. The remaining reserve amortization for NextEra Energy ($895 million) is correctly stated. However, due to the incorrect base figure for Duke Energy, the calculated difference is wrong: LLM reports $3,660 million ($4,555M - $895M), while the correct difference is $3,304 million ($4,199M - $895M). (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the core financial figure for Duke Energy is incorrect, and the resulting calculation is therefore invalid. The $895M value is accurate, but the $4,555M figure does not match the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model correctly identifies that the question requires comparing two distinct financial figures from two different companies and computing the difference. It also correctly identifies the relevant entities and metric types (noncurrent regulatory assets vs. reserve amortization). (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the exact comparison asked, uses appropriate terminology, and attempts the correct calculation. However, due to the incorrect input data, the conclusion is factually wrong. The answer would score higher if the numbers were accurate, even with the same reasoning framework.",

      "original_answer": "CAT did not specify a dollar amount for the Medicare Part D subsidy it expected to receive in 2024, but LMT reported receiving $2 million for the Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans in 2024. CAT's strategy for managing postretirement benefit plan assets involves a target allocation of 40% equities and 60% fixed income, while LMT’s U.S. pension plan had a target allocation of 85% fixed income and 15% equities in 2024, indicating a significantly lower equity exposure compared to CAT.",

It claims a total Medicare Part D subsidy of $6 million for both CAT and LMT in 2024, but the ground truth states that CAT did not specify any amount, and LMT reported only $2 million for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans (not necessarily all Part D). Thus, the $6 million figure is unsupported and incorrect. Additionally, the LLM reverses the equity allocation strategies: it states CAT allocates 15% to equities and LMT 40%, while the truth is CAT targets 40% equities and LMT only 15%. These are major factual inversions. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the $6 million total is fabricated; the 15% and 40% equity allocations are swapped between companies, making both percentages incorrect in context. No valid calculation can justify the $6 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly synthesize information across the two companies and misrepresented both subsidy expectations and asset allocation strategies. It incorrectly aggregated subsidies and reversed comparative strategies, undermining the logical structure. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topics (Medicare Part D subsidies and equity allocations), but with incorrect data and reversed conclusions.

      "original_answer": "Apple directly presents its segment information and geographic data in its 2022 10-K filing, including detailed financial metrics by reportable segment for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. In contrast, IBM does not include its segment information directly in the 2022 10-K but instead references its 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, directing readers to pages 87 to 90 for segment details. This implies that Apple adopts a more integrated and self-contained reporting approach, while IBM relies on external incorporation by reference, potentially affecting accessibility of detailed segment data for analysts reviewing its 2022 filing alone.",

In contrast, IBM's 2022 filing (page 6) references its 2021 segment information only in a brief \"Segment information and revenue by classes of similar products or services\" footnote (pages 87-90 of the 2021 Annual Report), without providing the same level of granular geographic detail or reconciliation.

These facts align with the ground truth. The implication about Apple's integrated reporting versus IBM's incorporation by reference is accurately captured, though the LLM adds interpretive language like 'transparent, standardized, and detailed' and 'less accessible,' which are reasonable inferences but slightly more evaluative than the neutral tone of the original. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., revenue amounts, percentages) in either the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations; however, page numbers (e.g., page 52 for Apple, pages 87-90 for IBM) and note numbers (Note 11) are correctly cited, assuming they match the actual filings—these details are consistent with typical SEC filing structures and the knowledge graph. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (Apple and IBM), two filings (2022 10-Ks), and references to prior-year reports (IBM’s 2021 Annual Report). It contrasts presentation methods and draws a valid implication about reporting approaches. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing how the presentation differs and what it implies.

While VZ's 2024 Wireless Service Revenue ($13,753 million) and total revenue ($29,531 million) are correct, T's Wireless Service Revenue is incorrect: LLM reports $65,373 million vs. ground truth of $68,041 million. This leads to an incorrect difference: $51,620 million (LLM) vs. correct $54,288 million. Similarly, T's total revenue is wrong: $122,336 million (LLM) vs. actual $122,336 million (coincidentally correct), but the derived percentage (52.7%) is inaccurate due to wrong segment revenue; correct is 55.6%. VZ's segment percentage is 45.9% (LLM) vs. 46.3% (truth), a minor deviation. (2) Calculations: Difference = $65,373 - $13,753 = $51,620 (correct math but wrong inputs). Percentages: 65,373 / 122,336 ≈ 53.4% (LLM says 52.7%) — calculation itself is slightly off. VZ: 13,753 / 29,531 ≈ 46.57% (LLM says 45.9%) — also miscalculated.

For BMY in 2023, the correct value is $65 million, but the LLM reports $35 million, a major discrepancy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: both numbers are incorrect, and the comparison is therefore flawed. The LLM suggests the 2024 combined value is 'comparable' to BMY's 2023 value, but in reality, $113 million (combined 2024) is significantly higher than $65 million (BMY 2023), making the trend opposite to what the LLM implies. (3) The qualitative reasoning fails on multi-hop synthesis: the model should have retrieved and summed values for two companies in 2024 and compared to a prior year value for one company.

      "question": "How do the differences in lease structure and risk exposure between AMT and SPG influence their respective revenue stability and tenant retention strategies?",
      "original_answer": "AMT maintains greater revenue stability through its structured lease arrangements with fixed escalation clauses and financial penalties for early termination, which discourage tenants from ending leases prematurely. These leases typically have initial terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal options, and often include pass-through costs for power, which are recognized as revenue over time. In contrast, SPG faces higher tenant retention risk due to its reliance on consumer foot traffic and exposure to unpredictable external factors like civil unrest, pandemics, and e-commerce shifts. SPG’s leasing goals are more vulnerable to market volatility, such as oversupply of retail space and reduced consumer willingness to shop in person, which could lead to lower occupancy and rental rates. As a result, AMT benefits from more predictable, long-term cash flows, while SPG must adapt its business model to evolving consumer behavior and external disruptions to maintain revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "The lease structures and risk exposures differ markedly between AMT and SPG, shaping their revenue stability and tenant‑retention approaches. AMT’s leases are typically longer‑term, with built‑in escalations and penalties that lock in rent and discourage early terminations, providing a more predictable cash flow but also greater exposure to tenant‑specific financial distress. In contrast, SPG’s leases—especially in retail—are shorter, more variable, and often tied to anchor‑store performance, making its revenue more sensitive to anchor closures, bankruptcies, and shifts in consumer behavior, prompting a proactive re‑leasing and rent‑adjustment strategy to mitigate volatility.",

(1) It correctly identifies that AMT has longer-term leases with escalation clauses and penalties for early termination, contributing to revenue stability, while SPG faces more volatility due to consumer behavior and anchor-store dependencies. These points match the original answer's emphasis on predictability for AMT and market sensitivity for SPG. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, exact lease durations like 'five to ten years') in the LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy cannot be penalized—none are misstated. The absence of specific numbers (e.g., lease term lengths, pass-through revenue recognition) is a minor omission but does not introduce inaccuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that AMT’s structure leads to stable cash flows while SPG must actively manage re-leasing and rent adjustments due to higher volatility. However, the LLM omits key details from the original answer, such as AMT’s pass-through of power costs as revenue and SPG’s exposure to civil unrest, pandemics, and e-commerce shifts—factors that enrich the risk profile. (4) Despite these omissions, the LLM conveys semantically equivalent reasoning about revenue stability and tenant retention strategies.

Meanwhile, AMD reported a steady increase in its Data Center revenue from $2,884 million in 2022 to $3,403 million in 2024, indicating a growing presence in this market. If NVIDIA is unable to meet the new standards, it could lose market share in China, potentially benefiting AMD if they can meet the requirements. However, if the standards broadly exclude foreign-made accelerators, both companies could face significant challenges in maintaining or growing their Data Center revenue in China.",

      "original_answer": "The decline in business spending negatively affects American Express's ability to securitize and sell loans and receivables, which is a key part of their funding plan. This could lead to funding challenges inconsistent with current expectations. Similarly, reduced business spending impacts Mastercard's cross-border transaction volumes, which are a significant source of revenue through cross-border volume fees and switched transaction fees. Both companies are thus exposed to financial performance risks due to lower business spending, with American Express facing potential liquidity constraints and Mastercard experiencing reduced fee income.",
      "llm_answer": "The declining business spending directly weakens the revenue base that underpins American Express’s loan‑securitization strategy, forcing the company to rely more on higher‑cost funding and to face tighter securitization market conditions. At the same time, Mastercard’s cross‑border transaction revenues are being squeezed by the same spending pull‑back, which reduces the volume of international payments it processes and depresses its fee income. Together, these pressures curtail both firms’ earnings growth and amplify the adverse impact on their overall financial performance.",

(1) All key facts are correct: declining business spending impacts American Express's loan securitization plans by weakening the revenue base and increasing reliance on more expensive funding, and it reduces Mastercard's cross-border transaction volumes and fee income. These effects align with the original answer’s points about funding challenges for Amex and reduced fee income for Mastercard. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no discrepancies exist. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links reduced business spending to Amex’s securitization strategy and Mastercard’s cross-border fees, then synthesizes the combined impact on financial performance. The LLM adds slight elaboration (e.g., 'higher-cost funding', 'tighter securitization market conditions') that are reasonable inferences and do not contradict the original. (4) The answer fully addresses both parts of the question and maintains contextual relevance. The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the original emphasizes Amex’s potential liquidity constraints more explicitly, while the LLM focuses on earnings growth—slightly less precise but still accurate in spirit.

It incorrectly states that DUK's fuel and power expense is $5,457 million, which is actually NEE's expense. DUK's correct expense is $2,203 million, and the combined total should be $7,660 million, not $10,914 million. The LLM also reports incorrect revenue figures: DUK's revenue is listed as $67,453 million instead of $6,488 million, and NEE's as $56,867 million instead of $28,114 million. These errors severely distort the percentage calculations. (2) Calculations are incorrect: the LLM claims DUK spent 16.2% of its revenue on fuel and power, but with the correct numbers, it is approximately 34%. For NEE, the correct percentage is ~19.4%, not 19.2% (though this is close, it's based on wrong inputs). The combined expense is miscalculated due to duplicated NEE's number for DUK. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly attribute expenses and revenues to each company, conflating the two entities. It appears to have copied NEE's expense and applied it to DUK, showing a failure in entity-specific data retrieval and synthesis. (4) Despite addressing all parts of the question (completeness), the answer is factually wrong on core metrics, leading to a low correctness score.

This implies LMT's rate is 2.5 points above CAT's. However, the LLM states CAT assumes 8.5% and LMT 8%, meaning CAT's rate is higher by 0.5 points — which contradicts the ground truth. Thus, both the individual rates and the direction of the difference are wrong. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the percentages cited (8.5% and 8%) do not align with the correct values needed to produce a 2.5-point difference favoring LMT. For example, if the difference is 2.5 points and LMT is higher, possible correct pairs could be CAT: 7.0%, LMT: 9.5%, or similar — not 8.5% vs 8%. The calculation and values are factually incorrect. (3) The qualitative accuracy is moderate: the model correctly identifies the companies (CAT and LMT), the type of assumption (health care trend rate for next year), and the relevant benefit plans.

For Netflix, it correctly identifies the 58% cost of revenue ratio, but incorrectly implies Google's is higher at 61%, which is false. The gross profit margin calculations themselves (42% for Netflix, 39% for Google) are mathematically correct based on the percentages provided in the LLM answer, but they are based on incorrect input data. (2) The actual cost of revenues and revenue figures from the ground truth are: Google — $110.939B / $257.637B = ~43%; Netflix — $17.333B / $29.884B = ~58%. The difference in cost of revenues as a percentage is 58% - 43% = 15%, not the implied 3% (61% - 58%) or any other value. The LLM answer reverses the comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize financial data for both companies, misrepresenting Google’s cost structure.

According to the ground truth, the combined total is $6.045 billion, but the LLM reports $255 million for Starbucks and $490 million for Tesla, summing to only $745 million—far below the correct total. The Starbucks expense amount is therefore incorrect (by over 95% underreporting), and Tesla's is off by nearly 90%. Additionally, Tesla’s weighted average recognition period is stated as 4.0 years by the LLM, whereas the ground truth is 3.0 years, making this a clear factual error. Only Starbucks’ 2.3-year period matches the original answer. (2) The calculations are fundamentally flawed: even if the LLM’s numbers were correct, it fails to compute the combined total, which was explicitly asked. The difference in recognition periods is also not calculated—the question asks how they differ, implying a comparison or difference (0.7 years), but no such analysis is provided. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is weak: while the model attempts to pull data for two companies across different dates, it fails to synthesize the correct figures or compute the required aggregate and comparative metrics. The entities (Starbucks/SBUX, Tesla/TSLA, correct metrics) are correctly identified, showing some understanding of the task structure.

      "original_answer": "AMT relies heavily on tenant leases as a source of recurring revenue, with the majority of its property operations generating revenue from multiyear contracts. This recurring revenue is critical for maintaining cash flow from operating activities. In contrast, SPG faces significant risks that could negatively impact tenant lease performance, including shifts in consumer behavior toward e-commerce, reduced consumer foot traffic due to public health crises, and the potential for tenants to underreport sales, which affects overage rent collection. These external factors could materially and adversely affect SPG’s occupancy levels and lease rates, directly impacting its revenue and asset value. Thus, while AMT benefits from the stability of long-term tenant leases, SPG is more exposed to volatility due to changing market and health conditions that influence tenant performance.",
      "llm_answer": "AMT’s recurring revenue from tenant leases is inherently stable and predictable, forming a core pillar of its financial model, but this stability is directly vulnerable to the same external pressures that threaten SPG’s tenant lease performance. Both companies face significant risks from shifting consumer behavior (e.g., e-commerce growth, retail bankruptcies, and anchor store closures) and public health crises (e.g., pandemics), which can disrupt tenant operations, reduce rent payments, and force lease modifications or terminations. While AMT mitigates this through long-term, multi-tenant leases and contractual protections (e.g., reserve accounts under securitizations), SPG’s exposure is amplified by its heavier reliance on large-format retail tenants, making both REITs susceptible to revenue volatility from factors beyond their control.",

The answer correctly identifies that both AMT and SPG rely on tenant leases, that external factors like e-commerce and public health crises pose risks, and that AMT benefits from long-term contracts while SPG is more exposed to volatility. However, the LLM mischaracterizes the contrast by stating that AMT's stability is 'directly vulnerable' to the same pressures in a way that equates its risk profile with SPG’s, whereas the original emphasizes AMT's relative stability versus SPG’s heightened exposure. The original clearly differentiates the two: AMT benefits from stability, while SPG faces material adverse effects due to its retail-centric, foot-traffic-dependent model. The LLM downplays this distinction by focusing on shared vulnerabilities without adequately acknowledging the structural insulation AMT enjoys through its multiyear, often triple-net leases with telecom tenants (not large-format retail). This weakens the qualitative accuracy (score 7) due to imbalanced comparative reasoning. Contextual relevance is high (9) as the response stays on-topic and addresses the comparative risk and revenue dynamics.

This difference caused Honeywell’s segment profit to be higher by the full amount of its restructuring costs ($90 million) compared with Caterpillar, which absorbed only a portion of its restructuring costs ($90 million was deducted from consolidated profit but not fully reflected in segment profit).

It breaks this down into $447 million for Duke Energy and $1,034 million for NextEra Energy, which sum correctly. The 2021 values are stated as $335 million (Duke) and $586 million (NextEra), totaling $921 million, which aligns with the ground truth total. The comparison stating that the 2023 total is higher than 2021 is accurate. (2) All numeric values are correct, and the implicit calculations (summing 2023 and 2021 values) are accurate. Format variations (e.g., $1,481 million vs $1,481M) are acceptable and do not affect meaning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly retrieves and synthesizes data across two companies and two years, then compares the totals. The breakdown per company adds value and demonstrates proper entity-level understanding. (4) The answer is fully relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the 2023 combined value and the comparison to 2021. The only minor limitation is that the ground truth does not specify the individual 2021 breakdowns ($335M and $586M), so while these numbers are consistent with the total, their presence in the LLM answer introduces details not confirmed in the ground truth.

It also states that Chevron produced 2,112 MMCFD and ExxonMobil 5,637 MMCFD in 2023, which misattributes Chevron's U.S. production (2,112 MMCFD) as its total and incorrectly assigns ExxonMobil’s production. In reality, Chevron produced 7,744 MMCFD and ExxonMobil 5,602 MMCFD is not supported—ExxonMobil actually produced 7,734 MMCFD in 2023. The LLM also incorrectly reports combined 2022 production as 8,295 MMCFD, which is actually ExxonMobil’s 2022 standalone value, not the combined total. The correct 2022 combined value is 12,812 MMCFD. (2) Calculations are fundamentally flawed: the LLM sums only partial values and fails to aggregate both companies’ full production. The claimed decrease of 546 MMCFD is incorrect—the actual change is an increase of 534 MMCFD (13,346 - 12,812). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is severely compromised: the model fails to correctly identify and synthesize net natural gas production for both companies across two years. It confuses U.S.-only figures with total production and omits international volumes entirely. It also fails to correctly sum the combined totals across entities and years. (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, metric (net natural gas production in MMCFD), and time periods.

      "original_answer": "AMT benefits from a more stable long-term revenue outlook due to 52% of its tenant leases expiring in 2030 or beyond, which provides extended contractual income visibility and reduces exposure to near-term market volatility. In contrast, SPG faces greater uncertainty in revenue stability because its properties are more exposed to short-term tenant risks, such as retail store closures, consumer foot traffic fluctuations, and the impact of external events like crime or public health crises, which can disrupt tenant performance and leasing goals. This contrast in lease duration profiles means AMT is better insulated from near-term market shifts, while SPG must navigate more immediate tenant and consumer behavior risks that could directly affect its leasing revenue and asset value.",
      "llm_answer": "The lease expiration profiles create markedly different long‑term revenue stability for the two companies. AMT’s portfolio is heavily weighted toward leases that extend to 2030 and beyond (about 52% of tenants have renewal dates in that horizon), giving it a relatively predictable, long‑term cash‑flow base.

Duke Energy reported $202 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities, while NextEra Energy reported $2,741 million.

According to the ground truth, Duke Energy (DUK) reported $202 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities, but the LLM incorrectly states $2,546 million—a significant overstatement. NextEra Energy (NEE) is correctly reported in the LLM answer as $2,741 million, which matches the ground truth. However, the combined total is therefore incorrect: the LLM calculates $5,287 million ($2,741M + $2,546M), whereas the correct sum is $2,943 million ($202M + $2,741M). This miscalculation undermines the quantitative foundation of the response. (2) The calculation error stems from using an incorrect value for DUK, despite getting NEE’s figure right. Even though the format of numbers is acceptable (e.g., $2,741 million vs $2.741B), the actual values must match; here, DUK’s liability is off by more than 12 times the correct amount. (3) The reasoning and multi-hop synthesis are partially sound—the LLM attempts to compare the two companies and attributes NEE’s higher liability to commodity and interest-rate contracts, which is plausible contextually. It also mentions DUK’s exposure to foreign currency derivatives, which may reflect accurate sector knowledge, though this detail isn’t in the ground truth. However, because the core data is wrong, the comparative analysis is misleading. (4) Contextual relevance is fair—the response addresses both parts of the question (total amount and interpretation of exposure) and uses appropriate financial terminology. But due to severe quantitative inaccuracies, especially with DUK’s liability, the correctness and qualitative accuracy scores are low. A correct multi-hop answer requires accurate data retrieval from both entities; this failure invalidates the conclusion about relative exposure levels.",

      "original_answer": "The combined amount of long-term debt maturing within one year for AT&T and Verizon in 2024 is $27,657 million. AT&T has $5,089 million in such debt, while Verizon has $22,568 million. This significant short-term debt burden implies both companies must prioritize liquidity management in 2025, with AT&T planning to fund its obligations through cash from operations, debt issuance, and asset sales, and Verizon likely needing to maintain access to credit facilities and manage its cash flow efficiently to meet its larger maturing obligations.",

It incorrectly states that AT&T has $22,568 million in long-term debt maturing within one year, when the ground truth is $5,089 million. It also reports Verizon's amount as $22,633 million, which is close but still incorrect (actual: $22,568 million). The combined total is therefore completely wrong—LLM implies ~$45.2 billion, while the correct sum is $27,657 million. These errors severely undermine the answer’s validity. (2) The calculation of the combined amount is not provided and is factually incorrect based on the numbers used. Even with format flexibility, the values are not equivalent to the ground truth. (3) The reasoning about liquidity strategies is partially plausible but misattributed—Verizon does have a larger burden, but the LLM fails to correctly identify AT&T’s significantly smaller obligation, leading to flawed synthesis. The mention of 'debt maturity tables' lacks sourcing and does not confirm multi-hop accuracy. (4) While the general concept of managing short-term debt through cash flow and financing is contextually appropriate, the severe numerical inaccuracies and entity-level confusion (swapping or misstating figures between companies) result in a low correctness score.

      "original_answer": "ExxonMobil's 2023 disclosures indicate that its Energy Products earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins, which are influenced by global supply and demand balances, inventory levels, and geopolitical developments. In 2023, refining margins remained above the pre-COVID 10-year historical range but started to normalize from 2022 highs, and the company noted that margins would remain volatile due to changes in global factors such as geopolitical developments and demand growth. Chevron, in its 2023 10-K filing, specifically listed 'changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins' as an important factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from its forward-looking statements. This indicates that Chevron explicitly recognizes industry refining margin volatility — such as the trends described by ExxonMobil — as a material risk to its financial projections and operational planning.",
      "llm_answer": "The volatility in industry refining margins—highlighted by ExxonMobil as a key driver of earnings swings due to fluctuating commodity prices, inventory levels, and geopolitical factors—is directly referenced in Chevron’s 2023 10‑K as a material risk, noting that changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins can materially affect its financial results.

(1) All factual elements are correct: ExxonMobil's 2023 disclosures do link Energy Products earnings to refining margins influenced by commodity prices, inventory, and geopolitical factors, with margins normalizing from 2022 highs but remaining volatile. Chevron’s 2023 10-K does list 'changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins' as a material risk affecting forward-looking statements. The LLM correctly identifies this linkage. (2) There are no numerical values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations, but all references to years (2023) and filings (10-K) are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—connecting ExxonMobil’s descriptive analysis of margin drivers to Chevron’s explicit risk factor disclosure—is sound and logically synthesized across two companies’ filings. The LLM correctly infers that Chevron recognizes the same type of volatility as a material risk, which aligns with the ground truth. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits the detail that ExxonMobil noted refining margins were 'above the pre-COVID 10-year historical range' in 2023, which adds context to the level of volatility. While not critical, this nuance is present in the original answer and slightly enhances completeness.

      "question": "How does the difference in financing strategies between GM and Tesla impact their respective exposure to vehicle residual value risks, particularly considering GM Financial's leasing penetration and Tesla's resale value guarantee arrangements?",
      "original_answer": "GM Financial's leasing program is heavily exposed to residual values, as evidenced by its leasing penetration and the $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations in 2023, which is directly influenced by used vehicle prices and lease portfolio net book values. In contrast, Tesla does not include vehicle sales with resale value guarantees in its standard disclosures, indicating a different risk profile where upfront cash payments reduce future residual value exposure. This means GM bears more residual risk through its leasing model, while Tesla mitigates this risk by receiving payments upfront and not including such arrangements in future payment disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "The financing strategies create markedly different residual‑value exposures: GM Financial’s leasing program (≈ 42 % of U.S. retail sales) subjects GM to residual‑value risk through its lease‑portfolio and equipment‑on‑operating‑leases, where residual estimates (e.g., 67 % for crossovers) are subject to market‑price volatility; Tesla, by contrast, guarantees resale values for lessees and holds inventory that can depreciate, but its exposure is largely tied to the performance of those resale‑value guarantees rather than a large, actively managed lease fleet. Consequently, GM’s risk is concentrated in lease‑portfolio residual estimates and equipment‑on‑lease write‑downs, while Tesla’s risk centers on the accuracy of its resale‑value guarantees and inventory valuation.",

Specifically, the 42% leasing penetration for GM and the 67% residual estimate for crossovers are not mentioned in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. The original answer cites a $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations in 2023 as evidence of GM's exposure, but this figure is missing in the LLM response. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly suggests Tesla 'guarantees resale values for lessees' and 'holds inventory that can depreciate' as part of its financing strategy—this is not supported by the original answer, which states Tesla does not include vehicle sales with resale value guarantees in disclosures, implying such arrangements are not standard or material. (2) The absence of the $0.9 billion gain—a key quantitative anchor in the original—is a significant omission. The LLM introduces precise percentages (42%, 67%) with false precision and no source in the ground truth, reducing quantitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning partially captures the contrast in risk exposure: GM’s leasing model creates residual value risk, while Tesla avoids it through upfront payments and lack of disclosed guarantees. However, the LLM misrepresents Tesla’s model by asserting resale value guarantees exist, which contradicts the original claim that Tesla does not report such arrangements. This undermines the multi-hop synthesis, as the conclusion about Tesla’s risk being tied to guarantee performance is factually inverted. (4) Despite these issues, the LLM correctly identifies the core conceptual difference—GM bears residual risk via leasing, Tesla mitigates it through financing structure—earning points for qualitative reasoning and contextual relevance. The structure and focus align well with the question, but factual inaccuracies, especially in numbers and Tesla’s risk mechanisms, limit correctness.",

It states the total increase as $1.04 billion, which is approximately equivalent to $1,048 million (ground truth), so the quantitative total is acceptable with rounding/format variation. However, it incorrectly claims that Qualcomm contributed more to the increase, when in fact Microsoft contributed $1,043 million versus Qualcomm's $55 million—Microsoft clearly contributed more. (2) Number verification: $1.04 billion ≈ $1,048 million is acceptable (within rounding). But the attribution is wrong—Qualcomm did not contribute more. The individual increases are not stated, so the model fails to provide full numeric transparency. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires combining data from both Microsoft and Qualcomm and comparing their contributions. The model correctly aggregates (approximately) but fails the comparative analysis, a core part of the question. (4) Correctness score is low due to the critical error in attribution despite partial numerical accuracy. Quantitative accuracy is moderate due to the correct order of magnitude.

In contrast, Schwab disclosed that it manages litigation expense through the purchase of insurance as part of its operational risk management strategy.

The ground truth states that Schwab, not Visa, uses insurance to manage litigation risk. The LLM incorrectly attributes Schwab’s strategy to Visa, reversing the key comparative insight. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires contrasting Visa’s self-absorption of litigation costs with Schwab’s use of insurance as a risk transfer mechanism.

This misattribution undermines the qualitative accuracy and core conclusion.

The combined 'Allowance for equity funds used during construction' is stated as $246 million (NEE: $189M; SO: $57M), but the ground truth is $132 million. This represents a major quantitative discrepancy. Additionally, SO's depreciation and amortization expense is reported as $1,459 million instead of the correct $1,608 million, further reducing accuracy. (2) Calculations: The sum of $189M + $57M = $246M is arithmetically correct, but the inputs are wrong. The comparison to depreciation and amortization is qualitatively correct (i.e., the allowance is much smaller), but the percentages implied (e.g., $132M is 2.7% of NEE’s $2,827M and 3.5% of SO’s $1,608M) cannot be verified from the LLM’s numbers and are not mentioned. The LLM fails to provide the required percentage comparisons present in the original answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across two companies and compare two financial metrics, which shows correct intent. However, due to incorrect source data, the synthesis fails. The model does correctly identify the relevant companies (NEE and SO), metric names, and year (2024), showing proper entity and contextual understanding. (4) Justification: The correctness score is low (3) due to major factual and numerical errors in both the allowance total and SO’s depreciation figure. Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised.

According to the ground truth, the combined income tax expense for Disney (DIS) in 2023 and AT&T (T) in 2023 is $5,604 million. However, the LLM reports Disney’s 2023 tax expense as $1,796 million and AT&T’s as $4,225 million, summing to $6,021 million, which is $417 million higher than the correct total. While Disney’s 2022 tax expense is correctly stated as $1,732 million, the comparison is based on an incorrect combined total. (2) Calculations: The LLM performs the addition correctly ($1,796M + $4,225M = $6,021M), but since the input numbers are wrong, the result is inaccurate. The difference between the combined 2023 expense and Disney’s 2022 expense is reported as $4,289 million, which follows from their incorrect total but does not match the ground truth difference ($5,604M - $1,732M = $3,872M). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the required entities (Disney and AT&T), the correct metric (income tax expense from continuing operations), and the correct years (2023 for both, 2022 for Disney).

In contrast, GILD used estimates of future operating profits as a key input in valuing intangible assets, including assumptions about revenues, market share, and currency-neutral financial performance. This reveals that while DHR experienced real, negative effects from currency movements in 2023, GILD's forecasting process assumes stable or predictable operating profits without explicit adjustment for currency risk, highlighting a gap between actual currency exposure and financial forecasting assumptions in the healthcare sector.",

In contrast, GILD's estimated operating profits used in intangible asset valuations (discussed in the context of impairment charges and fair value assessments) were not directly compared to DHR's currency impact, though GILD's own disclosures highlight currency translation adjustments affecting comprehensive income and the need to manage exchange rate risks through hedging.

However, it fails to state that DHR explicitly reported a negative impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar in 2023 due to higher European sales than expenses—a core point in the original answer. Instead, it says the impact was 'not explicitly detailed,' which contradicts the ground truth. For GILD, the LLM notes currency translation adjustments and hedging but does not accurately reflect that GILD used currency-neutral assumptions in estimating future operating profits for intangible asset valuations, a critical contrast in the original answer. (2) The $1.6 billion figure and 10% depreciation scenario are quantitatively accurate and contextually relevant as sensitivity metrics, though they are forward-looking hypotheticals rather than realized 2023 impacts. No calculation errors are present, but the numbers do not directly answer the comparative impact question. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking currency risk to financial forecasting—but fails to synthesize the key contrast: DHR experienced real negative effects while GILD’s valuation models assume stable, currency-neutral profits. This gap in synthesis undermines the qualitative accuracy.

According to the ground truth, TSLA's weighted average remaining contractual life for nonvested equity awards is 3.51 years, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as 1.8 years. The SBUX value (1.2 years) is correct. This leads to a completely incorrect difference calculation: the LLM computes 1.8 - 1.2 = 0.6 years, whereas the correct difference is 3.51 - 1.2 = 2.31 years. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe—while SBUX’s number is accurate, TSLA’s is wrong, and the resulting difference is off by more than half. The LLM also cites 'outstanding stock options' for TSLA and references a date of September 29, 2024, which mismatches TSLA’s fiscal year-end (December 31, 2024), further undermining accuracy. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing two companies’ metrics and computing a difference—but fails in multi-hop synthesis because it pulls incorrect data for TSLA, possibly confusing 'outstanding' with 'nonvested' or misreading the source document.

      "original_answer": "AMT's lease structure, which includes fixed escalation clauses, financial penalties for early termination, and minimal residual value risk due to multi-tenancy and long-term site usability, reduces financial risk from tenant lease performance. In contrast, SPG faces higher financial risk because its retail tenants are vulnerable to reduced consumer foot traffic from safety concerns, e-commerce competition, and public health crises, all of which could directly impact SPG's occupancy levels, lease rates, and overage rent collection.",
      "llm_answer": "The lease structures of AMT and SPG differ in key ways that shape their exposure to tenant‑related financial risk. AMT’s leases are typically longer‑term, include rent escalations and penalties for early termination, and often require tenants to meet service‑level obligations (e.g., power availability), which reduces the likelihood of abrupt lease breaks and provides a more predictable cash flow. In contrast, SPG’s leases—especially those tied to retail anchors—are more vulnerable to tenant bankruptcies, closures, or rent‑default risk because they rely heavily on a smaller number of large retail tenants and lack the same escalation or penalty provisions. Consequently, AMT’s financial risk from tenant performance is generally lower and more stable, whereas SPG faces heightened risk of rent loss and costly re‑tenanting if its tenants underperform or vacate.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: AMT’s lease structure includes fixed escalations, penalties for early termination, and multi-tenancy that reduces risk, while SPG faces higher risk due to reliance on retail tenants vulnerable to external shocks like e-commerce and foot traffic declines. The LLM correctly identifies AMT’s stable cash flows and lower re-tenanting risk versus SPG’s exposure to tenant bankruptcies, closures, and rent defaults. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in lease structure (escalations, penalties, tenancy type) and links them logically to financial risk exposure for both companies. It correctly infers that AMT’s structure mitigates risk while SPG’s reliance on large retail tenants increases vulnerability. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the LLM omits specific mention of 'overage rent collection' and 'public health crises' as noted in the original answer, which are relevant to SPG’s risk profile.

(1) On correctness: The LLM incorrectly states that Caterpillar excludes 'employee separations, contract terminations, long-lived asset impairments' — these are not mentioned in the ground truth for CAT in 2021. Instead, the original answer specifies that CAT excluded costs related to accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, project management, equipment relocation, and building demolition. These specific items are entirely missing from the LLM response. Additionally, the LLM claims Honeywell excludes 'only general corporate unallocated expenses, interest, stock compensation, pension and postretirement items, repositioning and other charges, and other items—not restructuring costs per se.' However, the ground truth states that Honeywell *does* exclude repositioning and other charges (which are restructuring-related), so saying it excludes 'not restructuring costs per se' is misleading and contradicts the original. (2) Quantitative accuracy: There are no numerical values in the question or answer, so this aspect is not applicable; no errors in numbers or dates. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM attempts to compare CAT and HON's approaches, which is correct in structure, but the synthesis is flawed due to incorrect attribution of excluded costs. It fails to accurately represent CAT’s 2021-specific policy and mischaracterizes HON’s approach as excluding *only* non-restructuring items when in fact repositioning (a restructuring cost) is explicitly excluded. (4) Contextual relevance: The answer stays on topic and addresses both companies and the concept of segment profit exclusions, so it is relevant. However, due to key omissions and misstatements in the specific costs excluded by CAT and the nature of HON’s exclusions, the qualitative accuracy and overall correctness are significantly reduced.

      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, ConocoPhillips' 2021 debt-to-capital ratio was 31% (page 54), while ExxonMobil's 2021 net debt-to-capital ratio was 18.9% (page 73). This means ConocoPhillips' ratio was 12.1 percentage points higher than ExxonMobil's. The difference indicates ConocoPhillips maintained a more leveraged capital structure with a greater proportion of debt relative to equity compared to ExxonMobil, which had a lower net debt-to-capital ratio reflecting a stronger equity position relative to its debt burden.",

The calculated difference of 12.1 percentage points is accurate (31 - 18.9 = 12.1). (2) All numeric values and calculations are correct, with proper decimal precision and percentage units. Format variations (e.g., '12.1 percentage points') are semantically equivalent and acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two different companies (COP and XOM), extracts the relevant financial metrics from the same year (2021), computes the difference, and interprets the implication regarding capital structure and leverage. (4) The qualitative interpretation aligns with the ground truth—highlighting that COP had a more leveraged capital structure and greater debt proportion compared to XOM, which implies higher financial risk. The mention of XOM's 'stronger equity position' adds slightly more context but does not deviate from the original meaning. All parts of the question are addressed: the quantitative difference and its implication on capital structure. Therefore, all scores are maximized.",

      "original_answer": "At MDLZ, higher net pricing contributed to an increase in Adjusted Operating Income margin from 15.8% in 2022 to 15.9% in 2023, despite being partially offset by higher raw material and advertising costs. At PEP, effective net pricing helped offset significant declines in operating profit caused by the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs, although it was insufficient to prevent an overall 19% decline in operating profit for the QFNA segment. Thus, while net pricing positively supported margins at MDLZ, its impact at PEP was more defensive, cushioning the blow from larger negative factors.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, net pricing contributed positively to Adjusted Operating Income margin at Mondelez International (MDLZ), as highlighted by the document’s discussion of “higher net pricing” as a key driver of margin expansion (e.g., operating income margin rose from 11.2% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023, with adjusted operating income margin increasing from 15.8% to 15.9%). This pricing benefit helped offset other headwinds such as higher input costs and commodity price increases. In contrast, PepsiCo (PEP) relied on “effective net pricing” to partially offset operating profit declines, as noted in its 2023 10-K where operating profit fell 52% due to factors like the Juice Transaction gain and impairment charges, but effective net pricing helped mitigate the decline. Thus, while MDLZ’s net pricing directly improved its margin, PEP used effective net pricing as a mitigating factor against broader profit declines.",

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It incorrectly states that MDLZ's operating income margin rose from 11.2% in 2022 to 15.3% in 2023, which contradicts the ground truth (Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.8% to 15.9%). The 11.2% and 15.3% figures are factually wrong and not supported by the original answer. Additionally, the LLM claims PEP's operating profit fell 52% due to the 'Juice Transaction gain and impairment charges', but the ground truth attributes the QFNA segment's 19% decline to the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs — a major discrepancy in both magnitude and cause. (2) The only correct quantitative detail is the accurate mention of MDLZ’s adjusted operating income margin rising from 15.8% to 15.9%, which matches the ground truth. However, the erroneous 11.2% to 15.3% base margin misrepresents the context. The 52% decline at PEP is entirely incorrect and unsupported. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning structure is sound: the model attempts the correct multi-hop comparison between MDLZ and PEP, identifying that net pricing helped MDLZ expand margins while serving as a defensive tool at PEP. It correctly identifies the defensive role of pricing at PEP and links it to offsetting profit declines. However, it misattributes the cause of PEP’s decline and exaggerates the magnitude, undermining the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is strong — the answer addresses the comparative role of net pricing in margin impact and profit protection, aligning with the question’s intent. Despite correct framing and some accurate terminology (e.g., 'effective net pricing', 'adjusted operating income margin'), the severe numerical errors and mischaracterization of key events (Quaker Recall vs. Juice Transaction) significantly reduce factual reliability. Hence, partial credit is given for correct conceptual understanding but docked heavily on quantitative accuracy.",

Additionally, the LLM answer fails to include any year-over-year trend analysis for either company, which is a key component of the original answer and the question's intent—comparing changes in performance over time. The original answer notes that AXP's yield increased from 12.4% to 12.8% and BAC's declined from 2.73% to 2.30%, but the LLM omits these trends entirely. (2) The quantitative error in BAC's yield (2.20% vs. 2.30%) is minor but still incorrect. More importantly, the absence of YoY changes means the model fails to support its qualitative claims with trend data, undermining the comparative analysis. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—highlighting AXP’s premium card model and higher yield makes sense contextually—but it lacks multi-hop synthesis because it does not connect the performance to changes over time. The conclusion about AXP having higher profitability is supported, but the absence of trend data means the answer does not fully reflect differences in performance *dynamics*.

The ground truth states NEE's noncurrent derivative assets are $1,935 million and DUK's are $57 million, resulting in a difference of $1,878 million. However, the LLM reports $1,790 million for NEE and $15 million for DUK, calculating a difference of $1,775 million—both figures are incorrect. These discrepancies affect the core quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation logic (subtracting DUK's value from NEE's) is correct, but the inputs are wrong, leading to an inaccurate result. Number formats are acceptable ($1,790 million is properly formatted), but the values themselves do not match the ground truth. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies commodity contracts as the primary contributing category to the difference, which aligns with the ground truth.

However, it fails to mention Level 3 commodity contract assets specifically for NEE ($2,094 million) or DUK's $3 million under Progress Energy, missing key supporting detail.

NEE's significantly larger prepaid amount suggests a more overfunded pension position compared to SO, which still has unamortized regulatory assets tied to postretirement benefits.

This is a significant overstatement by over $1.9 billion. NEE's figure of $2,496 million is correct. (2) The calculation and comparison are therefore invalid. The LLM implies a relatively close difference between NEE and SO, when in fact NEE's prepaid amount is over 150 times larger than SO's. This undermines the entire analysis. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in interpreting a larger prepaid amount as indicating stronger funding, but it mischaracterizes SO's position. The ground truth highlights that SO has regulatory assets subject to amortization, indicating ongoing legacy liabilities, whereas the LLM incorrectly treats SO as having a substantial prepaid asset. The LLM's conclusion about SO having a 'conservatively funded' position is misleading given SO's actual underfunded status implied by regulatory assets.

Thus, the correct combined total exceeds $45.455 billion, not $43.5 billion. (2) The LLM incorrectly characterizes AMT’s debt as heavily foreign-currency-denominated and tied to EURIBOR, while the ground truth indicates AMT’s debt is primarily dollar-denominated and linked to major acquisitions. Conversely, it wrongly claims SPG uses primarily U.S. dollar facilities and LIBOR/SOFR-based pricing, when in fact SPG has significant EUR, JPY, and MXN liabilities, indicating a more internationally diversified debt structure.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize data across entities (FDX vs GD), misattributes financial figures, and draws the opposite conclusion regarding which company has a higher proportion of near-term debt. The required comparison of relative debt burden in 2025 is fundamentally flawed. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topic (debt due in 2025 for FDX and GD) and attempts to compare proportions, but due to severe factual and logical errors, it conveys the opposite of the truth. The omission of total debt figures and correct percentages undermines completeness and correctness.",

According to the ground truth, Disney's year-over-year (YoY) change in Total Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities was an increase of $399 million (from $20,671M to $21,070M in 2024), while AT&T's was a decrease of $6,792 million (from $42,644M in 2022 to $35,852M in 2023). The combined absolute difference in their YoY changes is |399| + |−6,792| = 7,191 million. However, the LLM reports a combined change of $1,806 million and falsely claims Disney’s change was $1,591 million, which is not supported by any data. These numbers are entirely inaccurate. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM invents numbers not present in the original data (e.g., $1,591M for Disney), misrepresents the direction and magnitude of changes, and performs incorrect calculations. The correct combined difference is $7,191 million, not $1,806 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly extract or synthesize data across the two companies and their respective fiscal years. It uses incorrect years (possibly mismatching reporting periods) and fails to compute the actual YoY deltas. It also does not recognize that AT&T’s larger change is due to a large decrease, not an increase. (4) Despite the factual errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right metric, companies, and question structure, and correctly identifies AT&T as having the larger change, albeit based on wrong numbers. This prevents a score of 0. However, due to major factual and computational errors, the correctness score is very low at 2.",

However, it incorrectly states that both companies use '12-month average prices' when the ground truth specifies 'first-day-of-the-month average prices'. This is a critical factual error, as the pricing methodologies are distinct and explicitly disclosed in the 10-Ks. The ground truth emphasizes that the use of first-day-of-the-month prices introduces variability due to discrete pricing points, whereas the LLM attributes variability to a methodology (12-month average) that neither company uses for this calculation. (2) Quantitatively, the 10% discount rate is accurate, and no other numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, years) are misstated—though the LLM omits the specific reference to 2022 10-K filings, which is part of the original answer. The absence of incorrect numeric values keeps quantitative accuracy moderate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking two companies’ practices on discount rates is correct—but fails on the pricing methodology, breaking the synthesis required for full accuracy. The LLM appears to conflate SEC standardized measure rules (which allow for 12-month averages in some contexts) with actual company disclosures, which specify first-day-of-the-month pricing for COP and XOM in 2022.

In contrast, GILD's deferred tax liability is influenced by the acquisition of MYR, where the net deferred tax liability was based on differences between financial statement and tax basis of acquired assets, including the $845 million finite-lived intangible asset for Hepcludex (amortized over 10 years) and $1.19 billion acquired IPR&D.

However, the LLM mischaracterizes the comparison with GILD. It states that DHR's trend is 'consistent with' Gilead’s tax treatment of acquired intangibles, which contradicts the ground truth: DHR’s reduction in deferred tax liability reflects a decreasing burden, while GILD’s position is shaped by specific acquisition-related intangibles (Hepcludex amortization, IPR&D) and non-deductible goodwill, leading to different long-term tax implications. The LLM fails to highlight this contrast. (2) All numbers are correct: $2.958 billion to $2.192 billion is indeed a $766 million decrease. The format variation (billion vs million) is acceptable and accurately interpreted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the model correctly retrieves DHR’s deferred tax change and references GILD’s intangible asset treatment, it incorrectly synthesizes the relationship as consistent, when the ground truth emphasizes a difference in tax treatment implications—especially regarding non-deductible goodwill at GILD versus DHR’s overall liability reduction.

In contrast, TGT reports Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP metric that excludes certain items but does not specify any similar adjustment related to extreme pricing in Argentina or disclose a comparable inflation-driven pricing exclusion. This reveals that MDLZ takes a more granular and region-specific approach to Adjusted EPS adjustments, tailoring its non-GAAP exclusions to macroeconomic conditions, while TGT’s Adjusted EPS appears to follow a more general exclusionary framework without explicit mention of hyperinflationary market adjustments.",

Consequently, MDLZ’s disclosure strategy isolates and quantifies the impact of hyper‑inflation‑driven price spikes as a separate “currency‑related item” to preserve the comparability of its constant‑currency growth measures, while Target relies on a broader, more generic treatment of pricing and does not make a distinct non‑GAAP adjustment for extreme price movements.

BAC's definition of Net Interest Yield is Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets, as reflected in its consolidated financial statements showing a 2.64% yield for its consumer segment in 2024.

It also correctly states BAC's definition of Net Interest Yield as net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. However, the LLM introduces a BAC consumer segment yield of 2.64% for 2024, which is not present in the original answer and not required to answer the question—this is extraneous but not factually incorrect. (2) All numbers related to AXP ($10,931 million, $85,264 million, 12.8%) are consistent with the ground truth, though the LLM does not explicitly show the calculation (which is acceptable). The BAC yield figure (2.64%) is additional and not in the original; while plausible, it was not part of the ground truth and could mislead if inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts AXP’s portfolio-specific yield metric with BAC’s broader asset-based definition, highlighting the lack of direct comparability. It synthesizes the differing scopes of the metrics appropriately. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original in intent and key facts, with slightly more detail on BAC’s yield. The core correctness is high, but the addition of an unsupported specific BAC yield value (2.64%) prevents a perfect score, as it introduces unverified data.

Similarly, TMO's 2024 net proceeds are reported as $1,204 million in the ground truth, but the LLM states $204 million. This results in a drastically incorrect combined total: $28,981 million (correct) vs. $6,146 million (LLM). The LLM also fails to compute the correct difference between the combined proceeds and TMO's 2024 debt repayment ($3,607 million), omitting the $25,374 million excess stated in the original answer. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s sum of $5,942M + $204M = $6,146M is arithmetically correct, but based on wrong inputs.

      "original_answer": "AMT focuses on increasing occupancy of its communications real estate by leasing additional space on existing towers, anticipating growing demand driven by 4G densification and 5G deployments in the U.S. and advanced network technologies internationally. This strategy is expected to generate incremental returns by utilizing existing capacity or upgrading towers with modest investment. In contrast, SPG's retail real estate revenue depends heavily on occupancy rates, which were negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer willingness to visit properties and increased reliance on e-commerce. SPG faces challenges in renewing leases or re-leasing available space on favorable terms due to deteriorating market conditions and tenant financial instability, making it more difficult to increase revenue from existing properties. Therefore, while AMT's strategy is positioned for growth through increased occupancy, SPG's strategy is constrained by external risks affecting occupancy and tenant viability.",
      "llm_answer": "The differing dependence on occupancy rates shapes AMT’s and SPG’s revenue‑growth strategies: AMT emphasizes boosting the utilization of its existing communications sites—leveraging the high incremental margins from adding tenants or equipment to drive strong, recurring revenue—while SPG focuses on revitalizing its retail portfolio by improving occupancy and rent levels in its properties, aiming to increase revenue from existing real‑estate assets through higher tenant demand and rent recovery.",

(1) What was correct: The answer correctly identifies that AMT focuses on increasing utilization of existing communications sites to drive revenue, which aligns with the ground truth about leasing additional space on towers due to 4G/5G demand. It also correctly notes that SPG aims to improve occupancy and rent levels in its retail properties. The entities (AMT, SPG), the general time frame (2022 implied), and the focus on occupancy are accurate. There are no numeric values in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. (2) What was incorrect: The LLM answer omits critical context from the ground truth—specifically, that SPG’s occupancy challenges were driven by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced consumer foot traffic, e-commerce competition, and tenant financial instability. Instead, it presents SPG’s strategy in an optimistic light (‘revitalizing,’ ‘rent recovery’) without acknowledging the external constraints and deteriorating market conditions that limit its ability to grow revenue. This omission distorts the comparative analysis: while AMT is positioned for growth, SPG is constrained, but the LLM answer minimizes this asymmetry. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The model synthesizes the differing strategies but fails to fully integrate the causal factors behind each company’s occupancy dynamics. The reasoning is plausible but superficial, missing the risk-laden environment for SPG that is central to the original answer. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is 6 due to core factual alignment but significant omission of critical context affecting SPG. Quantitative accuracy is 10 because no numbers are involved. Qualitative accuracy is 6 due to incomplete and somewhat misleading reasoning about SPG’s strategic position.

This shows that while both companies report prepaid pension costs, Southern Company explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from these figures, reflecting a more segmented approach to regulatory asset reporting post-acquisition.

In contrast, Southern Company (SO) presents a much smaller regulatory‑asset balance of $203 million (including $13 million of prior‑service cost and $(216) million of net gain) that is also deferred, but its unamortized amounts are recorded directly in regulatory assets (liabilities) rather than in AOCI, reflecting a more aggressive amortization schedule and a distinct regulatory‑asset accounting treatment for its postretirement benefit plans.",

However, the LLM claims SO has a regulatory-asset balance of $203 million (with $13 million prior-service cost and $(216) million net gain), which is not supported by the original answer and introduces numbers not present in the ground truth. Similarly, the LLM states that NextEra Energy (NEE) has $221 million of unamortized regulatory assets, but this figure is absent from the original answer—no dollar amounts were provided for NEE in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: both companies’ figures are either fabricated or misattributed. The original answer emphasizes SO’s exclusion of specific amounts from prepaid pension costs due to acquisition-related accounting, but the LLM invents detailed breakdowns (e.g., $(216) million net gain) with no basis in the source. There are no calculations in the original to verify, but the LLM introduces false precision.

      "original_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production, which results in a more revenue-aligned expense pattern. In contrast, Netflix expenses participations and residuals in line with an accelerated amortization pattern, expecting more upfront viewing, with over 90% of a content asset amortized within four years.

      "llm_answer": "The difference in amortization timing—Disney’s ratio‑of‑current‑period‑revenues‑to‑estimated‑remaining‑revenues versus Netflix’s accelerated amortization—means Disney spreads its participation and residual costs more evenly across the product’s life, while Netflix front‑loads those expenses, resulting in higher expense recognition early in the asset’s cycle.

The answer accurately conveys that Disney's method results in more variable, revenue-aligned expense timing, whereas Netflix recognizes higher expenses early in the product life cycle. However, the LLM omits a key quantitative detail present in the original answer: Netflix amortizes over 90% of a content asset within four years. This specific metric is important for precision and completeness, especially in a financial comparison context. While the qualitative reasoning is sound and entities (Disney, Netflix, participations, residuals, amortization patterns) are correctly identified and contrasted, the absence of the 'over 90% within four years' benchmark reduces quantitative accuracy and completeness. The multi-hop synthesis—linking accounting policy to expense timing and earnings impact—is logically sound and relevant. Wording differs but maintains semantic equivalence on the general pattern, though the lack of specific time-bound amortization for Netflix limits full factual parity.

According to the ground truth, Amgen's 'Other income (expense), net' for 2024 is $506 million (correctly stated), but Thermo Fisher's 'Other income/(expense)' is $(65) million, not $12 million as claimed. The LLM incorrectly calculates the combined total as $518 million ($506M + $12M), whereas the correct sum is $441 million ($506M + (-$65M)). (2) The calculation is therefore fundamentally wrong, and the use of $12 million for Thermo Fisher has no basis in the provided truth. Additionally, the LLM falsely states that both companies have the same pre-tax income of $7,037 million, which is not supported by the original answer and introduces fabricated data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: while the question asks how the aggregated outcome affects each company’s consolidated income before taxes, the LLM does not correctly analyze the opposing effects—Amgen’s positive contribution vs. Thermo Fisher’s negative impact. Instead, it incorrectly implies both contribute positively and invents matching pre-tax incomes. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right metrics and companies and attempts to discuss pre-tax income impact, but the severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies—especially the wrong numbers, incorrect total, and fabricated financials—drastically reduce correctness.

The ground truth states COP's 2022 total discounted future net cash flows were $57,695 million, but the LLM reports $52,695 million (off by $5 billion). For XOM's 2019 discounted future net cash flows, the correct value is $34,542 million, but the LLM states $17,536 million (less than half the correct amount). The noncontrolling interest portion is reported as $2,862 million by the LLM versus the correct $1,064 million. These errors propagate into the sum and final comparison: the correct sum of XOM's figures is $35,606 million, but the LLM calculates $20,398 million. The correct difference is $22,089 million, but the LLM reports $25,159 million initially and then contradicts itself with 'roughly $32,300 million', showing internal inconsistency. (2) All calculations are incorrect due to wrong inputs and arithmetic errors. The LLM's stated sum ($17,536 + $2,862 = $20,398) is mathematically correct, but based on false data. The final comparison ($52,695 - $20,398 = $32,297) contradicts the earlier $25,159 figure, indicating confusion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is present—identifying two companies, two years, and combining cash flows with noncontrolling interest—but the execution fails due to incorrect data retrieval. The model appears to understand the required synthesis but pulls incorrect values from the knowledge base.

How might analysts interpret the difference in debt valuation approaches between CL and PM in terms of financial reporting conservatism and interest expense recognition?",
      "original_answer": "Analysts may interpret CL's reporting, where the carrying value of long-term debt ($8,239 million) exceeds its fair value ($7,862 million), as indicative of debt issued at a premium or a decline in market interest rates, which increases the fair value of fixed-rate debt. This suggests CL's financial reporting reflects a more conservative approach by maintaining a higher carrying value on the balance sheet. In contrast, PM's fair value step-up adjustment for inventories ($146 million) and the $(107) million purchase price adjustment amortized into interest expense suggest that PM's debt was initially recorded at a discount post-acquisition, leading to higher interest expense recognition over time. This indicates PM's approach reflects the impact of acquisition accounting on interest costs, which may affect earnings volatility. Therefore, the difference in valuation approaches reflects contrasting capital structure strategies and reporting conservatism, with CL showing a market-based valuation decline and PM experiencing acquisition-driven expense increases.",

In contrast, Philip Morris amortizes a $(107) million purchase‑price adjustment to interest expense over the life of its debt, which can smooth earnings but also reflects a more aggressive fair‑value‑based accounting for debt.

The $146 million fair value step-up for inventories at PM is missing, which is a factual omission affecting completeness. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no calculation errors, and number formats match or are acceptably varied. The comparison of carrying value > fair value for CL is correctly interpreted. (3) The reasoning correctly infers that CL’s higher carrying value suggests conservative reporting, and PM’s amortization of a negative adjustment implies higher interest expense recognition over time. However, the LLM mischaracterizes PM’s approach as 'more aggressive fair-value-based accounting for debt'—this is misleading because the adjustment stems from acquisition accounting (not debt revaluation per se), and the term 'aggressive' contradicts the conservative nature of amortizing step-ups. The original answer correctly frames this as an effect of purchase accounting impacting interest expense, not a deliberate accounting policy choice. The multi-hop synthesis between debt valuation, fair value, and interest expense recognition is partially sound but lacks the nuance of acquisition-related adjustments.

For group-monetized content (e.g., content used on DTC services or Linear Networks), Disney amortizes the costs based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line pattern. In contrast, Netflix also capitalizes production overhead for produced content and amortizes it over the shorter of the contractual window or estimated period of use (typically up to ten years), using an accelerated basis driven by expected viewing patterns. Netflix's amortization is not tied to revenue ratios but rather to viewing behavior, with over 90% of a title's cost typically amortized within four years. This reflects a difference in monetization focus: Disney aligns amortization with revenue realization, while Netflix aligns it with consumption patterns.",

Netflix, as indicated by its focus on group monetization for DTC streaming services and the use of \"projected usage\" for amortization, follows a similar group-based approach but emphasizes projected usage patterns rather than revenue ratios, with amortization typically accelerating or occurring straight-line over the content's useful life or expected airing seasons.

While it mentions accelerated amortization, it fails to include this precise percentage and timeframe, reducing quantitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning is mostly sound: the model correctly identifies the multi-hop contrast between revenue-based (Disney) and usage-based (Netflix) amortization and links it to monetization models.

(4) Despite the ground truth claiming the sum is 'greater than', which is incorrect arithmetically, the LLM correctly identifies it as 'lower than'. Thus, the LLM answer is factually and quantitatively more accurate. However, because the evaluation must be based on alignment with the provided ground truth (even if flawed), the correctness score is reduced slightly due to the discrepancy in the conclusion, though the reasoning and numbers are superior. Quantitative accuracy is high due to correct numbers and math. Qualitative accuracy is marked down because the model contradicts the ground truth on a logical point that the ground truth got wrong.

HD reported $250 million in amortization of leased assets, while TSLA reported $415 million. This indicates that TSLA had a significantly higher focus or reliance on finance leases compared to HD in that fiscal year.",

This reflects HD’s relatively conservative finance‑lease strategy—recognizing amortization over shorter lease terms and lower discount rates—while TSLA employs a more aggressive approach, extending lease terms and using higher discount rates, which results in larger amortization expense and a greater proportion of finance‑lease assets on its balance sheet.",

      "original_answer": "COST evaluates long-lived assets for impairment annually or when events suggest unrecoverable carrying values, using estimated future undiscounted cash flows and market appraisals for fair value. It reported no impairment charges in 2022. MO, on the other hand, tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually using a combination of qualitative and quantitative assessments, including a discounted cash flow model with a 10% weighted-average discount rate and a 2% perpetual growth rate. MO also reported no impairment charges in 2022. Both companies avoided impairment charges due to fair values exceeding carrying values, though MO emphasized sensitivity to assumptions like regulatory changes and consumer preferences, while COST focused on facility-level cash flow recoverability.",
      "llm_answer": "Both COST and MO applied a two‑step quantitative impairment test for goodwill and indefinite‑lived intangible assets, using discounted cash‑flow (income‑approach) valuations that relied on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).  For each reporting unit, the analysis incorporated assumptions about future sales volume, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates (approximately 10 % for COST’s reporting‑unit test and 17‑19 % for MO’s JUUL valuation).  Because the projected cash flows and fair values substantially exceeded the carrying amounts, neither company recorded an impairment charge in 2022.  The absence of impairment stemmed from management’s expectations of continued profitability, stable market conditions, and the absence of triggering adverse regulatory, litigation or macro‑economic events that would have materially altered those key assumptions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies. First, it incorrectly states that both COST and MO used a two-step quantitative test for goodwill — in reality, the ground truth indicates that MO used a combination of qualitative and quantitative assessments, not necessarily a two-step process. More critically, the LLM claims COST used a 10% discount rate in its reporting-unit test, but the ground truth does not specify any discount rate for COST, only for MO (10% weighted-average discount rate). Additionally, the LLM introduces a 17–19% discount rate for MO’s JUUL valuation, which is not mentioned in the ground truth at all. These numbers are fabricated or hallucinated. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the LLM invents specific discount rates for COST and a JUUL-specific valuation for MO that are unsupported by the original answer. The ground truth only confirms MO used a 10% weighted-average discount rate and a 2% perpetual growth rate — the LLM omits the 2% growth rate and replaces it with unspecified assumptions. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that it correctly identifies both companies reported no impairment charges in 2022 and links this to fair values exceeding carrying values. However, it misrepresents the methodologies: COST evaluates long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flows and market appraisals, not discounted cash flow models for goodwill, which the LLM incorrectly implies. The LLM conflates goodwill testing with long-lived asset testing and misattributes valuation techniques. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses impairment testing, assumptions, and the absence of charges, but it fails to distinguish between long-lived assets and goodwill as required by the question. The original answer differentiates COST’s approach (long-lived assets via undiscounted cash flows) from MO’s (goodwill and intangibles via DCF), while the LLM incorrectly applies DCF models to both for goodwill. Thus, while the conclusion of no impairment is correct, the reasoning and factual basis are significantly flawed.",

The ORCL value is reported as $6.96 billion and TXN's repurchase as $293 million, which sum to $7.253 billion. The ground truth is $7.293 billion, indicating a small discrepancy of $0.04 billion ($40 million). This difference likely stems from a rounding or data extraction error in one of the inputs or the summation. (2) The individual figures are very close to the ground truth values—$6.96 billion for ORCL and $293 million for TXN appear accurate based on typical disclosures, and their sum should be $7.253 billion, not $7.293 billion. However, since the expected answer is $7.293 billion, there is a minor quantitative inaccuracy, possibly due to the ORCL availability being slightly higher (e.g., $7.00 billion) in the source data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies two separate entities (ORCL and TXN), extracts the correct metric (repurchase availability and cash used), and performs the correct operation (addition).

      "original_answer": "C has a modeled FX volatility input of 13.17% for its trading account liabilities, indicating a moderate sensitivity to foreign exchange movements in this category. PYPL, on the other hand, explicitly calls out FX fluctuations as a key risk factor for its international operations, noting that such movements could significantly impact its business due to the global nature of its revenue base. While C quantifies its FX exposure in trading liabilities, PYPL emphasizes the operational and financial risks without providing a specific quantitative measure, suggesting that PYPL's business model is more broadly exposed to FX volatility through its international operations rather than through specific financial instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "C's exposure to FX volatility at 13.17% for trading account liabilities is markedly higher than PYPL's disclosed foreign‑exchange risk, which is limited to a general statement that cross‑border trade and currency fluctuations affect its international business. The 13.17% figure—derived from the fair‑value sensitivity analysis of C's trading‑account liabilities—indicates that a relatively small movement in exchange rates would have a material impact on C's financial position, whereas PYPL's disclosures do not quantify a comparable sensitivity and therefore suggest far lower direct exposure to FX movements.

In contrast, the ground truth emphasizes that PYPL's exposure is broader and more operationally significant due to its global revenue base, even though it lacks a specific percentage. The LLM misinterprets the absence of a number as evidence of lower risk, whereas the original answer suggests PYPL may be more exposed overall due to the scale and nature of its international operations. This reflects a flawed multi-hop reasoning process: while both entities are exposed to FX risk, the nature differs (financial instruments vs. operational exposure), and the LLM fails to synthesize this nuance. The answer is contextually relevant and addresses the comparison question, but the conclusion inverts the correct implication.

      "original_answer": "AT&T (T) does not amortize its FCC wireless licenses and instead tests them annually for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach on an aggregate basis. However, AT&T does amortize its wireless licenses in Mexico over a 25-year average economic life. In contrast, Verizon (VZ) treats its wireless licenses as indefinite-lived intangible assets and also does not amortize them, testing them annually for impairment. The difference in amortization policy means that AT&T recognizes periodic depreciation expense for its Mexican licenses, which affects earnings, while Verizon does not record any amortization expense for its licenses. This results in differing financial impacts on asset valuation and income statements, with AT&T experiencing a gradual reduction in asset value over time for Mexican licenses, while Verizon’s wireless license values remain on the balance sheet unless impaired.",

It claims CMCSA's sports-related programming and production costs fell by 23% and DIS by 9%, but the ground truth does not provide any such percentage declines for sports-related costs specifically. Instead, CMCSA's overall programming and production costs decreased due to the absence of major sports events in 2023 (like the FIFA World Cup and Super Bowl in 2022), while DIS saw a 1% *increase* in total programming and production costs, not a 9% decline. The LLM incorrectly states DIS had a decline, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) The dollar figures and percentages in the LLM answer are unsupported: no 23% or 9% figures appear in the original answer, and there is no mention of cricket rights or amortization of film/TV content in the context of sports programming costs. The original answer notes Hulu's costs increased by $317M (from $8,265M to $8,582M), but the LLM omits this key data point and instead fabricates aggregate percentage changes.

It incorrectly states that the combined increase is $1,589 million, which is actually NVDA's 2023 value, not the increase. The correct combined increase is $183 million ($76M for AMD + $107M for NVDA). The LLM also misattributes NVDA's increase as $76 million, but this is AMD's actual increase, not NVDA's. NVDA's increase was $107 million (from $3,807M to $3,914M), not the $1,513M to $1,589M cited, which are AMD's figures. (2) The LLM confuses the companies' data: it assigns AMD's values ($1,513M to $1,589M) to NVDA, reversing the entities. This leads to a completely incorrect calculation and conclusion. The correct increases are AMD: $76M, NVDA: $107M, so NVDA had greater growth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly extract or synthesize data for both companies. It claims AMD's data is missing, but in the ground truth, both companies' data are available and required. The model incorrectly assumes only NVDA's data is present and builds a flawed answer on that.

(1) The combined decrease in total current assets is reported as $2,705 million, which is off by $45 million from the ground truth value of $2,750 million. This discrepancy likely stems from rounding or source data variation in the underlying filings, but the individual components—Costco’s $1,633 million decline and Altria’s $1,072 million decline—are both correct and sum to $2,705 million. (2) The drop in Costco’s cash and cash equivalents is correctly stated as $3,794 million, and it is accurately compared to Altria’s total current asset decline of $1,072 million, with the correct conclusion that Costco’s cash drop exceeds Altria’s entire current asset decrease. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data across two companies (Costco and Altria), two years (2023 to 2024), and two metrics (total current assets and cash and cash equivalents), then performs a valid comparison.

These specific numbers are fabricated. For Disney, the LLM incorrectly states that Hulu/Disney+ programming costs were $13,959M in 2023 and $14,081M in 2024 (a 1% increase, not decrease), but the ground truth shows Hulu alone increased from $8,265M to $8,582M (4% increase), and Disney+ decreased from $5,694M to $5,499M (3% decrease). The LLM incorrectly aggregates or mislabels these figures, and the claim of a 1% decrease is false. Additionally, the LLM references 2024 data as if directly comparable to Comcast’s 2023 data, but the question asks for 2023 filings, and Disney’s data is reported as 2024 vs 2023, creating a mismatch in timeframes.

The conclusion that Comcast is 'aggressively cutting' while Disney is 'maintaining investment' is partially aligned with the ground truth’s interpretation, but it is based on incorrect numbers and misattributed trends. The ground truth notes Disney increased spending on Hulu while decreasing it on Disney+, a nuance entirely missed by the LLM.

It incorrectly states that JNJ had $1.88 billion in Immunology revenue and LLY had $16.75 billion, which is the opposite of the ground truth. JNJ’s 2021 Immunology revenue was $16.8 billion (correctly approximated as $16,750 million), while LLY’s was $1.88 billion (correctly approximated as $1,881.8 million). However, the LLM swaps the companies in its summary, attributing LLY’s revenue to JNJ and vice versa. (2) Calculations: The growth rate for JNJ (11.3%) is correctly calculated based on $16,750M (2021) vs $15,055M (2020). LLY’s growth rate is calculated as 36.7% using $1,881.8M / $1,372.3M, which is close to the ground truth 37.1% (based on $1.88B / $1.37B), so this is acceptable with minor rounding differences. However, the combined revenue is not explicitly calculated in the LLM answer, and the values are misattributed, so the $18.68 billion total cannot be derived from the presented numbers due to the company mix-up. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to cite specific 10-K pages and rows, showing an effort at source tracing, but fails in entity alignment—mixing up which company had which revenue. This breaks the synthesis across sources. The comparison of growth rates is numerically plausible (11.3% vs 36.7%), but because the companies are swapped in the narrative, the conclusion about which company grew faster is implied incorrectly. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4) due to critical entity-number mismatches despite some accurate raw numbers. Quantitative accuracy is moderate (5) because individual figures are close but misassigned. Qualitative accuracy is low (4) due to flawed reasoning in entity mapping.

In contrast, Tesla does not disclose a present value for its operating leases and instead reports gross lease receivables of $4,577 million. This difference in disclosure limits the comparability of their lease obligations because HD's figure reflects the time value of money, while Tesla's gross amount does not, making direct financial comparisons between the two companies less meaningful without further adjustments.",

Consequently, investors cannot directly compare the magnitude of the obligations because Tesla’s gross figure does not reflect the time value of money or the present‑value discounting that HD uses.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the core issue — that HD reports operating lease liabilities at present value while Tesla only discloses gross lease receivables, which reduces comparability. The reasoning about the time value of money and the impact on financial comparability is sound and relevant. However, there is a critical error in the quantitative data: the LLM states HD's 2021 operating lease liabilities as $2,039 million, which is both the wrong year (2021 vs required 2022) and the wrong amount (ground truth is $6,183 million for 2022). This misstatement severely undermines factual accuracy. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly refers to Tesla's 'gross lease receivables' — while Tesla does report $4,577 million in lease-related disclosures, this figure corresponds to gross operating lease *payments* or *commitments*, not receivables (which would imply Tesla is the lessor). The ground truth clarifies Tesla does not disclose a present value and reports gross lease obligations, not receivables. (2) The correct 2022 figures per ground truth are: HD’s present value = $6,183M, total payments = $7,095M, imputed interest = $912M. Tesla’s gross lease obligations = $4,577M. The LLM gets Tesla’s number right in magnitude but mislabels it as 'receivables', a material classification error. HD’s number is entirely incorrect in both amount and year. (3) The multi-hop reasoning — comparing accounting treatments and their effect on comparability — is logically sound and reflects appropriate synthesis between the two companies’ disclosures. The explanation of why present value vs gross amount affects comparability is accurate and well-articulated. (4) The correctness score is 5 due to major quantitative and classification errors, despite strong qualitative reasoning. Quantitative accuracy is low (4) because of wrong HD numbers and mischaracterization of Tesla’s figure. Qualitative accuracy is 7 because the conceptual explanation is strong.

      "question": "How does the use of proved oil and gas reserve estimates impact the depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expense for COP in 2021, and how does this compare to the method XOM uses for amortizing acquisition costs of proved properties?",
      "original_answer": "COP uses the unit-of-production method to calculate DD&A for proved oil and gas properties, which relies on proved oil and gas reserve estimates made by internal reservoir engineers. In 2021, COP reported a net book value of $52 billion for proved oil and gas properties and recorded $7.0 billion in DD&A expense. XOM also uses the unit-of-production method to amortize acquisition costs of proved properties, based on total proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. This shared method highlights a similar dependence on proved reserve estimates to determine asset value depletion, though COP emphasizes internal engineering judgment while XOM outlines a more structured policy tied directly to production volumes.",
      "llm_answer": "The depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense for ConocoPhillips in 2021 is calculated using the unit-of-production method, which relies on proved oil and gas reserve estimates prepared by internal reservoir engineers and reviewed by an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm; these reserve estimates are subject to significant management judgment and are tested by the auditor through evaluation of assumptions, corroborative evidence, and sensitivity analyses. In contrast, ExxonMobil amortizes acquisition costs of proved properties also on a unit-of-production basis but applies a straight-line method when the unit-of-production approach would not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the asset’s economic life, such as for assets with shorter useful lives than the underlying reserves.",

However, it introduces information not present in the original answer—specifically, that reserve estimates are reviewed by an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm and that auditors perform sensitivity analyses—details not mentioned in the ground truth and thus unverifiable. More critically, the LLM incorrectly states that XOM uses a straight-line method when the unit-of-production method would not result in equitable cost allocation, such as for shorter-lived assets. This contradicts the ground truth, which states XOM uses the unit-of-production method based on total proved reserves, with no mention of a straight-line fallback. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM answer omits the key financial figures provided in the ground truth: COP’s $52 billion net book value and $7.0 billion DD&A expense in 2021. These are central to the question’s first part and their absence constitutes a significant factual gap. While no incorrect numbers are stated, the failure to include these materially impacts accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking COP’s DD&A method to reserve estimates and comparing it to XOM’s approach—but the comparison is flawed due to the incorrect characterization of XOM’s policy. The ground truth emphasizes that both companies use the unit-of-production method with reliance on proved reserves, highlighting similarity; the LLM instead suggests a divergence in methodology, undermining the correct synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high, as the response addresses the core concepts of DD&A, reserve estimates, and cross-company comparison. However, the correctness score is reduced to 5 due to missing quantitative data and a significant error in XOM’s amortization method, which affects the validity of the comparison.",

In contrast, MO reports its long-term assets in two distinct categories: 'ABI' and 'Other Investments.' For example, at the end of fiscal 2021, MO reported $190,082 million in long-term assets under ABI and $1,049 million under Other Investments.

Both companies use Level 2 fair value inputs for ABI investments, but COST explicitly details ABI's fair value hierarchy classification (Level 1 for quoted shares, Level 2 for Restricted Shares), whereas MO's disclosure focuses on the investment's carrying amount within its broader equity securities portfolio without specifying the hierarchy level.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in addressing the core of the question. The original answer states that COST categorizes long-term assets under a broad 'other long-term assets' classification, while MO uses two specific categories: 'ABI' and 'Other Investments', with exact figures of $190,082 million and $1,049 million respectively at the end of fiscal 2021. The LLM answer instead focuses on 'Investment in ABI' and 'JUUL' under equity investments, which misrepresents MO's actual categorization. MO does not report ABI under 'Investments in Equity Securities'—rather, 'ABI' is a major component of its long-term assets as a standalone category. Additionally, the LLM claims COST reports 'Investment in ABI' as $11.1 billion, but the ground truth does not support this level of specificity in COST’s balance sheet presentation—COST aggregates such assets under broader 'other long-term assets'. (2) Quantitative inaccuracies include the LLM stating MO’s ABI investment is $11,144 million, which contradicts the ground truth value of $190,082 million for ABI. The $11.1 billion figure may refer to a different metric or be misattributed. The $1,705 million for JUUL is not mentioned in the original answer and is irrelevant to the question about general categorization of long-term assets. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly infers that because both companies have investments in ABI, this defines their overall categorization approach. However, the question asks about structural differences in how long-term assets are classified on the balance sheet, not specific investments or fair value disclosures. The LLM fails to recognize that MO breaks out ABI as a primary long-term asset category, while COST does not. (4) Due to major factual errors in entity classification, incorrect numerical values, and failure to capture the actual categorization frameworks used, the correctness score is low. The answer is contextually related (both discuss long-term assets and ABI), but the specifics are misleading and factually inaccurate.",

Similarly, the LLM states COST has large deferred tax liabilities from intangible assets, but it is MO whose intangible assets contribute $3,032 million to its deferred tax liabilities.

It states CMCSA's 2023 Theme Parks revenue as $8,947 million and DIS's as $7,541 million, which sum to $16,488 million—the correct combined total per the ground truth. However, the individual company revenues are reversed: the ground truth implies CMCSA had $7,541 million and DIS had $8,947 million in 2023 (since DIS's revenue is higher and grew by $1,096 million from 2022). The LLM incorrectly assigns the larger revenue to CMCSA. More critically, the LLM reports DIS's growth as 49.5%, which is wildly inaccurate—the ground truth states DIS's growth was 10.0% ($1,096 million increase). CMCSA's growth rate of 18.6% is correctly reported. (2) Quantitative verification: The sum of $8,947M + $7,541M = $16,488M matches the ground truth total, so the combined revenue is correct. However, the individual components are misattributed, and DIS's growth rate is completely wrong. The correct growth for DIS was 10.0%, not 49.5%. There is no indication in the LLM answer of the actual $1,406M and $1,096M increases. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present—revenues are summed correctly, and growth rates are mentioned—but the synthesis fails due to incorrect attribution of revenue figures and miscalculation (or hallucination) of DIS's growth rate. The model appears to have swapped the revenue values and invented a spurious growth rate.

      "original_answer": "The combined present value of operating lease obligations for HD and Tesla in fiscal year 2022 is $8,222 million ($6,183 million from HD and $2,039 million from Tesla). The total imputed or stated interest on these leases is $1,255 million ($912 million from HD and $343 million from Tesla). Therefore, the combined present value exceeds the total interest by $6,967 million.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined present value of operating lease obligations for HD and Tesla in fiscal 2022 is $1,024 million for HD and $33 million for Tesla, giving a total of $1,057 million. This total is slightly higher than the sum of the imputed interest on those leases, which is $912 million for HD and $33 million for Tesla, resulting in combined imputed interest of $945 million. Consequently, the lease obligations exceed the imputed interest by $112 million.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in all key numerical values. The ground truth states that HD's present value of operating lease obligations is $6,183 million and Tesla's is $2,039 million, totaling $8,222 million. The LLM incorrectly reports $1,024 million for HD and $33 million for Tesla, totaling only $1,057 million—over 85% lower than the correct total. Similarly, the imputed interest is grossly misreported: the LLM states $33 million for Tesla, but the correct value is $343 million; HD's interest is correct at $912 million, but the total is miscalculated as $945 million instead of the correct $1,255 million. The final difference is reported as $112 million instead of the correct $6,967 million. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM's incorrect numbers (e.g., $1,057M - $945M = $112M), but since the inputs are wrong, the results are factually invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—aggregating data across two companies and comparing present value to interest—is structurally attempted, but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Tesla and likely confusion with another company or metric (e.g., $33M appears twice, suggesting possible hallucination or data mix-up). (4) Scores are low because the core financial figures are wildly inaccurate, undermining correctness and quantitative precision. Qualitative reasoning structure is partially sound but based on false premises. Contextual relevance is moderate as the answer attempts the right comparison framework but with wrong data.",

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar allocated $89 million to its Non-U.S. pension plans in 2020, while Honeywell reported $8,450 million in total Non-U.S. plan assets at fair value as of December 31, 2020. The difference between these amounts is $8,361 million. This significant disparity indicates that Honeywell's Non-U.S. pension plans are considerably larger in scale and likely more mature or under different regulatory funding requirements compared to Caterpillar's, which may suggest differing pension liabilities, funding strategies, or geographic exposure in their employee benefit obligations.",

The correct difference is $8,450M - $89M = $8,361 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states the difference as approximately $1.7 billion ($1,700 million), which is off by over $6.6 billion. This severe miscalculation undermines the entire response. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are fundamental: both the individual figures (no mention of $89M or $8,450M) and the calculated difference are wrong. The LLM does not report the correct allocation or asset value, nor does it compute the correct delta. (3) The reasoning is flawed due to incorrect data. The LLM concludes that Caterpillar has a 'more aggressive funding approach' due to 'larger allocation to non-U.S. pension assets,' but this is the opposite of what the data shows: Honeywell's plan assets are vastly larger, suggesting either greater scale, maturity, or different funding strategy. The LLM misinterprets the relationship between contributions and asset values, and draws an invalid conclusion about strategy.

It falsely states that the 'Other Deferred Tax Liabilities' for Costco and Altria are $2,002 million and $4,878 million, respectively, which are actually their total deferred tax liabilities, not the 'Other' component. The correct 'Other Deferred Tax Liabilities' are $29 million for Costco and $105 million for Altria (summing to $134 million), per the ground truth. Instead, the LLM swaps the 'Other' line item with the total deferred tax liability, leading to a grossly inflated combined total of $6,880 million instead of $134 million. (2) The calculations are completely wrong: the LLM incorrectly adds the total deferred tax liabilities and labels them as 'Other', then falsely claims this sum exceeds their respective total deferred tax liabilities, which is illogical and factually incorrect. The ground truth states that 'Other' is a small fraction of the total, not larger. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails entirely: the model does not correctly identify or isolate the 'Other Deferred Tax Liabilities' line item for either company, conflating it with the total deferred tax liabilities. It also reverses the comparison, claiming the subset is larger than the whole, which reflects a fundamental misunderstanding. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the answer addresses the right companies (Costco and Altria), the correct year (2024), and the general topic (deferred tax liabilities), but all substantive content is factually inverted or incorrect.

      "question": "How do the differences in valuation methodologies for future fair values of private equity investments between DHR and MDT affect their expected liquidity and contribution requirements for retirement benefit plans in 2022?",
      "original_answer": "DHR estimates future fair values of private equity investments using market multiples, third-party appraisals, or quoted market prices, with valuation adjustments based on changes in operating results or financial condition. This approach may impact the accuracy of fair value estimates and influence DHR's U.S. and non-U.S. pension contribution requirements of $10 million and $48 million, respectively, in 2022. In contrast, MDT values private equity investments using year-end net asset values of partnerships, with unfunded commitments totaling $204 million as of April 29, 2022, and an estimated liquidation period of one to 15 years. MDT’s methodology may affect its ability to rebalance asset allocations closer to targets over the intermediate term, especially given the strong equity performance during the fiscal year. Therefore, DHR’s reliance on market-based adjustments and MDT’s use of NAV practical expedient create different liquidity profiles and contribution planning assumptions for their retirement benefit plans.",

Specifically, MDT's pension plans anticipate cash contribution requirements of approximately $10 million for U.S. plans and $48 million for non-U.S. plans in 2022, with actual contributions dependent on factors like asset returns and funding status, while the valuation methodologies for retirement benefit plan assets (including Level 3 investments and NAV-based valuations) influence the reported funded status and thus the timing and magnitude of required contributions.",

The ground truth reports Capital One's 2024 net charge-off rate as 5.88%, up 131 basis points from 2023. This is a major quantitative error affecting the core of the answer. PayPal’s figures (4.5% in 2024 from 7.2% in 2023, a 270-basis-point decrease) are correctly reported. (2) Calculations: The decrease for PayPal is accurately calculated (7.2% to 4.5% = 270 bps), but the Capital One numbers are entirely wrong—both the rate and the year-over-year change. The difference in 2024 rates between the two companies is stated as 1.38 percentage points in the ground truth (5.88% - 4.5%), but the LLM implies a difference of 2.4 percentage points (4.5% - 2.10%), which is incorrect.

For Southern Company Gas (SO), auditors extended these procedures by reading regulatory orders from multiple states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia), inspecting regulatory filings for intervenor challenges, and testing the completeness and accuracy of capitalized project costs. The regulatory uncertainties evaluated for SO included the risk that the Commissions might not approve full recovery of incurred costs or invested capital, and potential future rate reductions or refunds, which could significantly impact financial recoverability.",

The ground truth specifies that for SO, auditors read regulatory orders from four specific states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, Virginia), inspected for intervenor challenges, and tested completeness/accuracy of capitalized costs—none of which are mentioned in the LLM answer. Instead, the LLM claims auditors 'tested management’s controls,' which is not in the original. For DUK, the LLM omits the use of trend analyses, a key procedure in the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM introduces specific dollar amounts for DUK’s regulatory assets ($72M in 2021, $39M in 2020), which are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified; this is a significant factual overreach. No such figures are provided in the original answer, making these numbers unsupported and likely incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing audit procedures and regulatory uncertainties across two companies—but fails in synthesis: it does not accurately reflect that SO’s audit was more extensive or that state-level regulatory scrutiny was a key differentiator. The mention of 'regulatory assets and liabilities' for SO adds detail not in the original and distracts from the focus on recoverability. (4) Despite these issues, the LLM captures the core idea that both audits evaluated the risk of non-approval of cost recovery and potential rate reductions, which aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on regulatory uncertainty around cost disallowance and refunds. Wording differences are acceptable, but the introduction of unverified numbers and omission of key procedures reduce correctness.

      "original_answer": "Boeing derived 86% of its revenue in 2021 from fixed-price contracts, which exposes it to cost overruns and estimation risks. Lockheed Martin explicitly states that fixed-price contracts, especially for complex development programs, increase financial risk because cost and timing are difficult to estimate, often leading to losses. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin notes that bidding on cost-reimbursable development work with follow-on fixed-price production options increases the risk of lower margins or losses because contractors must estimate production costs before development is complete. Given Boeing’s heavy reliance on fixed-price contracts, this exposure significantly amplifies the financial risks Lockheed Martin describes, particularly in environments where cost estimation is inherently uncertain and inflationary pressures may further compress margins.",
      "llm_answer": "The 86% of Boeing’s 2021 revenue from fixed‑price contracts intensifies the financial risk that Lockheed Martin highlights for its own fixed‑price development programs: cost‑estimation errors can turn a seemingly profitable contract into a loss, and such losses can cascade through the backlog and delay revenue recognition. Because Boeing’s fixed‑price share is even higher than Lockheed’s typical exposure, any mis‑estimate of program costs or schedule delays—especially on complex development work—directly threatens its margins and forces it to absorb unplanned expenses, mirroring the “losses on certain fixed‑price development programs” that Lockheed warns could reoccur.",

(1) All factual information is correct: Adobe's cybersecurity vulnerabilities are correctly linked to reputational damage and customer retention risks, citing the 2022 10-K's concern about customers stopping use of products due to security issues. IBM's brand reputation risk is accurately tied to customer retention, consistent with its 2022 10-K language on brand image impacting client attraction and retention. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers that require verification—both filings referenced are from 2022, which matches the ground truth, though the LLM does not explicitly mention the year (minor omission). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes risks from both companies’ filings and connects them to a combined effect on competitive positioning in the IT sector, noting weakened loyalty and increased vulnerability to rivals. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—while the LLM uses slightly different phrasing (e.g., 'erode client trust' vs 'tarnished brand image'), the meaning is consistent. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the lack of explicit mention of the 'simultaneous' reputational damage scenario and slightly less emphasis on the cumulative shift toward trusted competitors, though the core insight is preserved.

      "original_answer": "Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) both highlight the importance of refining margins in influencing their earnings. According to Chevron's 2024 10-K filing, changes in refining, marketing, and chemicals margins are among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil specifically notes that its Energy Products segment earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins, which decreased in 2024 to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010–2019). This decline in refining margins would directly impact ExxonMobil’s earnings, as refining margins are a function of the difference between raw material costs and product prices, which are influenced by global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and other market dynamics. Since both companies depend on refining margins, the volatility in this financial metric affects their earnings outlooks, with ExxonMobil experiencing a measurable decline in margins that would constrain profitability, while Chevron's forward-looking projections become more uncertain due to this sensitivity.",
      "llm_answer": "The volatility in 2024 refining margins—down to the middle of the pre‑COVID 10‑year historical range for ExxonMobil and similarly depressed for Chevron—directly depresses each company’s earnings, as shown by ExxonMobil’s $6.28 billion earnings hit from weaker margins and Chevron’s $6,280 million earnings reduction from “significantly weaker industry refining margins.” Both firms note that these margin swings are a key driver of their financial performance and are highlighted as sensitive factors in their forward‑looking statements.",

It states that ExxonMobil had a '$6.28 billion earnings hit' and Chevron a '$6,280 million earnings reduction' due to refining margins. However, the original answer (ground truth) does not mention any specific dollar amounts for earnings impacts for either company. These figures are entirely fabricated and not supported by the provided knowledge. While both companies do emphasize the sensitivity of earnings to refining margins, no numerical impact is given in the ground truth, making these specific numbers incorrect. (2) The qualitative aspects are partially correct: both companies are correctly identified as being sensitive to refining margins, ExxonMobil’s mention of margins declining to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010–2019) is accurately reflected, and Chevron’s forward-looking statements being sensitive to margin changes is correctly noted. However, the LLM incorrectly implies that Chevron experienced 'similarly depressed' margins with a specific dollar impact, which is not in the original. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model invents a parallel quantitative impact for Chevron based on ExxonMobil’s data, which is not justified. There is no evidence in the ground truth that Chevron reported a $6.28 billion (or $6,280 million) reduction. The synthesis fails because it assumes symmetry between the companies’ earnings impacts without support. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses refining margin volatility and its importance to both firms’ earnings, which is central to the question. However, the inclusion of false precision through invented dollar figures severely undermines correctness. The qualitative accuracy is low due to these fabrications, though the general direction of impact (negative) and the sensitivity discussion are valid. Correctness score is low because financial figures must be accurate, and inventing numbers constitutes a critical error in financial analysis.",

      "original_answer": "CAT reported accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits of $2,757 million in 2023, while UNP reported accrued wages of $50 million in the same year. This significant difference suggests that CAT likely has a much larger workforce or different payroll timing compared to UNP, which could impact their respective short-term liabilities and cash flow management.",
      "llm_answer": "The accrued wages for CAT ($2,757 million) and UNP ($2,696 million) are nearly identical, but the slight difference reflects how each company structures its payroll accruals and timing. CAT’s larger accrued‑wages figure suggests it may accrue wages earlier in the fiscal period or retain a broader set of employee‑related liabilities (e.g., bonuses, benefits) that are recognized before actual cash payment, whereas UNP’s lower balance indicates a more conservative accrual approach, possibly tied to a different payroll cycle or fewer accrued benefit obligations. Consequently, the variance is less about a fundamental disparity in compensation philosophy and more about the timing and scope of when each firm records wage‑related expenses in its financial statements.",

The ground truth states that CAT reported $2,757 million in accrued wages, salaries, and benefits, while UNP reported only $50 million in 2023. However, the LLM incorrectly states that UNP’s accrued wages were $2,696 million—nearly matching CAT—which is completely false and reverses the actual magnitude of the difference. This error invalidates the entire analysis. (2) The numbers are not just inaccurate—they are fabricated for UNP. The LLM claims UNP has $2,696 million, which is off by over $2,600 million from the true value of $50 million. Even allowing for format variations, this is not a rounding or presentation issue but a catastrophic factual error. (3) The reasoning is internally logical—discussing accrual timing, scope of liabilities, and payroll cycles—but it is based on false premises. The multi-hop synthesis fails because it uses an incorrect data point for UNP, leading to a conclusion that the values are 'nearly identical,' when in fact CAT’s is over 55 times larger than UNP’s. This misrepresents the financial reality and leads to an entirely wrong interpretation. (4) The contextual relevance is partially preserved because the answer addresses the question’s intent—analyzing differences in compensation structures or payroll timing—but due to the severe factual inaccuracies, especially in quantitative data, the correctness score is near zero.

These errors stem from wrong input values, not calculation logic.

However, this also led to a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense due to higher effective interest rates on debt. Meanwhile, Starbucks reported that changes in fair value due to benchmark interest rates affected $350 million of its August 2029 notes, which were hedged using interest rate swaps. Therefore, while GM benefited from higher interest rates on income-generating assets, it faced higher financing costs, and SBUX actively managed interest rate exposure through hedging instruments.",

At the same time, GM’s automotive segment faced higher borrowing costs, with interest expense climbing $1.8 billion as the company’s average debt‑outstanding rose and the effective interest rate on debt jumped to 4.7 % (up 1.6 percentage points), pressuring overall profitability despite the revenue gains.

However, it introduces a $1.4 billion revenue increase (11.4% growth) not present in the ground truth, which lacks any mention of total revenue growth or percentage change—this is an unsupported addition. Additionally, the LLM claims SBUX’s 10-K does not discuss interest rate hedging strategies, which directly contradicts the ground truth stating SBUX hedged $350 million of its August 2029 notes using interest rate swaps due to benchmark rate changes. This omission is a major factual error. (2) Quantitatively, the $1.7B and $1.8B figures for GM are accurate, but the $1.4B revenue increase and 11.4% growth are not in the original data and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. The 4.7% effective rate and 1.6 percentage point increase are not in the ground truth and thus cannot be verified—these reduce quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails on the SBUX side: the model should have connected benchmark rate changes to SBUX’s use of interest rate swaps on specific debt, as stated in the original. Instead, it incorrectly asserts no information is available, showing a failure in synthesis or data retrieval. For GM, it captures the dual impact of higher income and higher expense, which is correct reasoning. (4) Correctness is partially achieved for GM but fails for SBUX, resulting in a mid-low score. Quantitative accuracy is moderate due to correct key figures but added unverified ones. Qualitative accuracy suffers from the SBUX omission and unsupported details.

The comparison to Caterpillar's balance is also incorrect: the LLM claims the total is $2,313 million greater, but in reality, Caterpillar's $2,757 million accounts for about 98.2% of the combined total, meaning the increase from adding Union Pacific is only $50 million.

Amgen’s actual $180M in noncash consideration from replacement equity awards is entirely omitted. No calculations are required in this question, but the misattribution of values across companies renders the quantitative content inaccurate. (3) The reasoning is flawed in the multi-hop synthesis: the core of the question asks how each company accounts for noncash consideration and what that reveals about their acquisition strategies.

      "llm_answer": "Changes in benchmark interest rates directly affect GM’s financial performance by increasing interest expense on its debt and GM Financial’s borrowing costs, as disclosed in its 10-K (pages 37–39). Specifically, GM notes that higher benchmark rates raised interest expense by $1.8 billion in 2023, contributing to a $1.1 billion decline in EBT‑adjusted results, while also boosting finance charge income from its loan portfolio. Conversely, Starbucks’ hedging strategy mitigates interest‑rate risk on its debt through interest‑rate swaps and other derivatives; its 10‑K (pages 46–50) shows that a 100‑basis‑point rise in rates would decrease the fair value of its long‑term debt by $943 million, and it uses swaps to hedge exposure to benchmark rate changes, thereby limiting the impact on earnings and other comprehensive income.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, it correctly states that GM's interest expense increased by $1.8 billion in 2023 due to higher benchmark rates, matching the original answer. It also mentions the increase in finance charge income (though without specifying the $1.7 billion figure) and notes the positive impact on GM Financial’s income. However, it omits the exact $0.3 billion increase in investment income, which is a minor omission. The Starbucks portion accurately describes the use of interest rate swaps and treasury locks (referred to as 'other derivatives') and correctly quantifies the $943 million decrease in fair value of long-term debt from a 100-basis-point rise—consistent with the risk exposure described in hedging disclosures. (2) Calculations are not required in this case, but the $1.1 billion decline in EBT-adjusted results is an additional detail not in the ground truth but plausibly derived from netting impacts; it does not contradict the original answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes GM’s mixed exposure (positive from finance income, negative from debt costs) and contrasts it with Starbucks’ proactive hedging strategy using derivatives. (4) Entity accuracy is strong—both companies, correct years (2023), and financial instruments (swaps, treasury locks) are properly identified. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit mention of 'treasury locks' and the precise $0.3 billion investment income gain, which slightly affects completeness. Overall, the answer conveys the same core message with high fidelity, strong reasoning, and excellent contextual relevance.",

      "original_answer": "COP calculates its standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows using 12-month average prices, assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions, which may not reflect future volatility. XOM notes that extended low prices could reduce capital spending and affect partners' ability to fund joint projects, thereby impacting proved reserves. Together, these approaches suggest that while COP's methodology smooths price volatility, it may mask the longer-term effects of sustained low prices, which XOM explicitly identifies as a risk that could reduce both the level and timing of proved reserves. This creates a potential misalignment in how each company accounts for price volatility in reserve estimation.",
      "llm_answer": "The reliance on 12‑month average prices by ConocoPhillips and the sensitivity of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves to prolonged low‑price periods together undermine the stability of reserve estimates under volatile markets: COP’s reserve calculations are tied to short‑term price swings, so a sudden price decline can quickly reclassify quantities as non‑proved, while XOM’s reserves are vulnerable to extended low‑price environments that curtail capital spending and delay the development of proved undeveloped reserves, potentially leading to downward revisions if price recovery is delayed.

(2) However, the qualitative analysis contains a significant error: it incorrectly states that COP’s reserve calculations are 'tied to short-term price swings' and that 'a sudden price decline can quickly reclassify quantities as non-proved.' This misrepresents COP’s methodology. The ground truth clarifies that COP uses a 12-month average price, which *smooths* volatility rather than reacting to short-term swings. Thus, the LLM inverts the intended effect of COP’s approach. (3) Regarding multi-hop reasoning: the LLM correctly identifies that XOM’s reserves are sensitive to extended low prices affecting capital spending and project timing, which aligns with the original answer. However, it fails to accurately contrast this with COP’s smoothing mechanism, instead portraying COP as more reactive to volatility—undermining the correct synthesis. The original answer emphasizes that COP’s method may mask long-term risks of low prices (a forward-looking limitation), whereas the LLM suggests COP is immediately reactive (a short-term sensitivity), which is factually incorrect. (4) Despite this key reasoning flaw, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses the core question about how both companies’ approaches affect reserve reliability under volatility.

      "original_answer": "Charles Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities decreased from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021, yet interest revenue from these securities increased from $1,560 million to $4,537 million due to a significant rise in average balances from $58,181 million to $253,555 million. This contributed to the overall net interest revenue growth from $6,113 million in 2020 to $8,030 million in 2021, a $1,917 million increase. BNY Mellon, in its 10-K, highlights that it monitors net interest revenue closely as part of its financial outlook and risk management, noting its sensitivity to market trends such as interest rates and asset composition. Therefore, BNY Mellon would be strategically interested in understanding how shifts in asset yields and balances impact net interest revenue, as seen at Schwab, to better model and manage its own revenue streams under varying economic conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "The rise in Schwab’s average yield on available‑for‑sale securities from 1.78 % in 2020 to 1.30 % in 2021 helped lift net interest revenue by $1.9 billion (31 %), even though overall yields fell and net interest margin declined to 1.45 % from 1.62 %. This trend matters to BNY Mellon because its own forward‑looking statements flag net‑interest revenue as highly sensitive to market conditions, meaning Schwab’s ability to grow interest income despite low rates signals a potentially more favorable net‑interest environment that BNY Mellon watches closely for its own earnings outlook.",

It incorrectly states that Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities rose from 1.78% in 2020 to 1.30% in 2021, when in fact it decreased from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021. This misrepresents the direction of the yield change. Additionally, the LLM claims net interest revenue increased by $1.9 billion (31%), which is directionally correct but imprecise—the actual increase was $1,917 million (from $6,113M to $8,030M), so the dollar amount is close but the percentage is miscalculated (31.3% actual). The LLM also introduces a net interest margin of 1.45% and 1.62% without grounding in the provided truth, which is not mentioned in the original answer and cannot be verified. (2) The calculation of revenue growth is approximately correct in magnitude but based on incorrect inputs and reasoning. The key driver in the ground truth—massive growth in average balances from $58.181B to $253.555B—is entirely omitted in the LLM answer, which instead attributes growth to rising yields, which is factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the LLM does not correctly synthesize that lower yields were offset by a large increase in securities balances, leading to higher interest revenue. Instead, it falsely claims yields increased, undermining the logical chain. The connection to BNY Mellon is partially sound—acknowledging that BNY monitors net interest revenue sensitivity to market conditions—but it mischaracterizes Schwab’s experience as evidence of a 'favorable net-interest environment' when it was actually a case study in balance sheet scaling amid low rates. (4) The correctness score is low due to fundamental errors in directionality of yield change and omission of key causal factors. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to incorrect percentages and unsupported metrics. Qualitative accuracy is poor due to flawed reasoning, though some entities (Schwab, BNY Mellon, net interest revenue) are correctly identified. Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to address both parts of the question and draws a plausible strategic link to BNY Mellon.",

Specifically, using MDT’s much lower average discount rate (e.g., ~0.60%–25.40% vs. DHR’s 4.23%–4.48%) would increase the projected benefit obligation for DHR, while using DHR’s higher rate would decrease MDT’s obligation.

However, the LLM incorrectly reports DHR's rate as 4.23%–4.48% and MDT's as a wide and inaccurate range of 0.60%–25.40%. These ranges do not match the ground truth and suggest a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the data. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe—neither the point estimates nor the ranges align with the correct figures. The correct difference is 13.10% - 2.80% = 10.3 percentage points, but the LLM’s implied comparison is based on incorrect data. Additionally, characterizing MDT’s rate as 'much lower' (~0.60%) is factually wrong, as MDT’s actual rate (13.10%) is much higher than DHR’s (2.80%). This reverses the logic of the impact. (3) The reasoning about the inverse relationship between discount rates and projected benefit obligations is conceptually correct—lower discount rates increase liabilities, higher rates decrease them. However, due to the incorrect assignment of rates, the conclusion is flipped: the LLM states that using MDT’s 'lower' rate would increase DHR’s obligation, when in reality MDT’s rate is higher, so using it would decrease DHR’s obligation. This undermines the multi-hop synthesis.

The combined AOCL is stated as $3,097 million, but the correct value is $4,020 million (sum of META's $3,097 million and VZ's $923 million). The LLM incorrectly assigns $1,380 million to Meta and $1,717 million to Verizon in 2024, which contradicts the ground truth (Meta: $3,097M, VZ: $923M). (2) The change in AOCL for Meta is wrong: LLM claims it increased from $0 to $1,380 million, but in reality, it worsened from ($2,155M) to ($3,097M), a $942M increase in loss. For VZ, the decrease from $1,380M to $923M (a $457M improvement) is correctly calculated, which is the only accurate numeric change. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize AOCL values for both companies across 2023 and 2024. It invents a starting AOCL of $0 for Meta in 2023, which is not supported by the data. The net shift of $1,837 million is incorrect due to erroneous inputs. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the answer addresses the right entities (Meta and VZ), metric (AOCL), and time frame (2023–2024), and attempts both parts of the question—combined AOCL and change comparison—so contextual relevance is moderate.

      "original_answer": "The difference in financial reporting structures impacts transparency by making GM's liquidity changes quantifiable through disclosed figures like outstanding letters of credit ($0.7 billion in 2023), while Tesla provides detailed revenue and gross profit metrics for its Automotive Segment, enabling deeper performance analysis. This contrast in reporting depth affects stakeholders' ability to evaluate liquidity and profitability comprehensively within the Automotive Segment across the two companies.",

Consequently, GM’s presentation makes it easier for investors to assess the Automotive Segment’s cash position and funding flexibility, while Tesla’s more limited segment financials offer less granular visibility into its liquidity and segment performance.",

It accurately states that GM provides a detailed reconciliation of Automotive available liquidity, which enhances liquidity transparency, while Tesla reports revenue and gross profit but lacks a comparable liquidity breakdown. Although the LLM answer does not explicitly mention the $0.7 billion in outstanding letters of credit from GM’s 2023 filing (present in the ground truth), this specific figure is a supporting detail rather than a central component of the overall comparison. The absence is a minor omission, not a factual error. (2) There are no numerical inaccuracies; the LLM avoids making up numbers and does not contradict the ground truth. It refrains from citing specific dollar amounts, so there is no incorrect quantitative claim—this is acceptable given that the question does not require specific figures, only a qualitative comparison of reporting structures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that GM’s approach aids liquidity assessment while Tesla’s enables performance (profitability) analysis, allowing for a valid cross-company comparison of transparency dimensions. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing how reporting differences impact transparency in liquidity and segment performance. The qualitative accuracy is slightly reduced due to the omitted example ($0.7B LOC), but the reasoning and conclusion remain aligned with the ground truth.

The ground truth states the combined short-term lease cost for CAT and UNP in 2023 is $86 million ($62M for CAT, $24M for UNP), but the LLM reports $251 million ($189M for CAT, $62M for UNP). Similarly, the prior-year (2022) combined cost is reported as $85 million in the ground truth ($59M + $18M), while the LLM reports $235 million ($187M + $48M). These numbers are significantly off, indicating a failure in data retrieval or synthesis. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent (e.g., $189M + $62M = $251M), but since the base numbers are wrong, the results are invalid. The actual 2023 sum should be $86M (not $251M), and the 2022 sum should be $85M (not $235M). The LLM incorrectly suggests a $16M increase, while the truth shows only a $1M increase. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—aggregating short-term lease costs across two companies and two years—was structurally attempted, but the model used incorrect data for both entities and years, indicating a failure in entity-metric alignment. It likely pulled data for the wrong metric (e.g., total lease costs instead of short-term), misidentified the companies, or used incorrect filings. (4) Despite the severe factual inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant: it addresses both parts of the question (2023 combined cost and comparison to prior year), uses correct company tickers (CAT, UNP), references the right metric type (short-term lease cost), and provides a logical structure.

It correctly identifies that AMT adds back real estate-related depreciation, amortization, and accretion in its segment gross margin calculation, which is equivalent to excluding it from the core segment performance metric. It also accurately states that SPG includes accumulated depreciation in a standalone schedule within its real estate asset valuation without linking it to a segment margin measure. The mention of specific pages (47–49 for AMT, 155 for SPG) adds precision and supports the claims, though the ground truth does not require page numbers, so this is a value-add rather than a discrepancy. There are no numeric inaccuracies—no dollar amounts, dates, or percentages are misstated (the focus is on treatment rather than quantities). The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the differing treatments across the two companies’ 2024 10-Ks. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM frames SPG’s approach as 'not incorporating depreciation into a segment-margin metric,' while the ground truth emphasizes SPG's inclusion of capitalized costs in asset valuation. These are consistent—SPG includes depreciation in asset valuation (via accumulated depreciation) but does not adjust segment margins with it. Thus, the semantic meaning is preserved.

Additionally, the adoption of new technologies like 5G or small cell networks could reduce demand for traditional tower-based services, further decreasing lease rates.

SPG’s exposure stems from oversupply in retail trade areas, leading to lower market rents. These points align with the original answer’s emphasis on different mechanisms—technology and competition for AMT, real estate dynamics for SPG. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable but assumed correct by absence. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that both companies face downward pressure on lease rates, but through distinct channels—AMT via tech evolution and competitive landscape, SPG via physical market oversupply. The mention of 'AI-driven power-intensive systems' is a slight expansion beyond the original but is contextually plausible and does not distort the meaning. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong; the LLM uses different phrasing (e.g., 'less favorable terms', 'costly upgrades') but maintains factual fidelity. One minor point preventing a perfect 10 is the omission of the detail about a 'significant percentage of leases expire annually' for AMT, which adds context to the vulnerability to competitive pressures.

(3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the two entities (Bank of America and Charles Schwab), the relevant financial instruments (revolving loans and HELOCs amortized cost basis), the FICO threshold (>=740), and the date (December 31, 2022). This shows sound qualitative understanding of the required synthesis across entities and metrics. (4) Justification: The low correctness and quantitative accuracy scores reflect the major error in the BAC revolving loans figure, which is off by over $10 billion. The qualitative accuracy score is slightly higher because the model understands the structure of the question and the correct entities and conditions. Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, metrics, and criteria, even if the numbers are wrong.",

According to the ground truth, NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets related to interim removal costs and other generation plant dismantlement total $1,035 million ($1,021M + $14M). However, the LLM incorrectly reports this amount as $5,774 million, which is over five times higher. This figure appears to be a misinterpretation or misaggregation of broader asset removal cost categories, possibly conflating multiple line items or including unrelated regulatory assets. (2) The number for Duke Energy ($1,446 million in noncurrent regulatory assets related to VIEs) is correctly reported and matches the ground truth. However, the comparison drawn is therefore invalid due to the incorrect NEE figure. The LLM claims NEE’s amount is more than three times larger than DUK’s, while in reality, DUK’s $1,446 million exceeds NEE’s $1,035 million by $411 million. This reverses the conclusion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the synthesis between NEE and DUK is based on an incorrect input for NEE. While the model attempts to compare the two companies as required, the faulty data undermines the logic. Additionally, the LLM references 'accrued asset removal costs, asset-retirement-obligation regulatory expense differences and related regulatory assets'—a broader category than what the question specifically asks for (interim removal costs and other generation plant dismantlement), indicating a failure in precise metric identification. (4) Despite the significant quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies (NEE and DUK), the correct fiscal year (2023), and the general domain of noncurrent regulatory assets. Hence, partial credit is given for structure and relevance, but the correctness score is low due to fundamental factual and computational errors.",

In contrast, VZ manages its short-term obligations through asset-backed debt secured by receivables and participation interest, with proceeds classified under Debt Maturing Within One Year and Long-Term Debt. VZ's strategy includes restricted cash and segregated accounts for debt servicing, limiting the impact on general liquidity.

However, it introduces a figure for Verizon (VZ) of $12,973 million in short-term debt for 2023, which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. This number is a critical factual error. (2) The quantitative accuracy is reduced due to the unsupported VZ debt figure; no such value was in the original answer, which focused on the structure of VZ's debt rather than a specific total. The AT&T numbers are accurate, and the increase of $2,010 million is correctly implied. (3) The reasoning is generally sound: the LLM correctly contrasts T's rising reliance on short-term financing with VZ's structured, asset-backed approach involving receivables and segregated accounts. It appropriately infers that VZ's method supports greater liquidity stability. However, the mention of 'renewable energy projects' as a use of proceeds is not in the original and introduces unverified detail. (4) Despite the incorrect VZ debt number and the extraneous renewable energy claim, the core multi-hop comparison—T’s growing unsecured short-term debt vs. VZ’s structured, collateralized liquidity strategy—is accurately synthesized and contextually relevant.

(2) The LLM accurately references Walmart's Sam's Club segment as a reportable segment in WMT's 10-K, correctly citing page 77 of the document.

This difference impacts the projected growth of pension obligations, as higher salary increases lead to larger future liabilities.

      "llm_answer": "The 2023 salary‑increase assumption used by Duke Energy (4.90 %) is identical to that used by NextEra Energy (4.90 %). Because the two companies employ the same salary‑increase rate, the difference in their pension‑obligation valuations does not stem from divergent salary assumptions; instead, any comparability issue would arise from other actuarial inputs (e.g., discount rates, expected return on assets) or from the way each company applies those assumptions.

(2) Quantitatively, the key percentage for DUK is completely wrong—no part of the 3.50%-4.00% range equals 4.90%. This error invalidates all subsequent reasoning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly retrieve and contrast the two companies' assumptions. Instead, it assumes parity, leading to the erroneous conclusion that salary assumptions do not affect comparability. In reality, the difference in assumptions does impair comparability, as correctly explained in the ground truth.

Southern Company’s decrease is correctly calculated as $14 million (from $89M to $75M), matching the ground truth. However, the combined net change is wrong: the LLM adds $68M + $14M = $82M decrease, while the correct combined change is $26M + $14M = $40M decrease — but the ground truth states $14M, suggesting possible offsetting signs or interpretation of net change as absolute sum with sign.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. It incorrectly states that TXN's SG&A expense was $1,940 million, which is false — the ground truth is $134 million. This leads to a completely wrong difference of $226 million instead of the correct $2,032 million. The percentage is also miscalculated: 226 / 26,914 ≈ 8.4%, which matches the LLM's claim, but since the numerator is wrong, the result is invalid. The correct percentage is 7.6% (2,032 / 26,914). (2) NVDA's SG&A ($2,166 million) and net revenue ($26,914 million) are correctly cited, so some numbers are accurate. However, the core comparison fails due to the incorrect TXN value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to compare SG&A expenses across companies and compute the proportion relative to NVDA’s revenue — but it fails at entity-specific data retrieval for TXN. There is no indication that TXN reported SG&A of $1,940 million; this appears to be a confusion with another figure or company. (4) Scores reflect that while the framework of the answer is relevant and partially based on correct data (NVDA figures), the critical error in TXN's SG&A renders the conclusion factually incorrect. The quantitative accuracy is very low due to the large magnitude of error in both the difference and percentage.",

This satisfies the quantitative requirement with no errors in percentage or year. (2) The number '14%' is accurate and correctly attributed to the right entities (Walmart, Sam's Club) and time period (2023), with no calculation issues. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers the significance of this relationship by noting the material adverse effect on PEP's divisions (FLNA, QFNA, PBNA) if Walmart were lost, which aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on significant reliance. While the original answer mentions concentrate sales to bottlers supplying Walmart, the LLM focuses on downstream divisional impact—both valid aspects of the relationship. The LLM adds slightly more speculative risk language ('would have a material adverse effect') not explicitly in the original, but this is a reasonable inference. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the percentage and the strategic importance of Walmart as a global omnichannel retailer. The only minor gap is the omission of the specific mechanism (concentrate sales to bottlers), but the core multi-hop synthesis—linking Walmart sales % to strategic dependence across divisions—is correctly executed.

The LLM incorrectly reports a $584M shortfall for DHR and $830M for MDT, which are not supported by the original data. Additionally, MDT’s projected Non-U.S. pension payments over the next 10 years are $666 million, not $367 million as claimed. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is incorrect: $584M + $830M = $1,414M (not $1.418B, another minor arithmetic inconsistency). More importantly, these inputs themselves are wrong. The correct calculation from the ground truth is $1,184M - $521M = $663M. The comparison to MDT’s 10-year payments should be between $663M and $666M—nearly equivalent—but the LLM incorrectly states that the shortfall exceeds payments by a large margin due to wrong numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—aggregating shortfalls across companies and comparing to future payments—but it fails in execution because it uses incorrect underlying data. The model appears to have misread or hallucinated the component values for DHR and MDT rather than correctly extracting and summing the actual obligations and assets. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts the right comparison and structure, but the severe numerical errors undermine the conclusion. Correctness and quantitative accuracy are very low due to wrong figures and miscalculations.

BAC's interest benefit is part of a broader accrual for interest and penalties related to income taxes, which stood at $105 million at December 31, 2024. MET's interest benefit of $4 million is included in other expenses and reflects its overall liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which could increase or decrease in the next 12 months due to potential U.S. federal tax legislation or regulatory changes.

(2) The calculation itself is flawed: $7M – $5M = $2M is mathematically correct but based on incorrect inputs, so the final result does not match the ground truth.

It also accurately reported the 2023 values for Meta ($16,169 million) and T ($10,289 million). However, there is a critical error in the comparison for AT&T: the LLM states that AT&T’s receivables 'rose from $10,289 million to $9,638 million', which is incorrect because $9,638 million is less than $10,289 million — this is actually a decrease, not an increase.

      "original_answer": "For BKNG, indirect taxes increased general and administrative expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher travel transaction taxes and digital services taxes, which were driven by improved revenue performance. For GM, indirect taxes contributed to liabilities through potential retrospective recoveries and adjustments tied to unique events, such as recent Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting salaried workers in GMI. These differing business factors—BKNG's tax exposure from transaction-based growth and GM's legal and settlement-related tax impacts—show how indirect taxes influence each company's financial obligations through distinct operational and regulatory channels.",
      "llm_answer": "The indirect‑tax increases raise BKNG’s general and administrative (G&A) expense because the company reports that higher indirect taxes—driven by improved revenue—directly lift its G&A costs, while the same tax changes create potential settlement liabilities for GM that are reflected in the “potential settlement with certain third parties relating to retrospective recoveries of indirect taxes” noted in the segment‑reporting footnote. In GM’s case, the tax‑related adjustments are embedded in the adjustments to earnings before interest and taxes (e.g., the $130 million corporate adjustment and the $‑683 million GMI adjustment) and are tied to the company’s exposure to indirect‑tax recovery claims, whereas for BKNG the same tax pressure simply inflates its G&A line item. Thus, the business drivers are: (1) BKNG’s G&A rise is driven by higher indirect‑tax expense and related professional‑service fees; and (2) GM’s indirect‑tax exposure can generate settlement‑related liabilities that appear as adjustments in its segment earnings and affect its overall tax‑related expense.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: BKNG's increase in general and administrative (G&A) expenses due to higher indirect taxes driven by improved revenue performance is accurately described. Similarly, GM's exposure to potential settlement liabilities from retrospective recoveries of indirect taxes—particularly tied to legal developments such as Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting GMI—is correctly identified. (2) Quantitative accuracy is strong: the LLM references specific adjustments like the $130 million corporate adjustment and the -$683 million GMI adjustment, which are consistent with the type of data found in GM’s segment reporting and tax disclosures. While the original answer does not include these exact numbers, they are plausible and contextually appropriate, and no incorrect figures are cited. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how indirect taxes affect two different companies through distinct mechanisms—operational tax expense for BKNG versus legal/settlement-related liabilities for GM—and ties each to relevant business factors. (4) Semantic equivalence is maintained: although the LLM uses more detailed financial terminology (e.g., segment adjustments, EBIT adjustments), the core meaning matches the original answer. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly name the 'Korea Supreme Court decision' as the driver for GM’s liability, though it refers to 'retrospective recoveries' and 'exposure to indirect-tax recovery claims,' which imply the same.

      "question": "How do the pension-related 'other gains and losses' discussed by PEP and the 'other (gains) and losses' reported by WMT differ in terms of their financial statement presentation and potential impact on operating performance?",
      "original_answer": "PEP discusses 'other gains and losses' as a component of pension and retiree medical expense calculations, directly influenced by actuarial assumptions and market conditions. These gains and losses are part of the annual pension expense and can materially affect financial results due to significant management judgment involved. In contrast, WMT reports 'other (gains) and losses' as a separate line item in the income statement, with amounts of $1,538 million in 2023 and $3,027 million in 2024, directly impacting income before taxes. While PEP's 'other gains and losses' are embedded in pension expense and reflect long-term liability assumptions, WMT's line item represents more immediate, potentially one-time financial impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "The pension-related \"other gains and losses\" disclosed by PepsiCo (page 63) are presented as a separate line item within income before income taxes and are subsequently reflected in the pension‑related components of other comprehensive income, whereas Walmart’s \"other (gains) and losses\" (page 55) are aggregated under a single \"Other (gains) and losses\" caption in the income statement and are not broken out as a distinct pension‑related component. Consequently, PepsiCo’s pension gains/losses are isolated and can directly affect operating performance through their impact on operating profit and net income, while Walmart’s other gains/losses are combined with non‑pension items, making their effect on operating performance less transparent and potentially diluted by other non‑pension items.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding PEP's financial statement presentation. The claim that PepsiCo presents 'other gains and losses' as a separate line item within income before income taxes is incorrect according to the ground truth, which states these gains/losses are embedded in pension expense and influenced by actuarial assumptions—not presented as a standalone income statement item. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly asserts that these items affect operating profit, which contradicts standard accounting treatment where pension-related other gains/losses are typically recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI) and only amortized into earnings over time. In contrast, Walmart’s 'other (gains) and losses' are correctly described as a separate income statement line item, but the LLM fails to include the critical quantitative data provided in the ground truth: $1,538 million in 2023 and $3,027 million in 2024. These missing figures represent a major omission in quantitative accuracy. (2) No numbers from the LLM answer match the ground truth—WMT’s values are entirely absent, and no correct figures are cited for PEP. This results in a very low quantitative accuracy score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model attempts to compare presentation differences between PEP and WMT and infer implications for operating performance transparency. However, the reasoning is based on incorrect premises about PEP’s disclosure practices, undermining the validity of the comparison. The model also introduces page numbers (63 and 55) not present in the original question or ground truth, suggesting hallucination. (4) While the answer addresses the question's structure and intent—comparing presentation and impact on operating performance—the factual foundation is flawed. The contextual relevance is high because the response stays on topic and attempts the required cross-company analysis, but correctness and qualitative accuracy are compromised by misrepresentation of key facts.",

      "question": "How does Bank of America's use of past experience in determining the expected rate of return on its pension plan assets compare to MetLife's use of past experience in pricing insurance products, and what specific role does each company's historical data play in their respective financial strategies?",
      "original_answer": "Bank of America incorporates its pension funds' past experience as part of the analysis used to determine the expected rate of return on plan assets, combining this with historical market returns, asset class volatility, and future expectations to guide long-term investment decisions. MetLife, on the other hand, uses past experience both prospectively and retrospectively in its pricing of insurance products — evaluating historical performance to set future premium rates and to recoup or distribute gains and losses based on prior years' results. While Bank of America uses past experience to inform long-term asset return assumptions, MetLife directly ties past experience to pricing adjustments and risk management in its insurance underwriting and product pricing.",
      "llm_answer": "Bank of America uses historical market returns, volatility, asset‑class correlations and its own past experience to set the long‑term expected rate of return on pension‑plan assets, a key input for funding and accounting that aligns with its broader investment‑strategy and risk‑management objectives. MetLife similarly relies on historical data and past experience to set assumptions for mortality, morbidity, persistency and investment returns when pricing life, annuity and health insurance products, embedding that historical experience in its product‑pricing and profitability models to ensure that premiums and reserves reflect the company’s historical claims experience and risk appetite.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is factually accurate and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor differences in emphasis. (1) All key facts are correct: Bank of America uses past experience in setting the expected rate of return on pension assets, combining it with market data and future expectations, which aligns with its investment and risk strategy. MetLife uses historical data (mortality, morbidity, persistency, investment returns) from past experience to price insurance products and set reserves, directly linking historical performance to pricing and risk management. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between Bank of America’s use of past experience in pension asset return assumptions (forward-looking but not directly tied to adjustments) versus MetLife’s use in dynamic pricing and profitability modeling (both prospective and retrospective). The LLM captures the core contrast: Bank of America uses history for long-term assumptions; MetLife embeds it directly into pricing and risk outcomes. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the LLM slightly underemphasizes MetLife’s retrospective use of past experience to recoup or distribute gains/losses based on prior results, which is explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. However, the reference to embedding historical experience in profitability models and reserves implies this mechanism.

This interest expense is significantly lower than their respective capital expenditures, which were $939 million for DUK and $9,302 million for NEE in 2023.

The statement that the combined interest expense is significantly lower than their respective capex is contextually accurate, especially for NEE. However, the LLM answer omits the comparative analysis provided in the original answer—specifically, that the interest expense represents about 128% of DUK’s capex and 12.8% of NEE’s capex. This comparative insight was explicitly requested in the question (how the interest expense compares to capex), and while the LLM notes the direction of the comparison, it fails to quantify it, which is a key part of the multi-hop reasoning. The entity identification (DUK, NEE, 2023), metrics (cash paid for interest net of capitalized amounts, capex), and years are all correct. The reasoning is sound but incomplete in synthesis.

      "question": "By how much would Union Pacific's pension expense increase from a 0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets, and how does this quantify the sensitivity of pension obligations to actuarial assumptions as demonstrated in GE's pension disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "Union Pacific's pension expense would increase by $12 million from a 0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets. This quantifies the sensitivity of pension obligations to actuarial assumptions, as seen in GE's disclosures where changes in assumptions like discount rates and expected return on assets directly impact pension obligations and expenses through actuarial calculations.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the GE disclosures in pages 61‑62, a 0.25 % decrease in the expected return on plan assets would raise the GE Aerospace principal pension‑plan cost in the following year by roughly **$50 million**. This illustrates that pension expense is highly sensitive to actuarial assumptions—specifically, a modest shift in the expected return assumption translates directly into a comparable change in annual pension cost, as demonstrated by the GE sensitivity analysis.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect in both the quantitative result and the entity involved. The question asks specifically about Union Pacific's pension expense increase from a 0.25% decrease in expected return on plan assets, and the ground truth states this would be $12 million. Instead, the LLM cites a $50 million increase, which pertains to GE Aerospace, not Union Pacific. This is a major factual error. (2) The quantitative inaccuracy is significant: $50 million vs $12 million is a more than 4x difference, and the source of the number (GE) is not relevant to the first part of the question. The LLM incorrectly uses GE's data to answer the Union Pacific portion, failing the multi-hop requirement to retrieve Union Pacific's specific sensitivity figure. (3) The reasoning is flawed because it does not correctly synthesize the required information: the first part of the question requires Union Pacific's data, not GE's. While the second part about sensitivity is conceptually correct—discussing how actuarial assumptions affect pension expenses—the LLM fails to connect Union Pacific's $12 million figure to the broader point about sensitivity, instead substituting GE's example prematurely. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer discusses pension sensitivity to assumptions, which is relevant, but misapplies the data. The qualitative accuracy is low because of incorrect entity mapping and lack of proper multi-hop synthesis between Union Pacific and GE. Only the general conceptual understanding of sensitivity saves it from a score of 1.",

According to the ground truth, in 2024, META had a $685 million increase and T (AT&T) had a $1,017 million increase, totaling $1,702 million. However, the LLM incorrectly reports $2,882 million for Meta and $685 million for AT&T, which reverses and inflates the actual figures. Similarly, for 2023, the correct values are $168 million (META) and $448 million (T), totaling $616 million, but the LLM reports $1,204 million for Meta and $168 million for AT&T, which are both factually incorrect. (2) Calculations are also wrong: the LLM claims a combined 2024 increase of $3,567 million, which does not match the correct total of $1,702 million. The year-over-year comparison is therefore invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly synthesize data across the two companies and two years; it misrepresented which company had which value and used incorrect source data.

It states COP's combined DDD&A expense was $5,785 million, which is only the consolidated operations amount and omits the $579 million from equity affiliates, leading to an incorrect total of $5,785 million instead of the correct $6,364 million. Furthermore, it incorrectly reports CVX's DDD&A as $5,504 million, whereas the ground truth is $29,218 million — a massive discrepancy. The conclusion that COP's expense was higher than CVX's by $281 million is therefore completely false; in reality, CVX's was $22,854 million higher. (2) Number verification: COP consolidated: $5,785M (correct), COP equity affiliates: missing $579M, COP total: should be $6,364M (not $5,785M), CVX: reported $5,504M (wrong), actual $29,218M. Difference calculation is invalid due to incorrect inputs.

      "original_answer": "The $5.00 billion note issued by NVDA in June 2021 led to a $52 million increase in interest expense (from $184 million in fiscal year 2021 to $236 million in fiscal year 2022). This increase in interest expense reflects the direct cost of borrowing. However, NVDA also reported $107 million in income from 'Other, net' in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by unrealized gains from investments in non-affiliated entities. This suggests that while the debt issuance increased financial costs, NVDA was able to offset some of that burden through investment gains. If TXN were to issue similar debt, they would face comparable interest costs, which could constrain financial flexibility by diverting funds from operations or capital investments. TXN’s ability to manage this burden would depend on their capacity to generate offsetting income streams, such as from investment gains or operational efficiencies, as NVDA did.",

The calculation of the $52M increase is implied but not explicitly stated, and the LLM does not mention the $107M 'Other, net' income from investment gains that partially offset the interest expense in NVDA’s case—this omission reduces completeness and weakens the qualitative analysis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the LLM connects NVDA’s debt issuance to higher interest costs and extends the logic to TXN’s potential financial flexibility. However, it fails to note that NVDA offset some costs via investment gains, which is a key nuance in assessing how firms might manage such debt. Thus, the synthesis is incomplete. (4) The answer remains contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question—impact on other income (expense), net and implications for TXN—though with less depth than the original. The conclusion about TXN facing similar constraints is reasonable and logically derived, even if the offsetting mechanisms are underdeveloped.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that Costco had a larger decrease in lease costs both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the prior year, which aligns with the ground truth. The percentage decreases (8.7% for Costco and ~6.6% for Philip Morris) are accurate and match closely with the ground truth (6.7% for Philip Morris; the 0.1% difference is within acceptable rounding). (2) The LLM provides specific dollar figures: Costco decreased from $692M to $602M (a $90M decrease), but incorrectly states the change as $60M. This is a significant error in absolute change. Philip Morris decreased from $448M to $403M, a $45M decrease, which the LLM correctly reports. The actual total lease cost change difference between the two companies should be |−90 − (−45)| = $45M, but the ground truth states $109M difference in changes, which implies the correct absolute changes are likely $109M apart (e.g., Costco down $154M, PM down $45M, or similar). However, the LLM’s internal numbers do not support the $109M difference in changes. Since the LLM does not mention the $109M difference at all, this is a major omission. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly computes percentage changes and compares them across companies and years. However, it fails to compute or report the difference in the total lease cost changes between the two companies, which is a core part of the question. (4) Despite strong performance on percentage trends and directional accuracy, the omission of the $109M figure and incorrect absolute change for Costco reduces the correctness score. Quantitative accuracy is marked down due to the incorrect $60M figure and missing $109M synthesis. Qualitative and contextual scores remain high because the reasoning framework and entity identification are correct.",

This is a major factual error. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly references a $1.5 billion termination fee related to AMD’s Xilinx acquisition, whereas the ground truth states that the total acquisition value was $35 billion, not a $1.5 billion fee. (2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: the correct total for AVGO is $15.5 billion, not $3.0 billion (off by over $12.5 billion); the AMD transaction value is $35 billion, not $1.5 billion. No correct calculations or figures are provided. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The model fails to correctly identify the amounts issued by AVGO across the two years and misrepresents the nature and size of the AMD-Xilinx transaction.

The core distinction—that Bank of America includes these assets while MetLife does not—is accurately captured.

These numbers are completely mismatched. (2) Calculations are wrong: the LLM incorrectly computes changes and uses incorrect base values. The correct difference in change magnitude is $722M - $599M = $123M, favoring EMR, but the LLM concludes RTX had a larger shift, which is false.

According to the ground truth, ConocoPhillips (COP) had an 89.0% increase in NGL price per barrel from 2020 to 2021, but the LLM claims a 162% increase. For Chevron (CVX), the correct increase is 162.8%, but the LLM reports 157%, which is off by nearly 6 percentage points. Additionally, the LLM provides specific price points: $11.11 to $29.10 for COP and $10.58 to $27.13 for CVX. These numbers do not align with the knowledge graph ground truth, which implies different base and final values to yield the correct percentage increases. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s stated increase for COP (from $11.11 to $29.10) is actually a 162% increase ((29.10 - 11.11)/11.11 ≈ 1.62), which matches their reported percentage but contradicts the ground truth of 89.0%. Similarly, CVX’s increase from $10.58 to $27.13 is about 156.7%, close to the LLM’s 157%, but still incorrect versus the true 162.8%. These inaccuracies suggest the model used incorrect source data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: While the LLM attempts to compare both companies’ NGL price increases over the same period (2020–2021), it reverses the conclusion. The ground truth states that CVX had a significantly higher increase (162.8% vs 89.0%), but the LLM incorrectly claims COP’s growth slightly outpaced CVX’s. This misrepresents the comparative outcome. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and directional errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because key percentages and figures are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the model understands the task structure (compute % change, compare two firms), but fails in execution.

GM Financial also identified no impairment indicators in its leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, despite a potential future decline in used vehicle prices, which were still expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.

Amazon's Income Before Income Taxes of $37,557 million is significantly higher than GM's $12,716 million, indicating a greater pre-tax profitability position for Amazon. Amazon's operating income is $36,852 million, which is slightly lower than its pre-tax income, showing minimal impact from non-operating income or expenses. In contrast, GM's operating income of $10,465 million is lower than its pre-tax income of $12,716 million, suggesting that non-operating items positively impacted GM's pre-tax income by $2,251 million.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures. It reports GM's Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes as $10,403 million instead of the correct $12,716 million from the ground truth. It also incorrectly states Amazon's operating income as $12,248 million instead of $36,852 million, and GM's operating income as $12,306 million instead of $10,465 million. These errors severely undermine the quantitative accuracy. The combined pre-tax income is calculated as $47,960 million, but the correct sum is $50,273 million. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs, leading to wrong totals and comparisons. The LLM claims the combined pre-tax income exceeds the sum of operating incomes ($24,554 million), but this total is itself incorrect (correct sum of operating incomes is $36,852 + $10,465 = $47,317 million). The direction of the comparison between pre-tax and operating income for each company is also misrepresented. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails because the model uses incorrect data points for both companies across multiple metrics (pre-tax income and operating income), and thus cannot accurately compare or synthesize the financial performance. The conclusion about non-operating items impacting results is missing entirely. (4) While the answer attempts to address the question structure—calculating combined pre-tax income and comparing to operating income—the severe numerical inaccuracies and flawed logic result in a mostly incorrect response. Contextual relevance is moderate because the framework of the answer matches the question, but factual correctness is poor.",

      "question": "How does the difference in geographic concentration of proved reserves between Chevron (86% in OECD countries) and ExxonMobil's broader reserves management approach affect their respective exposure to regulatory and political risks in the energy sector?",
      "original_answer": "Chevron's proved reserves are concentrated with approximately 86% located in OECD countries, which are typically characterized by stable regulatory environments and strong governance frameworks. This geographic concentration likely reduces Chevron's exposure to political and regulatory risks compared to ExxonMobil, which manages a more globally dispersed portfolio of reserves, including both consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. ExxonMobil explicitly notes that its reserves estimates are subject to regulatory changes, fiscal and commercial terms, government policies, and consumer preferences, which vary significantly across jurisdictions. Therefore, ExxonMobil’s broader and less concentrated reserves base likely increases its exposure to geopolitical and regulatory volatility compared to Chevron’s more OECD-focused reserves position.",
      "llm_answer": "The geographic concentration of Chevron's proved reserves—86% in OECD countries—creates a structural advantage in mitigating regulatory and political risk exposure compared to ExxonMobil's more globally diversified reserve portfolio. ExxonMobil's reserves span a broader range of non-OECD regions (including Asia, Africa, and the Americas), which introduces greater complexity in navigating differing fiscal regimes, government policies, and geopolitical uncertainties across its key operating areas. Consequently, Chevron's reserves are inherently less exposed to regulatory volatility in emerging markets, while ExxonMobil's global footprint subjects it to a wider array of political and regulatory risks that could impact reserve development timelines and project economics.",

(1) Quantitatively, the 86% figure for Chevron's proved reserves in OECD countries is correctly stated, and no other numerical data contradicts the original answer. (2) The reasoning correctly infers that Chevron's concentration in OECD countries reduces regulatory and political risk exposure, while ExxonMobil’s broader global footprint—especially in non-OECD regions—increases complexity and risk due to varying fiscal regimes, government policies, and geopolitical uncertainties. This matches the original answer’s logic. (3) The multi-hop synthesis is sound: it connects geographic reserve distribution to risk exposure by referencing regulatory stability in OECD vs. volatility in non-OECD regions, consistent with ExxonMobil’s own disclosures about sensitivity to regulatory changes and government policies. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the LLM does not explicitly mention ExxonMobil’s use of both consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies in its reserves management, which is part of the original answer’s rationale. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall correctness. Wording differs but semantic meaning and factual content are equivalent.

AVGO held $1,334 million in state research and development tax credits as of October 30, 2022, but none are specifically noted to be perpetual like AMD’s California R&D credit.

It correctly identifies AMD's $288 million in state tax credits as of December 25, 2021, and notes the non-expiring California R&D credit, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it fails to report AVGO's actual state tax credit amount of $1,334 million as of October 30, 2022, instead stating that AVGO's state credits are 'not explicitly detailed' and only referencing expiration ranges without providing the required figure. This omission severely undermines the quantitative and multi-hop synthesis aspects of the answer. (2) The total state tax credits should be $288M + $1,334M = $1,622M, but the LLM does not compute or mention this total. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly implies that AVGO’s state credits expire between 2022–2036, while the ground truth specifies they begin expiring in fiscal year 2023—close but not precisely aligned. The mention of federal credits ($441.8M) is irrelevant to the question about state credits and introduces confusion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to extract and synthesize AVGO’s specific state R&D credit value from its 10-K, which is necessary for the total. It also does not contrast AMD’s perpetual California R&D credit with AVGO’s lack of such a noted perpetual credit, instead making vague claims about expiration patterns. (4) While the answer shows some understanding of expiration treatment differences, the failure to provide AVGO’s key number and the total amount results in a low correctness score. Quantitative accuracy is partially met for AMD but not AVGO, hence a 5. Qualitative reasoning is weakened by incorrect focus and missing synthesis, warranting a 4.

In contrast, MO performed both qualitative and quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021, using a discounted cash flow model with a 10% weighted-average discount rate and a 2% perpetual growth rate, and also found no impairment. However, MO acknowledges higher sensitivity to macroeconomic and regulatory factors that could affect future cash flow estimates. Therefore, while both companies reported no impairment charges, MO's methodology reveals greater exposure to external risks that could lead to future write-downs compared to COST's more stable asset evaluation approach.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2022 impairment testing methodology for long‑lived assets and goodwill is essentially the same as in prior years – assets are tested for recoverability using undiscounted cash‑flow analyses, and goodwill is tested annually (or more often if indicators arise) using a qualitative assessment that can be bypassed for a quantitative discounted‑cash‑flow test. Both COST and MO rely on this approach, but the documents show that COST’s testing is described in the “Depreciation, Amortization, Impairment Testing and Asset Valuation” section of its 10‑K (pages 42‑46), while MO’s testing is detailed in its own “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” (pages 23‑27). Because both companies use comparable qualitative/quantitative methods, their exposure to future write‑downs is similarly driven by macro‑economic conditions, regulatory changes, and the assumptions embedded in their cash‑flow forecasts, rather than by a fundamentally different testing framework.",

The LLM misattributes the year of MO's testing and fails to note that MO’s detailed discounted cash flow model (with 10% discount rate and 2% growth rate) was used in 2021, not 2022. These are critical factual errors. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM omits the specific 10% weighted-average discount rate and 2% perpetual growth rate used by MO—key metrics that inform risk sensitivity—and incorrectly implies both companies conducted analyses in 2022 when MO’s detailed testing was in 2021.

MET also notes that extension terms are \"not prevalent\" for agricultural loans, whereas BAC explicitly models extensions for commercial loans.

It also correctly states that Duke Energy's cost decreased year-over-year. However, it incorrectly states Southern Company's 2023 natural gas cost as $1.6 billion without specifying that this is part of a larger total, and more critically, it misattributes $1.6 billion as 'Southern Company Gas' rather than the full Southern Company, which in the ground truth is $1,644 million ($1.644 billion). The combined total is stated as 'approximately $2.2 billion', which is close to the correct $2,237 million ($2.237 billion), so this is a minor rounding/inexactness issue. (2) The percentage decrease for Duke Energy is correctly calculated: (1,276 - 593) / 1,276 ≈ 53.5%. However, the LLM claims Southern Company’s cost fell 45.3%, but the ground truth shows a decrease from $2,994 million to $1,644 million, which is a $1,350 million drop, or (2,994 - 1,644) / 2,994 ≈ 45.1%, so the percentage is approximately correct. However, the LLM fails to report the actual dollar change for Southern Company, and mislabels the metric as 'Southern Company Gas'—a potential subsidiary—instead of the parent entity.

It also correctly states that RTX provides only a high-level summary without detailed component breakdowns or separate U.S./non-U.S. reporting. While the LLM does not include the specific 2022 dollar figures mentioned in the ground truth (e.g., $(3) million for EMR U.S. plans and $5 million for Non-U.S.), this omission does not undermine the overall factual correctness of the qualitative comparison. (2) No incorrect numbers are presented; the LLM avoids making up figures and instead focuses on structural disclosure differences. The absence of specific dollar amounts from the ground truth is a minor completeness gap but does not constitute a factual error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that EMR discloses detailed, segmented pension data while RTX does not, leading to a valid conclusion about relative transparency. The logic supporting EMR’s more transparent approach versus RTX’s concise reporting is well-founded in the described disclosure practices.

It incorrectly states AT&T's (T) 2024 increase in unrecognized tax benefits as $1,026 million, which is actually T's 2023 increase according to the ground truth. The correct 2024 value for T is $369 million. Similarly, the LLM assigns $168 million as AT&T's prior year (2023) increase, which is incorrect — the correct 2023 value is $1,026 million. These errors completely distort the analysis. (2) Calculations are therefore also wrong: the LLM reports a combined 2024 increase of $3,908 million ($2,882M + $1,026M), but the correct total is $3,251 million. The prior year total is misreported as $1,372 million ($1,204M + $168M), whereas the correct 2023 total is $2,230 million. The year-over-year difference is misrepresented due to these errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize data across the two companies and two years. It swaps values between years for T, suggesting confusion in entity-year alignment. While it recognizes the need to compare current and prior years across both firms, the incorrect data undermines all conclusions. (4) Contextual relevance is acceptable — the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and time frame, and attempts the correct comparisons.

Chevron's dry hole expense in 2019 was $172 million according to the ground truth, but the LLM reports $118 million, which is incorrect. This is a major quantitative error. (2) For ConocoPhillips, the LLM correctly identifies the Kamunsu East Field (KBBC) as one of the fields associated with dry hole expenses or impairments, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly substitutes 'Corridor Block in Indonesia' for the actual field 'Patawali wells in Block WL4-00', which is a critical entity error. The Corridor Block is not mentioned in the ground truth and appears to be fabricated or confused with another source. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound— the model attempts to link two different companies (CVX and COP) and extract relevant expense and field information for the same year (2019), showing awareness of the required synthesis. However, due to incorrect data retrieval for both the Chevron expense amount and the ConocoPhillips fields, the reasoning fails at execution. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate terminology (e.g., dry-hole costs, impairments, field names), but the factual inaccuracies severely undermine correctness.

      "original_answer": "The reasonably possible loss estimate for Booking.com's VAT assessments in 2020 was $22 million, while General Motors recorded $2.8 billion in warranty recall campaign accruals in 2021.

This contrast shows that Booking.com faced a comparatively modest contingent tax liability, while GM confronted a far larger, though largely accrued, contingent liability from vehicle warranty recalls.

The conversion from €20 million to ≈$22 million is accurate and appropriately contextualized. (2) All numeric values, years, and financial metrics are correct. The comparison of magnitudes (Booking.com’s $22M vs GM’s $2.8B) is quantitatively sound, with no calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model synthesizes contingent liability data across two different companies, industries, and types of obligations (tax vs product warranty), and correctly infers that GM faced a much larger financial risk. It adds relevant context about supplier recoveries making further losses 'insignificant'—a nuance not in the original but factually consistent with GM's disclosures. (4) The answer conveys the same core conclusion as the ground truth: GM faced significantly higher contingent liability risk. The only minor shortcoming is that it doesn't explicitly name the Chevrolet Bolt recall as the primary driver, which is a small omission in qualitative completeness. However, the reasoning and risk assessment remain accurate and insightful. Thus, the answer is factually excellent with near-perfect synthesis.",

The total difference between the two companies' net deferred income tax positions is $15,303 million.

The net deferred income tax position for UNP is incorrectly stated as $1,576 million (asset), whereas the ground truth shows it is ($13,123) million (liability), indicating a massive directional and numerical error. The calculated difference of $604 million is therefore completely wrong; the correct difference is $15,303 million. CAT's net deferred tax asset of $2,180 million is correct, but the rest of the quantitative framework collapses due to the UNP error. (2) The valuation allowance for CAT is partially correct in concept but inaccurate in amount—the ground truth specifies a total valuation allowance of $934 million, while the LLM breaks it down into $95 million and $682 million components totaling only $777 million, missing $157 million and failing to mention key drivers like research expenditures and tax carryforwards as emphasized in the original. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve UNP's deferred tax liability, misrepresenting it as a positive asset, which indicates a failure in synthesizing the correct data points across companies. The comparison between CAT and UNP is thus invalid. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses both parts of the question (difference in tax positions and role of valuation allowances) and correctly identifies that valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets based on realizability.

The ground truth states that COP contributed 173 thousand barrels per day (MBD), ExxonMobil's Syncrude contributed 67 MBD, and Kearl contributed 249 MBD, totaling 489 MBD. The LLM instead reports 936 MBOED (equivalent to thousand barrels per day) from ConocoPhillips alone, which is more than double the correct total for all three operations combined. (2) The numbers are severely inaccurate: the LLM cites 923 MBOED from ConocoPhillips' consolidated production and 13 MBOED from equity affiliates, which does not align with the ground truth data. There is no mention of Syncrude and Kearl contributing 67 and 249 respectively under ExxonMobil, nor is there a correct summation. The calculation (923 + 13 = 936) is arithmetically correct but based on false inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model incorrectly attributed Syncrude and Kearl operations to ConocoPhillips via equity affiliates, when in fact the question asks for ConocoPhillips' own operations plus ExxonMobil's two operations. The LLM conflated ownership and reporting structures, misassigning ExxonMobil’s assets to COP’s equity affiliates. (4) The contextual relevance is partial—it addresses crude oil production in 2023 and attempts a combination, so the general intent is correct.

Similarly, Altria (MO) decreased from 7,100 to 6,000 employees, a decrease of 1,100, but the LLM reports only a 1,000 decrease. The combined net change should be +31,000 - 1,100 = +29,900 (an increase), but the LLM incorrectly calculates a net decrease of 1,000. (2) All three key numbers (Costco increase, Altria decrease, combined change) are wrong. The calculations are therefore also incorrect, failing basic arithmetic consistency.

(2) The dollar amounts themselves ($771M and $35M) are factually correct and match the ground truth, as is the 2023 year reference.

The mention of a 6.5% CET1 ratio threshold is contextually relevant but not part of the original question or answer and may conflate ratio-based standards with absolute capital amounts without clarification. (3) The multi-hop reasoning partially succeeds: the model correctly identifies both BlackRock’s CET1 capital and the 'well capitalized' threshold, and connects the concept to American Express’s definition. However, it fails to accurately compute the difference between the two values, a core requirement. The definition of CET1 from American Express is reasonably paraphrased, though it omits mention of CECL rules, which are included in the ground truth definition.

The correct combined change is an improvement of $3,021 million, but the LLM reports a total decline of $5,782 million, which is not only wrong in direction but also magnitude. (2) Specific number verification: Google’s (Alphabet’s) Total Comprehensive Loss decreased from $7,603M to $4,402M (a $3,201M improvement), not a $4,402M decline as implied. Verizon’s loss improved from $1,865M to $1,380M (a $485M improvement), not a $1,380M decline. The LLM misrepresents the base figures as the changes. The unrealized gains contributions are also incorrect: LLM claims $1,057M for Alphabet and $1,062M for Verizon, but ground truth is $2,512M and $536M respectively. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to compute the year-over-year change correctly for either company and misattributes the unrealized gains. It also conflates total comprehensive loss values with the change in those values. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—it addresses the right companies, time frame (2022–2023), and financial concepts (unrealized gains on hedges/investments)—but the incorrect data and logic undermine the response.

      "question": "How does the reasonably possible loss estimation approach differ between Booking.com's VAT-related contingencies and GM's automotive recall liabilities, and what does this reveal about the nature of their respective contingent obligations?",
      "original_answer": "Booking.com estimated a reasonably possible loss of €20 million ($22 million) related to VAT assessments in France, based on potential adverse impacts from a court decision, and did not accrue any liability for Italian VAT audit recommendations of €154 million ($175 million) or Turkish tax assessments totaling 813 million Turkish Lira ($61 million), as it believes it is in compliance with applicable laws. In contrast, GM accrued $2.8 billion in warranty recall campaign liabilities, including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt recall, and estimated its reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be insignificant, indicating a higher degree of certainty in its obligations. This reveals that Booking.com's contingent liabilities are largely uncertain and under dispute, while GM's liabilities were more quantifiable and largely covered by supplier reimbursements, resulting in minimal additional exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Booking.com's VAT-related contingencies are estimated using a \"reasonably possible loss\" approach that requires assessing the likelihood and potential magnitude of tax assessments or adjustments arising from uncertain tax positions, particularly in jurisdictions with aggressive tax authorities. This results in a range of possible outcomes where the upper end of the range represents the maximum exposure, but the company records only the amount it deems most likely, often resulting in conservative accruals. In contrast, GM's automotive recall liabilities are estimated based on the \"reasonably possible loss\" of amounts accrued for warranty and recall expenses, which are tied to actual or projected costs of repairs, replacements, or supplier recoveries (e.g., the $2.8 billion Chevrolet Bolt recall with $2.0 billion offset by LG Electronics reimbursement). This reveals that Booking.com's contingent obligations are primarily tax-related and involve probabilistic assessments of potential liabilities, while GM's are rooted in tangible, cost-driven liabilities tied to product defects and supplier obligations, reflecting a fundamental difference in the nature of their contingent exposures.",

The ground truth states Booking.com faced a reasonably possible loss of €20 million ($22 million) for French VAT, did not accrue liabilities for Italian VAT of €154 million ($175 million) or Turkish assessments of 813 million Turkish Lira ($61 million). The LLM answer omits all these specific figures and instead offers a generic description of tax contingencies without citing any actual numbers. For GM, the ground truth specifies a $2.8 billion warranty recall liability (including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt), with reasonably possible losses beyond that deemed insignificant. The LLM incorrectly frames the $2.0 billion as an offset from LG Electronics, implying the net accrual was lower, but the ground truth does not state that the $2.0 billion was already offset at the time of accrual—only that supplier reimbursements reduced exposure. The LLM invents a reimbursement detail not present in the original. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the model fails to report any of the specific numbers from the ground truth (e.g., €20M, €154M, 813M TRY, $2.8B, $2.0B) and misrepresents the GM recall cost structure. While $2.8 billion and $2.0 billion are mentioned in the LLM answer, they are embedded in an incorrect narrative about supplier offsets, undermining factual reliability. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly contrasts tax-based contingencies (Booking.com) with product recall liabilities (GM) and draws a qualitative distinction between uncertain legal interpretations and tangible repair costs. However, it fails to synthesize the actual disclosures: Booking.com’s refusal to accrue large tax assessments due to belief in compliance, and GM’s high certainty due to insignificant excess exposure. The reasoning is plausible but not grounded in the specific evidence. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the comparative nature of the question and attempts to explain differences in contingent obligation types. However, due to missing and distorted quantitative data, the correctness score is limited to 5—partially correct but with major factual gaps and one key misrepresentation (supplier reimbursement as reducing accrual).",

However, the LLM incorrectly states that Costco records these costs in 'cost of sales' and accrues unincurred costs at the time revenue is recognized—this contradicts the original answer, which does not mention accrual for unincurred costs for Costco. In contrast, the description of Philip Morris (PM) is accurate: PM treats shipping and handling as costs to fulfill a contract and accrues them when revenue is recognized, consistent with the ground truth.

The LLM states the opposite: that DHR had a range of 4.23%–4.48% and MDT had 2.80%–3.50%, which is factually incorrect.

In contrast, T reported an ending balance of $756 million in its Allowance for Credit Losses for 2023, showing a significant provision for potential credit losses. This difference reveals that T faces higher credit risk, possibly due to business-to-business receivables with longer payment terms or higher exposure to economically sensitive customers.

These omissions significantly reduce quantitative accuracy. (2) No numeric values from the ground truth are mentioned in the LLM answer—neither the dollar amounts nor the expiration dates—making it quantitatively inaccurate despite being factually consistent where it does speak. (3) The reasoning is sound in linking market rate exposure to increased borrowing costs and financial risk, and the comparison between the two companies is logically structured. The multi-hop synthesis is partially correct—both companies’ reliance on variable-rate debt is correctly inferred and connected to broader financial risks—but the lack of specific facility terms and maturity dates weakens the depth of synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core mechanisms and risks of market rate dependency. However, the absence of specific, verifiable figures from the original answer limits correctness.

Costco's dividend of $1,498 million is correct. The combined dividend total is therefore wrong: $1,706 million instead of $7,988 million. Altria's net income ($2,475 million) is correctly cited, but Costco's net income is slightly off at $5,915 million vs. the correct $5,844 million. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM claims the combined payout is 58% of Altria’s net income — but $6,490 million exceeds Altria’s net income, whereas the LLM uses $208 million (a likely confusion with quarterly dividends). Similarly, 25% of Costco’s net income would be about $1,479 million, close to its dividend, but due to incorrect Altria figures, the overall comparison fails. The key comparison in the question — whether total dividends were covered by net income — is completely misrepresented. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is unsound: the model fails to correctly synthesize dividend data for Altria, likely misinterpreting annual as quarterly dividends. It does correctly identify the companies and fiscal year 2022, but the financial synthesis across entities is invalid due to incorrect data.

The final total of $380 million is therefore wrong; the correct total is $256 million. (2) The calculation itself (addition) is logically sound, but based on incorrect input data.

Duke Energy reports $14,039 million in Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities, while NextEra Energy reports $10,049 million. The difference of $3,990 million is largely due to Duke Energy having significantly higher asset retirement obligations ($8,560 million) compared to NextEra Energy's asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference ($4,066 million), indicating that Duke Energy faces a more immediate burden in asset retirement costs, which are likely tied to older infrastructure or differing regulatory requirements across their service territories.",

The difference in their liabilities reflects distinct regulatory environments: Duke Energy’s larger noncurrent regulatory liability stems from higher accrued asset removal costs and deferred tax balances tied to its regulated utility assets, while NextEra Energy’s liability is driven primarily by asset retirement obligation differences and deferred tax positions specific to its generation portfolio, illustrating how each company’s regulatory framework and asset mix shape the magnitude of their regulatory liabilities.",

This leads to an incorrect combined total of $23,942 million instead of the correct $24,088 million. The difference calculation is therefore also off. (2) The quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the $146 million error in NextEra's liability value, which affects the sum and potentially any comparative analysis.

(3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that differing regulatory environments and asset mixes (e.g., asset removal costs, deferred taxes, generation portfolios) influence the size of regulatory liabilities. It appropriately links higher liabilities to Duke’s regulated utility structure and older infrastructure, even if it doesn’t explicitly mention Duke’s $8,560 million asset retirement obligations versus NextEra’s $4,066 million, which is a key point in the original answer.

(2) The quantitative inaccuracies are significant: the model fails to report NFLX’s $28 million separately and omits the correct total of $1,813 million. It incorrectly treats $1,785 million as the total when that amount corresponds only to T’s liability. The mention of $28 million on page 79 is correctly attributed to NFLX in the original data, but the LLM misinterprets its role in the total.

Both companies use these standalone selling price estimates to allocate transaction prices between services and equipment in bundled contracts, which directly affects the timing and pattern of revenue recognition—Google recognizes revenue ratably over the contract term for subscription-based services, while Verizon recognizes equipment revenue at the point of delivery and service revenue over the enforceable contract term.",

However, it inaccurately generalizes Google's approach as 'similar' to Verizon's, whereas the ground truth specifies that Google determines SSP based on actual prices charged to customers, which may differ in nature from Verizon's specific methodologies. The LLM also incorrectly implies that Google spreads equipment revenue over the contract term, but the ground truth states Google recognizes subscription service revenue ratably—there is no mention of Google deferring device revenue over time, which is a key distinction. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors in numbers, dates, or calculations. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly synthesizes that SSP estimation affects revenue timing and that allocation drives recognition patterns. However, it fails to correctly contrast Google’s ratable recognition (for services) with Verizon’s point-in-time equipment recognition, instead suggesting both spread device revenue over time, which misrepresents Google’s pattern.

      "original_answer": "Chevron explicitly lists 'changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins' as a key risk factor that could materially affect their results, indicating their financial exposure to margin volatility. ExxonMobil, in its impairment testing process, relies heavily on assumptions about future refining and chemical margins to estimate asset cash flows. If refining margins decline, this could trigger asset impairment charges for ExxonMobil, while simultaneously negatively impacting Chevron’s operational results. Therefore, both companies are financially vulnerable to margin declines, with Chevron facing direct earnings risk and ExxonMobil facing potential asset devaluations.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Chevron and ExxonMobil disclose that declining industry margins—whether from lower refining spreads or weaker chemical pricing—can trigger asset impairments and impair the recoverability of long‑lived assets.

There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10 by default. The qualitative accuracy is slightly reduced because the LLM answer does not fully differentiate the distinct risk mechanisms between the two companies as clearly as the ground truth: Chevron is exposed to direct earnings impacts from margin volatility (listed as a risk factor), while ExxonMobil’s exposure is more specific to impairment testing (reliance on margin assumptions in cash flow forecasts). The LLM generalizes both under impairment risk without highlighting Chevron's broader operational sensitivity versus ExxonMobil's asset valuation risk.

      "llm_answer": "The combined net change in accounts payable and other liabilities for AXP and BLK in 2023 was an increase of $5,065 million for AXP and $13,109 million for BLK, compared with increases of $8,815 million for AXP and $12,133 million for BLK in 2022.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors. According to the ground truth, AXP had a $5,065 million increase in 2023 (correctly stated), but BLK had only a $375 million increase in other liabilities in 2023 — not $13,109 million as claimed. Similarly, BLK’s 2022 change was a $481 million decrease, not a $12,133 million increase. The LLM completely fabricates large numbers for BLK that are orders of magnitude off. (2) The combined 2023 net change should be $5,065M (AXP) + $375M (BLK) = $5,440M (ground truth reports $5,274M, likely due to rounding or specific line-item definitions), but the LLM implies a total of over $18B, which is wildly incorrect. The 2022 combined value in ground truth is $8,815M (AXP) – $481M (BLK) = $8,334M, whereas LLM reports nonsensical increases for BLK. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly retrieve or synthesize BLK’s liability changes; instead, it invents values. It also fails to note that BLK’s 2022 change was a decrease, not an increase. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure of the response matches the question (comparing 2023 vs 2022 for both firms), but the data is almost entirely inaccurate for BLK. Due to severe quantitative and qualitative errors, the correctness score is very low.",

The LLM instead states CVX had a deficit of $3,047 million and XOM $5,236 million, which are not only incorrect individually but also reverse the relative sizes of the deficits.

While the sum is correct, the component values do not align with the ground truth breakdown (the original data likely has different splits). (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially compromised because although the final combined total is accurate ($60.7B), it is derived from incorrect constituent figures.

      "original_answer": "Oracle emphasizes the need to generate sufficient taxable income in specific jurisdictions to realize deferred tax assets, factoring in future growth, forecasted earnings, taxable income, jurisdictional mix, historical earnings, and tax planning strategies. Texas Instruments, on the other hand, focuses on external factors such as changes in U.S. or international tax laws and market conditions that could affect future taxable income, leading to adjustments in valuation allowances. Both companies tie changes in valuation allowances directly to net income in the period of determination, but Oracle includes potential adjustments to goodwill during acquisition measurement periods, while Texas Instruments highlights sensitivity to customer demand, technology shifts, and inventory write-offs as additional sources of financial uncertainty.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle’s approach to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax asset valuation emphasizes the need to assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets through projected taxable income and to record valuation allowances when such recovery is not likely, with adjustments to goodwill permitted during the measurement period for business‑combination tax contingencies. Texas Instruments similarly evaluates the likelihood of realizing deferred tax assets but focuses on segment‑level profitability and market conditions to judge recoverability, and it also adjusts its tax valuation allowances when new information alters the estimated realizability of those assets. Consequently, while both companies use comparable GAAP criteria, Oracle’s larger, more complex global structure leads it to rely more heavily on overall projected taxable income and goodwill adjustments, whereas Texas Instruments leans on segment‑specific cash‑flow forecasts and market‑driven assumptions, resulting in different impacts on the timing and magnitude of tax expense recognized in their financial reports.",

It accurately captures that Oracle focuses on projected taxable income, jurisdictional mix, forecasted earnings, and allows goodwill adjustments during acquisition measurement periods—key points from the original answer. Texas Instruments' emphasis on market conditions and segment-level profitability is consistent with the ground truth's mention of customer demand, technology shifts, and inventory write-offs as sources of uncertainty. The LLM correctly notes that both companies adjust valuation allowances based on new information and that these changes impact net income directly. However, the LLM omits specific mention of Texas Instruments' sensitivity to changes in U.S. or international tax laws and instead generalizes to market conditions and segment profitability, which, while related, does not fully capture the regulatory dimension emphasized in the original. Additionally, while the LLM mentions Oracle’s global complexity and goodwill adjustments, it does not explicitly reference historical earnings or tax planning strategies, which are part of Oracle’s stated considerations. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect by default, as no numbers are involved), and the reasoning is sound and contextually appropriate.

According to the ground truth, NextEra Energy's 2023 Noncurrent Regulatory Assets were $4,801 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports $4,343 million. Similarly, the LLM uses $5,484 million for NEE’s 2022 value, whereas the correct figure is $5,992 million. These errors directly impact downstream calculations. The combined total is reported as $18,961 million by the LLM, but the correct total is $18,419 million ($13,618 + $4,801), making the LLM's sum inaccurate by $542 million.

The LLM concludes the gap widened by $117 million, but in reality, the difference increased from $8,653M to $8,817M — a change of +$164M (not -$164M as stated in the original answer; note: the original answer incorrectly states the change as -$164M, but since $8,817 - $8,653 = +$164M, this is a positive increase). However, even with this correction, the LLM’s entire calculation base is wrong due to incorrect inputs.

(2) The quantitative values are wrong: it reports MMM's margin as 9.0% (vs. true value 22.6%) and calculates a difference of 0 basis points (vs. correct 1,360 bps). The calculation itself (0 bps) is only correct based on incorrect inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model should have retrieved MMM's margin from MMM's 10-K and UPS's from UPS's 10-K, then compared them. Instead, it used UPS's document to incorrectly assign the same margin to MMM, showing a failure in entity-metric mapping and cross-document synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is low because it misidentifies the source and entity, but it does attempt to address the question structure (comparing margins and computing basis points), warranting a minimal score for relevance.",

      "original_answer": "META paid $4.38 billion for Class A and $691 million for Class B in total dividends and dividend equivalents in 2024, resulting in a $3.69 billion difference between the two classes. Meanwhile, CMCSA repurchased 212 million shares of Class A common stock for $8.6 billion and increased its dividend by $0.08 to $1.24 per share annually in January 2024, showing a more aggressive shareholder return strategy focused on both buybacks and dividend growth.",

In contrast, CMCSA’s shareholder‑return strategy in 2024 emphasized share repurchases (≈$8.6 billion of Class A stock) and a dividend increase (to $1.24 per share), rather than differentiating payouts between its own Class A and Class B shares.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors. It incorrectly states Oracle's beginning cash and cash equivalents as $4,631 million, which is actually Texas Instruments' ending balance. Oracle's correct beginning balance is $30,098 million, not $4,631 million. Texas Instruments' beginning balance is correctly stated as $3,107 million. The combined beginning total is therefore incorrectly calculated as $7,738 million instead of the correct $33,205 million. The ending balances are partially correct: Oracle's $21,383 million and Texas Instruments' $4,631 million are accurate, and their sum of $26,014 million is correct. However, the comparison is flawed because the beginning total is wrong. (2) Calculations: The LLM incorrectly sums $4,631 + $3,107 = $7,738, which reflects a misattribution of Oracle's beginning value. The correct beginning sum is $30,098 + $3,107 = $33,205 million. The ending sum of $26,014 million is correct. The net change should be a decrease of $7,191 million, but this is not mentioned. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly identify and synthesize the correct beginning balances from two different companies across different fiscal year-ends. It confuses Oracle's ending balance with its beginning balance, breaking the multi-hop logic. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3) due to major numerical and entity-level errors.

In contrast, Gulf Power maintains a 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel alongside Mississippi Power, where Mississippi Power operates the facility on Gulf Power's behalf under an agreement.

      "original_answer": "MetLife's preferred stock dividends of $195 million in 2021 directly reduce the net income available to common shareholders, which was $6,353 million in that year. This highlights the financial obligation companies in the financial sector face in maintaining preferred dividend payments. Meanwhile, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) discloses several risk factors, such as regulatory constraints, capital adequacy requirements, and the potential impact of economic weakness or cybersecurity incidents, which could materially affect its ability to generate sufficient earnings and maintain dividend payments. Together, these factors imply that while preferred dividends are a binding obligation, broader operational and regulatory risks at firms like BK could constrain their ability to sustain such payments, thereby affecting the stability of shareholder returns across the financial sector.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of preferred stock dividends on MetLife's net income available to common shareholders is evident in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, where dividends on preferred stock of $195 million in 2021 (down from $202 million in 2020) are subtracted after net income to arrive at $6.353 billion of income available to common shareholders. This reduction is relevant because, as highlighted in Bank of New York Mellon’s risk factors (pages 3‑4), the parent’s ability to pay dividends—and thus support MetLife’s shareholder returns—can be constrained by regulatory requirements, capital adequacy rules, and the need to maintain sufficient liquidity. Consequently, while MetLife has continued to generate ample earnings, the stability of its shareholder returns is tied to the broader financial sector’s capacity to meet regulatory and capital constraints that could limit dividend payments.",

The formatting difference ($6.353 billion vs $6,353 million) is acceptable and semantically equivalent. (2) All quantitative values are accurate—preferred dividends and net income figures are correctly cited with proper year (2021). No calculations are required beyond recognition of subtraction, which is correctly implied. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is largely sound: it connects MetLife’s dividend obligations to the impact on common shareholders and links this to Bank of New York Mellon’s risk factors affecting dividend capacity. However, the LLM incorrectly implies that BK supports MetLife’s shareholder returns, which is not stated or implied in the ground truth—these are separate companies with no disclosed parent-subsidiary or financial support relationship. This is a minor but notable logical misstep in synthesis. (4) Despite this, the core reasoning about regulatory, capital, and liquidity constraints affecting dividend stability in the financial sector is well-aligned with the original answer. The answer is contextually relevant, comprehensive, and conveys the same overall implication about sector-wide dividend stability risks. The error in implying a financial linkage between BK and MetLife prevents a perfect score, but factual and numerical accuracy remains high.",

      "original_answer": "AXP recognizes Card Member Rewards expense in the period when members earn rewards, recording a liability based on expected redemptions and estimated cost of points, particularly for Membership Rewards, while COF records rewards expense as an offset to interchange income when rewards are earned and calculates its liability based on estimated future redemption costs, factoring in historical redemption behavior and program terms. These differences reflect distinct approaches to timing and estimation methodology in recognizing rewards-related costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2023 10-K disclosures, Card Member Rewards (AXP) and Customer Rewards (COF) differ significantly in their accounting treatment:  \n\n1. **Expense Recognition Timing**: AXP recognizes Card Member Rewards expense when rewards are earned (i.e., when Card Members spend on enrolled products), recording a liability for expected future redemptions based on historical redemption patterns and program terms. COF, however, recognizes Customer Rewards expense only when rewards are redeemed or when the liability is adjusted for expected redemption (e.g., via the \"customer rewards reserve\" methodology), with the expense offsetting interchange income and tied to actual redemption behavior.  \n\n2. **Liability Calculation**: AXP calculates its rewards liability using historical redemption rates, program-specific assumptions, and enrollment/attrition trends, with changes in the liability directly impacting rewards expense. COF determines its reserve using historical redemption data, spending patterns, and program terms, reducing the reserve as rewards are redeemed and adjusting for expected future redemption costs. Both use estimates, but AXP’s liability is explicitly tied to \"rewards that are expected to be redeemed,\" while COF’s reserve is described as a \"computed based estimate of future cost of earned rewards expected to be redeemed.\"  \n\nThese distinctions reflect AXP’s focus on membership-based rewards (e.g., Membership Rewards) versus COF’s broader customer rewards framework, with AXP’s approach emphasizing proactive liability accrual for future redemptions and COF’s relying on actual redemption offsets to revenue.",

COF records Customer Rewards expense as an offset to interchange income when rewards are earned, with liability based on estimated future redemption costs using historical behavior and program terms. The LLM correctly captures these distinctions in timing and methodology. (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences between two companies' accounting treatments from their respective 10-Ks, correctly identifying AXP’s accrual-based, forward-looking approach versus COF’s redemption-linked, reserve-adjusted method. The explanation of liability calculation for both firms reflects the correct estimation frameworks. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to slight overstatement that COF recognizes expense only 'when rewards are redeemed'—the ground truth indicates expense is recognized when rewards are *earned*, not redeemed, though it is offset against interchange income.

This combined financial obligation indicates that Netflix bears a significantly larger interest burden, suggesting a more aggressive debt-financed strategy, particularly for content investment, compared to AT&T’s smaller interest payment, which may reflect a more conservative or mature capital structure.",
      "llm_answer": "The total interest paid by Netflix in 2023 was $684.5 million, as disclosed in its consolidated statement of cash flows (page 41), while AT&T reported $7,578 million of interest expense for 2023 (page 96). Combined, this reflects Netflix’s relatively modest financing costs compared with AT&T’s substantially larger debt service obligations, underscoring AT&T’s heavier reliance on debt financing and a more aggressive capital‑expenditure strategy, whereas Netflix’s lower interest outlay aligns with its conservative leverage approach and focus on funding content growth through operating cash flow.",

While Netflix's interest payment of $684.5 million ($684,504,000) is correct and matches the ground truth, AT&T's interest expense is grossly misstated as $7,578 million ($7.578 billion), whereas the correct amount is $7,370,000 (~$7.37 million). This is a 100x overstatement. The combined total interest is therefore incorrectly implied to be over $8.2 billion, while the correct total is $691,874,000. (2) Calculations are completely off due to the erroneous AT&T figure. The LLM claims AT&T has a 'substantially larger debt service' than Netflix, when in fact Netflix pays over 93x more in interest. This reverses the entire financial interpretation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model misreads AT&T’s number—likely confusing millions with thousands or misreading the financial statement. The conclusion about AT&T having a more aggressive debt strategy is the opposite of the truth. In reality, Netflix’s high interest reflects its aggressive debt-financed content strategy, while AT&T’s low interest suggests conservative or reduced leverage.

      "original_answer": "Comcast incurs programming and content production costs primarily through multiyear distribution agreements with per-subscriber fees, and its monetization strategy focuses on individual content licensing and distribution. In contrast, Meta's content costs are embedded within broader cost of revenue and tied to infrastructure and partner arrangements, reflecting its ad-based and platform-driven monetization model. These differences show that Comcast's content costs are directly tied to subscriber growth and contractual programming fees, while Meta's are more aligned with maintaining technical infrastructure and platform partnerships to support ad delivery and product monetization.",
      "llm_answer": "The differences in content cost structures reflect distinct monetization strategies: Comcast capitalizes and amortizes owned and licensed film/television content using individual title or usage-based methods tied to revenue forecasts, with impairment testing on a title or channel basis, while Meta treats most licensed video and music costs as immediate expenses (expensed when licensed or over the contract period) and does not capitalize content costs, aligning with its advertising-driven, short-cycle revenue model.

It correctly identifies that Comcast capitalizes and amortizes content costs using title- or usage-based methods with impairment testing, while Meta expenses content costs immediately or over the contract period and does not capitalize them. This aligns with their respective monetization models—Comcast's long-term content licensing and distribution versus Meta's ad-driven, short-cycle platform model. However, the LLM answer diverges from the original (ground truth) answer by focusing more on accounting treatment (capitalization vs. expensing) rather than the contractual obligations and cost structure drivers emphasized in the ground truth—specifically, Comcast's per-subscriber programming fees and multiyear distribution agreements versus Meta's infrastructure- and partnership-based cost of revenue. While related, these are distinct aspects: the original answer emphasizes *why* costs arise (contractual structures) and how they align with monetization, whereas the LLM focuses on *how* costs are recognized (accounting policy). This is a meaningful omission in completeness and reasoning, as it fails to synthesize the contractual and structural drivers behind the cost differences, which were central to the question. Despite this, the LLM provides a coherent, relevant, and semantically plausible comparison that captures a key dimension of the difference in monetization strategies.

In the Filorga unit, pandemic‑driven reductions in duty‑free, travel‑retail and pharmacy sales prompted an interim quantitative impairment test that resulted in a $204 million trademark write‑down and a $367 million goodwill impairment, directly lowering the carrying value of those indefinite‑lived assets.  By contrast, PepsiCo’s impairment discussion notes that, aside from the Filorga case, its reporting units’ fair values substantially exceed carrying values and that indefinite‑lived intangible assets other than Filorga exceed their recorded values by at least 20%, indicating that COVID‑19‑related demand shifts have not triggered comparable impairment charges for PepsiCo’s long‑lived brands.  Consequently, while Colgate‑Palmolive recorded material impairments tied to pandemic‑induced market disruptions, PepsiCo’s indefinite‑lived intangible assets remained largely insulated from such impacts.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the quantitative details. The ground truth states that Colgate-Palmolive recorded a $204 million impairment charge for the Filorga trademark, reducing its carrying value to $588 million. However, the LLM incorrectly adds a $367 million goodwill impairment, which is not mentioned in the original answer and introduces a fact not supported by the provided truth. There is no mention of goodwill impairment in the ground truth, only a trademark impairment. Additionally, the LLM implies that PepsiCo discussed the Filorga case in its impairment analysis, which is factually incorrect—Filorga is a Colgate-Palmolive asset, not a PepsiCo one. This misattribution severely undermines the accuracy. (2) The $204 million trademark write-down is correctly cited, but the additional $367 million goodwill charge is unsupported and incorrect. The claim that PepsiCo’s intangible assets exceed recorded values by 20% is not present in the original answer and appears fabricated. No such percentage or comparison was made in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—both companies are assessed for pandemic impacts on indefinite-lived intangible assets—but the synthesis fails due to the conflation of Filorga with PepsiCo. The model incorrectly treats Filorga as a PepsiCo asset when comparing, which breaks the logical chain. The correct reasoning should contrast Colgate’s specific vulnerability via Filorga with PepsiCo’s broader resilience, without implying PepsiCo evaluated Filorga. (4) Despite the serious quantitative and entity errors, the answer captures the core qualitative contrast: Colgate took impairment charges due to pandemic-sensitive channels, while PepsiCo did not report such charges, relying on forecasting models. The structure and intent align with the question, and the contextual relevance is high. However, the introduction of false numbers and misattribution of assets reduces the correctness score significantly.",

      "original_answer": "Adobe's Product Revenue accounted for only 4% of total revenue in 2021, while Cisco's Product Revenue represented 73.7% of total revenue in 2022. This significant difference highlights Adobe's transition to a subscription-based model where they derived 92% of revenue from subscriptions, compared to Cisco's continued reliance on product sales as a core part of their business model.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe's Digital Experience revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, driven primarily by subscription‑based revenue from its Experience Cloud platform and the Workfront acquisition, reflecting a strategy that monetizes software through recurring subscription fees. In contrast, Cisco reports only a 6% increase in total product revenue (with a modest 5% rise in its Americas segment) and does not break out a distinct Digital Experience segment, indicating a more traditional, license‑centric model that relies heavily on perpetual on‑premise licenses and a smaller, slower‑growing subscription component. Consequently, Adobe’s higher and faster‑growing subscription‑derived product revenue percentage signals a shift toward a subscription‑first monetization approach, whereas Cisco’s lower, more modest product‑revenue growth underscores its continued emphasis on conventional licensing and services.",

It incorrectly states Adobe's Digital Experience revenue as $3.87 billion with 24% YoY growth, which is not relevant to the question about Product Revenue percentage of total revenue. The ground truth specifies that Adobe's Product Revenue was only 4% of total revenue in 2021, while the LLM does not mention this key percentage at all. Similarly, for Cisco, the ground truth states that Product Revenue was 73.7% of total revenue in 2022, but the LLM fails to provide this percentage and instead mentions a 6% increase in product revenue without specifying what share it constitutes of total revenue. These omissions and misdirections severely impact quantitative accuracy. (2) The dollar amounts, percentages, and growth rates cited (e.g., 24%, $3.87 billion, 6% increase) are either unverifiable from the ground truth or irrelevant to the core comparison of Product Revenue as a percentage of total revenue. No correct calculation or citation of the critical 4% (Adobe) and 73.7% (Cisco) figures is present. (3) While the LLM correctly infers a qualitative difference in monetization strategies—Adobe’s shift to subscriptions versus Cisco’s reliance on traditional licensing—it fails the multi-hop requirement of synthesizing the exact revenue composition percentages from each company’s disclosures to support that conclusion. The reasoning is directionally sound but lacks grounding in the required data points. (4) Despite incorrect and missing quantitative data, the answer remains contextually relevant by addressing software monetization strategies and contrasting subscription vs. license models.

It also accurately notes that these deposits are treated as restricted cash and offset by liabilities on the balance sheet, which matches the Original Answer. However, the LLM introduces 'restricted cash for litigation settlement' as a type of security deposit, which is not mentioned in the ground truth and may conflate separate disclosures; this detail is unsupported and potentially misleading. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default since no numbers are misstated.

It also omits AIG’s context of security deposits being part of broader real estate-related reserves (e.g., replacement reserve deposits), weakening the comparative analysis. (4) Despite these omissions and the introduction of an unverified deposit type, the answer remains contextually relevant and captures the core distinction: Mastercard provides specific, structured disclosures about customer security deposits that AIG does not.

The higher salary increase assumption at NEE implies a faster-growing benefit obligation compared to DUK, which could lead to a larger liability on NEE's financial statements if other actuarial assumptions (like discount rate and employee demographics) are held constant. This contrast in salary increase assumptions suggests that NEE may be recognizing a more aggressive growth in employee compensation, which would increase the present value of pension obligations more significantly than under DUK's more moderate and consistent assumptions.",

It correctly identifies that DUK has a consistent salary increase range over the past three years and that NEE reported a single value in 2023. However, it fails to report the actual numerical values: DUK’s range of 3.50%–4.00% and NEE’s 4.90% assumption. These specific percentages are critical for assessing the impact on benefit obligations, and their absence constitutes a major omission. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM does not mention any numbers at all, making it impossible to verify or compare the magnitude of the assumptions. This is a significant failure in quantitative accuracy, especially since the question hinges on comparing specific percentage values and their financial implications. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—acknowledging that salary increase assumptions affect projected benefit obligations—but mischaracterizes the implications. The LLM suggests that a 'broader range' introduces 'more variability', which is misleading; actuarial valuations use point estimates or deterministic assumptions, not ranges, for projections. The range reported by DUK likely reflects disclosure of sensitivity or policy, not direct input into valuation models. In contrast, the ground truth correctly explains that NEE’s higher 4.90% assumption leads to faster-growing liabilities compared to DUK’s more moderate assumptions, which is the correct economic interpretation. The LLM fails to make this comparative impact analysis. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response stays on topic and discusses benefit obligation valuations and assumptions—but lacks the necessary depth and factual foundation to fully address the multi-hop nature of the question (comparing specific assumptions across firms and inferring financial statement impacts).

The ground truth states that the combined percentage change in the debt to capital ratio from 2023 to 2024 for COP and XOM is -1.0 percentage points, but the LLM claims it is +27 percentage points, which is wildly inaccurate. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states that ExxonMobil (XOM) had a lower ratio (13.4%) than ConocoPhillips (COP) at 16.4%, while the ground truth clearly states that COP had a lower ratio of 27% compared to XOM’s 13.4% — however, this too presents a contradiction, as 13.4% is actually lower than 27%. Upon closer inspection, the original answer likely contains a typo: stating that COP had a lower ratio (27%) than XOM (13.4%) is factually impossible since 13.4% < 27%. Therefore, the correct interpretation should be that XOM had the lower ratio (13.4%) vs COP (27%) in 2024. Despite this inconsistency in the ground truth, the LLM still fails completely on the quantitative aspect. (2) The LLM invents numbers not present in the ground truth: it claims a change from 13.4% to 16.4%, implying a +3pp change for one company, and then asserts a combined change of +27pp, which is nonsensical and mathematically invalid. There is no support for these values. The actual combined percentage point change is -1.0pp according to the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is completely flawed. The model fails to compute or report the correct change for either company, does not sum or combine the changes appropriately, and misidentifies which company had the lower ratio despite contradicting its own numbers. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the model attempts to address the right companies (COP and XOM), the right metric (debt-to-capital ratio), and the correct time frame (2023 to 2024). However, all substantive content is factually wrong. Quantitative accuracy is extremely poor due to fabricated numbers and incorrect calculations.

This contrasts with SPG's exposure to leasing risks from e-commerce growth and public health crises, which can reduce consumer foot traffic, lower tenant performance, and result in store closures or underreported sales.

      "question": "How does the investment strategy of XOM in new fields, as reflected in its 2023 capital expenditures, relate to COP's reserve replacement performance in 2023, and what does this imply about their respective approaches to sustaining production?",
      "original_answer": "XOM invested $26.3 billion in capital and exploration expenditures in 2023 to support the development of new fields and mitigate natural field decline through disciplined investments. Meanwhile, COP achieved a reserve replacement rate of 123% in 2023, driven by development drilling, extensions, discoveries, and purchases. This indicates that while both companies focus on sustaining production through new field development, XOM emphasizes large-scale capital investment in a diverse portfolio, whereas COP highlights successful reserve additions through a mix of exploration and acquisitions. The combined evidence suggests differing strategic emphases: XOM prioritizes proactive investment in future capacity, while COP emphasizes effective reserve management and replacement efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "Both ExxonMobil (XOM) and ConocoPhillips (COP) are prioritizing reserve replacement and capital investment to sustain production, but they approach it differently. XOM’s 2023 capital expenditures ($11.0–$11.5 bn) and reserve replacement strategy focus on maintaining production through disciplined, cost‑controlled investments and incremental reserve growth, while COP’s 2023 reserve replacement of 123 % (organic 96 %) reflects a stronger net increase in proved reserves driven by acquisitions, enhanced recovery and new field development. Consequently, XOM emphasizes steady, cash‑generating investments to fund shareholder returns and incremental production, whereas COP pursues aggressive reserve‑building activities to ensure long‑term production sustainability.",

It states XOM's 2023 capital expenditures as $11.0–$11.5 billion, whereas the ground truth reports $26.3 billion—a major discrepancy that undermines the core of the multi-hop analysis. This error directly affects the validity of any strategic comparison based on investment scale. (2) The reserve replacement rate for COP (123%) is correctly reported, and the mention of organic replacement at 96% aligns with plausible data (though not in the ground truth provided, so cannot be confirmed as correct here). However, the incorrect capex figure for XOM invalidates the comparative financial context. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—LLM attempts to contrast XOM’s strategy of disciplined investment with COP’s aggressive reserve building, which is consistent with the ground truth’s interpretation. It correctly identifies that both companies aim to sustain production but through different emphases. However, due to the incorrect capex number, the synthesis is based on flawed premises. The model also introduces 'organic 96%' and 'enhanced recovery' not present in the original answer, adding unsupported detail. (4) Despite the reasoning being logically structured and contextually relevant, the severe quantitative error in XOM’s capital expenditure significantly reduces factual correctness. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the strategic framing is plausible, and contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question and attempts proper multi-hop synthesis between XOM's investments and COP's reserve performance.",

It reports $1,250 million as the combined fair value, whereas the ground truth is $3,106 million. The ADBE amount cited ($750 million) does not match the correct breakdown of $693 million (1-2 years) and $443 million (2-3 years), totaling $1,136 million. The CSCO amount is reported as $500 million, but the correct value is $2,240 million due between 1-3 years. (2) The calculations are flawed: the LLM sums only $750M + $500M = $1,250M, which is not only based on wrong inputs but also fails to include all relevant tranches of debt. Additionally, referencing specific notes (e.g., '2.60% notes maturing February 28, 2023') introduces overly specific details not aligned with the aggregated 'Intermediate-Term Debt due between one and three years' metric in the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is poorly executed: the model fails to correctly identify and aggregate ADBE’s two time buckets (1-2 and 2-3 years) and significantly underreports CSCO’s obligation. It appears to conflate short-term maturities (some possibly within one year) rather than covering the full 1-3 year horizon.

      "original_answer": "CAT's 2022 10-K highlights that economic weakness could lead to increased goodwill and asset impairment charges due to reduced demand for its products and services, particularly in cyclical industries like energy, transportation, and mining. This implies a causal link between macroeconomic downturns and financial charges for CAT. In contrast, UPS disclosed in its 2022 10-K that it reports operating profit and other financial metrics excluding the impact of goodwill and asset impairment charges, indicating a strategy to adjust for such one-time financial impacts when evaluating performance. This shows that while CAT's operations are vulnerable to economic conditions that may trigger impairments, UPS proactively excludes such charges to provide a clearer view of ongoing operational performance.",

In contrast, UPS's 2022 10-K (pages 29–33) explicitly details how it excluded transformation costs, goodwill/asset impairments, and divestiture impacts from its non-GAAP metrics, and notes that impairment charges were assessed but not materially affecting 2022 results—unlike the 2020 pension mark-to-market volatility UPS highlighted.

It correctly identifies CAT's exposure to economic conditions in 2022—such as recession risks, commodity volatility, and supply chain issues—that could lead to goodwill or asset impairments due to reduced demand, particularly in cyclical sectors. It accurately notes that CAT’s 2022 10-K discusses risk factors but does not report actual impairment charges for that year, which is consistent with the original answer’s implication of vulnerability without confirmation of charges. On the UPS side, the LLM correctly states that UPS excluded goodwill and asset impairment charges from its non-GAAP metrics in its 2022 10-K, emphasizing a strategy of adjusting for such items to assess operational performance—directly matching the core comparison in the ground truth. The LLM adds contextual detail (e.g., reference to transformation costs, divestitures, and 2020 pension volatility) not in the original answer but supported by UPS disclosures, enhancing completeness without introducing error. Quantitatively, there are no numerical claims (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages), so accuracy is not compromised. The minor deduction in qualitative accuracy is because the LLM slightly reframes the contrast: while the original answer emphasizes CAT’s *potential* for impairments due to economic sensitivity versus UPS’s *disclosure practice* of excluding them, the LLM focuses more on the absence of 2022 charges at CAT and UPS’s non-reporting of material impacts, which is accurate but slightly shifts emphasis from the structural difference in how each company treats impairments (one vulnerable to triggers, the other adjusts for them).

In contrast, ConocoPhillips integrates undeveloped acreage as a core component of its proved reserves disclosures, signaling a broader, more integrated approach to reserve reporting that includes future development potential.

This contrast indicates that ExxonMobil is scaling back its non‑producing land base, likely focusing on core assets and development efficiency, whereas ConocoPhillips is aggressively adding undeveloped acreage to secure future production growth.

However, the LLM claims a global reduction from 63,045 to 61,948 thousand acres, which is not supported by the original data and misrepresents both the magnitude and geographic scope of the change. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states that ConocoPhillips' undeveloped acreage increased from 41,252 to 63,045 thousand acres in 2024, directly copying ExxonMobil's incorrect total acreage numbers and falsely attributing them to ConocoPhillips. There is no evidence in the ground truth that ConocoPhillips reported such a numerical change in acreage.\n\n2) Quantitatively, the numbers are entirely incorrect. The LLM fabricates totals not present in the original answer and performs calculations (e.g., net reduction of 1,097 thousand acres) based on false inputs.

The conclusion that ExxonMobil is 'scaling back' aligns loosely with the ground truth's 'strategic reduction', but the characterization of ConocoPhillips as 'aggressively adding' acreage due to acquisition activity is unsupported. The ground truth emphasizes ConocoPhillips’ *inclusion* of undeveloped acreage in proved reserves reporting as a methodological difference, not necessarily a physical expansion of holdings. Thus, the reasoning misinterprets the nature of the comparison—reporting practice vs. physical acreage change.\n\n4) Despite the factual errors, the LLM does address the comparative aspect of the question and attempts to infer strategic implications, maintaining some contextual relevance.

In contrast, SPG faces significant uncertainty in tenant leasing due to risks like oversupply reducing market rents, e-commerce competition impacting occupancy rates, and safety concerns affecting consumer foot traffic.

AMT's revenue is anchored by long-term leases with contractual escalations (averaging ~3% annually) and low churn (~3% in 2023), driven by limited alternative sites and high renewal rates, ensuring predictable cash flow. In contrast, SPG faces elevated churn risks, particularly from T-Mobile lease cancellations under its master lease agreement, which could disrupt revenue stability, while its tenant concentration in key accounts (e.g., AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon in the U.S. & Canada) amplifies vulnerability to customer-specific financial or operational shifts.

However, it introduces a fact not present in the ground truth—T-Mobile lease cancellations under a master lease agreement—which is inaccurate for SPG and misrepresents the source of its churn risk. SPG’s risks stem from retail-specific factors like e-commerce competition, oversupply, and foot traffic concerns, not telecom carrier lease cancellations. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly frames SPG’s tenants as being concentrated in AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon, which applies to AMT, not SPG. This is a significant entity and factual error. (2) Quantitatively, the ~3% escalation and ~3% churn for AMT are consistent with the ground truth, but the $60 billion in non-cancellable revenue—a key figure in the original—is omitted.

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's shift in product mix between its Graphics and Compute & Networking segments in fiscal year 2022 create differential gross margin impacts that could present opportunities or challenges for Texas Instruments' Embedded Processing business?",
      "original_answer": "NVIDIA experienced a 64.9% overall gross margin in fiscal year 2022, up from 62.3% in fiscal year 2021. This improvement was primarily driven by a higher-end mix within Graphics, which saw its gross margin increase. However, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced a gross margin decline due to a shift in product mix. Texas Instruments' Embedded Processing revenue and operating profit increased in 2022 primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Given that both companies operate in the semiconductor space and serve overlapping markets (e.g., automotive, industrial, and computing), NVIDIA's product mix shift and margin dynamics could signal market demand changes that may create opportunities for Texas Instruments to capitalize on or face increased competition in embedded processing applications.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s shift toward a higher‑end, more compute‑intensive product mix—especially within its Graphics segment—generated a higher gross margin on those sales, while the Compute & Networking segment experienced a lower gross margin due to a mix shift toward lower‑margin networking and automotive products. This differential margin impact created pricing and profitability pressures for Texas Instruments’ Embedded Processing business, which must compete with NVIDIA’s higher‑margin graphics offerings and the lower‑margin compute mix that can compress overall industry gross margins.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains partial factual correctness but misses key quantitative details from the ground truth. It correctly identifies that NVIDIA's Graphics segment benefited from a higher-end product mix leading to higher gross margins and that Compute & Networking saw margin pressure due to mix shift. However, it fails to include the actual gross margin figures for NVIDIA in fiscal year 2022 (64.9%) and 2021 (62.3%), which are central to the original answer and required for full accuracy. These omissions significantly reduce quantitative accuracy. (2) No calculations are presented or required, but the absence of specific margin percentages—critical data points—constitutes a major gap. The LLM vaguely references 'higher' and 'lower' margins without grounding them in reported numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: it connects NVIDIA’s product mix shifts to potential implications for Texas Instruments’ Embedded Processing business. However, it incorrectly frames the impact as direct 'pricing and profitability pressures' and 'competition with NVIDIA’s higher-margin graphics offerings,' which misrepresents the relationship. The original answer notes that both companies serve overlapping markets and that NVIDIA’s dynamics could signal demand trends—creating opportunities or competitive dynamics—not direct margin pressure. The LLM overstates competitive pressure and misses that TI’s Embedded Processing actually grew in revenue and profit in 2022, suggesting resilience or opportunity rather than pressure. (4) Contextual relevance is strong because the answer addresses the semiconductor industry overlap and considers implications for TI. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct directional reasoning but flawed inference about competitive dynamics. Correctness score is 5 due to missing key facts, incorrect implications about competition, and lack of supporting data, despite some accurate conceptual elements.",

      "question": "How might the discontinuation of LIBOR impact both MetLife and BNY Mellon's borrowing costs and financial performance, considering their respective risk exposures?",
      "original_answer": "The discontinuation of LIBOR could increase borrowing costs and negatively impact financial performance for both MetLife and BNY Mellon. MetLife specifically notes that differences between LIBOR and alternative reference rates may impact the value and return on financial instruments, investments, and interest rates on debt, which could increase costs or reduce returns. BNY Mellon highlights that increased funding and borrowing costs could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Together, these risks suggest that both companies may face higher financing expenses and reduced profitability due to the LIBOR transition.",
      "llm_answer": "Both MetLife and BNY Mellon could see higher borrowing costs if LIBOR‑linked contracts lack robust fallback language, forcing them to refinance at less favorable rates and potentially weakening cash flows. For MetLife, the impact is amplified by its reliance on dividend‑linked funding and regulatory constraints on capital, while BNY Mellon’s diversified funding base may absorb shocks more readily but still faces higher debt‑service expenses and reduced competitiveness of its products if transition risks are not managed.",

There are no numeric values in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default. The LLM correctly identifies both companies and the nature of their exposure (borrowing costs, financial performance), satisfying entity accuracy and contextual relevance. However, the LLM introduces details not present in the original answer: (1) 'lack of robust fallback language' as a specific mechanism, (2) MetLife's 'reliance on dividend-linked funding and regulatory constraints on capital,' and (3) BNY Mellon's 'diversified funding base' and 'competitiveness of its products.' While plausible, these are not mentioned in the ground truth and represent speculative elaboration rather than evidence-based synthesis from the knowledge graph. The original answer focuses on direct impacts—differences between LIBOR and alternative rates affecting returns (MetLife) and material adverse effects from higher funding costs (BNY Mellon). The LLM answer adds reasoning layers not supported in the source, reducing qualitative accuracy. It correctly performs multi-hop reasoning by attributing risks to both firms, but overextends beyond the provided evidence. Thus, while the core conclusion aligns, the additional specificity lowers the correctness and qualitative scores despite strong relevance and no factual contradictions.",

However, according to the ground truth, the correct values must sum to $2,901 million, meaning the individual values cannot both be $1,529 million. (2) The quantitative error is significant: $1,529M + $1,529M = $3,058M is mathematically correct, but the inputs are wrong. The model incorrectly asserts that both ADBE and CSCO have the same net value of $1,529 million, which contradicts the ground truth.

It states AIG repurchased $706 million in shares, but the ground truth indicates AIG's repurchase value was $8,376.8 million (part of the $9,082.8 million total with MA). MA's repurchase amount is correctly stated as $9.032 billion (~$9,032 million), which is close to the ground truth. However, the total repurchase value is therefore incorrect: LLM implies ~$9,738 million total, while the correct total is $9,082.8 million. (2) The average price per share for MA ($379.49) is correct. However, the LLM incorrectly calculates AIG’s implied average price as ~$278 per share using an incorrect numerator ($14.1 billion, which is remaining authorization, not amount spent) and divides by 50.8 million shares. The correct implied average price for AIG is $561.02, derived from dividing the actual amount spent by shares repurchased. The LLM uses wrong data and flawed logic. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model must synthesize actual repurchase amounts and compute average prices using dollars spent and shares repurchased. The LLM confuses share repurchase authorization remaining with actual dollars spent, leading to a completely incorrect comparison. It also reverses the conclusion: it claims MA paid a higher average price than AIG, but in reality, AIG paid significantly more per share ($561.02 vs $379.49).

The LLM states that UPS’s 2021 net periodic benefit cost included a $3.3 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gain, which is not supported by the ground truth and introduces a specific number not present in the original answer. The original answer does not provide any specific dollar amount for UPS’s mark-to-market impact, so this figure is likely hallucinated. Additionally, the LLM misrepresents the $168 million figure: in the ground truth, this is the expected increase in CAT’s expense in 2022 *excluding* mark-to-market impacts, but the LLM presents it as the actual expected increase without clarifying that mark-to-market effects are excluded — a subtle but important distinction in context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model correctly contrasts CAT and UPS’s reporting practices and links mark-to-market treatment to pension cost trends. However, it fails to mention that CAT’s 2021 gains reduced expenses compared to 2020, which is a key part of the original answer and relevant context for the 2022 comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the response directly addresses both parts of the question. Qualitative accuracy is strong due to correct entity identification and conceptual explanation.

The original answer correctly states $2,966 million, which is material in the context of T's $50,661 million in total accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The LLM answer incorrectly minimizes the scale of T's liability by misrepresenting thousands instead of millions. (2) While the LLM correctly notes that NFLX did not separately disclose accrued participations and residuals and deemed them immaterial, it does not explicitly state that NFLX *disclosed* their immateriality, which is a key point in the ground truth. The original answer emphasizes that NFLX *stated* the amount was not material, which is a stronger and more precise claim than simply not presenting a line item. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the LLM draws a reasonable conclusion that the liability is material for T and likely immaterial for NFLX, which aligns with the original answer. However, it fails to quantify the significance of T's liability relative to its total payables (a key comparative point in the ground truth), missing a critical multi-hop synthesis element.

While it correctly identifies CMCSA's Federal Deferred Tax Expense as $2,126 million (a benefit, i.e., negative value), it incorrectly treats this as a positive amount in the calculation. Similarly, it correctly identifies META's expense as $67 million. However, the 'net difference' is calculated as $2,059 million, which is incorrect. The correct combined difference is -$2,193 million (i.e., -2,126 - 67), reflecting the total gap between a large benefit and a smaller expense. The LLM instead appears to have subtracted 67 from 2,126 and presented it as a positive net benefit, which misrepresents both the direction and the conceptual meaning of 'combined difference'. (2) Number verification: CMCSA: -$2,126M (correctly stated in ground truth as negative, but LLM writes '$2,126 million (a benefit)'—this is semantically acceptable if interpreted correctly, but the subsequent calculation shows misunderstanding). META: $67M (correct). Difference: LLM says $2,059M (incorrect); correct value is -$2,193M. The calculation error is significant and changes the interpretation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and interpret the contrast, which is good. However, the flawed calculation undermines the reasoning.

However, for Gilead Sciences, the LLM incorrectly states net identifiable assets as $2.166 billion (confusing it with UnitedHealth's figure) and claims a combined $1.335 billion for MiroBio, XinThera, and Tmunity — but the original answer only attributes $1,335 million to Gilead’s total identifiable net assets across recent acquisitions without specifying per-deal breakdowns. The LLM also incorrectly lists goodwill amounts per acquisition (e.g., $226M for MYR, $389M for MiroBio), which are not in the original answer and appear fabricated. The correct total goodwill for Gilead is $226 million relative to $1,335 million in net identifiable assets (ratio ~17%), but the LLM miscalculates this comparison by aggregating disparate figures. (2) Quantitative accuracy suffers due to incorrect allocation of goodwill across deals and misattribution of net identifiable assets. While UnitedHealth’s numbers are accurate, Gilead’s are distorted. The LLM incorrectly states Gilead’s net identifiable assets as $2.166 billion — a figure that belongs to UnitedHealth — indicating a critical data mix-up. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure — comparing goodwill to net identifiable assets — but fails in multi-hop synthesis because it conflates entity-specific data. It attempts to break down acquisitions individually but introduces unsupported figures, undermining the validity of the comparison. The conclusion that UnitedHealth has a much higher ratio is correct, but the path to that conclusion is flawed. (4) Scores reflect partial correctness: the UnitedHealth portion is accurate, but Gilead’s data is significantly misrepresented. Despite this, the answer remains contextually relevant and attempts a direct comparison as required by the question.",

      "original_answer": "HD's 2023 10-K filing defines ROIC as 'Return on invested capital,' without providing additional details about its calculation or use. In contrast, NKE's 2023 10-K filing describes ROIC as a performance measure that helps understand the company's ability to manage invested capital effectively and includes a specific calculation as of May 31, 2024, and 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "HD's 2023 10-K defines ROIC as a non-GAAP performance measure that reflects the company's ability to effectively manage invested capital, calculated using net income, interest expense (income), and income tax expense to derive earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), then adjusting for an income tax adjustment and dividing by average invested capital (total debt plus shareholder's equity less cash and equivalents). Specifically, HD reports a trailing twelve-month ROIC of 34.9% as of May 31, 2024, compared to 31.5% as of May 31, 2023, using the formula:  \nROIC = (EBIT × (1 - Effective Tax Rate)) / Average Invested Capital, where invested capital = Total debt + Shareholders' equity - Cash and equivalents.  \n\nIn contrast, NKE's 2023 10-K uses ROIC as a non-GAAP measure defined in its \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section, calculating it as Net income + Interest expense (income), net + Income tax expense, adjusted for an income tax adjustment, divided by Average invested capital (Total debt + Shareholders' equity - Cash and equivalents). NKE explicitly states its ROIC was 34.9% as of May 31, 2024, and 31.5% as of May 31, 2023, with the same formula structure but emphasizes that the calculation is based on the trailing four quarters ended May 31, 2024, and includes detailed adjustments for income tax. Both companies use identical ROIC formulas and metrics, but HD's definition is embedded within its broader non-GAAP financial measures discussion, while NKE's is explicitly detailed in its \"Return on Invested Capital\" subsection under \"Table of Contents\" and \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"",

(1) HD's 2023 10-K does not provide a detailed definition of ROIC, but the LLM falsely claims it defines ROIC with a full formula, including EBIT, tax adjustments, and invested capital components, and reports specific percentages (34.9% and 31.5%). These numbers and the formula are not present in HD's filing according to the ground truth. (2) The ground truth states that HD only names ROIC as 'Return on invested capital' without further details, but the LLM fabricates a comprehensive non-GAAP definition and calculation. (3) For NKE, while the ground truth confirms ROIC is described as a performance measure with a specific calculation as of May 31, 2024, and 2023, the LLM adds granular details (formula, components, tax adjustments) not confirmed in the original answer, making it appear more specific than warranted. (4) The claim that both companies use 'identical ROIC formulas' is unsupported by the ground truth, which only states that NKE provides a specific calculation while HD provides none. (5) Multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM invents technical details for HD that do not exist, leading to a false comparison. Although the LLM addresses both companies and the concept of ROIC, the factual inaccuracies in definitions, formulas, and metrics severely undermine correctness.

In contrast, TXN records unrealized gains and losses from available-for-sale debt securities as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with credit losses on these securities recorded as an allowance for credit losses in Operating Income and Expenses (OI&E).

Consequently, NVIDIA’s unrealized gains/losses can affect reported operating income through the income‑statement line items related to market‑able securities, while Texas Instruments’ unrealized gains/losses primarily affect equity via AOCI and do not materially influence operating income.",

According to the ground truth, NVDA explicitly states that unrealized gains and losses were 'not significant for all periods presented,' meaning they are immaterial and do not meaningfully affect financial statements. However, the LLM claims NVDA includes these in 'Other income (expense), net' and thus can impact operating income — this contradicts the original answer and misrepresents NVDA's disclosure. For TXN, the ground truth correctly states that unrealized gains/losses go to AOCI (affecting equity), while credit losses on available-for-sale securities are recorded in Operating Income and Expenses. The LLM incorrectly downplays TXN’s operating income exposure and misattributes the lack of material influence, when in fact credit losses do impact operating income. (2) There are no explicit numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not penalized — the issue lies in qualitative misinterpretation. Format and dates (2022) are correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize that NVDA treats unrealized items as immaterial (hence no real impact on income or equity), while TXN does recognize them systematically in AOCI and allows credit losses into operating income. Instead, it reverses or misattributes the income statement impacts. (4) Contextual relevance is fair — the response addresses both companies, the treatment of unrealized gains/losses, and attempts to compare effects on income and equity.

General Motors reports its ROIC-adjusted as based on EBIT-adjusted over average net assets, which includes adjustments for automotive debt, pension liabilities, and tax assets.

Nike’s ROIC definition adjusts earnings before interest and taxes for taxes and uses average invested capital that includes debt and equity but excludes cash, reflecting its focus on operating efficiency and capital allocation within its consumer‑direct model. GM’s ROIC similarly adjusts EBIT for specific items (e.g., interest, taxes, and one‑time adjustments) and uses a capital base that incorporates automotive debt and pension liabilities, highlighting its emphasis on managing a capital‑intensive automotive and financial services structure.

(2) The numbers cited for EBIT and invested capital do not align with the ground truth and appear fabricated or misattributed. The correct ROIC values per the knowledge graph are not reflected: Nike’s ROIC is correctly stated as 46.5%, but GM’s ROIC should be around 2.9%, not 14.2%.

This could materially affect AMT’s ability to maintain its own REIT status. Additionally, AMT would economically bear the federal income tax, penalties, and interest incurred by the subsidiary REIT. For SPG, failure of its subsidiary REITs to qualify would similarly disrupt its REIT compliance, particularly regarding income sourcing and asset composition, and could result in corporate-level taxes and a 4% nondeductible excise tax if distributions fall short.

However, the sum for PepsiCo is entirely wrong—there is no indication in the ground truth of expenditures near $1 billion; the correct sum is $4 million. The LLM likely misread or hallucinated data from a non-existent or incorrect source (e.g., referencing a 'Total' row in a table not present in the actual filings).

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect. (1) Quantitative Accuracy: The numbers provided are grossly inaccurate. The ground truth states BAC reported $284,325 million and C reported $6,971 million in 2024, totaling $291,296 million. The LLM incorrectly reports $4,599 million for BAC and $3,489 million for C, with a total of $8,088 million—less than 3% of the correct total. Additionally, the prior-year value for C is stated as $11,350 million in 2023 in the ground truth, but the LLM claims $3,489 million, which is both numerically wrong and illogically the same as its incorrect 2024 value. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s sum ($4,599 + $3,489 = $8,088) is arithmetically correct but based on false inputs, so the result is invalid. The claimed increase of $4,600 million is also incorrect—the actual increase from C’s 2023 value ($11,350 million) to the combined 2024 total ($291,296 million) is $279,946 million. (3) Qualitative Accuracy: The model fails to correctly identify the financial data for the entities (BAC and C), uses incorrect years (treats C’s 2024 value as equal to 2023), and does not perform valid multi-hop reasoning across the correct sources. (4) Contextual Relevance: While the structure of the answer addresses the question format (total value and comparison), the factual foundation is so flawed that the response is misleading. The model appears to have hallucinated data rather than retrieving or synthesizing actual figures. Thus, only minimal credit is given for attempting the right question structure.",

      "original_answer": "CAT estimates the fair value of its finance receivables by discounting the future cash flows using current interest rates representative of receivables with similar remaining maturities. In contrast, UPS holds a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at both fixed and floating interest rates, exposing it to interest rate risk. To manage this risk, UPS utilizes interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, and other derivative instruments to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of its total debt portfolio and related borrowing costs.",

(1) It correctly states that CAT estimates fair value by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates representative of similar maturities.

(2) For UPS, it accurately identifies that interest rate risk arises from its portfolio of finance receivables and that the company uses interest rate swaps, including fixed-for-floating and forward-starting swaps, to manage this risk—this aligns with the original answer's mention of swaps and other derivatives to manage fixed/floating rate exposure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts CAT’s valuation method with UPS’s risk exposure and risk management tools. (4) The only minor omission is that the LLM answer does not explicitly state that UPS’s receivables accrue income at both fixed and floating rates—the source of the interest rate risk—though this is implied by the use of swaps to manage the mix. Also, the LLM focuses on hedging 'debt' rather than explicitly linking it to the finance receivables portfolio, slightly narrowing the scope. However, the use of swaps to manage interest rate exposure is correctly tied to interest rate risk, and the instruments mentioned are accurate. No numbers or calculations are incorrect (quantitative accuracy is perfect), and all entities (CAT, UPS, interest rate swaps, forward-starting swaps) are correct.

Additionally, the LLM omits BKNG's net gains of $1.8 billion in 2020 and $745 million in 2019, which are key to demonstrating the pattern of significant volatility. (2) The numbers cited are partially correct in amount but incorrect in sign and context—$569 million is accurate in magnitude but should be a loss, not a gain. The omission of two years of data reduces completeness and weakens the comparative analysis. (3) The reasoning about differential exposure to equity price risk is logically sound and aligns with the ground truth; the contrast between BKNG’s material exposure and GM’s immaterial exposure is correctly inferred. However, the flawed data undermines the validity of the conclusion. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core comparison and draws an appropriate implication.

In contrast, GD's discount rate for pension benefit obligations decreased from 3.19% in 2020 to 2.54% in 2021. The increase in EMR's discount rates led to actuarial gains and a reduction in the accumulated benefit obligation from $5,634 to $3,910, contributing to overfunding of $513 for U.S. plans. GD's declining discount rate would have increased its pension liabilities, as lower discount rates raise the present value of future obligations. Therefore, EMR experienced a positive valuation impact from rising rates, while GD likely faced increased pension liabilities due to falling rates.",

It incorrectly states EMR's U.S. discount rate increased from 2.54% to 2.84% between 2021–2022, while the ground truth shows an increase from 2.92% to 5.64%. Similarly, for non-U.S. plans, it reports 2.52% → 2.89%, but the correct figures are 2.2% → 4.9%. These errors severely undermine quantitative accuracy. For GD, the LLM misstates the time period, citing 2020–2021 rates (3.19% to 2.54%) but incorrectly frames them as 2021–2022, reversing the temporal comparison. (2) The dollar amount mentioned—'$2.1 bn pretax AOCL decline'—has no support in the original answer and introduces unverified data. The ground truth references a reduction in accumulated benefit obligation from $5,634M to $3,910M (a $1,724M decrease), not $2.1B in AOCL. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM claims EMR’s falling obligations had a 'negative impact on pension fund valuations', but rising discount rates reduce liabilities, which is a positive valuation impact (as correctly stated in the original answer). Conversely, it incorrectly suggests GD’s 'higher discount rates' would reduce liabilities, when in fact GD’s rates decreased, increasing liabilities. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response attempts to compare EMR and GD’s discount rate changes and their impact on pension valuations—but due to incorrect data, timing, and logic, the synthesis fails.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect. It claims the combined total cannot be determined, but the ground truth and available data show that the individual 2024 undiscounted lease payments for Gilead Sciences ($143 million) and UnitedHealth Group ($1,038 million) are explicitly disclosed in their respective 10-K filings. These figures can and should be summed to produce the combined total. (2) The quantitative values mentioned in the LLM response—$143M for Gilead and $1,038M for UnitedHealth—are actually correct and match the ground truth inputs, but the model fails to perform the basic arithmetic: 143 + 1,038 = 1,181 million. This is a critical error in calculation and synthesis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires summing values from two separate 10-K filings, which is a standard and feasible task. The LLM incorrectly asserts that because the data comes from separate filings, they cannot be combined—this reflects a misunderstanding of financial data aggregation. (4) Despite referencing correct numbers and entities, the failure to compute the sum results in a substantively wrong conclusion, warranting a very low correctness score. Quantitative accuracy is low because the final required number ($1,181M) is missing and the calculation is not performed. Qualitative accuracy is poor due to faulty logic. Contextual relevance is moderate because the model identifies the right documents and line items but fails to answer the actual question.",

However, it fails to report the GD figure, claiming no data is available in the provided pages. The ground truth indicates the combined total for EMR and GD is 1,804,142 shares, implying GD’s unvested shares are 1,272,000 (1,804,142 - 532,142). The LLM’s assertion that GD data is missing suggests either incomplete document access or failure to locate the relevant disclosure, resulting in an incomplete answer. (2) Quantitatively, the EMR number is correct, but the total is significantly underreported due to missing GD data. The calculation of the total is therefore incorrect, though no explicit arithmetic error is made by the LLM—it simply omits half the data. (3) The reasoning is sound in structure—identifying EMR’s number and acknowledging absence of GD data—but fails the multi-hop requirement of synthesizing data from both companies. The model should have either located the GD data or not claimed completeness.

According to the ground truth, the combined 2023 crude oil revenue for COP and XOM is $7,087 million, with COP contributing $143 million and XOM $6,944 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states that both companies have $143 million in crude oil revenue, leading to a total of $286 million—far below the correct total. This error undermines the entire response. (2) The percentages provided (0.3% for COP and 0.25% for XOM) are also incorrect due to the wrong crude oil and total revenue figures. In reality, COP’s crude oil revenue ($143M / $8,203M) is about 1.74%, while XOM’s ($6,944M / $20,528M) is approximately 33.8%, showing XOM is far more reliant on crude oil—opposite to the LLM’s conclusion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize data across the two companies and misrepresented the proportion comparison. It incorrectly implies COP has a higher proportion of crude oil revenue than XOM, when the truth is the reverse.

The ground truth states MDLZ had a 14.7% Organic Net Revenue growth with favorable volume/mix, while PM had a net 9.7% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions. The LLM answer does not report these overall growth figures, which are central to the question. Instead, it introduces a specific figure of '2.8 percentage points in emerging markets' for volume/mix growth, which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified against the ground truth. This number is likely a hallucination or misattribution. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the key percentages (14.7% for MDLZ and 9.7% for PM) are omitted, and an unsupported number (2.8 pp) is introduced. The comparison of favorable volume/mix impact between MDLZ and PM cannot be accurately assessed without these figures. (3) Qualitatively, the LLM correctly identifies that MDLZ's favorable volume/mix was driven by AMEA, Latin America, and Europe due to improved product mix and strong snack demand, which aligns with the ground truth. It also correctly notes that PM's volume/mix gains were offset by unfavorable pricing and mix, particularly in cigarettes in Europe. This shows sound multi-hop reasoning in identifying regional and product-level dynamics. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question: the comparative volume/mix impact and the regional drivers for MDLZ.

It incorrectly states that AMGN's 2020 domestic income is $2,505 million (same as GILD's), when the ground truth is $4,087 million for AMGN and $2,505 million for GILD. Similarly, it assigns both companies the same 2021 domestic income of $8,587 million, while in reality AMGN had $1,850 million and GILD had $8,587 million. These errors propagate into the totals: LLM reports $5,010 million combined 2020 income (vs. correct $6,592 million) and $17,174 million for 2021 (vs. correct $10,437 million). (2) Calculations are mathematically correct within the LLM's incorrect inputs (e.g., $2,505 + $2,505 = $5,010), but based on wrong data. The comparison between years is directionally correct (2021 > 2020), but the magnitude of increase is wildly overstated due to incorrect totals. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly retrieve or distinguish the financial data for each company and year. It appears to have conflated GILD's 2020 and 2021 figures with AMGN's, indicating a failure in entity-metric alignment across time periods. (4) Despite the severe quantitative inaccuracies, the answer structure addresses the question's intent—comparing combined domestic income across years—and maintains contextual relevance.

It incorrectly assigns $6,168M to AVGO and $14,082M to QCOM, reversing the actual values from the ground truth (AVGO: $14,082M in FY2023; QCOM: $10,110M in FY2024). This leads to an incorrect combined total of $20,250M instead of the correct $24,192M. The comparison to QCOM's operating income ($10,071M) is also wrong: the LLM claims the excess is $10,179M, but the correct difference is $14,121M. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: all key financial figures are incorrect, and the resulting calculations (sum and difference) are therefore invalid. Only QCOM's operating income ($10,071M) is correctly stated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM attempts to combine income from two companies across fiscal years and compare to a third metric—but the entity-to-metric mapping is flawed. The model appears to confuse which value belongs to which company, indicating a failure in entity-metric alignment despite accessing correct data points. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer follows the correct structure, addresses all parts of the question, and uses appropriate financial terminology. However, due to severe factual inaccuracies in numbers and attribution, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.",

      "original_answer": "AIG estimates the fair value of liabilities by using market-observable interest rates and considers factors such as the coupon rate, yield curves, and other relevant factors, particularly in the context of securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Schwab, on the other hand, bases its fair value measurements for interest rate swaps on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve, considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. Both companies incorporate coupon rates into their valuation models, but Schwab explicitly references the dual-leg structure of interest rate swaps, while AIG focuses on broader market observables like yield curves.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG and Schwab use different fair‑value models for liability estimation.  \nAIG’s methodology relies on internal valuation models that incorporate counterparty credit risk, discounted present‑value calculations, and market‑observable inputs (e.g., CDS spreads, benchmark curves) to price complex liabilities such as super‑senior credit default swaps and funds‑withheld embedded derivatives. Schwab, by contrast, measures its derivative liabilities at fair value using observable market data—quoted prices for exchange‑traded contracts, market‑observable yield curves for interest‑rate swaps, and third‑party dealer quotes for OTC derivatives—adjusting only when corroborating market evidence is available. Both firms consider market inputs, but AIG emphasizes internal credit‑risk adjustments and embedded‑derivative modeling, whereas Schwab emphasizes external market quotes and hedge‑accounting relationships.",

(2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; however, the absence of numbers does not affect scoring here, hence a score of 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the original answer emphasizes how each company incorporates coupon rates into their fair value estimation—AIG in repurchase agreements with yield curves, and Schwab in the fixed and floating legs of interest rate swaps. The LLM fails to mention the dual-leg structure of swaps (a key differentiator in the ground truth) and instead generalizes Schwab’s approach to OTC derivatives and exchange-traded contracts broadly. Similarly, AIG’s focus on securities sold under agreements to repurchase is omitted. (4) The LLM answer is contextually relevant and discusses fair value methodologies, but it misaligns on the specific components related to coupon rates. The core idea that both use market observables is correct, but the distinguishing features (Schwab’s explicit use of fixed/floating coupon legs in swaps, AIG’s use in repurchase agreements with yield curves) are missing or replaced with unrelated details.

Boeing’s tax refund directly improved its operating cash flow in 2022, providing immediate liquidity. In contrast, FedEx’s $226 million benefit is a contingent, unrecognized tax position tied to ongoing litigation, with no immediate cash impact unless the court rules favorably and a refund is ultimately received.",

However, the documents indicate that Boeing's tax-related cash inflows would be derived from its operating cash flow (which includes tax payments/receipts), while FedEx's unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future tax liabilities that could impact cash flow if resolved. The key differences lie in their financial impact and timing: Boeing's tax cash flows are part of its ongoing operating cash generation (with 2022 operating cash flow showing $5.96B net cash from operations, partially driven by tax refunds), whereas FedEx's unrecognized tax benefits ($226M cumulative benefit recorded as of 2023) represent a contingent tax position that may affect future cash flows through potential refunds or payments, with resolution expected over varying timelines including potential appeals extending beyond 2025. The timing difference is significant, as Boeing's tax cash flows are realized in the current period, while FedEx's tax benefits are uncertain and may be realized over multiple years through ongoing tax audits and potential litigation.",

The total of $1.726 billion is not mentioned in the LLM response, despite being a direct sum of two disclosed figures. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly identifies FedEx's $226 million unrecognized tax benefit and references Boeing’s operating cash flow context, but fails to state the explicit $1.5 billion refund amount, which is critical to answering the first part of the question. The mention of Boeing’s $5.96B net cash from operations is accurate but irrelevant to the specific tax inflow asked. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning about timing and financial impact is partially sound—Boeing’s refund being current and realized versus FedEx’s contingent, future-oriented benefit is conceptually correct. However, the LLM mischaracterizes FedEx’s $226 million as a 'potential future tax liability' when it is actually a 'cumulative benefit' from an aggressive tax position, which would result in a cash inflow if upheld, not an outflow. This misrepresents the financial impact. Additionally, the multi-hop synthesis is weak: while both companies and years are correctly identified, the model fails to connect and sum the two specific tax-related inflows as required. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses tax impacts, timing, and cash flow implications, aligning with the question’s intent.

General Motors' value is correctly reported as $5,395 million ($5.4 billion), which matches the ground truth. The total value is therefore incorrectly calculated as approximately $7.2 billion instead of the correct $5,723 million. (2) The calculation of the total is wrong due to the incorrect Booking Holdings figure. The correct sum is $328M + $5,395M = $5,723M, but the LLM implies a total of $7,213M, which is not mentioned explicitly but follows from its numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM correctly identifies both companies and the relevant metric (Construction in Progress) for 2021, and synthesizes the strategic implications appropriately. However, the flawed input data undermines the conclusion. The qualitative analysis of capital expenditure strategies—GM focusing on manufacturing and EVs, Booking on platform infrastructure—is reasonable and contextually appropriate. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to the major numerical error in Booking Holdings' value, which invalidates the total and skews the comparative analysis.

Schwab's 2024 10-K states that its capital management strategy includes a target common dividend payout of 20% to 30% of net income and reports a consolidated capital ratio of 6.8%. How does Schwab’s reported capital ratio influence its ability to maintain its dividend payout range, and what does this suggest about the relationship between capital ratios and financial flexibility for firms like AIG and Schwab operating under different regulatory capital requirements?",
      "original_answer": "Schwab’s 2024 consolidated capital ratio of 6.8% indicates a relatively strong capital position, which supports its ability to maintain a dividend payout targeting 20% to 30% of net income. This capital buffer allows Schwab to balance returns to shareholders with maintaining sufficient liquidity, especially in light of potential future needs such as migrating IDA balances onto its balance sheet. For AIG, maintaining sufficient capital is tied to its ability to underwrite insurance and manage risk through entities like National Union and Lexington, which are subject to insurance regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, capital ratios directly affect financial flexibility—Schwab uses its capital to support dividends and strategic balance sheet decisions, while AIG must ensure capital adequacy to sustain underwriting activities and meet regulatory thresholds.",

This strong capital position provides the financial flexibility to sustain its planned dividend payout of roughly 20%‑30% of net income, as the firm can comfortably meet regulatory capital buffers while still returning excess capital to shareholders.

It adds the detail that this ratio is near Schwab’s long-term target of 6.75%–7.00% (adjusted for AOCI) and exceeds the 4% Tier 1 Leverage requirement—information not present in the original answer but plausibly derived from Schwab’s 10-K. While these additions are reasonable, they are not confirmed in the ground truth, so they represent an expansion rather than a direct reflection of the provided knowledge. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: 6.8% capital ratio and 20%–30% dividend range are correctly cited. No calculations are required, and the comparisons made (e.g., exceeding 4%) are factually sound if assumed based on regulatory context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is largely sound: the model connects Schwab’s capital strength to its ability to maintain dividends and contrasts this with AIG’s regulatory environment. However, it omits key specifics about AIG’s capital needs being tied to underwriting through National Union and Lexington and does not mention the balance sheet migration of IDA balances, which is a critical strategic use of capital in Schwab’s case. This reduces completeness in synthesizing all elements from both filings. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, drawing a valid contrast between firms under different regulatory regimes. The core conclusion—that capital ratios affect financial flexibility differently based on regulatory context—is aligned with the ground truth. However, the omission of specific operational drivers (IDA migration, insurance underwriting) slightly weakens qualitative accuracy.

This aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM omits the specific quantitative impact on Netflix's net cash from financing activities — namely, the $2,387 million decrease compared to 2020's $1,002 million in proceeds — which is a notable omission affecting completeness. (2) The $19,032 million figure for AT&T is accurate and correctly formatted. Netflix’s lack of debt issuance is correctly stated. But the absence of the $2,387 million decline and the 2020 comparison weakens the quantitative completeness, even though no incorrect numbers are presented. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that AT&T’s debt issuance boosted its financing cash inflows, enhancing liquidity and flexibility, while Netflix’s lack of borrowing led to tighter cash flow constraints. This reflects valid multi-hop synthesis between debt activity and cash flow implications. However, the deeper temporal comparison (2021 vs 2020 for Netflix) is missing, which is part of the original answer’s causal explanation. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing the question’s focus on contrasting debt trends and their cash flow impacts. Despite missing a key numerical detail, the core logic and entity accuracy (NFLX, T, 2021, debt issuance amounts) are correct. Thus, the correctness score is 8 due to partial omission of a critical quantitative change in Netflix’s cash flows, though no factual errors are made.",

The combined total of 'Interest Income and Other, Net' is stated as $4.2 billion, but the ground truth is $323.8 million. The LLM incorrectly reports $2.1 billion for both HD and SBUX, whereas HD actually reported an expense of $201 million (negative) and SBUX reported income of $122.8 million. These numbers are off by more than an order of magnitude. (2) The calculations are completely wrong: $2.1B + $2.1B = $4.2B is arithmetically correct but based on false inputs. The correct sum is $122.8M - $201M = -$78.2M net, but the ground truth states the combined total as $323.8M, which appears to be a sum of absolute values or reported as a positive aggregate despite one being an expense — however, even under that interpretation, the LLM’s numbers are still grossly inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly identify how this line item affects earnings before taxes. In reality, HD’s earnings before tax were reduced by $201M (due to expense), and SBUX’s increased by $122.8M (income), but the LLM falsely claims both had $2.1B in positive income, showing no correct synthesis across entities. (4) Contextual relevance is low due to fabricated figures, though the structure of the response attempts to address both parts of the question (total and contribution to earnings). The qualitative reasoning framework is superficially plausible (discussing contribution to earnings before tax) but built on false data, rendering it invalid.

The ground truth states that Emerson's warranty expense is 'less than one-half of one percent of sales' (<0.5%), but the LLM incorrectly specifies it as 0.1%—a more precise figure not supported in the original. More critically, the LLM claims both Emerson and General Dynamics had $38.5 billion in revenue in 2022, which is false. The ground truth does not provide Emerson's revenue, and General Dynamics' revenue was not stated at all. The LLM fabricates matching revenues to calculate General Dynamics' warranty expense as 0.27%, which is unsupported and incorrect. The $104 million warranty expense for GD is correct. (2) Calculations: The 0.27% figure comes from ($104M / $38.5B), but since GD's actual revenue is not confirmed as $38.5B, this calculation is baseless. Emerson's 0.1% figure is entirely invented. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to compare warranty strategies, which is relevant, but does so using fabricated data. It fails to correctly synthesize the intended contrast—Emerson’s low percentage vs. GD’s high absolute dollar amount—because it incorrectly converts GD’s expense into a percentage using assumed revenue.

      "original_answer": "DUK defers depreciation and accretion costs related to AROs for coal ash until recovery treatment is determined, indicating a regulatory deferral approach. NEE, on the other hand, actively records and expenses accretion costs annually, with $141 million in 2021 and $169 million in 2020, showing a more immediate financial impact. This contrast reveals different regulatory and accounting treatments affecting their financial statements.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures, DUK and NEE differ in their accounting treatment and financial impact of accretion costs related to AROs for coal ash as follows:\n\n1.  **Accounting Approach:** DUK explicitly includes \"AROs - coal ash\" as a distinct regulatory asset line item within its regulatory assets schedule (Page 142), reflecting deferred depreciation and accretion costs specifically tied to coal ash basin closure obligations. NEE, however, does not separately identify \"coal ash\" within its ARO disclosures (Page 11); its AROs are described generally as relating to \"decommissioning obligations of FPL's and NEER's nuclear units and to obligations for the dismantlement of certain of NEER's wind and solar facilities,\" with no specific mention of coal ash basins. NEE's AROs are primarily tied to nuclear decommissioning and renewable facility dismantlement, not coal ash.\n\n2.  **Financial Impact:** DUK's regulatory asset for coal ash (included in the $3,408 million AROs - coal ash figure on Page 142) represents a significant, identifiable financial impact reflected in its regulatory assets. NEE's AROs (Page 11) show a much larger total ARO balance ($3,179 million for NEE, $2,107 million for FPL), but this includes nuclear decommissioning and other obligations, *not* specifically coal ash. The accretion expense reported for NEE's AROs (e.g., $169 million for NEE and $103 million for FPL in 2020) relates to the accretion of the *overall* ARO liability (primarily nuclear), not specifically to coal ash. NEE's disclosure does not isolate a distinct \"coal ash\" accretion cost or regulatory asset line item like DUK does. Therefore, while NEE incurs accretion expense on its AROs (which include nuclear, not coal ash), the specific financial impact and accounting treatment for *coal ash* AROs as a distinct regulatory item is unique to DUK.",

However, the LLM answer incorrectly claims that NEE's accretion expenses relate only to nuclear decommissioning and renewable facilities, not coal ash, and asserts that NEE does not disclose coal ash AROs separately. This contradicts the ground truth, which implies NEE does account for coal ash AROs with measurable financial impact. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM introduces numbers not in the original answer (e.g., $3,408 million for DUK’s AROs, $3,179 million for NEE, $103 million for FPL in 2020) without verification against the ground truth, which does not provide DUK’s ARO balance or NEE’s total ARO—only accretion expenses for NEE in 2020 and 2021. These figures may be from the actual filings but are not part of the provided ground truth, making the response over-specific and misaligned. (3) The reasoning is flawed in its multi-hop synthesis: it infers from the absence of 'coal ash' in NEE’s ARO description that they do not have coal ash AROs, but the ground truth confirms they do incur related accretion costs. Thus, the conclusion that NEE’s AROs are unrelated to coal ash is incorrect. (4) While the LLM correctly identifies DUK’s deferral approach and regulatory asset treatment, aligning with the ground truth, it fails to acknowledge that NEE expenses accretion costs annually—missing a key contrast.

FedEx's U.S. federal operating and capital loss carryovers are correctly stated at $157 million. The specific tax-related inflow in Boeing's 2022 operating cash flow is accurately identified as a $1.5 billion income tax refund.

Additionally, GILD's total income before income taxes is reported as $8,133 million, but the correct value is $8,278 million. The percentage of foreign income for GILD is stated as 50%, but since foreign income is negative, the correct interpretation is that it offsets 3.7% of total income.

      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) reported a decrease in its net charge-off rate by 49 basis points to 0.00% in 2021, primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in its energy loan portfolio. This reflects an improvement in credit performance and economic conditions, especially in the energy sector, compared to 2020. In contrast, PayPal (PYPL) defines its net charge-off rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily balance of those receivables. While COF's metric reflects a specific improvement in a core loan segment (energy), PYPL's definition emphasizes a structural, formulaic approach focused on merchant credit risk without factoring in fraud, indicating differing risk management frameworks and portfolio compositions between the two financial institutions.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s net charge‑off rate fell from 0.49% in 2020 to essentially 0% in 2021, a decline driven largely by improved performance in its energy‑loan portfolio, whereas PayPal defines net charge‑off rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud) on its merchant‑loan and consumer‑loan receivables relative to the average daily balance of those receivables, and reports a 4.7% net charge‑off rate for merchant loans and a 4.3% rate for consumer loans in 2021.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. The ground truth states that Capital One's net charge-off rate decreased by 49 basis points to 0.00% in 2021, implying it was 0.49% in 2020. The LLM correctly identifies the 0.49% to 0% shift, which aligns with a 49 basis point decline, so this part is accurate. However, the LLM introduces specific PayPal net charge-off rates of 4.7% for merchant loans and 4.3% for consumer loans in 2021—these figures are not present in the original answer and are unsupported by the provided ground truth. The original answer only describes PayPal's definition and treatment of the metric, not actual reported values. (2) The calculation of the 49 basis point decline is implicitly correct (0.49% to 0.00%), but the addition of unverified PayPal charge-off rates undermines quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts COF’s performance-driven decline in charge-offs with PYPL’s definitional approach. However, it fails to emphasize that PYPL’s framework excludes fraud, a key differentiator highlighted in the original answer, and instead adds extraneous, unverified numerical data. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies, the correct time frame (2020–2021), and attempts a meaningful comparison. However, the inclusion of fabricated metrics reduces correctness. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because entity identification (COF, PYPL, energy and merchant loan portfolios) and time periods are correct, but the reasoning is weakened by unsupported data. Overall, the answer captures the directional trend for COF and attempts a definitional contrast, but the addition of incorrect quantitative data for PYPL significantly harms factual correctness.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial figures. It reports COF's Securities available for sale as $226.2 billion, which is incorrect — the ground truth is $79,117 million ($79.117 billion). AIG's Securities for Sale are reported as $231.7 billion, which is close to the correct value of $231,733 million ($231.733 billion), so this part is approximately accurate. However, the sum is therefore wrong: LLM calculates $457.9 billion, while the correct total is $310,850 million ($310.85 billion). COF’s liquidity reserves are reported as $120.7 billion, which is close to the correct $120,652 million ($120.652 billion), so this figure is acceptable within rounding. (2) Calculations: The LLM performs the addition correctly based on its incorrect inputs, but the inputs themselves are flawed, leading to an erroneous conclusion. The correct sum is $231,733M + $79,117M = $310,850M, not $457.9B. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies the correct entities (AIG and COF), the correct metric types (Securities for Sale / available for sale), and the correct date (December 31, 2023), showing some understanding of the required synthesis. However, it uses an incorrect value for COF’s securities, breaking the chain of accurate reasoning. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is low (2/10) due to significant numerical inaccuracies that change the conclusion. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because one of two key numbers is highly inaccurate. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the structure and intent of the reasoning are sound, but execution fails.

      "original_answer": "Emerson recognized a $56 million mark-to-market gain on its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation, positively impacting its financial results. In contrast, UPS reported a $359 million mark-to-market loss related to its defined benefit plans, which significantly reduced its investment income. The difference between these two figures is $303 million.

However, the LLM states that UPS's total investment-income loss was $2.2 billion 'driven by' the $359 million loss and other adjustments, which introduces a figure ($2.2 billion) not present in the original answer and potentially conflates the mark-to-market loss with broader investment income impacts. This overstates the scope of the loss in context, though it does not negate the core fact of the $359 million loss. The difference between the two amounts ($303 million) is not explicitly calculated or mentioned in the LLM answer, which is a missing quantitative element required by the question. (2) Numeric values for Emerson and UPS are accurate: $56 million gain and $359 million loss are correct. The calculation of the difference ($359M - $56M = $303M) is implied but not stated, so the answer fails to fully address the 'how much of a difference' component. The introduction of $2.2 billion is unsupported in the ground truth and may mislead. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model correctly attributes the gain to Emerson’s equity investment and the loss to UPS’s pension remeasurement, and it contrasts their impacts on financial performance appropriately—Emerson’s gain boosted earnings, while UPS’s loss reduced income. However, the synthesis is slightly weakened by the inclusion of an extraneous $2.2 billion figure. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and captures the contrasting financial impacts accurately.

The individual 2024 values for Alphabet ($112.39 billion) and Meta ($69.38 billion) are also accurate. However, the year-over-year increase for Meta is incorrect: the LLM reports a $12.63 billion increase, while the ground truth states a $22,629 million ($22.629 billion) increase. This is a significant error in calculation or data retrieval. Alphabet's increase is approximately correct at $28.10 billion vs. the true $28,097 million ($28.097 billion), with minor rounding acceptable. (2) Calculations: The sum of $112.39B + $69.38B = $181.77B is correct. Alphabet’s YoY increase: $112.39B - $84.29B = $28.10B is accurate. Meta’s: $69.38B - $56.75B = $12.63B is incorrect — the correct difference should be $22.63B, indicating a factual error in either the 2023 value or the 2024 value used.

      "original_answer": "The difference in net charge-off rates between COF (0.37%) and PYPL's definition of the metric—excluding fraud losses on merchant loans and advances—reflects contrasting credit risk management approaches. COF's lower net charge-off rate indicates stronger credit quality and loss mitigation in its loan portfolio, particularly in auto and consumer banking. PYPL, by excluding fraud losses from its net charge-off rate calculation, highlights a different risk exposure tied to merchant loans and advances, which may carry unique credit risks not captured in the metric. This distinction shows that COF's credit management strategy results in lower realized losses, while PYPL's approach focuses on separating fraud-related losses from credit performance metrics, affecting how each company measures and manages credit risk.",

The ground truth states COF's net charge-off rate is 0.37% in 2022, but the LLM incorrectly reports this as occurring in 2021, introducing a one-year error. More critically, the LLM fabricates PYPL's net charge-off rates of 4.7% for merchant receivables and 4.3% for consumer loans, which are not present in the original answer and contradict the premise that PYPL excludes fraud losses from its metric—no specific rate is provided in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the only correct number is COF’s 0.37%, though misdated; all other figures are hallucinated. There are no calculations in the question, but the comparison relies on accurate data, which the LLM fails to provide. (3) Reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that COF and PYPL use different approaches to credit risk management, with COF showing strong underwriting and PYPL separating fraud from credit losses. This reflects a valid interpretation of contrasting strategies. However, the reasoning is built on false numerical premises, undermining the multi-hop synthesis. The model attempts to contrast actual loss performance with definitional differences but does so with invented data. (4) Despite the flawed numbers, the answer addresses the core conceptual contrast in risk management approaches, giving it moderate qualitative and contextual relevance.

According to the ground truth, COST's finance lease costs exceeded Philip Morris's by $104 million, but the LLM calculates a difference of only $59 million. This major discrepancy indicates incorrect underlying numbers or calculations. (2) The LLM states COST's 2024 finance lease cost as $126 million ($97M amortization + $29M interest) and Philip Morris's as $67 million ($72M amortization + $2M interest). However, the sum for Philip Morris is mathematically incorrect—$72M + $2M = $74M, not $67M. More critically, these values do not align with the ground truth, which implies the source data used by the model is wrong. The correct difference of $104M suggests either COST’s costs were higher, Philip Morris’s were lower, or both. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to sum amortization and interest for both companies and compute the difference—but it fails due to incorrect input data. The model identifies the correct entities (COST and Philip Morris) and the correct financial components (amortization and interest for finance leases), showing understanding of the required synthesis. (4) Despite correct framing and intent, the answer is severely compromised by inaccurate numbers, leading to a low correctness score.

These numbers are accurately represented with acceptable formatting (e.g., using 'million' and proper magnitude). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both figures are correct, and while the LLM does not explicitly calculate the 255x ratio (231,733 / 0.907 ≈ 255.5), it conveys the vast difference in scale using 'dwarfs' and 'far larger', which is semantically appropriate. No calculation errors are present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different companies (AIG and COF) and two different metrics (total fair value vs. AOCI change) is correctly synthesized to compare absolute exposure to fair value fluctuations. The conclusion that AIG has greater absolute exposure while COF shows limited volatility is logically consistent with the data. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention of COF's 'relative volatility' or sensitivity despite a smaller portfolio, which is included in the ground truth and adds nuance. However, the LLM captures the core contrast effectively. Thus, the answer is factually correct, contextually relevant, and well-reasoned, warranting a high score with only slight deduction for incomplete qualitative nuance.",

      "question": "How did the changes in noncurrent regulatory assets at DUK from 2020 to 2021 compare to the changes in noncurrent regulatory assets at NEE due to reserve amortization, and what was the combined impact on their balance sheets?",
      "original_answer": "DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased by $656 million from 2020 ($5,775 million) to 2021 ($5,909 million). NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets were impacted by reserve amortization adjustments related to accrued asset removal costs, which reflected changes in regulatory ROE targeting under the 2016 rate agreement. These adjustments were recorded as increases or decreases to noncurrent regulatory assets or liabilities. The combined impact of these changes indicates that both companies experienced regulatory-driven balance sheet adjustments, with DUK showing a direct increase in noncurrent regulatory assets while NEE's changes were more dynamic due to amortization reversals and accruals.",
      "llm_answer": "The increase in non‑current regulatory assets at DUK from 2020 to 2021 was driven by a $429 million reserve‑amortization charge that was recorded as an increase to accrued asset‑removal costs, whereas NEE’s non‑current regulatory assets were reduced by the same $429 million reversal of reserve amortization in 2020. Consequently, the net effect was a $429 million rise in DUK’s regulatory‑asset balance and a corresponding $429 million decline in NEE’s regulatory‑asset balance, producing a combined $858 million swing that was reflected on each company’s balance sheet as a $429 million increase (DUK) and a $429 million decrease (NEE) in non‑current regulatory assets.",

According to the ground truth, DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased from $5,775 million in 2020 to $5,909 million in 2021, a correct increase of $134 million (not $429 million as stated by the LLM). The LLM incorrectly claims a $429 million reserve-amortization charge drove the increase, but this figure does not align with the actual data. Furthermore, the LLM states that NEE’s noncurrent regulatory assets were reduced by $429 million due to reversal of reserve amortization in 2020, but the original answer does not provide any specific dollar amount for NEE’s changes—only that adjustments occurred due to reserve amortization related to accrued asset removal costs under the 2016 rate agreement. There is no mention of a $429 million reduction or reversal at NEE. (2) The calculation of a 'combined $858 million swing' is entirely fabricated, based on incorrect numbers and unsupported logic. The actual DUK change was $134 million increase, not $429 million. NEE’s change is not quantified in the ground truth, so no precise combined impact can be calculated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly equates DUK’s increase with a specific reserve-amortization charge and directly offsets it with a reversal at NEE, implying a symmetrical transaction between the two companies, which is not supported by the original answer. The original answer describes independent regulatory adjustments—DUK had a direct increase, while NEE experienced dynamic adjustments due to amortization reversals and accruals, but no direct comparison or offsetting amounts are stated. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the LLM addresses regulatory assets, reserve amortization, and balance sheet impacts for both DUK and NEE, but the factual and quantitative errors severely undermine correctness. The qualitative reasoning is partially sound in identifying regulatory mechanisms but fails in accurate synthesis. Thus, the correctness score is low due to major factual and numerical errors.",

      "original_answer": "Emerson recognized a mark-to-market gain of $56 million in fiscal 2023 on its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation, which was excluded from pro forma results to reflect the economic reality of the transaction. In contrast, UPS recognized a mark-to-market gain of $3.3 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) in 2021 related to its pension plan following the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, which was included in Investment income and other on the income statement. Emerson's gain was tied to an equity investment linked to a specific acquisition, while UPS's gain stemmed from pension plan adjustments due to regulatory changes. These differences in source, timing, and treatment indicate that the mark-to-market gains are not comparable and should be carefully evaluated when assessing the companies' core operating performance, as they reflect distinct non-operational, one-time accounting adjustments.",

Consequently, while Emerson’s gain is a one‑time, acquisition‑related item affecting earnings in the period of purchase, UPS’s mark‑to‑market impacts are embedded in ongoing pension expense and are spread over multiple periods, making direct comparison of core earnings challenging due to the differing recognition timing and the fact that Emerson’s gain is excluded from its pro forma core earnings, whereas UPS’s adjustments are integral to its pension expense calculations.",

However, it omits UPS's specific gain amount of $3.3 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) in 2021, instead vaguely referring to 'periodic' pension adjustments without specifying the timing or magnitude. This is a significant omission in quantitative accuracy. (2) The ground truth specifies UPS recognized the gain in 2021 due to the American Rescue Plan Act, which the LLM fails to mention—missing a key regulatory driver and exact year. The LLM incorrectly implies UPS's mark-to-market adjustments are routinely spread over time, when in fact the $3.3 billion gain was a one-time 2021 event. This affects both quantitative and qualitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning is otherwise sound: the LLM correctly contrasts Emerson’s one-time, acquisition-linked gain with UPS’s pension-related adjustments and notes differences in presentation and pro forma treatment. It appropriately concludes that comparability of core earnings is limited. The multi-hop synthesis across companies and accounting treatments is logically structured.

The LLM incorrectly reports Alphabet's increase as ~$29.8 billion (close but not exact, and improperly derived by summing segment-level figures like Google Services and Cloud, which are not equivalent to consolidated Total Income from Operations) and Meta's increase as $29.35 billion — a major overstatement of the actual $22.629 billion. Additionally, the LLM states Meta’s growth rate is 22%, which is less than half the true 48% growth rate. (2) Calculations are flawed: while $25.4B + $4.4B ≈ $29.8B is arithmetically correct, these components do not represent the total company-wide increase in Total Income from Operations and thus misrepresent the metric. Meta’s reported $29.35B increase and 22% rate are both factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure — the model attempts to compute total increases and compare percentage growth — but fails due to incorrect data sourcing and metric misalignment.

It correctly notes HD's 0.9% drop in average ticket and 1.0% decline in transactions, and the resulting 1.8% drop in comparable sales, which aligns with the ground truth. However, for SBUX, it fails to mention the 5% decrease in transactions and the partial offset by pricing (4% ticket growth), instead implying both metrics declined. The 2% decline in SBUX comparable store sales is omitted. (2) Quantitatively, the 1.8% comparable sales decline for HD is correct, as is the 90 basis point margin contraction and the resulting 19.8% North America operating margin for SBUX.

In contrast, PepsiCo’s 10‑K (pages 119‑123) describes a more expansive approach: it evaluates uncertain tax positions through a detailed assessment of tax law, settlement history and new information, and it records reserves for positions that are subject to challenge even when the likelihood of success is not explicitly tied to a > 50 % threshold.

(2) The original answer does not include any specific dollar figures for goodwill transfers or mention impairment testing — it only states that INTC adjusted prior periods to reflect changes in operating segments and reallocated goodwill based on relative fair value. Thus, the inclusion of exact figures and the mention of quantitative impairment testing go beyond the ground truth and introduce unsupported detail. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that both companies made retrospective adjustments to prior periods to align with current segment structures, enhancing comparability. It also correctly links the changes to impacts on financial reporting consistency and segment evaluation. However, the reasoning is undermined by the incorrect geographic shift for ACN and the speculative goodwill figures for INTC. (4) Despite these issues, the LLM captures the overarching theme — that both companies modified historical financials to improve comparability due to structural changes — which maintains contextual relevance. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the conceptual framework is correct, but key details are wrong or invented. Correctness score is 5 due to significant factual errors in entities and numbers, despite a relevant and logically structured response.",

The correct combined total is $3.36 billion ($56 million from Emerson + $3.3 billion from UPS). (2) The calculation is fundamentally wrong: the LLM fails to correctly identify Emerson’s gain and duplicates UPS’s figure. While UPS’s $3.3 billion gain related to pension remeasurement under ARPA is correctly contextualized, Emerson’s gain is misrepresented as $3.3 billion instead of $56 million.

Therefore, the combined impact of the FDII deduction on the effective tax rates of AVGO and CSCO in 2022 was -3.9%. In 2021, AVGO reported an FDII deduction impact of -3.1%, and CSCO reported an impact of -4.2%. Thus, the combined impact in 2021 was -7.3%. This shows a smaller tax benefit from the FDII deduction in 2022 compared to 2021.",

The combined impact in 2022 was therefore -3.9%. In 2021, AVGO had a -3.1% impact and CSCO had -4.2%, totaling -7.3%. The LLM incorrectly states that both companies benefited from the FDII deduction in 2022 and misrepresents the magnitude and direction of the impact. (2) The LLM introduces false numbers: it claims AVGO’s tax rate declined from 20.1% to 18.4%, and CSCO’s similarly, which is not supported by the ground truth. It also fabricates dollar amounts ($3.9 million and $4.2 million), which are not in the original answer and are incorrect in context—FDII impact is expressed in percentage points on effective tax rates, not dollar values. The claimed '1.7 percentage point reduction in combined effective tax rate' is baseless. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize the individual company impacts, misidentifies the direction of the effect (positive vs. negative impact), and invents a narrative of increasing benefit when the truth is a decreasing benefit. It also confuses tax rate changes with FDII-specific impacts without isolating the deduction's effect. (4) Scores are low due to pervasive factual and quantitative errors. Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the general topic (FDII impact on tax rates of AVGO and CSCO), but the content is factually wrong.

Similarly, CVS Health’s correct value is 1,314 million, while the LLM reports 1,329 million, an overstatement of 15 million. The calculated difference in the LLM answer is 448 million (1,777 - 1,329), whereas the correct difference is 359 million (1,673 - 1,314), resulting in an error of 89 million shares.

This $9.32 per barrel difference suggests that XOM's European operations are less profitable on a per-barrel basis than its operations in Canada and the Other Americas. COP, in contrast, discloses its global average production cost per BOE as part of its supplementary data but does not break it down regionally.

The difference cited in the LLM answer ($16.43) is therefore incorrect—the actual difference is $9.32. Additionally, the claim that COP has a global average production cost of $5.09 per barrel is entirely unsupported by the original answer, which states that COP only discloses a global average without specifying the number and provides no regional breakdowns. The LLM falsely attributes regional cost figures ($19.94 for Canada/Other Americas and $39.09 for Europe) to COP, which are not disclosed by COP at all.

      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) experienced a 198 basis point decrease in its Net Charge-Off Rate to 1.90% in 2021, which contributed to a $8.2 billion decrease in the Provision for Credit Losses, resulting in a benefit of $902 million due to strong credit performance. This improvement indicates better loan recovery or fewer defaults, which enhances profitability and reduces risk. PayPal (PYPL), on the other hand, defines its Net Charge-Off Rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily loan balance. This definition implies that PYPL’s credit risk exposure is directly tied to the performance of its merchant loan portfolio, and a higher Net Charge-Off Rate would signal increased credit deterioration and potential financial loss.",

However, it introduces a specific income increase in the Credit Card segment from $1.36B to $7.76B that is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth, making this an unsupported addition. (2) The quantitative values for the Net Charge-Off Rate (1.90%, down 198 bps) and the $902 million benefit are accurate and consistent with the ground truth. The 3.88% rate in 2020 is correctly implied (1.90% + 1.98% = 3.88%), so the calculation is sound. However, the segment income figures ($1.36B to $7.76B) are not mentioned in the original answer and appear to be extraneous or potentially incorrect, reducing quantitative accuracy slightly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is largely sound: the LLM correctly links the decline in charge-offs to improved credit performance and lower provisions, and it appropriately contrasts Capital One’s metric with PayPal’s definition. It correctly interprets that a lower charge-off rate improves credit risk profiles, which is consistent with the implication in the original answer about PayPal’s exposure. However, it does not explicitly mention PayPal’s exclusion of fraud losses, a key nuance in PYPL’s definition that affects how credit risk is assessed. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question—Capital One’s financial impact and PayPal’s credit risk implications. While the core facts are correct and the reasoning is logical, the inclusion of unverified segment income data and the omission of PayPal’s exclusion of fraud losses prevent a top score. Thus, correctness is rated 8 due to partial overreach in details and minor omission in PayPal’s definition nuance.",

It incorrectly states that Capital One (COF) reported $2,723 million in pledged securities, while the ground truth specifies COF reported only $13 million in securities collateral pledged under master netting agreements. Similarly, the LLM claims AIG has a total pledged amount of $2,723 million for fixed-maturity securities, which is not supported by the original answer—AIG reported $1,200 million in securities collateral *received*, not pledged. The difference in collateral values is therefore completely wrong: the correct difference is $1,187 million ($1,200M - $13M), but the LLM implies a much smaller or reversed gap. (2) The net exposure figures are also incorrect: the LLM states COF’s net exposure is $1,670 million and AIG’s is $2,335 million, whereas the ground truth reports COF’s net exposure as $2,322 million and notes that AIG did *not* disclose a net exposure figure. These numbers are not just different—they reflect a fundamental misrepresentation of available data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify which company pledged versus received collateral, conflates 'collateral pledged' with 'collateral received', and invents comparable pledged balances despite a large actual disparity.

      "question": "How did CMCSA's change in amortization of software in 2024 compare with T's reported amortization of network software, and what does this indicate about their respective capital investment patterns?",
      "original_answer": "CMCSA reported a decrease in the amortization of software in 2024, which partially offset the overall increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization expense driven by higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (e.g., $2.7 billion in 2024 from such assets). In contrast, T disclosed a consistent increase in amortization of network software, reaching $3,076 million in 2024, indicating sustained investment in software supporting its network infrastructure. This comparison suggests that while T is continuing to invest in and amortize network software, CMCSA appears to be managing software investment more cautiously, even as it increases spending on intangible assets from acquisitions like the linear media business.",
      "llm_answer": "CMCSA reported amortization of software of $3,076 million in 2024, whereas AT&T’s depreciation expense included $3,076 million of software amortization (and total depreciation of $20,421 million). This indicates that CMCSA’s software amortization is roughly in line with AT&T’s software component of depreciation, reflecting comparable capital investment in software assets, though CMCSA’s overall depreciation/amortization pattern is more modest than AT&T’s larger plant‑and‑equipment base.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It incorrectly states that CMCSA reported software amortization of $3,076 million in 2024, which is false according to the ground truth—CMCSA actually reported a *decrease* in software amortization, not a specific dollar amount, and certainly not $3,076 million. That figure belongs to AT&T (T), which reported $3,076 million in amortization of network software in 2024. The LLM erroneously attributes this same number to CMCSA, creating a false equivalence. (2) Quantitatively, the $3,076 million figure is correct for T but incorrectly applied to CMCSA. There is no support in the ground truth for any specific dollar amount of software amortization for CMCSA in 2024—only a directional decrease. The LLM also introduces AT&T’s total depreciation of $20,421 million, which is not mentioned in the original answer and adds unsupported context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the original answer contrasts CMCSA’s declining software amortization (indicating cautious investment) with T’s rising network software amortization (indicating sustained investment). The LLM instead claims both have the same software amortization amount, leading to the opposite conclusion—that their software investment patterns are comparable—when the ground truth suggests they are divergent. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses software amortization and capital investment patterns, but the incorrect data and reversed conclusion severely undermine accuracy. The qualitative reasoning fails due to incorrect entity-metric pairing and flawed synthesis.",

The LLM states HD ended at $218 and MCD at $187, which is inconsistent with the ground truth. These values are not within acceptable variance and represent a significant factual error. (2) The calculation of a 16.4% outperformance is based on incorrect inputs and thus also wrong. The correct difference is $25 ($175 - $150), not $31 ($218 - $187). The LLM misreports both final values and computes an incorrect comparative metric. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not retrieve or synthesize the correct data points from the source documents. It incorrectly identifies the cumulative returns for both companies despite the question relying on precise figures from stock performance graphs. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer discusses the correct concept (CTSR over five years) and correct companies, but with entirely inaccurate data.

ACN utilized its syndicated credit facility to issue $935 million in commercial paper as of August 31, 2024, while INTC had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 30, 2023, having repaid its $3.9 billion commercial paper balance from the prior year.

This missing data assertion invalidates the core of the answer.

      "original_answer": "For KO, volume-based incentive programs are a component of variable consideration, which is estimated and included in net operating revenues upon completion of performance obligations. KO considers factors like customer sales volumes and discount rates in estimating this variable consideration. For PM, volume-based incentives are treated as reductions of revenue and are recorded as sales occur, based on estimates of customer target achievement. These estimates directly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized for both companies, though each uses a different method for incorporating these incentives into financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2022 10‑K disclosures, both companies treat volume‑based incentive programs as variable consideration that is estimated and recognized as revenue when performance obligations are satisfied.  \n\n- **KO** (Coca‑Cola) notes that “the amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues… we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to customer sales volumes, ending inventories, selling price per unit, channels, and discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances.” The company records a reduction of revenue for volume‑based incentives as sales occur, and the estimate of variable consideration is continually updated.  \n\n- **PM** (Philip Morris) states that “for volume‑based incentives provided to customers, management continually assesses and estimates, by customer, the likelihood of the customer’s achieving the specified targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made. For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience.” It also explains that “the transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the customer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable,” and that such variable consideration is estimated using the most likely amount expected under the contract, historical discount/rebate redemption experience, and the terms of any underlying programs.  \n\nThus, both firms estimate variable consideration for volume‑based incentives and recognize it as part of net operating revenue, while PM also references the need to estimate the cost of trade‑promotion programs, which aligns with the question’s focus on variable consideration and trade‑promotion cost estimation.",

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information from both KO’s and PM’s 2022 10-Ks, correctly comparing their approaches to variable consideration and trade promotion costs. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly overstates similarity by saying both recognize incentives 'as part of net operating revenue' without fully emphasizing that PM explicitly treats them as revenue reductions, which is a nuance present in the original answer. However, the LLM does mention 'reduction of revenue' for PM, so this is not a factual error.

These match the ground truth inputs. (2) The calculation is accurate: $12.5B + $6.8B = $19.3B, which matches the original answer exactly. Number formats are consistent and acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—though the years differ (2021 vs 2022), the question explicitly provides both figures and asks for a sum, so no adjustment for time period is required. The model correctly synthesizes data from two different companies and time points as instructed. (4) The answer is complete, contextually relevant, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth.

However, the question specifically asks for the *difference* between AIG’s maximum and MS’s maximum (i.e., 97% - 49.75% = 47.25%), but the LLM fails to compute or state this difference. The ground truth states the difference is 47.75%, which appears to be a minor error in the original answer (97 - 49.75 = 47.25, not 47.75); however, the LLM does not attempt the calculation at all. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: the input numbers are accurate (49.75% and 97%), but the required arithmetic (difference) is missing. (3) The reasoning is sound in identifying the correct values from each 10-K and contextualizing them, but it fails the multi-hop requirement of computing the numerical difference, which is central to the question.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Derivative Assets for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of December 31, 2021, is $1,228 million. Duke Energy reported $116 million in noncurrent derivative assets, while NextEra Energy reported $1,135 million. The significant difference suggests that NextEra Energy employs a more extensive long-term hedging strategy or has larger long-term commodity, interest rate, or foreign currency exposures compared to Duke Energy, which may reflect a more aggressive or diversified risk management approach in managing future price volatility.",

The difference in their noncurrent derivative asset positions reflects distinct strategic approaches: Duke Energy's smaller noncurrent derivative asset position (primarily tied to interest rate and commodity contracts within its regulated utility segments) suggests a more conservative risk management focus aligned with its regulated utility model, while NextEra Energy's significantly larger noncurrent derivative assets (driven by its competitive energy trading and renewable generation operations, including complex forward contracts and options with significant unobservable inputs) indicate a more aggressive, market-oriented strategy to manage price volatility and optimize value in competitive markets.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in the quantitative values. It incorrectly states that Duke Energy reported $1,135 million in noncurrent derivative assets, which is actually the value for NextEra Energy. The correct value for Duke Energy is $116 million, as per the ground truth. This leads to a completely incorrect combined total of $2,270 million instead of the correct $1,228 million. The LLM repeats the same $1,135 million figure for both companies, indicating a clear data extraction or reasoning failure. (2) The calculation is therefore invalid—$116M + $1,135M = $1,251M (rounded to $1,228M in ground truth, likely due to exact source figures), but the LLM computes $1,135M + $1,135M = $2,270M, which is nearly double the correct amount. (3) The qualitative reasoning about strategic differences—Duke Energy being more conservative due to its regulated model and NextEra more aggressive due to trading and renewables—is contextually plausible and aligns with sector knowledge, showing sound multi-hop interpretation *if* the numbers were correct. However, because the reasoning is based on incorrect data (attributing the same value to both firms), the synthesis is flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses both parts of the question (total and strategic interpretation) and uses appropriate financial reasoning, but the severe numerical inaccuracies undermine the entire response.

Additionally, the LLM falsely claims CMCSA’s revenue grew 7.2% in 2023, which is not supported by the original answer. (2) The combined revenue calculation is completely incorrect due to swapped and inaccurate inputs. The correct sum is $25,489M + $11,212M = $36,701M, but the LLM uses wrong values and does not compute a total.

It fails to correctly synthesize data across the two entities and time periods. (4) Despite the severe factual inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant in structure—it attempts to address both parts of the question (combined revenue and growth comparison) and makes a qualitative statement about growth being modest relative to scale, which aligns with the original sentiment.

According to the ground truth, HD spent $9,412.4 million more on property and equipment at cost than MCD in 2022, but the LLM claims only a $400 million difference. Similarly, the difference in accumulated depreciation is stated as $8,934 million in the ground truth, but the LLM reports $677.7 million. These numbers are wildly off, indicating major errors in data retrieval or calculation. (2) The individual values provided by the LLM (e.g., HD spending $2,040 million vs. MCD’s $1,640.8 million) do not align with the ground truth inputs implied by the correct answer, which would require HD’s spending to be $9,412.4 million higher—suggesting either confusion with absolute values or incorrect sourcing. The depreciation figures ($17,196M vs. $16,518.3M) also do not support the correct difference of $8,934M, meaning the LLM likely used wrong base numbers.

While the raw numbers for net PP&E ($1,659,140 for ACN and $5,168,000 for QCOM) and accumulated depreciation ratios are correct in the ground truth, the LLM incorrectly reports them as 'million'—e.g., '$1,659,140 million' instead of '$1,659,140'. This transforms the value into over $1.6 trillion, which is off by a factor of a million. Similarly, QCOM's $5,168 million is correct (since $5,168 million = $5.168 billion), but ACN's $1,659,140 million is catastrophically wrong. (2) The combined net value is not explicitly calculated in the LLM answer, unlike the original answer which correctly sums to $6,827,140.

Inventory figures are partially correct—PM's finished product of $5,112 million is accurate—but COST's merchandise inventory is $18,647 million, not mentioned at all. Instead, the LLM cites $3,789M receivables for COST, which is unsupported by the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: The model fails to correctly synthesize data across companies and financial line items. It invents a 'wholesale model with high receivables' narrative for COST that is not in the original data, while the ground truth emphasizes COST's retail inventory focus.

      "original_answer": "In 2021, DHR experienced a negative impact of (16.5)% from acquisitions/divestitures on its core sales growth, while TMO reported no impact (0%) from acquisitions/divestitures. This led to a difference of 16.5 percentage points in the effect of acquisitions/divestitures on sales growth between the two companies.

It incorrectly states that DHR had a (7.5)% impact from acquisitions/divestitures, while the ground truth is (16.5)%. It also falsely claims TMO had a (16.5)% impact, when in fact TMO had 0% impact. These errors reverse the actual relationship between the companies. The LLM further states TMO's core sales growth was 31.0%, but the correct figure is 5%. Only DHR's core sales growth (23.0%) is correct. (2) Calculations are therefore also wrong: the LLM implies an 8 percentage point gap in organic growth, but the correct difference is 18 percentage points (23.0% - 5%). The difference in acquisition impact is stated as 9 percentage points in the LLM answer (7.5 vs 16.5), but the correct difference is 16.5 points (16.5% vs 0%). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the impact of acquisitions/divestitures and organic growth for both companies, misattributing figures and reversing roles. It appears to have swapped the acquisition impact between DHR and TMO. (4) Scores are low due to pervasive quantitative and qualitative errors.

Morgan Stanley's 2023 securities-based lending exposure is reported as $74,594 million in the ground truth, but the LLM states $89,246 million. The sum in the ground truth is $77,507 million, but the LLM calculates $90,479 million based on incorrect inputs.

(2) Calculations are internally consistent in the LLM answer (e.g., $1,233M + $89,246M = $90,479M), but since all input numbers are wrong, the result is factually incorrect. The percentage comparison is missing entirely in the LLM answer, and instead it vaguely states the sum is 'modest relative to' total exposure, which misrepresents the actual relationship (86.8% is not modest).

      "original_answer": "GOOGL experienced a $5.2 billion increase in Other Cost of Revenues in 2023, driven by higher content acquisition costs for YouTube and compensation expenses, including $479 million in employee severance charges. This increase put upward pressure on total costs, likely compressing operating margins unless offset by revenue growth. In contrast, T saw a $395 million decrease in Other Cost of Revenues due to a change in accounting estimate that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs, which improved their operating margin by reducing current-period expenses. These contrasting trends reflect GOOGL’s strategic investments and restructuring while T optimized accounting policies to enhance margin performance.",

AT&T's Other Cost of Revenues increased by $5.2 billion (from $77,248M in 2022 to $82,446M in 2023), primarily driven by higher content acquisition costs (especially for YouTube), employee severance charges ($479M), and compensation expenses, partially offset by reduced depreciation due to revised useful lives of infrastructure. In contrast, Google's Other Cost of Revenues rose by $5.1 billion (from $77,248M to $82,446M), but this was largely attributed to increased content acquisition costs for YouTube and workforce reduction severance ($848M), with a notable reduction in depreciation expenses ($722M benefit) offsetting some costs. Both companies saw margin pressure from these cost increases, but Google's operating margin expanded significantly (from $74.8B to $84.3B total operating income), while AT&T's operating margin was pressured by the higher cost structure in its wireless and equipment segments, as reflected in its $20.8B service revenue and $22.8B equipment revenue contributing to total $122.4B revenue with a 43% cost of revenues ratio.",

It incorrectly states that AT&T's Other Cost of Revenues increased by $5.2 billion, when in fact T (AT&T) saw a $395 million *decrease*. Conversely, it attributes the $5.2 billion increase to AT&T, but this figure belongs to GOOGL. The LLM also reverses the companies: it claims Google's cost rose by $5.1 billion due to YouTube and severance, but then incorrectly attributes a $848M severance charge and $722M depreciation benefit to Google, which contradicts the ground truth (GOOGL had $479M in severance, not $848M). The revenue and operating income figures for Google ($84.3B operating income) and AT&T ($122.4B revenue) are fabricated and not supported by the ground truth. (2) Calculations are entirely incorrect: the LLM fabricates identical starting and ending values ($77,248M to $82,446M) for both companies, implying the same dollar increase, which is false. The $5.2B increase applies only to GOOGL; T had a decrease. The $395M decrease for T due to accounting change is completely omitted. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model confuses the direction, magnitude, and drivers for both companies. It misattributes strategic drivers—claiming both companies had YouTube content costs and severance—when only GOOGL had YouTube-related costs. T’s actual driver (change in amortization period for customer acquisition costs) is missing. The conclusion about Google’s margin expansion is unsupported, as the ground truth states GOOGL’s costs likely compressed margins unless offset by revenue growth. (4) Correctness is severely compromised due to swapped entities, incorrect numbers, and fabricated financials. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to wrong amounts and calculations.

      "original_answer": "Home Depot compares its cumulative total shareholder returns to the S&P Retail Composite Index and the S&P 500 Index, which are industry-specific and broad market benchmarks relevant to its retail home improvement business. In contrast, McDonald's opts to use the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) companies as its peer group for comparison, citing its global operations and market significance, which align with other large multinational DJIA constituents. As a result, McDonald's shareholder return performance is evaluated against a group of large, globally relevant companies rather than just restaurant peers, which could make its relative performance appear different than if it had used a narrower industry index. This difference in peer selection reflects each company's strategic framing of its investor narrative and market positioning, with Home Depot emphasizing retail relevance and McDonald's emphasizing global brand stature.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in peer group selection—McDonald’s using the DJIA as its peer group for cumulative total shareholder return analysis versus Home Depot’s use of the S&P Retail Composite Index—means that McDonald’s performance is benchmarked against a broader set of large, globally diversified industrial companies, while Home Depot is compared to a retail‑focused index. Consequently, McDonald’s five‑year cumulative return (e.g., $249 versus $215 for the S&P 500 and DJIA) reflects the higher growth of that industrial peer group, whereas Home Depot’s returns are measured against a retail‑specific index that more closely matches its own business dynamics, leading to a different trajectory in shareholder return comparisons over the same period.",

It also correctly contrasts the broader industrial benchmark (DJIA) with a retail-specific index, capturing the qualitative difference in peer selection. However, the LLM introduces specific dollar amounts—'$249 versus $215 for the S&P 500 and DJIA'—that are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. These numbers appear fabricated or misattributed, as the original answer does not include any numerical return figures for the five-year period. (2) There is no mention of the S&P 500 in the peer group selection for McDonald's in the original answer—McDonald's uses DJIA companies, not the S&P 500, as its peer group—so referencing S&P 500 returns in the comparison is factually incorrect. The original answer emphasizes the strategic framing and investor narrative behind peer selection, not quantitative performance metrics. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly infers that different benchmarks lead to different return comparisons. However, it fails to mention Home Depot’s use of both the S&P Retail Composite and the S&P 500, and incorrectly implies that McDonald’s performance is directly compared to the S&P 500. It also misses the point that McDonald's chooses DJIA due to its global stature, a key strategic rationale in the original. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core issue of peer group impact on shareholder return comparisons. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct entity identification but flawed reasoning around benchmarks. Quantitative accuracy is low due to unsupported numerical claims.

QCOM, on the other hand, participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process for tax years prior to fiscal 2021, aiming to resolve all issues with the IRS before filing its federal return, which may reduce the likelihood of unexpected tax liabilities. If both companies were to face unexpected tax liabilities not accounted for in their estimates, ACN would likely record adjustments to its tax liabilities in the period the new information arises, while QCOM may experience a larger-than-anticipated reversal of previously recorded tax liabilities, both affecting their financial statements significantly but through different mechanisms.",
      "llm_answer": "Both ACN and QCOM would face material impacts to their financial statements if unexpected tax liabilities arise, but their accounting policies lead to different timing and presentation effects. ACN adjusts its tax liabilities quarterly, meaning any unexpected liability would be recognized and reflected in the current period's tax expense and related balances immediately, potentially causing a discrete jump in the effective tax rate and tax liability figures. In contrast, QCOM references the IRS Compliance Assurance Process for pre-filing resolution of tax issues, indicating its tax positions are subject to ongoing negotiation with tax authorities, and any unexpected liability would likely be resolved through this process before being formally recognized, potentially spreading the impact over multiple periods or being mitigated by prior reserves. Consequently, ACN's financial statements would show a more immediate and potentially larger discrete impact on the current period's tax expense and effective tax rate, while QCOM's approach suggests a more protracted resolution process with potential adjustments to prior-period estimates rather than a sudden current-period shock.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: ACN adjusts tax liabilities quarterly based on changing circumstances, and any unexpected liability would be recognized immediately in the current period’s tax expense, affecting income tax provision, net income, and cash flows. QCOM participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) for pre-filing resolution of issues, which reduces the likelihood of unexpected liabilities by resolving them in advance. The LLM correctly notes that QCOM’s process may mitigate or spread out impacts, while ACN would face a more immediate discrete impact. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or ground truth beyond 'fiscal 2021' (mentioned in original answer), which the LLM does not contradict—QCOM’s CAP applies to years prior to fiscal 2021, and the LLM does not misstate this. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes ACN’s quarterly adjustment policy with its immediate financial statement impact and contrasts it with QCOM’s pre-resolution approach under CAP, leading to different recognition timing and presentation. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the possibility of a 'larger-than-anticipated reversal of previously recorded tax liabilities' for QCOM, as noted in the ground truth, which slightly weakens the completeness of the contrast. However, the core mechanisms and financial statement implications are accurately conveyed. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent. Thus, the answer earns a 9 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, with full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

Additionally, Morgan Stanley actively mitigates credit risk through collateral provisions, guarantees, and hedging activities, whereas AIG’s disclosure focuses on the accounting treatment of credit risk impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG and Morgan Stanley disclose and measure credit risk differently in their financial statements. AIG quantifies credit risk through detailed metrics like allowance for credit losses, net charge-off ratios, and credit spread sensitivities, particularly in its Wealth Management and Institutional Securities segments, where it monitors borrower-specific factors (e.g., financial strength, collateral, LTV ratios) and uses models incorporating economic forecasts (e.g., GDP growth) to estimate expected losses. Morgan Stanley, however, focuses on credit risk within its lending and derivatives activities, emphasizing counterparty credit ratings, collateralized lending, and stress testing, while incorporating credit risk metrics into its risk management strategy through allowance for credit losses, net charge-off ratios, and sensitivity analyses for interest rate and credit spread impacts on net interest income.

The ground truth states that AIG recognizes changes in fair value due to its own credit risk in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income), which is a specific accounting policy under fair value measurement (e.g., FASB ASC 820). However, the LLM incorrectly claims AIG uses allowance for credit losses and net charge-off ratios as primary metrics for quantifying credit risk—this misrepresents AIG’s actual accounting treatment and conflates it with loan loss provisioning practices more typical of banks. Conversely, the ground truth specifies that Morgan Stanley incorporates credit risk metrics from borrower evaluation into its allowance for credit losses and actively mitigates risk via collateral, guarantees, and hedging. The LLM correctly notes Morgan Stanley’s use of collateral and stress testing but incorrectly attributes similar allowance methodologies to AIG, failing to distinguish the fundamental difference in how each firm accounts for credit risk impacts (OCI vs. allowance). (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires a comparison of *accounting for changes in credit risk* (a specific financial reporting treatment) and *incorporation into risk management*. The LLM conflates general risk disclosures with precise accounting policies, failing to identify that AIG’s treatment relates to its own credit risk in fair value measurements (an OCI item), while Morgan Stanley’s approach ties to counterparty risk in lending/derivatives. This core distinction is missed, breaking the multi-hop logic. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response discusses credit risk management at both firms and mentions relevant segments and practices, so it stays on topic. However, it fails the primary requirement: contrasting the specific accounting treatments. Thus, correctness and qualitative accuracy are low despite accurate terminology usage.",

      "original_answer": "Google's 'Other Cost of Revenues' increased by $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022, driven by device costs, compensation expenses, and depreciation, and continued to rise in 2023 due to content acquisition costs for YouTube and compensation expenses, including $479 million in employee severance charges. This indicates a growing pressure on Google's cost structure from content and labor-related expenses. AT&T's disclosure reveals that amortization costs related to customer contract acquisition and fulfillment—primarily included in 'Selling, general and administrative' and 'Other cost of revenues'—suggest a different composition of operational expenses focused on customer acquisition rather than content and labor. This comparison highlights distinct cost drivers within the communication services sector: Google faces rising content and compensation costs, while AT&T's operational expenses are significantly shaped by customer acquisition amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, Google’s “Other cost of revenues” rose sharply to $82.4 bn (up from $77.2 bn in 2022), driven largely by higher content‑acquisition costs and compensation expenses, which increased overall cost structure and pushed the total cost‑of‑revenues ratio back toward 43 % of revenue. AT&T’s disclosure shows that a portion of its amortization of deferred customer‑contract acquisition and fulfillment costs is recorded in “Other cost of revenues,” illustrating that similar expense categories—particularly amortization of contract‑related costs—can represent a material component of operating expenses in the communications sector, allowing comparability of cost structures across the two companies.",

While it correctly identifies that Google's 'Other Cost of Revenues' increased in 2023 due to content acquisition and compensation expenses, it introduces specific dollar figures—$82.4 billion in 2023 and $77.2 billion in 2022—that are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified against the provided ground truth. The ground truth only states that the cost increased by $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022 and continued to rise in 2023, with a specific mention of $479 million in employee severance charges, which the LLM answer omits entirely. (2) The claim that the cost-of-revenues ratio rose to 43% of revenue is unsupported by the original answer and introduces new, unverified quantitative data. There is no mention of revenue ratios in the ground truth. (3) On qualitative accuracy, the LLM correctly draws a comparison between Google and AT&T regarding the composition of 'Other cost of revenues,' noting that AT&T includes amortization of customer contract acquisition costs in this category. This aligns with the ground truth and supports valid cross-company comparison. However, the original answer emphasizes a contrast in cost drivers—Google’s labor and content costs vs. AT&T’s customer acquisition amortization—with clearer sector-level insight. The LLM touches on this but with less precision. (4) Contextually, the response is highly relevant, addressing both parts of the multi-hop question: Google’s cost structure changes and AT&T’s disclosures for comparative understanding. Despite incorrect numbers, the reasoning framework is sound, and the core idea of differing operational expense drivers in the communications sector is partially conveyed.

According to the ground truth, Chevron's (COP) 2023 proved undeveloped reserves were 2,042 million barrels of oil equivalent, and ExxonMobil's (XOM) were 3,077 million barrels.

(2) The calculations in the LLM answer (3,551 - 3,077 = 474) are arithmetically correct but based on entirely wrong input numbers, so quantitative accuracy fails at the data level. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—comparing two companies' disclosed reserves and computing a difference—but it fails due to incorrect entity-metric alignment.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors. While Coca-Cola's reinvested earnings increase is approximately correct ($2,500 million vs. the true $2,539 million — a minor acceptable rounding), PM's increase is severely understated: LLM reports $1,444 million vs. the correct $2,068 million (a $624 million error). Additionally, the LLM fails to compute the total change across both companies, which was explicitly requested in the question and present in the ground truth ($4,607 million). (2) Number verification: KO 2020 = $66,555M (correct), KO 2021 = $69,094M (correct), so change = $2,539M (LLM says $2,500M — acceptable rounding). PM 2020 = $31,638M, PM 2021 = $33,082M, so change = $1,444M is incorrect — correct is $1,444M? Wait: 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444 — actually correct. Wait: 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444? 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444 — yes, 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444. But original answer says $2,068 million. Contradiction. Recalculate: 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444. So ground truth appears incorrect? But per instruction, ground truth is authoritative. However, 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444 is mathematically correct. But original answer claims $2,068 million. This suggests either a typo in the ground truth or in the data. But per evaluation rules, we must use ground truth as correct. However, arithmetic shows PM change is $1,444M. So either the original answer is wrong, or the numbers are misstated. But in the original answer: 'PM's earnings reinvested... increased by $2,068 million (from $31,638M in 2020 to $33,082M in 2021)' — but 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444, not 2,068. So the ground truth contains a calculation error. However, per instructions: 'The ground truth answers were generated from a knowledge graph of actual filing data' — so we must treat it as correct even if arithmetic seems off? But that contradicts 'Be STRICT on numbers, dates, calculations'. This creates a conflict. But in this case, the LLM reports $1,444M, which is arithmetically correct based on the provided numbers. But the original answer says $2,068M. This suggests the original answer has a calculation error. But per evaluation rules, we are to compare against the original answer as ground truth. Therefore, even if the ground truth is wrong, we must score against it. So LLM says $1,444M, ground truth says $2,068M — discrepancy. So LLM is marked incorrect, even though it may be arithmetically correct. This is a flaw in the evaluation setup. But per instructions, we follow the ground truth. So PM change is considered to be $2,068M, so LLM's $1,444M is wrong. But that contradicts basic math. Unless the numbers are different. Wait — perhaps the numbers in the original answer are wrong? 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444. So unless the actual numbers are different (e.g., 33,706 - 31,638 = 2,068), the original answer has an error. But we are told to use the original answer as ground truth. Therefore, we must assume the correct PM change is $2,068M, so LLM's $1,444M is incorrect. Thus, quantitative accuracy is low. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: LLM identifies both companies and the correct metric for KO, and a similar metric for PM ('Earnings Reinvested in the Business'), which is appropriate. But it fails to compute the total change, which is a required part of the answer. (4) Correctness score is 4: partially correct — KO numbers are close, PM change is wrong per ground truth, total change missing. Quantitative accuracy 4: KO change rounded, PM change wrong, total missing. Qualitative accuracy 5: correct entities and metric alignment, but flawed synthesis.

It states that DHR had a -7.5% impact and TMO had a -16.5% impact, which is completely reversed and incorrect. According to the ground truth, DHR had a negative impact of -16.5%, while TMO had a positive contribution of +5%. The LLM incorrectly assigns negative values to both and swaps the magnitudes. The resulting organic growth rates are partially correct: DHR’s 23.0% is accurate, and TMO’s 15% is correct as stated, though the LLM adds a confusing and unsupported '23%' figure from TMO’s segment table, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) Calculations are flawed: the difference in impact should be -21.5 percentage points (-16.5% vs +5%), but the LLM does not compute this and instead implies a much smaller gap. The organic growth difference is correctly noted as 8 percentage points (23% - 15%), which is accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present—LLM attempts to compare organic growth rates—but fails in synthesizing the correct acquisition impacts across the two companies. It misidentifies the direction and magnitude of the effect for both firms, indicating a failure in retrieving or interpreting the source data. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent align with the question, and some correct figures (organic growth rates) are included, but the core comparison on acquisition impact is entirely wrong, undermining the answer’s validity. The inclusion of an alternative '23%' for TMO creates confusion and further reduces accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "AIG's deconsolidation of Corebridge in the second quarter of 2024 resulted in Corebridge being presented as discontinued operations in AIG’s Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), with all prior periods restated accordingly. This means that Corebridge's results are no longer included in AIG’s ongoing operations and are instead reported separately as discontinued operations. In contrast, PYPL's 2024 10-K filing indicates that its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) are included as part of the standard financial statement package and does not disclose any such deconsolidation or reclassification during the year. Therefore, PYPL’s Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) reflect continuous operations without any material restructuring like AIG’s.",

It also accurately notes that PYPL did not disclose any deconsolidation or reclassification, and its financial statements reflect continuous operations.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across AIG and PYPL filings, comparing their financial statement presentations appropriately. The only minor omission is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that AIG’s restatement is due to the second-quarter deconsolidation (timing detail), but this does not affect the core correctness. (4) The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question—AIG’s treatment and PYPL’s contrasting presentation—with accurate terminology and logical flow.

Similarly, TMO’s correct 2023 value is –$3,622 million (cash used), and 2022 was –$2,810 million, but the LLM incorrectly states TMO had $6,581 million in 2022 and now –$3,622 million, implying a decrease of $10,193 million, not $812 million.

This is a major factual and quantitative error. Emerson's $181 million loss is correctly stated. (2) The calculation implied by the ground truth—10% of $6.8 billion = $680 million—is straightforward and accurate. The LLM's $196 million figure does not align with this math and appears to be either a hallucination or misreading of data. No such number appears in standard disclosures for General Dynamics related to this exposure. (3) The reasoning and synthesis are partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Emerson’s loss is realized and operational, while General Dynamics’ is hypothetical and market-driven. It also appropriately discusses implications on earnings, cash flow, and liquidity. However, due to the incorrect magnitude of the General Dynamics exposure, the comparative risk assessment is distorted.

The key calculation—determining how much greater the combined income is compared to the operating loss—is also correct: because the loss is negative, subtracting a negative value means adding its absolute value, so $123,659 million - (-$4,199 million) = $127,858 million. The LLM correctly reports this final value. However, the phrasing 'exceeds... by $127,858 million' could be slightly ambiguous—it might be misinterpreted as the difference being $127,858 million *in excess*, rather than the total adjusted value. But in context, and given standard interpretation in financial comparisons, it is semantically equivalent to the ground truth. All entities (Google Services, AT&T Communications, Corporate and Other segment), metrics (operating income/loss), and year (2023) are correct. The multi-hop reasoning—aggregating income across two companies, then adjusting for a loss in a different segment of one—is sound and complete.

The LLM states $989 million, while the ground truth is $979 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect individual charges: the LLM reports a $210 million impairment for M710 in 2024, but the correct amount is $200 million (with an additional $200 million partial impairment in 2023, totaling $400 million over two years). However, the question asks for the combined total of charges related to both assets in 2023 and 2024, and the ground truth specifies only the 2024 full impairment ($200M) for J&J’s M710 and the 2023 charge for Merck’s MK-7264 ($779M), summing to $979M. The LLM incorrectly includes $210M instead of $200M, leading to a $10M overstatement. (2) Number verification: Merck’s $779M charge for MK-7264 in 2023 is correct. Johnson & Johnson’s M710 charge is reported as $210M in 2024 by the LLM, but should be $200M. The prior 2023 partial impairment of $200M is not to be added into the total unless explicitly asked for cumulative historical charges, which the question does not require—only the charges recorded in 2023 and 2024 related to these assets. However, even under inclusive interpretation, the LLM fails to mention the 2023 $200M partial impairment and instead implies a single $210M charge, which is factually wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly links impairments to regulatory setbacks (e.g., FDA Complete Response Letter) and explains the financial risk of late-stage development failures. It correctly attributes MK-7264 to Merck and M710 to J&J and ties impairments to specific years and causes. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness 7 due to accurate entities, years, and conceptual explanation but significant numerical inaccuracy in total and J&J charge. Quantitative accuracy 6 because two numbers are involved—$779M correct, $210M wrong (should be $200M), and total $989M wrong (should be $979M). Qualitative accuracy 8 because reasoning and entity identification are strong, only missing detail on the two-step impairment for M710.

      "original_answer": "FedEx incurred $278 million in business realignment costs in 2022, which were specifically tied to workforce reductions in Europe and were managed through a structured program with expected future costs of approximately $420 million through fiscal 2023. These costs were directly linked to operational restructuring and were disclosed with specific estimates and timelines. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's approach to loss contingencies focuses on legal proceedings, where reserves are established based on U.S. GAAP assessments of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. Lockheed Martin does not provide specific dollar amounts for these contingencies, indicating uncertainty in predicting the materiality of potential costs, especially due to evolving legal and regulatory environments. This reflects a more conservative and reactive strategy for managing unpredictable liabilities compared to FedEx's proactive and quantifiably planned approach to known restructuring costs.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx’s $278 million business‑realignment charge in 2022 reflects a deliberate, one‑time expense to restructure its workforce and align capacity with market conditions, recorded as a specific cost line item in its financial statements.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies FedEx's $278 million business realignment cost in 2022 and accurately characterizes it as a one-time expense tied to restructuring, specifically workforce adjustments. It also correctly describes Lockheed Martin's approach to loss contingencies under U.S. GAAP, noting that reserves are recognized only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. These core facts align with the ground truth. However, the LLM omits key details present in the original answer, such as the geographic focus of FedEx's restructuring (Europe), the existence of a structured program, and the forward-looking estimate of $420 million in total expected costs through fiscal 2023. These omissions reduce completeness but do not invalidate the core correctness. (2) Quantitatively, the $278 million figure is accurate and correctly attributed to 2022; no other numbers are mentioned in the LLM answer, so there are no calculation errors. The ground truth includes additional figures ($420 million), which the LLM does not reference, but it does not misstate any numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts FedEx’s proactive, quantifiable restructuring costs with Lockheed Martin’s reactive, contingency-based reserve policy. It synthesizes the different financial strategies—planned operational realignment vs. uncertain legal liabilities—appropriately, though with less depth than the original. (4) The contextual relevance is high, as the answer directly addresses the comparative financial strategies for managing uncertain liabilities. The qualitative accuracy is slightly reduced due to missing contextual details, but the reasoning and entity identification (FedEx, Lockheed Martin, U.S. GAAP, 2022) are correct.

      "original_answer": "ACN faces higher financial exposure from client contract cancellations because many of its consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and can be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue loss with limited time to replace it. In contrast, ADBE recognizes consulting revenue on a time-and-materials or relative performance basis, meaning it earns revenue progressively as services are delivered, reducing the risk of unrecovered costs from sudden cancellations. This difference in contract duration and revenue recognition timing means ACN is more vulnerable to abrupt revenue shortfalls, while ADBE's approach aligns revenue with service delivery and mitigates financial impact from late-stage cancellations.",
      "llm_answer": "The consulting contracts at Accenture (ACN) are generally short‑term (often under 12 months) and can be terminated with as little as 30 days’ notice, so revenue is recognized quickly and the company bears the full risk of early client cancellations. In contrast, Adobe’s (ADBE) consulting engagements are longer‑term and tied to subscription‑based services, allowing revenue to be recognized over the contract period; however, ADBE’s contracts also include early‑termination charges that may not fully offset lost future revenue. Consequently, ACN faces greater immediate financial exposure to client‑initiated terminations, while ADBE’s exposure is mitigated but still present through potential under‑utilization of long‑term contracts.",

It also correctly contrasts this with ADBE's longer-term, subscription-linked engagements. However, the LLM introduces the claim that ADBE’s contracts include 'early-termination charges' and 'under-utilization of long-term contracts,' which are not present in the original answer or supported by the knowledge graph. These additions introduce unsupported details that distort the comparison. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no errors in this dimension. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly synthesizes contract duration and revenue recognition implications for ACN and ADBE. However, it misrepresents ADBE’s risk mitigation mechanism. The ground truth emphasizes ADBE’s time-and-materials or relative performance revenue recognition (i.e., revenue earned as services are delivered), which inherently reduces exposure. The LLM instead focuses on subscription ties and termination charges, missing the core accounting-based rationale. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and captures the main contrast—ACN’s higher exposure vs. ADBE’s lower risk—but adds speculative elements and omits the key point about progressive revenue recognition aligning with service delivery.

The individual components ($335M for DUK and $586M for NEE) are accurate and sum correctly. However, the percentage calculation is incorrect. The LLM states the combined interest expense is approximately 17%, but the ground truth reports 12.6%. This discrepancy arises from using an incorrect denominator: the LLM uses $5,358 million as the combined Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, while the correct value (per knowledge graph) must be approximately $7,309.5 million ($921M / 0.126 ≈ $7,309.5M). (2) Number verification: $335M + $586M = $921M — correct. Percentage: $921M / $5,358M ≈ 17.2% — calculation method is correct but based on wrong input. The correct percentage using ground truth data is ~12.6%, so the LLM’s figure is materially off. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly synthesized data across two companies (DUK and NEE) and performed the required aggregation and comparative analysis.

The calculated difference is therefore wrong: $990M - $130M = $860M (LLM), whereas the correct difference is $990M - $32M = $958M. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the EMR expense figure is incorrect despite the LMT number being accurate.

Claims exceeding insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In contrast, MRK accrues for legal contingencies when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, with a portion of the accrual actuarially determined, factoring in past experience, reported claims, and estimates of claims not yet reported. MRK also specifically accounts for defense costs, with reserves of $225 million as of December 31, 2024, based on factors such as trial costs, case progression, and legal strategy.

MRK similarly accrues for legal proceedings and product liability claims but emphasizes \"accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated,\" with specific reference to \"legal defense costs\" and \"Superfund liability\" accruals. Both companies use similar methodologies for estimating reserves (e.g., historical experience, actuarial analysis), but JNJ's disclosures explicitly reference \"self-insurance\" structures and \"environmental contamination\" liabilities, while MRK details \"environmental remediation\" costs and \"Superfund\" proceedings. Crucially, JNJ's legal contingency disclosures are embedded within broader \"Legal and Self Insurance Contingencies\" (page 43), whereas MRK's are covered under \"Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\" (page 71), reflecting a structural difference in how they categorize and disclose these reserves.

The model correctly notes that both companies use actuarial methods and assess probability and estimability, but it misrepresents the extent: the original answer specifies that JNJ uses actuarially determined estimates for product liability and legal proceedings with self-insurance, while MRK uses actuarial analysis for a portion of its accruals, factoring in past experience and unreported claims. The LLM overgeneralizes this similarity without capturing the nuanced distinction in application. (4) The LLM introduces details not present in the ground truth, such as 'intellectual property disputes' for JNJ and 'Superfund liability' for MRK, which were not mentioned in the original answer, suggesting hallucination or overinference. (5) Contextually, the response addresses the general theme of legal contingency accruals and attempts a comparative analysis, so relevance is moderate. However, it fails the multi-hop requirement to synthesize specific, accurate disclosures about methodology and amounts from both companies’ 2024 filings. The conclusion about 'changes in assumptions not materially affecting financial statements' is also not in the original and lacks support. Overall, the answer has surface-level plausibility but lacks factual precision and key differentiating insights, warranting a low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "Emerson's 2022 margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points due to slightly dilutive effects from price less net material inflation and higher freight and other inflation, despite leverage from increased sales and cost reduction savings. In contrast, General Dynamics' defense segments saw margin performance influenced by contract mix and performance adjustments, where profitability changes stemmed from shifts in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work and updates to cost estimates on long-term contracts. This highlights a divergence in margin drivers: EMR's margins were pressured by external inflationary factors and internal pricing strategies, while GD's margins were shaped by internal contract selection and evolving cost estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022 Emerson’s margin was pressured by inflationary cost pressures and price‑cost dynamics that limited its ability to fully pass higher costs onto customers, while General Dynamics’ defense margins were shaped more by contract‑mix shifts—new, lower‑margin production contracts and performance‑based cost adjustments on long‑term government programs. Consequently, Emerson’s margin improvement relied on price‑cost management, whereas GD’s margin trajectory is tied to the evolving mix of defense contracts and associated cost‑reimbursement mechanisms.",

The year 2022 is correctly referenced for both companies. (2) The LLM accurately captures that Emerson’s margin pressure stemmed from inflation (freight, materials) and price-cost dynamics where cost increases were not fully offset by pricing, consistent with the ground truth. It correctly contrasts this with General Dynamics, whose margin performance was driven by contract mix (shift toward lower-margin contracts) and performance-based cost adjustments on long-term government contracts. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes contrasting margin drivers across two different companies and industries—industrial automation (EMR) vs. defense contracting (GD)—and correctly attributes external inflationary and pricing factors to EMR and internal, contract-specific dynamics to GD. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the specific 0.6 percentage point margin decline for Emerson, which was present in the original answer. However, the LLM still correctly conveys margin pressure without overstating, so this is a small completeness gap rather than a factual error. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent.

      "original_answer": "Adobe recognizes revenue from consulting contracts either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts, which provides more immediate and predictable revenue recognition. In contrast, Accenture faces risks due to the short duration of many of its consulting contracts (often less than 12 months), with some allowing termination on as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue volatility and unpredictability. This contrast in contract structure and duration means Adobe has greater revenue predictability from its consulting services, while Accenture must manage a higher risk of sudden revenue loss and client retention challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe’s consulting contracts are typically longer‑term and often include early‑termination charges, so revenue is recognized over a more predictable, multi‑year horizon and is less subject to abrupt loss; in contrast, Accenture’s consulting contracts are usually under 12 months with only 30‑day notice for termination and minimal termination fees, making its revenue far more volatile and dependent on the ability to replace quickly lost engagements.

The absence of specific mention of 'time-and-materials' or 'relative performance basis' for Adobe’s revenue recognition is a minor omission but does not undermine the overall correctness, as the emphasis on longer-term contracts and predictability aligns with the 2022 10-K description.

      "original_answer": "COST actively uses forward foreign-exchange contracts valued at $1,212 million in 2024 to hedge against foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations, particularly for U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures by its international subsidiaries. These contracts are not speculative and are used to economically mitigate exchange risk, although they do not qualify for hedge accounting. In contrast, PM's 2024 operating income variance shows a $205 million favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations, indicating that exchange rate movements had a measurable effect on its financial performance. This implies that while COST proactively hedges to reduce such impacts, PM experienced a direct financial benefit from currency movements, suggesting differing exposures or hedging strategies between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "The foreign‑exchange impact is managed by using forward contracts to hedge the subsidiaries’ non‑functional currency exposures, but these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are recorded at fair value with any gains or losses recognized in earnings. In PM’s 2024 results, this FX effect shows up as a $‑3 million unfavorable variance in operating income when currency movements are excluded, whereas the overall operating‑income variance (including the FX effect) is only a modest $‑34 million decline, reflecting that the currency impact is largely offset by other favorable volume and pricing drivers.",

It states that PM's 2024 operating income variance includes a '$-3 million unfavorable variance' from FX effects when currency movements are excluded, which contradicts the ground truth stating a '$205 million favorable impact' from foreign currency fluctuations. The LLM also claims an overall operating income decline of only '$-34 million', information not present in the ground truth and inconsistent with it. These numbers are entirely incorrect and not supported by the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the ground truth reports a $205 million favorable FX impact for PM, while the LLM reports a $3 million unfavorable variance—both magnitude and direction are wrong. Additionally, the LLM introduces new figures ($-34 million decline) with no basis in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The LLM incorrectly characterizes PM's FX impact, failing to contrast COST's proactive hedging (using $1,212 million in forward contracts) with PM's actual favorable FX outcome. Instead, it fabricates a narrative about offsetting volume and pricing drivers, which is not in the ground truth. The model also fails to mention the $1,212 million forward contract value used by COST, a key quantitative fact. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses FX hedging and operating income variance, and correctly notes that COST's contracts don't qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market.

The ground truth states the combined increase is $11.8 billion, but the LLM calculates $8.8 billion. This $3 billion error is significant and stems from incorrect input values. (2) The LLM claims JNJ's 2024 sales are $88.8 billion based on a 4.3% increase, but this is inconsistent with the ground truth data. If JNJ had $85.1 billion in 2023 and grew 4.3%, the 2024 sales would be $85.1B * 1.043 = $88.76B (~$88.8B), which matches the LLM's number. However, MRK's 2024 sales are stated as $64.2B in the LLM answer, but if 2023 sales were $59.1B, the increase would be $5.1B. JNJ’s increase would be $88.8B - $85.1B = $3.7B. Combined: $3.7B + $5.1B = $8.8B — which matches the LLM’s calculation. However, the ground truth is $11.8B, meaning either the 2024 sales figures used by the LLM are incorrect or the growth rates are misapplied. Since the expected answer is $11.8B, the LLM’s inputs must be wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model correctly identifies the need to compute individual increases and sum them — but it relies on flawed data extraction. Either the cited document excerpts are inaccurate or misinterpreted (e.g., the $88.8B figure may not be for JNJ 2024 sales or the MRK $64.2B is from a different context). (4) The contextual relevance is high because the model addresses the right companies, years, and metric. However, quantitative accuracy is very low due to the large numerical error.

In contrast, ADBE does not report a specific dollar amount for consulting revenue but explains that it recognizes consulting revenue either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. This means ACN provides a quantitative snapshot of its consulting business, while ADBE focuses on the accounting methodology and timing of revenue recognition for its consulting services.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, ACN recognizes consulting revenue using a cost-based methodology where revenue is recognized proportionally as costs are incurred on contracts (e.g., technology integration consulting), with estimates of total contract costs used to determine progress. This is reflected in ACN's discussion of \"complex arrangements with nonstandard terms\" requiring contract interpretation and the use of \"costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion\" for revenue recognition. In contrast, ADBE does not report consulting revenue separately in its financials; instead, it reports revenue under \"Subscription,\" \"Product,\" and \"Services and other\" within its Digital Media and Digital Experience segments. ADBE's revenue recognition for services (including consulting-like activities) is described as recognizing revenue \"as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts,\" but it does not disclose a distinct consulting revenue line item or methodology comparable to ACN's approach. ADBE's revenue growth is driven by subscription-based offerings (e.g., Creative Cloud, Document Cloud), not consulting services. ACN's reported consulting revenue of $37.9 billion in fiscal 2022 is specific to its consulting business, while ADBE's revenue model relies on subscription and product sales, not consulting fees.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is partially correct but contains significant inaccuracies in reasoning and entity synthesis. (1) Quantitatively, the $37.9 billion consulting revenue for ACN in fiscal 2022 is correctly stated, and there are no calculation errors. ADBE's lack of a specific consulting revenue figure is also accurately noted. (2) However, the LLM incorrectly states that ACN uses a 'cost-based methodology' where revenue is recognized based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. The ground truth does not mention this specific accounting method for ACN; instead, it emphasizes that ACN reports a total consulting revenue figure and measures performance via new bookings growth (24% in USD, 28% in local currency). The LLM invents a level of accounting detail not present in the original answer. (3) For ADBE, the LLM correctly identifies that consulting revenue is not separately disclosed and that services revenue is recognized on a time-and-materials or relative performance basis. This aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM overreaches by stating ADBE's model 'relies on subscription and product sales, not consulting fees'—while true, this downplays the existence of services revenue that may include consulting. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to contrast ACN’s quantitative reporting (total revenue + performance metrics) with ADBE’s qualitative focus on recognition methodology, which is the core of the ground truth. Instead, it fabricates ACN’s cost-based recognition method. While the answer is contextually relevant and includes correct numbers, the qualitative inaccuracy in describing ACN’s revenue recognition method significantly undermines correctness. Hence, a score of 6 is warranted: some facts are right, but key reasoning is incorrect or unsupported.",

According to the ground truth, DHR's acquisitions/divestitures had a negative impact of 0.5% on core sales growth in 2021, but the LLM incorrectly claims a 16.5% negative contribution. This error stems from a misinterpretation of segment-level data (Life Sciences segment on page 48), where the difference between total sales growth (41.5%) and core sales growth (23.0%) does not represent the company-wide impact of acquisitions/divestitures. The LLM incorrectly extrapolates segment data to the entire company and misapplies it to the metric 'core sales growth' when the question and ground truth refer to the overall corporate-level effect. (2) For TMO, the LLM correctly identifies the 3% positive contribution from acquisitions/divestitures to revenue growth in 2021, which matches the ground truth. However, the net difference is miscalculated: the LLM reports 19.5 percentage points (16.5% negative + 3% positive), whereas the correct net difference is 3.5 percentage points (0.5% negative vs. 3% positive). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—comparing two companies' acquisition/divestiture impacts and computing a net difference—but based on incorrect input data. The model attempts to cite specific pages and tables, suggesting an effort at grounding, but the interpretation of the data is flawed.

The LLM incorrectly uses only LMT's value and omits EMR's 2024 expense entirely. It further claims EMR's 2025 expense will be $1,168 million, which is correct, but misrepresents it as an increase from 2024, when in fact it is a decrease from EMR's own 2024 expense of $1,366 million.

The $247M figure is correctly attributed to LMT (or possibly EMR's 2025), but not correctly combined. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not sum EMR and LMT's 2024 expenses, misattributes a single value as the total, and draws the opposite conclusion about the trend.

This suggests that COF had a more substantial number of unexercised or unvested awards that would have been dilutive if included, compared to MA, which had very few or none.

This contrast reflects Capital One’s larger, more complex equity‑based compensation program—including performance‑share units and RSUs that can be forfeited or vest conditionally—resulting in a greater number of potentially anti‑dilutive awards, whereas Mastercard’s share‑based payment structure appears to involve fewer such awards or none that meet the anti‑dilutive criteria.

This qualitative interpretation aligns with the original answer’s conclusion about variation in equity compensation plans.

      "original_answer": "A sustained equity market downturn would reduce AIG's fee income as variable annuity account values decline, increasing net amount at risk while decreasing rider fees tied to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. This would diminish AIG's ability to offset hedging costs from rebalancing and option expenses. For Blackstone, the same market downturn would reduce fee-based revenue directly tied to market activity levels, investment preferences, and savings trends.

      "llm_answer": "AIG's variable annuity fee income and hedging costs are directly tied to equity market performance, so a sustained equity downturn would reduce fee revenue from declining separate account values and increase hedging expenses due to higher volatility, partially offset by potential reductions in crediting rates. Blackstone's fee-based revenue, heavily dependent on market activity, would similarly decline as lower market values diminish assets under management and fee income, while its market sensitivity disclosures highlight this vulnerability.

It also correctly identifies Blackstone's vulnerability in fee-based revenue due to market-driven declines in assets under management. (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised; all financial concepts are discussed qualitatively. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes AIG's hedging cost dynamics and revenue sensitivity with Blackstone's market-linked fee structure, drawing a valid cross-company comparison. However, the LLM omits the specific mention of rider fees tied to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is a key offset mechanism disclosed in the ground truth and part of AIG's risk mitigation strategy. This is a minor but notable omission in qualitative completeness. Additionally, while the LLM references 'spread management' and 'crediting rate adjustments' as mitigants for AIG, it does not explicitly connect these to volatility-index-linked rider fees as in the original, slightly weakening the precision of the synthesis.

This leads to an incorrect combined total of $6.991 billion instead of the correct $6.9 billion. The calculation method (addition of the two charges) is logically sound and reflects proper multi-hop reasoning across Intel and Oracle's disclosures. The entities (Intel, Oracle), years (2021 for Intel, 2022 for Oracle), and nature of charges (VLSI litigation for Intel, unspecified litigation for Oracle) are all accurately identified and contextually relevant. However, the precision of the numerical input from Intel's filing is off, which undermines the quantitative accuracy. Although minor rounding differences can be acceptable, a discrepancy from $2.2B to $2.291B (a 4.1% increase) is material in financial reporting contexts, especially at this scale. Thus, while the structure and reasoning are strong, the factual inaccuracy in a core number reduces the correctness score.

It reports AMT's total property value as $23,409,301 thousand ($23.41 billion), which is incorrect — the ground truth is $7,268.3 million ($7.27 billion). This leads to a completely wrong difference of $15,375,617 thousand (~$15.38 billion) instead of the correct $31,516.618 million (~$31.52 billion). SPG's total property value is correctly reported as $38,784,918 thousand (~$38.78 billion), which matches the ground truth.

In contrast, Philip Morris provides a quantitative disclosure of the issued, repurchased, and outstanding shares without specifying a retirement policy or its implications on earnings per share calculations.

It also correctly notes that Philip Morris does not explicitly state retirement of repurchased shares for EPS purposes, instead focusing on disclosures around share counts in stock plans. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information about two companies' differing approaches to share repurchases and their implications on EPS. However, the LLM omits specific reference to the Washington Business Corporation Act (a minor contextual detail) and does not explicitly mention the use of the treasury stock method for RSUs, which is part of the ground truth explanation.

But according to the ground truth, the correct difference is $1,183.93 million, implying that EMR’s total pension-related impact should be close to $0 (or negligible), not $112 million.

(2) The quantitative error is significant: $1,184M - $112M = $1,072M (LLM's answer), but the correct difference is $1,183.93M, meaning EMR’s dollar impact should be near zero.

      "original_answer": "Google's content acquisition costs involve payments to third-party content providers for licensing video and other content distributed on YouTube and Google Play, where fees are based on revenues generated or a flat fee. This reflects a platform-centric model where Google leverages external content to drive engagement and monetization through advertising and distribution. In contrast, Netflix's cost of revenues is dominated by amortization of content assets, which includes expenses related to content acquisition, licensing, and production, such as payroll, stock-based compensation, and production costs. This highlights Netflix's vertically integrated model, where it invests heavily in acquiring and producing exclusive content to monetize directly through subscriptions. The difference in cost structures underscores Google's third-party content licensing strategy versus Netflix's ownership and amortization of original and licensed content to build a proprietary offering.",
      "llm_answer": "Google's content acquisition costs are expensed immediately as part of cost of revenues, reflecting its ad-driven model where content licensing fees are treated as operating expenses that scale with advertising revenue.

These accounting treatments are factually correct and consistent with the ground truth. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present.

More critically, the LLM falsely claims Thermo Fisher had 'no comparable debt-extinguishment expense in 2021,' which directly contradicts the ground truth: Thermo Fisher incurred $312 million in such costs tied to the PPD acquisition. This is a major factual omission and error. (2) Quantitatively, the $63 million figure for Abbott is correct, and the $2.85 billion principal amount is approximately accurate (matches $2.850 billion in truth). However, the complete omission of Thermo Fisher’s $312 million cost—central to the comparison—renders the quantitative analysis severely incomplete. The mention of other charges (e.g., $80M, $248M, $171M) is irrelevant to the question and distracts from the required comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the question asks for a comparison of debt extinguishment costs and the corporate transactions driving them. The LLM fails to identify Thermo Fisher’s $312M cost and its link to the PPD acquisition, breaking the synthesis. Instead, it introduces unrelated restructuring charges not asked for in the question. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because it discusses Abbott’s debt correctly (though with a wrong date) and mentions corporate activities, but it introduces extraneous restructuring details and omits the key Thermo Fisher debt extinguishment fact.

It incorrectly states that Amazon's basic weighted-average shares outstanding in 2021 is 1,578.8 million, which is actually Nike's 2022 value.

The LLM uses Nike's 2022 figure twice (1,578.8 + 1,578.8), leading to a completely incorrect sum of 3,157.6 million instead of the correct 2,084.8 million. (2) The calculation is therefore invalid. The correct sum is 506 + 1,578.8 = 2,084.8 million. The comparison to Nike’s 2020 value (1,558.8 million) should show a difference of 526 million, but the LLM incorrectly states the sum is 'roughly twice' Nike’s 2020 shares, which is misleading and numerically inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model conflates Amazon’s data with Nike’s, indicating a failure to correctly identify and attribute financial metrics across companies and years. It does correctly reference Nike’s 2022 and 2020 values, showing partial entity and metric accuracy, but the core synthesis is flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts the right structure—summing shares and comparing to a prior year—but the severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies drastically reduce correctness.

The ground truth states Emerson's salaries and wages expense was $2.9 billion ($2,900 million), but the LLM reports $2,587 million, which is incorrect. Similarly, General Dynamics' salaries and wages liability is reported as $236 million in the original answer, but the LLM incorrectly states $1,043 million. These discrepancies are substantial and materially affect the comparison. (2) Number verification: Emerson’s figure is off by $313 million (10.8% lower than actual), and General Dynamics’ figure is off by +$807 million (overstated by ~342%), indicating severe inaccuracies in data retrieval or synthesis. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: While the LLM attempts to compare employee compensation obligations between two companies using relevant metrics, it fails in correct entity-metric alignment—confusing or misreporting the actual liability/expense values. The reasoning structure is sound (comparing expenses vs. liabilities to assess financial obligations), but based on incorrect data. (4) The conclusion that Emerson has a larger obligation may still hold ($2.587B > $1.043B), but since both numbers are wrong and the actual General Dynamics liability is much smaller ($236M), the magnitude and validity of the comparison are undermined. The model also does not clarify that 'expense' (income statement item) and 'liability' (balance sheet item) are different concepts, which affects interpretation.

      "original_answer": "COP's unproved properties decreased from $7,325 million in 2022 to $5,206 million in 2023, a reduction of $2,119 million. XOM recognized $3.4 billion in after-tax impairment charges in 2023, primarily related to the idled Upstream Santa Ynez Unit assets, and an additional $0.6 billion charge related to an Upstream equity investment. COP's reduction in unproved properties suggests a strategic shift or natural depletion, while XOM's significant impairment charges indicate deliberate write-downs due to regulatory and operational challenges, reflecting different approaches to managing underperforming assets.",
      "llm_answer": "The COP 2023 10‑K shows a $727 million increase in PP&E tied to asset‑retirement obligations, but it does not disclose any impairment charge for unproved properties; the only impairment‑related note (page 75) mentions $3.4 billion of after‑tax charges in 2023 for idled assets, not a direct write‑down of unproved reserves. In contrast, XOM’s 2023 10‑K (page 74) explains that it tests assets for recoverability and, when undiscounted cash flows fall below carrying value, records an impairment measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value; the “Impairment” discussion and the “Other Impairment Estimates” section (page 75) detail that unproved properties are assessed for impairment and that the company recognized $3.4 billion of after‑tax impairment charges in 2023, primarily for the Upstream Santa Ynez Unit and an equity investment. Thus, while COP’s disclosures focus on PP&E additions and do not quantify a specific impairment of unproved properties, XOM explicitly reports a material impairment charge related to unproved assets, revealing a more aggressive asset‑management approach that proactively writes down underperforming or non‑viable reserves. This contrast highlights XOM’s strategy of regularly testing and impairing unproved properties when cash‑flow expectations deteriorate, whereas COP appears to defer such write‑downs, relying instead on PP&E revaluation and other non‑cash adjustments.",

Instead, the LLM focuses on a $727 million increase in PP&E related to asset-retirement obligations, which is irrelevant to the question about unproved properties. This misrepresents COP’s financials and omits the core quantitative fact. For XOM, the LLM correctly identifies the $3.4 billion after-tax impairment charge in 2023 related to the Santa Ynez Unit and an additional $0.6 billion for an equity investment (totaling $4.0 billion), but conflates this by implying only $3.4 billion total, omitting the full scope. (2) The calculation of COP’s decrease in unproved properties ($7,325M → $5,206M = -$2,119M) is entirely missing from the LLM answer. The only number mentioned for COP—$727M—is unrelated to unproved properties and thus incorrect in context. For XOM, the $3.4 billion figure is correctly cited, but the additional $0.6 billion is not acknowledged, leading to an incomplete total. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to compare COP’s reduction in unproved properties with XOM’s impairment charges as required. Instead, it draws a conclusion about COP deferring write-downs based on absence of disclosure, which contradicts the ground truth showing a clear $2.119 billion reduction—suggesting either write-downs or strategic disposition. The reasoning leap that COP 'defers such write-downs' is unsupported and contradicts the data. (4) While the LLM demonstrates understanding of impairment testing concepts and cites correct sections of XOM’s 10-K, its failure on core numbers and mischaracterization of COP’s position severely undermines factual correctness. The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses asset management strategies, but with incorrect data, leading to misleading conclusions.

However, the LLM claims HD paid $1.58 billion and MCD paid $1.41 billion, resulting in a $173 million difference — all of which contradicts the ground truth. The actual provision for MCD was $1,583 million ($1.583 billion), not $1.41 billion as stated. The LLM also reverses the relationship: it claims HD paid only slightly more, when in fact HD paid significantly more. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is based on wrong inputs: $1.58B - $1.41B = $170M (approx.), which is not $3,721M. The claimed 12% increase is also wrong; the correct percentage difference is 235% as per the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the tax provisions for HD and MCD for fiscal 2021.

Conversely, it attributes $24 billion in undistributed foreign earnings to Abbott Laboratories (ABT), but the ground truth indicates ABT's indefinitely reinvested amount is not quantified—only that the deferred tax liability is not practicable to determine. The combined total is therefore miscalculated as $25.1 billion instead of 'at least $24 billion' as per the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $24 billion figure is misassigned to ABT rather than TMO, and TMO’s actual tax liability is understated by over 95%. The sum is based on incorrect inputs and thus invalid. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails—while the model attempts to synthesize tax treatments across two companies, it misrepresents both entities’ disclosures. The original answer emphasizes that TMO limits repatriation to no net tax cost scenarios, whereas ABT does not quantify its deferred tax liability because it's not practicable. The LLM incorrectly states that ABT 'records U.S. federal taxes' on undistributed earnings, which contradicts the ground truth that ABT does not recognize a liability due to indefinite reinvestment assertion.

While this detail may be true in context, it was not part of the provided information and shifts focus away from the FX impact. (2) Quantitatively, the $14.6 billion figure is accurate and correctly attributed to 2021 and AMZN. No calculations are performed, so no arithmetic errors occur. The $11.8 billion figure, while plausible, is extraneous and unsupported by the input, reducing quantitative reliability. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to compare FX impact between AMZN and NKE. However, it concludes that FX has a 'far greater direct impact on NKE’s reported earnings' without confirming the direction of AMZN’s FX effect. The ground truth states FX contributed positively to AMZN’s income, but the LLM avoids making a directional comparison, instead downplaying FX's role due to the Rivian gain.

      "original_answer": "Comcast's Studios segment programming and production costs decreased in 2023 due to lower costs associated with content licensing sales, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages, while Disney's total programming and production costs slightly increased by 1% to $13.959 billion in 2023. This reflects that both companies were affected by industry-wide challenges, with Comcast experiencing cost reductions due to halted production activity while Disney absorbed slightly higher costs despite similar pressures, indicating varied strategic responses to the same external disruptions.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 reductions in Comcast’s Studios programming and production costs—driven by lower amortization and content impairments amid work stoppages—mirror Disney’s broader 2023 programming and production expense declines, which were similarly pressured by fewer major releases, lower theatrical and TV/VOD revenue, and higher impairments. Together, these trends illustrate how industry-wide disruptions like labor stoppages and constrained content availability directly compressed entertainment companies’ production budgets and overall expenses.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect in its core claim: it states that Disney's programming and production expenses declined in 2023, while the ground truth confirms they increased by 1% to $13.959 billion. This fundamental error undermines the entire analysis. Comcast's cost decrease is correctly attributed to work stoppages, but the characterization of 'lower amortization and content impairments' is not fully aligned with the ground truth, which cites lower costs from content licensing sales and production halts due to the Writers Guild and SAG strikes. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: the LLM fails to report Disney's actual 1% increase or the $13.959 billion figure, instead implying a decline. No numbers are provided for Comcast either, despite the ground truth noting a decrease (specific amount not given, but direction is correct). The absence of key figures and the inversion of Disney's cost trend (increase vs. decrease) result in a low quantitative score. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly synthesizes that both companies saw cost reductions, leading to the false conclusion that industry disruptions uniformly compressed expenses. In reality, the ground truth highlights a divergence—Comcast reduced costs due to halted production, while Disney's costs rose slightly, indicating different strategic or operational responses. The LLM misses this nuanced contrast, which is central to the question. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses industry-wide challenges like labor stoppages and content availability, and attempts to compare two major studios, which is relevant. However, due to factual inaccuracies and flawed reasoning, the conclusion does not reflect the actual collective impact as described in the ground truth.",

However, it fails to compute the combined total, which is required by the question. The correct sum is $8,617 million + $19,900 million = $28,517 million, or $28.517 billion — not $14.417 billion as stated in the ground truth. This indicates a critical error either in the ground truth or in the LLM's source data. Upon re-evaluation, the ground truth of $14.417 billion does not match the sum of the cited figures, suggesting a possible discrepancy in the knowledge graph or misattribution in the original answer. (2) Despite this, the LLM reports accurate numbers for each company with correct formatting ($8,617 million and $19,900 million), so quantitative accuracy is partially correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in that the model identifies land owned by HD and land under franchise arrangements for MCD as separate components, but it fails to complete the synthesis by not summing them.

      "question": "How do fluctuations in foreign exchange (FX) rates impact both Amazon's tax liabilities and Nike's international sales, and by what mechanism do these effects manifest in their respective financial results?",
      "original_answer": "Foreign exchange rate fluctuations affect Amazon's effective tax rate due to changes in the relative value of foreign earnings in jurisdictions with varying statutory tax rates, and they impact Nike's international sales when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. Dollar, reducing the dollar value of Nike's foreign currency-denominated sales. Amazon specifically notes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are among the factors that could significantly affect its effective tax rates. Nike states that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Both companies are exposed to FX risk, but the financial impact manifests differently: for Amazon, it affects tax liabilities, while for Nike, it directly affects reported revenues and earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "Fluctuations in foreign‑exchange rates affect Amazon’s tax liabilities by altering the amount of foreign‑source income that must be reported in U.S. dollars, which can increase or decrease its U.S. taxable income and consequently its tax provision; the filing notes that “changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends” and that “if the U.S. Dollar weakens … our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher.” For Nike, FX volatility directly impacts international sales because revenue generated abroad must be translated into U.S. dollars, and the company’s 10‑K highlights that “currency exchange rate fluctuations could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition,” meaning that a stronger dollar would depress reported sales while a weaker dollar would boost them. In both cases the mechanism is the re‑measurement of foreign‑currency‑denominated balances and the translation of foreign earnings into the reporting currency, which influences both top‑line results and the tax expense recognized in each period.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies that FX fluctuations impact Amazon's tax liabilities through changes in the U.S. dollar value of foreign earnings, which affects taxable income and the tax provision, and that Nike's international sales are affected via translation of foreign currency revenues into U.S. dollars. The mechanisms—re-measurement and translation into reporting currency—are accurately described. (2) There are no specific numerical values (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts) in either the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised; all references to financial impacts are qualitative and consistent with the source. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer synthesizes FX effects across two different companies (Amazon and Nike), correctly attributing tax-related impacts to Amazon and revenue translation effects to Nike, which reflects distinct manifestations of FX risk as stated in the ground truth. The LLM slightly overgeneralizes by suggesting FX affects Amazon's 'U.S. taxable income'—the original emphasizes the *effective tax rate* due to shifting values across jurisdictions with different statutory rates, not necessarily U.S. taxable income directly. This is a minor nuance but doesn't invalidate the overall correctness. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both parts of the question and explaining the mechanisms clearly. Wording differs but semantic equivalence is preserved. One small improvement would be explicitly noting that Amazon’s tax effect arises from relative earnings in high- vs low-tax jurisdictions being revalued by FX, not just overall income changes. Overall, this is a strong, factually correct response with only minor room for refinement in precision.",

Ground truth shows CL reported $93 million and PG reported $592 million. The LLM also repeats this error for 2023, claiming CL had $737 million and PG $0, while in reality PG reported $737 million and CL reported $96 million. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: the LLM reports a 2024 combined total of $592 million (should be $685 million) and 2023 combined total of $737 million (should be $833 million), leading to a year-over-year decrease of $145 million (should be $148 million). While the $145M decrease is close, it stems from wrong inputs and is still inaccurate.

      "original_answer": "MET's tax-exempt income reduced its tax provision by an unspecified amount in 2023, as noted in the 'Tax effect of: Tax-exempt income' line item which showed a negative adjustment of $(34) million. This indicates that tax-exempt income lowered MET's overall tax liability. In contrast, COF adjusts its Commercial Banking revenue and yields to a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and applicable state taxes to account for investments that generate tax-exempt income, which is a proactive reporting methodology rather than a retrospective adjustment. Thus, while MET reflects tax-exempt income as a reduction in the tax provision, COF adjusts revenue metrics to reflect the equivalent taxable value of those investments.",
      "llm_answer": "The tax‑equivalent reporting approach used by Capital One differs from MetLife’s methodology in that Capital One explicitly presents its Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable‑equivalent basis using a 21 % federal statutory rate (and applicable state rates), with offsetting reductions recorded in the “Other” category, whereas MetLife’s tax‑equivalent disclosures are confined to the income‑tax reconciliation and do not adjust segment revenue in the same way. Consequently, Capital One’s tax‑equivalent presentation directly reduces its reported tax provision by the amount of tax‑exempt income (e.g., $1.9 billion of tax‑exempt revenue in 2023), while MetLife’s tax provision is reconciled from the statutory rate to the reported rate and includes separate adjustments for tax‑exempt income, dividend deductions, and other credits.",

The ground truth states MET had a $(34) million reduction due to tax-exempt income, but the LLM does not mention this figure at all. Instead, it incorrectly attributes a tax-equivalent adjustment to Capital One's tax provision, while the ground truth clarifies COF adjusts revenue and yields, not the tax provision. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: the $1.9 billion figure is unsupported, and the correct $(34) million adjustment for MET is omitted.

However, the conclusion that COF 'directly reduces its reported tax provision' is factually wrong; COF adjusts revenue, not tax provision. MET’s approach is accurately described as part of tax reconciliation.

The reasoning about revenue realization timing on long-term contracts is partially sound in isolation but built on false premises. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts the right comparison and cites the correct qualitative disclosure from GD, but the core financial data is so inaccurate that the conclusion about EMR's revenue realization delay is unsupported. The answer does not correctly imply that EMR has a longer delay than GD because the magnitude of EMR's unbilled receivables buildup is misrepresented. Thus, the multi-hop synthesis fails at the first step due to incorrect data retrieval.",

      "question": "What is the difference in the way Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Procter & Gamble (PG) define and utilize the non-GAAP metric of Organic Sales Growth in their financial reporting and management evaluation processes?",
      "original_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive defines Organic Sales Growth as net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestments, and uses it alongside other financial and non-financial indicators to monitor business health and performance. In contrast, Procter & Gamble defines Organic Sales Growth similarly—excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign exchange—but emphasizes its use specifically in assessing management performance for at-risk compensation. The difference lies in how each company integrates the metric into its broader performance evaluation framework: Colgate uses it as part of a comprehensive set of indicators, while P&G explicitly ties it to executive compensation decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Procter & Gamble (PG) use “organic sales growth” as a non‑GAAP metric to evaluate management performance, but they define and apply it differently.  \n\n- CL describes organic sales growth as net‑sales growth that excludes the effects of foreign‑exchange, acquisitions and divestitures, and it presents this measure in its MD&A (page 28) as a way to monitor underlying sales trends and to assess senior‑management goals.  \n\n- PG defines organic sales growth similarly—sales growth stripped of foreign‑exchange, acquisition and divestiture impacts (page 33) and uses it in its “Core” non‑GAAP earnings calculations, linking the metric directly to at‑risk compensation and to core‑EPS reporting.  \n\nThus, while both companies exclude FX, M&A and divestiture effects, CL presents organic sales growth as a stand‑alone indicator in its MD&A, whereas PG embeds it within a broader set of core‑non‑GAAP adjustments (including restructuring and intangible‑impairment exclusions) that are used to compute core EPS and evaluate executive performance.",

(1) Both companies' definitions of Organic Sales Growth are correctly described: excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions, and divestitures—this matches the original answer exactly. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts, dates) in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense, but all referenced page numbers (28 and 33) are consistent with the source context provided in the LLM answer and do not contradict the ground truth; thus, no factual inaccuracies exist. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that both companies use the same core definition but differ in how they apply the metric—Colgate as a standalone performance monitor, P&G as part of executive compensation and core EPS. This synthesis across two companies and their reporting practices is accurate. (4) The only minor deviation from the ground truth is that the LLM adds detail not in the original—specifically mentioning P&G’s inclusion of restructuring and intangible-impairment exclusions in its 'Core' EPS calculations—which, while likely true, slightly extends beyond the scope of the provided ground truth. However, this does not introduce inaccuracy but adds contextual depth. The core distinction about P&G tying organic growth to at-risk compensation is correctly highlighted, which is the key differentiator in the ground truth.

This figure represents the aggregate transfers out of Level 3 assets across all categories (including private equity investments, real estate funds, and insurance deposit contracts) as detailed in the Level 3 defined benefit plan assets table on page 96. The $115 million transfer out was calculated as the sum of the \"Transfers out of Level 3\" line item ($115 million) for the year ended December 31, 2021, which directly reflects the net decrease due to such transfers. This amount is consistent across the disclosures for both GE and its subsidiaries, as the context pertains to GE's financial reporting. \n\n(Note: The question specifically asked for \"both GD and GE,\" but the provided document pages only contain GE's disclosures; no separate GD data was provided, so the answer is based solely on the available GE information.)",

The correct Disney 2023 cost is $13,959 million per the ground truth. The difference is therefore wrong: LLM claims $1,451 million, but the correct difference is $22,803 million. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states that Disney's costs decreased by 1% from 2023 to 2024, while the ground truth shows a 1% increase (from $13,959M to $14,081M). (2) Number verification: Comcast's $36,762 million is correct. Disney's 2023 cost is wrong in LLM answer ($35,311M vs true $13,959M). 2024 cost is not mentioned in LLM answer, but implied to be lower due to 'decreased by 1%', which contradicts the true $14,081M. Calculations are therefore entirely incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: The model did not correctly identify Disney's costs, conflating them with Comcast's.

Texas Instruments reported accrued expenses and other liabilities of $911 million and operating lease liabilities of $3,320 million, resulting in a ratio of 27.4%. This indicates that Texas Instruments carries a significantly higher proportion of accrued expenses and other liabilities relative to its operating lease obligations compared to Salesforce.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided pages, Salesforce (CRM) reports total operating lease liabilities of $3,162 million and total accrued expenses and other liabilities of $372 million as of January 31, 2024. Texas Instruments (TXN) shows total operating lease liabilities of $3,569 million (with $598 million due in Fiscal 2025) and accrued expenses and other liabilities of $911 million as of January 31, 2024. Thus, relative to their operating lease obligations, Salesforce's accrued expenses ($372M) represent a smaller proportion of its total lease liabilities ($3,162M) compared to Texas Instruments' accrued expenses ($911M) relative to its total lease liabilities ($3,569M), indicating Salesforce has a lower accrued expenses-to-lease-liabilities ratio.",

However, there is a critical discrepancy in Texas Instruments' operating lease liabilities. The ground truth reports $3,320 million, but the LLM states $3,569 million, which is incorrect. This affects the accuracy of the implied ratio comparison. While the LLM does not explicitly calculate the percentage ratios, it qualitatively states that Salesforce has a lower ratio, which is correct. (2) Verification of numbers: Salesforce’s $372M accrued expenses and $3,162M operating lease liabilities are accurate. Texas Instruments’ $911M accrued expenses are correct, but its operating lease liabilities are wrong ($3,569M vs. true value $3,320M). This leads to an inaccurate basis for comparison. The correct ratio for TXN is 27.4% ($911M / $3,320M), but using the LLM’s number would yield ~25.5%, altering the conclusion slightly. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies and compares relative liability structures. It draws the correct qualitative conclusion that Salesforce has a lower proportion, even if the exact numbers for TXN are off. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—it directly addresses the comparative capital intensity question using the right metrics. Due to the significant error in TXN’s lease liability figure, quantitative accuracy is penalized, but the overall reasoning and direction of comparison remain valid, warranting a 7 for correctness.",

In 2021, CAT's weighted-average volatility was 32.9% and GD's was 27.3%, resulting in a difference of 5.6 percentage points.

It incorrectly states CAT's 2021 volatility as 31.7% instead of the correct 32.9%, and misrepresents GD's 2021 volatility in the calculation (refers to 26.7% instead of 27.3%). The 2023 values (CAT: 31.0%, GD: 22.8%) are correct. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM claims the 2021 difference was 1.7 percentage points, but then shows a calculation using 32.9% - 26.7% = 6.2%, which is inconsistent and incorrect. The correct 2021 difference is 32.9% - 27.3% = 5.6 percentage points. The 2023 difference is correctly calculated as 8.2 percentage points (31.0% - 22.8%), but the LLM incorrectly interprets this as a narrowing of the gap, when in fact the difference increased. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the question asks how the difference in 2023 compares to the difference in 2021. The correct logic is that the difference increased from 5.6 to 8.2 pp, i.e., by 2.6 pp. The LLM incorrectly concludes the gap narrowed, which is the opposite of the truth.

This reflects a strategy of investing more heavily in content to support growth. In contrast, T's 'Other Cost of Revenues' decreased by approximately $395 million due to an accounting policy change that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs. This change indicates a cost management strategy focused on spreading expenses over a longer period, reducing short-term cost impact.

Instead, it uses the total net cash provided by operating activities for each company, which is not what the question asks. The question specifically seeks the impact *from changes in operating assets and liabilities*, not the total operating cash flow. (2) The numbers cited—$13,426 million for CVS and $6,787 million for MDT—are the total net cash from operating activities, not the portion attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities. The correct combined impact, according to the ground truth, is $19,465 million, meaning the LLM's sum of $20,213 million is factually incorrect in context. Even the arithmetic sum ($13,426 + $6,787 = $20,213) is accurate, but it's applied to the wrong financial line items. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that it identifies both companies and pulls relevant cash flow figures from their filings, but it fails at the critical step of isolating the specific impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities. This indicates a misunderstanding of the financial statement structure—those changes are components *within* operating activities, not the total value. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies and time period and attempts the correct type of aggregation. However, due to using total operating cash flows instead of the specific changes, the quantitative and qualitative accuracy scores are low.

It accurately notes that CRM discusses strategic investment risks in its 'Risk Factors' section and that TXN includes investment gains and losses in 'Other income (expense), net'. However, the LLM mischaracterizes CRM's disclosure by focusing on acquisition-related risks and integration challenges, whereas the ground truth emphasizes CRM's specific disclosure about the risk of 'partial or complete loss of invested capital' and 'significant changes in fair value' of its strategic investment portfolio. This is a key qualitative difference—the original answer highlights financial risk to capital and fair value volatility, while the LLM shifts focus to M&A integration risks, which are related but not equivalent. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors here, hence a score of 10. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts CRM’s qualitative risk disclosure with TXN’s financial statement classification. However, it fails to fully synthesize the correct nature of CRM’s risk disclosure, weakening the comparison.

More critically, the LLM incorrectly assigns the same value ($4,343 million) to both NEE and FPL, which suggests a failure in entity-specific data retrieval. (2) The calculation is flawed: even if the numbers were correct, adding $4,343M (NEE) + $4,343M (FPL) = $8,686M, making the combined total greater than DUK’s $4,578M, which contradicts the conclusion that DUK was higher by $235M. This reveals a fundamental arithmetic and logical inconsistency. The correct difference per the ground truth is $1,603 million, not $235 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key dollar amounts. It states NFLX's total contractual obligations as $42.54 billion and T's as $337.47 billion, which is a complete reversal of the ground truth: NFLX is $42,541,407 (~$42.54 million) and T is $337,473 (~$0.34 million). The LLM incorrectly inflates T's obligations by a factor of over 1,000, leading to a nonsensical comparison. The difference should be $42,203,934 in favor of NFLX, but the LLM implies T has vastly larger obligations. (2) Content obligations for NFLX are correctly cited as ~$21.71 billion in the LLM answer, but this is again off by a factor of 1,000 (should be $21,713,349, or ~$21.71 million). T's long-term debt is stated as $17.74 billion in the LLM answer, but ground truth is $146,064—another massive overstatement. These quantitative inaccuracies invalidate all financial comparisons. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is conceptually sound—identifying content obligations as central to NFLX and debt obligations to T—but the synthesis is based on grossly incorrect data. The conclusion that T has extensive debt commitments is false per the ground truth. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative errors (2/10), partially correct qualitative structure but flawed entity values (4/10), moderate contextual relevance as the framework of comparison is relevant (6/10), and low overall correctness due to inverted and inflated numbers (3/10).",

      "original_answer": "HD uses the straight-line method for depreciating buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment over their estimated useful lives, while MCD also uses the straight-line method but specifies different useful life ranges—buildings up to 40 years, leasehold improvements based on the lesser of asset life or lease terms, and equipment between 3 to 12 years. This difference in depreciation policy specificity allows MCD to adjust asset valuations more dynamically based on economic and technological changes, potentially influencing when asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation occur. HD's approach, by contrast, appears more static, which may limit flexibility in responding to rapid changes in asset utility. These differing methods reflect contrasting long-term asset management strategies: HD emphasizes consistency, while MCD emphasizes adaptability.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in depreciation methods for property and equipment between HD and MCD does not materially affect their long‑term asset management strategies, as both companies use straight‑line depreciation over similar useful‑life ranges and do not rely on distinct depreciation policies that would lead to divergent asset‑management approaches.",

The synthesis between method, useful life, and strategic outcome is missing. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses depreciation methods and asset management, but it draws an incorrect conclusion, undermining its usefulness.

The correct difference should be $2,482.2M – $600M = $1,882.2M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly extract the relevant metric for MCD. It confuses 'rent received' with 'lease payments made,' which are opposite cash flow directions and unrelated to the question.

XOM's methodology is correctly described in the ground truth as using 'net production quantities available for sale, excluding volumes consumed or flared', but the LLM does not mention this key exclusion, which is central to the comparability issue. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no calculations or figures to verify. Thus, the score of 10 reflects absence of numerical errors rather than verification of correct numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model recognizes that differing divisors affect comparability—but fails to accurately represent the specific differences. It incorrectly frames the discrepancy as COP using sales quantities versus XOM using net production, when in fact both use net production, but XOM further excludes consumed or flared volumes. This mischaracterization breaks the logical chain and leads to an invalid conclusion about the nature of the incompatibility.

This indicates that at least one of the individual company values is incorrect. (2) The LLM claims both CRM and TXN reported $836 million in accrued compensation. However, this is implausible and factually wrong—TXN’s 10-K for 2023 does not report $836 million in accrued compensation; the number likely stems from a misreading of the balance sheet (e.g., confusing 'Accrued compensation' with another line item or misinterpreting units—$836 million vs $836 thousand). Similarly, CRM’s accrued compensation is not $836 million according to ground truth. The calculation itself ($836M + $836M = $1,672M) is mathematically correct, but the inputs are wrong, leading to an incorrect total.

It incorrectly states that DHR's discount rate 'fell from 1.1% in 2020 to 1.4% in 2021', which is factually wrong—the rate increased from 1.1% to 1.4%, but the phrasing 'fell' is incorrect and misleading. More critically, the LLM fails to report DHR's actual change in projected benefit obligation (PBO), which decreased from $1,366 million to $1,125 million—a $241 million reduction. Instead, the LLM does not mention any dollar amounts or PBO changes at all, which is a core part of the question. (2) The TMO discount rate values (0.95% in 2020, 1.45% in 2021) and the 0.5-percentage-point increase are correct. However, the DHR discount rate values are inaccurately cited (1.1% and 1.4%) and do not match the ground truth (which does not report DHR's discount rates at all—only the PBO values). The ground truth uses DHR's PBO change to illustrate sensitivity, not its discount rate. Thus, the LLM fabricates DHR discount rate data not present in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in concept—linking discount rate changes to pension liability sensitivity—but flawed because it synthesizes incorrect or non-existent data for DHR. The model incorrectly assumes DHR used discount rates of 1.1% and 1.4%, when the ground truth does not provide DHR's discount rates at all. The correct reasoning should use TMO's rate change and DHR's PBO change as separate data points to illustrate the broader principle. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the sensitivity of pension liabilities to interest rate assumptions, which is the conceptual goal. However, due to major quantitative inaccuracies and fabrication of DHR discount rate data, the correctness score is low.

      "original_answer": "The combined depreciation and amortization expense for McDonald's and Tesla in 2023 is $2,504 million. McDonald's depreciation and amortization expense was $382 million, which is 1.5% of its total revenues ($25,494 million). Tesla reported a deferred tax liability related to depreciation and amortization of $2,122 million, which reflects a larger capital-intensive operational model compared to McDonald's.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined depreciation and amortization expense for McDonald's (MCD) and Tesla (TSLA) in 2023 was $382 million for MCD and $2,122 million for TSLA, for a total of $2,504 million. As a percentage of total revenue, MCD’s expense represented roughly 1.5% ($382 M ÷ $25,494 M), while TSLA’s expense represented about 8.4% ($2,122 M ÷ $25,178 M).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly reports all key financial figures: McDonald's depreciation and amortization expense of $382 million, Tesla's $2,122 million, and the combined total of $2,504 million. It accurately calculates McDonald's expense as 1.5% of revenue ($382M / $25,494M). For Tesla, it computes 8.4% ($2,122M / $25,178M), which is factually correct based on the implied revenue figure, though the original answer does not explicitly state Tesla's total revenue. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth or are derived accurately. The sum $382M + $2,122M = $2,504M is correct. The percentage calculations are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data across two companies, computes percentages relative to their respective revenues, and implicitly uses correct revenue figures. However, the original answer does not mention Tesla’s total revenue or the 8.4% figure, instead focusing on the deferred tax liability context. While the LLM’s addition of this percentage is reasonable and correct, it goes slightly beyond the ground truth’s scope. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addresses all parts of the question, and maintains semantic equivalence. The only minor deviation is the inclusion of Tesla’s percentage of revenue, which, while accurate, was not emphasized in the original answer. This does not reduce correctness but reflects a slight difference in focus. Overall, the answer is factually excellent with complete and accurate quantitative analysis.",

Emerson's unbilled receivables increased from $1,453 million to $1,599 million in 2023, increasing its net contract asset position by $146 million.

It falsely claims that both Boeing and Emerson experienced a $317 million decrease in net contract assets, while the ground truth shows Boeing decreased by $317 million and Emerson *increased* by $146 million. The LLM incorrectly applies Boeing's numbers to Emerson, even using identical calculations ($8,634 → $8,317) for Emerson, which is factually wrong. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: Emerson’s actual unbilled receivables increased from $1,453M to $1,599M (a $146M increase), not a $317M decrease. The LLM also introduces arbitrary subtractions of $19 million with no basis in the ground truth. The final difference in changes is incorrectly stated as 'identical' when it should be $463 million (sum of Boeing's $317 reduction and Emerson's $146 increase). (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly identify or synthesize the separate financial movements for the two companies. Instead, it duplicated Boeing’s data for Emerson, showing a failure in entity-specific information retrieval and comparison.

      "original_answer": "COP reports increased costs in low-carbon and other new technologies, contributing to a decrease in earnings within its Technology segment in 2024. However, COP does not disclose a specific dollar amount for its low-carbon investments. In contrast, XOM provides a concrete figure of $0.9 billion invested in its Low Carbon Solutions business in 2024, specifically targeting carbon capture and storage, lithium, and carbon-free hydrogen projects. This contrast indicates that while both companies are investing in low-carbon technologies, XOM is making a more quantifiably directed financial commitment to these initiatives, whereas COP's investment appears to be ongoing but less specifically itemized, suggesting a potentially broader or less mature allocation of resources toward low-carbon solutions.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 10‑K filings reveal contrasting capital‑allocation priorities. ConocoPhillips emphasizes cash‑flow generation and shareholder returns, using $12.1 bn of capital expenditures primarily for upstream production growth and modest low‑carbon investments ($0.9 bn), while ExxonMobil reports a much larger, diversified capex program of $27.6 bn that allocates $4.9 bn to product‑solution businesses and $0.9 bn to low‑carbon projects, underscoring a broader strategic focus on both traditional hydrocarbon expansion and early‑stage low‑carbon technologies.",

It incorrectly states that ConocoPhillips (COP) invested $0.9 billion in low-carbon investments, which directly contradicts the ground truth stating that COP does not disclose a specific dollar amount for such investments. It also falsely attributes $4.9 billion in spending on product-solution businesses to ExxonMobil (XOM) in 2024, which is not supported by the ground truth. The only correct quantitative detail is XOM’s $0.9 billion investment in Low Carbon Solutions, matching the original answer. (2) The capital expenditure figures of $12.1 billion for COP and $27.6 billion for XOM are not mentioned in the ground truth and are therefore unverified and likely incorrect. The LLM appears to have fabricated or misattributed these numbers. Calculations or comparisons based on these figures (e.g., relative allocation) are thus invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. While the question asks for a comparison based on 2024 10-K disclosures, the LLM invents specific capex allocations not present in the ground truth. It misrepresents COP’s strategy by assigning a precise low-carbon investment figure when none exists in the source data, undermining the core contrast: XOM provides specific disclosures while COP does not. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the answer attempts to address strategic priorities and contrasts between the two firms, giving it moderate contextual relevance.

This reflects CRM’s more aggressive stock‑based compensation strategy, as evidenced by a larger stock‑compensation expense ($362 million vs. $289 million) and a smaller share‑repurchase outlay, whereas TXN’s modest increase aligns with its comparatively restrained approach to employee‑related liability management.",

Similarly, TXN's accrued compensation increased by $7 million (from $22 million in 2022 to $29 million in 2023), but the LLM incorrectly states a $29 million increase from $799 million to $828 million—both base values and changes are wrong. (2) The calculations are based on completely inaccurate figures: CRM’s actual change is -$100M (not +$67M), and TXN’s is +$7M (not +$29M). The LLM also uses inconsistent fiscal years—ground truth compares CRM’s 2023 to 2024 and TXN’s 2022 to 2023, but the LLM does not specify correct fiscal periods. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails entirely: the model does not correctly identify the direction or magnitude of changes, nor does it reflect the actual contrasting strategies—CRM reducing liabilities vs. TXN increasing them.

      "original_answer": "Fluctuations in currency exchange rates directly impact Costco's international profitability by influencing comparable sales figures, which in turn affect its ability to leverage SG&A expenses. Costco notes that currency exchange rate changes are beyond its control and can significantly affect sales comparisons. Similarly, Philip Morris (PM) faces currency-related risks in Russia and Ukraine, where it derived 6% of its total net revenues from Russia and 1% from Ukraine in 2024. PM highlights that geopolitical instability from the war in Ukraine and sanctions could increase exposure to currency fluctuations, which may raise operational costs and reduce demand for its products. Both companies are exposed to currency volatility, but PM also faces additional geopolitical and regulatory risks in Russia that could lead to asset impairments and deconsolidation, compounding the financial impact beyond typical FX exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can erode the profitability of Costco’s international operations by reducing the U.S.‑dollar value of foreign‑currency sales and increasing the cost of imported goods, while also exposing the company to risks of devaluation and capital controls that limit the ability to repatriate cash. In contrast, Philip Morris faces currency‑related risks in Russia and Ukraine that are tied to punitive tax proposals, possible loss of access to local cash flows, and potential impairments of assets due to the war, making its currency exposure more geopolitically driven and potentially more severe for its specific markets.",

However, the LLM answer omits key quantitative details present in the ground truth: specifically, that Philip Morris derived 6% of its total net revenues from Russia and 1% from Ukraine in 2024. This omission affects quantitative accuracy. (2) No explicit calculations are made, but the absence of these specific percentages—critical for assessing the scale of PM's exposure—is a factual gap. The LLM mentions 'possible loss of access to local cash flows' and 'impairments' which aligns with the ground truth, but without the revenue breakdown, precision is reduced. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that currency impacts affect both firms, but PM’s risks are compounded by geopolitical instability and regulatory threats in conflict-affected regions. It correctly infers that PM’s exposure goes beyond typical FX risk to include asset impairments and deconsolidation, which is consistent with the original answer. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the response directly addresses both parts of the question and draws a meaningful comparison.

      "original_answer": "Citigroup Inc., as a holding company, relies on interest, dividends, and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends and satisfy debt obligations. However, several of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory, or contractual restrictions that limit their ability to provide such payments. These restrictions include local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements tied to Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Similarly, Wells Fargo’s subsidiary banks are restricted under federal law from transferring funds or assets to the Parent or its nonbank subsidiaries in excess of 10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for any single affiliate and 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates. These limitations, combined with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length transaction terms, constrain the ability of both Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo to reallocate capital internally, thereby reducing flexibility in managing liquidity and capital during periods of financial stress or regulatory scrutiny.",
      "llm_answer": "The SEC filings illustrate that both Citigroup and Wells Fargo operate under binding regulatory constraints that limit how they can use and move funds within their corporate structures. Citigroup’s subsidiaries are subject to capital‑adequacy and liquidity rules that restrict dividend and other payments to the parent, while Wells Fargo’s holding‑company framework imposes “covered‑transaction” limits (generally 10 % of a subsidiary’s capital for any single affiliate and 20 % in the aggregate) and requires FRB approval for many capital‑distribution activities.

No incorrect numbers or calculations are present. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that Citigroup’s subsidiaries face capital adequacy and liquidity restrictions affecting payments to the parent, and that Wells Fargo is bound by federal 'covered-transaction' rules under the Bank Holding Company Act, which is consistent with the ground truth.

(4) Minor qualitative omission: the LLM does not mention Citigroup’s inter-affiliate arrangements tied to its resolution plan or specific stress test requirements, nor does it reference the need for secured collateral and arm’s-length terms emphasized in the original answer.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar's customer advances increased from $1,860 million in 2022 to $1,929 million in 2023, reflecting a $69 million growth. This increase indicates a shift in the timing and volume of advance payments received from customers. In contrast, General Dynamics explicitly describes the role of customer advances in shaping revenue recognition timing, particularly in their defense and aerospace segments. In defense, customer advances are less common, and billing typically follows revenue recognition, creating contract assets. However, international contracts sometimes result in customer advances before revenue is recognized, creating contract liabilities. In aerospace, General Dynamics often receives deposits upon contract execution and milestone achievements, which are later liquidated as revenue. Therefore, while Caterpillar's customer advances grew modestly, General Dynamics highlights a more structured and segment-specific impact of these advances on financial reporting timing.",
      "llm_answer": "The change in Caterpillar's customer advances from 2022 to 2023 was a $69 million increase (from $1,860M to $1,929M), which is relatively minor compared to General Dynamics' defense and aerospace revenue recognition timing. While GD's revenue recognition is heavily influenced by defense contracts (e.g., $303M from DoD in Aerospace and $12,325M in Marine Systems), Caterpillar's customer advances represent only a small fraction of its overall revenue recognition process, with no material impact on its financial statements beyond standard contract asset/liability adjustments.

However, it introduces unsupported figures for General Dynamics—specifically '$303M from DoD in Aerospace' and '$12,325M in Marine Systems'—which are not present in the original answer and are irrelevant to the question about customer advances and revenue recognition timing. These numbers distort the response and lack verification from the provided ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the Caterpillar figures are correct with acceptable formatting ($1,860M = $1,860 million). The $69M difference is accurate. But the inclusion of extraneous GD revenue figures undermines quantitative accuracy, even if those numbers were true (which cannot be verified here), because they were not part of the original comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to contrast Caterpillar’s minor change in advances with GD’s more structured use of advances in revenue recognition. However, it misrepresents GD’s disclosures by focusing on segment revenues instead of the actual mechanism of customer advances and their impact on contract assets/liabilities. The original answer emphasizes that in defense, advances are rare and billing follows recognition (creating assets), while international contracts may create liabilities; in aerospace, deposits are received early and recognized over time. The LLM fails to convey this nuanced, segment-specific treatment, instead asserting that GD's recognition is 'heavily influenced' without explaining how advances specifically affect timing. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses the core idea of comparing Caterpillar’s numerical change to GD’s qualitative significance in revenue timing—but veers off by introducing unrelated revenue data. The conclusion that Caterpillar’s change is 'not material' may be reasonable, but the lack of support from the original context and the erroneous GD figures reduce overall correctness.

      "llm_answer": "Disney's 26% increase in advertising revenue from impressions—driven by Disney+ ad-supported service launches and increased cricket programming—is not directly comparable to Alphabet's impression-based monetization performance, as Alphabet's 2023 10-K does not disclose specific impression-driven advertising growth metrics or revenue breakdowns tied to impressions. Instead, Alphabet reports overall advertising revenue growth of 9% year-over-year (from $237.9B to $272.5B in Google Services), with YouTube ad revenue increasing 8% and Google Network revenue declining 1%, but it does not isolate impression volume or growth as a key driver like Disney does.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly states Disney's 26% increase in advertising revenue from impressions and accurately identifies the drivers—Disney+ ad-supported service launches (domestically in December 2022 and internationally from November 2023) and increased cricket programming, including two ICC tournaments. It correctly notes that Alphabet’s 2023 10-K does not provide specific impression growth metrics, making direct comparison impossible. While the original answer emphasizes the lack of disclosed impression volume growth at Alphabet, the LLM captures this nuance by stating Alphabet does not isolate impression volume or growth as a driver. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM accurately reports Alphabet's overall Google Services ad revenue growth (from $237.9B to $272.5B, ~9% growth), YouTube ad revenue increase of 8%, and Google Network revenue decline of 1%. These figures align with Alphabet’s 2023 10-K disclosures. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes Disney’s impression-driven revenue growth with Alphabet’s lack of granular impression metrics, concluding non-comparability. It bridges two companies, two reporting frameworks, and two levels of disclosure transparency. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that Alphabet’s Google Network revenues are impression- and cost-per-impression-based (a detail in the ground truth), though it implies this by linking them to impression-based monetization. This omission slightly affects qualitative completeness but does not undermine the core correctness. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, well-reasoned, and contextually precise.",

The ground truth states that the total number of nonvested awarded shares for CVS and MDT combined in 2023 is 23,136 thousand shares, but the LLM reports 16,994 thousand shares, which is significantly off. (2) The quantitative discrepancy is substantial—23,136 vs. 16,994 thousand shares—a difference of 6,142 thousand shares. This indicates either incorrect data retrieval or miscalculation. Since the question involves summing two company-specific values from 2023, the error likely stems from retrieving incorrect nonvested share figures for one or both companies. (3) The multi-hop reasoning appears structurally sound—the LLM attempts to combine data for two companies (CVS and MDT) for the correct year (2023) and metric (nonvested awarded shares)—but the underlying data used is incorrect, invalidating the synthesis.

      "original_answer": "COST disclosed that its retirement plan expenses totaled $963 million in 2024, which is predominantly included in SG&A expenses, a category that also captures other operating costs supporting warehouse and e-commerce operations. PG, on the other hand, disclosed that its lease-related expenses include property taxes and other operating costs associated with operating leases that are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.

In contrast, PG’s property‑tax treatment appears in its lease accounting disclosures: the company’s operating lease cost includes “variable lease cost” that captures property taxes and other operating costs, and the lease‑liability schedule shows future lease payments that are net of interest, reflecting how property‑tax obligations are incorporated into the measured lease expense. Thus, COST reports retirement‑plan costs as a distinct component of SG&A, while PG integrates property‑tax‑related lease costs into its overall lease expense and liability calculations.",

(2) Entity accuracy is strong—COST and PG are correctly identified, with proper linkage to retirement plan expenses and lease-related property taxes, respectively. The fiscal year 2024 is correctly used for the primary figure. (3) Reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that COST includes retirement costs predominantly in SG&A, which encompasses other operating costs, and that PG treats property taxes as variable lease costs within operating lease expenses, consistent with lease accounting rules (ASC 842). The synthesis across the two companies’ disclosures reflects the different components of 'other operating costs' as required by the question. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly use the phrase 'other operating costs' in the same comparative framing as the original answer—while it describes the mechanisms accurately, it could more clearly emphasize that these are two distinct *components* of 'other operating costs' in their respective filings.

According to the ground truth, Capital One (COF) spent $7,605 million (not $5.9 billion) and Mastercard (MA) spent $5,904 million (not $6.5 billion) on Purchases of Treasury Stock in 2021. The correct total is $13,509 million ($13.509 billion), not $12.4 billion. These discrepancies are substantial and materially incorrect. (2) The net cash used in financing activities is also misstated: COF’s was $7,030 million (not $6.56 billion), and MA’s was $6,555 million (correctly cited as $6.555 billion in the LLM answer, which is acceptable). However, the LLM incorrectly states that treasury stock purchases exceeded each company’s net cash used in financing, which is only true for COF (108%), not MA (90%). The LLM implies both exceeded, which is false. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize data across the two companies and misrepresents the relationship between treasury purchases and financing cash flows. It incorrectly identifies which company’s spending exceeded its financing outflows. (4) While the answer structure addresses the question’s components (total spending and comparison to financing activities), the severe numerical inaccuracies and incorrect comparative conclusions severely undermine correctness.

      "original_answer": "PG added $3,997 million in long-term debt during fiscal year 2023, while TGT added $0, indicating divergent capital structure strategies. PG appears to be leveraging more debt financing, potentially to fund growth initiatives or acquisitions, as seen in prior years with significant capital expenditures and acquisitions.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no calculation errors, and the comparison between the two companies’ debt additions is correctly framed. (3) The reasoning is largely sound and reflects the multi-hop synthesis required: it contrasts PG’s debt-financed capital returns (dividends, buybacks) with TGT’s conservative, debt-averse strategy. While the ground truth emphasizes PG’s potential use of debt for growth initiatives or acquisitions and TGT’s prior debt reduction and stock repurchases, the LLM flips the emphasis—attributing PG’s borrowing to capital returns and TGT’s inaction to internal cash reliance. This is a valid interpretation supported by typical financial behavior, though slightly different emphasis than the original. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addresses the question about contrasting capital structure strategies and provides meaningful interpretation.

It explains that debt securities are classified as current or long-term based on contractual maturities or the intent to sell within twelve months, and it outlines a structured process for evaluating credit-related impairments and non-credit-related losses. This indicates a more structured and market-sensitive approach to managing investment risk and liquidity. In contrast, MDT references 'current investments' only in the context of its overall liquidity and flexibility, stating that its cash, cash equivalents, current investments, and credit facilities will satisfy its current and future obligations. MDT does not specify the composition or management methodology of its current investments, suggesting a more generalized reliance on liquidity without the same level of detail or risk segmentation as CVS. This difference reflects that CVS adopts a more granular and proactive strategy for managing investment-related liquidity risks, while MDT emphasizes broad financial strength and flexibility without elaborating on specific investment management practices.",

In contrast, MDT’s discussion centers on its $3.5 billion syndicated credit facility and the ability to extend maturities, highlighting a broader reliance on long‑term debt capacity and less granular detail on short‑term restricted cash, reflecting a more expansive view of financial flexibility that integrates both debt and equity‑linked investments.",

(1) Quantitatively, the mention of a $3.5 billion credit facility for both CVS and MDT is plausible and aligns with typical disclosures, but the ground truth does not reference restricted cash or commercial paper programs for CVS, nor does it mention equity-linked investments for MDT—these are fabrications or misattributions. (2) The question asks how CVS and MDT differ in discussing the management and classification of current investments specifically, but the LLM shifts focus to credit facilities, restricted cash, and funding sources not tied to investment classification. The original answer emphasizes CVS's detailed breakdown of debt and equity securities classification and impairment evaluation, which the LLM omits entirely. Instead, it introduces 'captive insurance collateral' and 'commercial-paper program'—details not present in the ground truth. (3) MDT’s actual disclosure, per the ground truth, makes only a general reference to current investments within liquidity, without detailing composition or management; the LLM incorrectly implies MDT discusses debt capacity and equity-linked investments in this context. (4) The reasoning fails the multi-hop requirement: while both companies are discussed, the synthesis misrepresents the nature of their disclosures about investment classification. The LLM conflates liquidity tools (credit facilities) with investment management practices, missing the core distinction—CVS’s granular, risk-segmented approach vs. MDT’s generalized liquidity statement.

The original answer states that BlackRock includes foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses from monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies as part of 'general and administrative expenses' on the income statement, while Goldman Sachs recognizes such gains or losses directly in earnings without specifying a line item. The LLM response, however, incorrectly shifts focus to the distinction between AOCL and AOI for translation adjustments (which relates to *translation*, not *remeasurement*), conflating two different accounting treatments. The key difference in *remeasurement* treatment—where BlackRock explicitly assigns these gains/losses to a specific expense line item—is entirely missed. The LLM claims both firms treat remeasurement gains/losses the same way (recognized in earnings), which contradicts the ground truth that BlackRock embeds them in general and administrative expenses, implying a specific presentation, while Goldman Sachs does not specify a line item. There are no numerical values to verify, so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10 by default. However, the qualitative accuracy is low due to failure in multi-hop reasoning: the model did not correctly identify and contrast the specific income statement treatment between the two firms. Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer discusses foreign currency accounting but misdirects on the key distinction the question asks for—differences in remeasurement (not translation) treatment.",

The LLM does not compute or report these percentages, instead making a vague qualitative statement that amortization is 'slightly lower' than operating earnings—this is misleading because amortization is a component of earnings and should be compared as a percentage, not an absolute comparison.

      "original_answer": "Costco (COST) experiences a direct positive impact on net sales growth from rising gasoline prices due to increased sales volume, although this comes at the expense of a lower gross margin percentage. In contrast, Procter & Gamble (PG) attributes a 4% increase in net sales growth specifically to price changes across its product categories, indicating a strategic reliance on pricing power to drive revenue. This comparison reveals that while both companies are influenced by pricing dynamics, COST's pricing sensitivity is tied to volume and external market forces (like fuel prices), whereas PG actively leverages pricing strategy as a lever to influence sales growth.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of gasoline price changes on Costco’s net sales growth is modest and indirect—gasoline sales contributed only about $400 million of net sales growth in 2024, with lower prices actually reducing sales by roughly $917 million (a 39‑basis‑point drag), while higher prices would have the opposite effect. In contrast, Procter & Gamble attributes roughly 4 % of its net‑sales growth to price changes (e.g., a 4 % price increase offsetting foreign‑exchange headwinds) and explicitly cites pricing as a primary driver of growth across its segments. This reveals that Costco’s business model relies more on membership volume and ancillary services (including gasoline) to drive traffic, where pricing influences mainly cost structure and margin, whereas P&G’s model is built around pricing power as a direct lever for revenue growth. Consequently, pricing plays a far more central and measurable role in P&G’s sales expansion than it does for Costco.",

It incorrectly states ABT's 2024 cost of products sold as $99,337 million, but this number does not align with the ground truth (which implies ABT's 2024 value is $18,706 million, since $100,769M - $82,063M = $18,706M). Furthermore, it misattributes the $99,337 million to 'page 188' for ABT, but the description incorrectly labels it as belonging to the 'Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment'—a CVS segment, not ABT. The LLM also incorrectly reports the CVS Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment cost of products sold in 2022 as $82,063 million, whereas the ground truth value is $82,063 million only if that were part of the sum, but the correct value from the ground truth is actually $82,063 million — wait, no: the ground truth sum is $100,769M from ABT 2024 and CVS PCW 2022, and total CVS 2022 cost is $160,738M, so CVS PCW 2022 must be $82,063M. However, the LLM claims ABT 2024 is $99,337M and adds it to $82,063M to get $181,400M — which is mathematically correct for those inputs but based on wrong inputs. The ground truth sum is $100,769M, so the LLM’s sum is vastly inflated. Then, the LLM incorrectly states that $181,400M exceeds $160,738M — which is true — but draws the wrong conclusion: it says the combined costs exceed CVS’s total, which contradicts the ground truth that the combined value is only 62.6% of CVS’s total. (2) Calculations: The addition of $99,337M + $82,063M = $181,400M is correct, but the inputs are wrong. ABT’s actual cost should be ~$18,706M to reach the correct sum of $100,769M. The LLM uses incorrect source data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: it fails to correctly extract ABT’s 2024 cost of products sold and confuses segment attribution, mislabeling a CVS segment metric as related to ABT. It also misreads or misreports the total CVS cost of products sold, citing the Health Services segment instead of the total across all segments — a critical error.

SPG, on the other hand, capitalizes construction-related costs—including interest and real estate taxes—during the development period until the asset is ready for its intended use. This suggests that SPG is deferring certain construction expenses to the balance sheet, whereas AMT appears to be settling or reducing its accrued liabilities, which may reflect differences in development activity levels or financial strategy in managing construction-phase properties.",

This decrease indicates that AMT is completing or winding down certain development phases, resulting in lower accrued outlays for ongoing projects. In contrast, Simon Property Group’s disclosures focus on capitalizing acquisition‑related costs and development expenditures, but no specific accrued‑construction‑cost figure is provided, implying that SPG treats such costs as part of its broader investment‑property capitalization rather than a separately tracked accrued liability.

This misrepresents the accounting logic. A decrease in accrued construction costs reflects settlement of liabilities or reduced accruals, not capitalization policy per se. Capitalization would affect asset values and expense timing, but not directly explain a drop in accrued costs. (3) Regarding SPG, the LLM claims that 'no specific accrued-construction-cost figure is provided' and that SPG integrates such costs into broader capitalization, which may be true, but the answer fails to correctly contrast SPG’s actual policy (capitalizing interest and real estate taxes during development) as stated in the ground truth. Instead, it shifts focus to 'acquisition-related costs,' which is not mentioned in the original and introduces a misdirection. (4) The multi-hop synthesis is flawed: while both companies’ treatments are discussed, the causal reasoning is reversed or confused. The implication about financial treatments—AMT reducing liabilities vs. SPG deferring expenses via capitalization—is partially valid, but the LLM fails to correctly attribute the reasons. Thus, while contextually relevant and numerically accurate, the answer’s reasoning undermines its correctness, warranting a mid-range score of 5.",

This suggests major errors in either data retrieval or calculation. (2) The individual company values provided—$6,183 million for HD and $3,236 million for MCD—are not consistent with the ground truth, which implies the model failed to retrieve correct base figures from the 2022 filings.

Second, it claims the CVS Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment cost of products sold in 2023 was $82,063 million, which is incorrect—the ground truth is $110,153 million. Third, it calculates a sum of $181,400 million, which is wrong, and then compares it to a total CVS cost of products sold of $160,738 million, which is also incorrect—CVS's total was $110,153 million. (2) All numeric values are incorrect: ABT 2024 cost of products sold is misstated, CVS segment cost is misstated, sum is wrong, and total CVS cost is wrong.

This significant gap reflects their distinct roles and revenue models within the asset management industry. BlackRock operates as a dedicated asset manager with a strong emphasis on ETFs, which are vehicles that attract large-scale inflows driven by client demand for passive and active investment strategies. The $390 billion in ETF net inflows directly contributes to BlackRock’s assets under management (AUM), which in turn drives its investment management revenue as a percentage of AUM. In contrast, Goldman Sachs’ investment management revenue of $10.596 billion encompasses a broader set of services, including private wealth management and institutional asset management, and is not solely dependent on ETF inflows. This highlights Goldman Sachs’ diversified revenue base, which includes investment banking, market making, and other principal transactions, distinguishing it from BlackRock’s more focused asset management model.",
      "llm_answer": "The $390 billion of BlackRock’s 2024 ETF net inflows represents the total capital that investors poured into its exchange‑traded‑fund products, whereas Goldman Sachs reports $10.596 billion of 2024 investment‑management revenue, which is the fee income earned from managing assets across its institutional and retail platforms. This gap underscores that BlackRock’s ETF business is a pure inflow‑driven, fee‑based distribution channel that feeds assets into the broader AUM pool, while Goldman Sachs generates revenue through a diversified mix of investment‑advisory, underwriting, market‑making and credit‑loss provisions, reflecting its role as a full‑service investment bank as well as an asset manager. Consequently, the disparity highlights how BlackRock’s revenue model is tightly linked to the scale and growth of ETF flows, whereas Goldman Sachs’ earnings are shaped by a wider set of banking and asset‑management activities with varying fee structures and margin dynamics.",

This omission prevents a perfect score, though the magnitude of the gap is clearly implied. (2) All numeric values are accurate and properly attributed to the correct companies and years. Format variations (e.g., $390 billion vs $390 billion) are acceptable and do not affect accuracy. The calculation itself is straightforward subtraction: $390B - $10.596B = $379.404B, which the model should have included. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes that BlackRock’s ETF inflows represent asset growth (not revenue), while Goldman Sachs’ figure is actual revenue from a broader investment management business. It accurately contrasts BlackRock’s asset manager model with Goldman’s integrated investment bank model, highlighting fee structures, revenue drivers, and business diversification.

(2) The LLM references a $12.0 billion board-approved authorization for Texas Instruments (TXN) and implies that $10.10 billion is the remaining amount, but according to ground truth, TXN's remaining authorization was $8.24 billion as of its fiscal year end 2022. For NVDA, the disclosed remaining authorization was $11.0 billion. The correct sum is $8.24B (TXN) + $11.0B (NVDA) = $19.24B. The LLM incorrectly reports the combined figure and misattributes the components. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly extract and sum the remaining authorizations from both companies. It appears to conflate total authorization with remaining balance or misreads the documents, and does not accurately reflect the synthesis required across both filings.

      "original_answer": "At INTC, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years effective January 2023, which reduces annual depreciation expense going forward. This change was influenced by factors such as process technology cadence, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and reuse of machinery across process generations. At CRM, costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized over four years — longer than the typical initial contract period — based on factors including estimated life cycles of offerings and customer attrition. This amortization period directly affects marketing and sales expense on the income statement. Both companies use straight-line depreciation/amortization methods, but the differing amortization periods reflect distinct operational factors: CRM focuses on customer lifecycle and renewal expectations, while INTC considers technological longevity and manufacturing transitions.",
      "llm_answer": "The changes in estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment at Intel (INTC) and the amortization periods for capitalized costs at Salesforce (CRM) directly impact their financial statements by affecting depreciation expense and the timing of cost recognition. At Intel, extending the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years (effective January 2023) reduced annual depreciation expense, thereby increasing net income and retained earnings. At Salesforce, capitalized costs related to obtaining revenue contracts are amortized over four years (or two years for renewals), which spreads the expense over a longer period, reducing periodic amortization expense and preserving earnings. These accounting decisions were influenced by factors such as the estimated average period of benefit from the assets, expected contract renewals, industry trends, and management's judgment on asset longevity and business conditions.",

According to the ground truth, NVIDIA's long-term net deferred tax asset was $1.22 billion and Texas Instruments' was $176 million in fiscal year 2022, making NVIDIA's asset $1.044 billion greater. The LLM incorrectly reports NVIDIA's asset as $176 million and Texas Instruments' as $253 million, reversing the correct values and introducing a figure ($253 million) not present in the ground truth. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer ($253M - $176M = $77M difference) is mathematically correct but based on wrong inputs, leading to an erroneous conclusion. The correct difference is $1.22B - $176M = $1.044B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly extract or synthesize the deferred tax figures from the two companies' 10-K filings, assigning incorrect values to both entities. It also incorrectly asserts that the question's premise is wrong when in fact the LLM's data is wrong. (4) Due to major factual and quantitative errors, the correctness score is very low (1).

      "original_answer": "Abbott targets R&D spending at approximately 7% of total sales in 2025, indicating a clear, strategic approach to maintaining competitive innovation across its diversified healthcare portfolio. In contrast, Lilly explicitly states that due to the high risk and uncertainty in pharmaceutical R&D, it cannot reliably estimate the total costs or future revenue potential of its development projects, and project-level cost data are considered insufficiently reliable for external reporting. This implies that Abbott's R&D pipeline is managed with greater predictability and financial transparency, while Lilly's pipeline faces higher financial and developmental unpredictability due to the nature of pharmaceutical research.",

In contrast, Lilly's R&D cost estimation is described as uncertain, with no specific percentage provided in the document. This difference implies that Abbott's R&D pipeline is more predictable and strategically managed, while Lilly's pipeline faces greater uncertainty in cost and timeline due to the high-risk, complex nature of its late-stage clinical programs (e.g., tirzepatide and Alzheimer's disease candidates), which require extensive trials and regulatory navigation.",

While the LLM does not quote Lilly's explicit statement about 'insufficiently reliable' project-level data, it correctly conveys the essence of Lilly's uncertainty. (2) All numeric values (7%) and timeframes (2025) are accurate. No calculations were required, and the percentage is correctly reported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes Abbott’s forward-looking R&D target with Lilly’s qualitative disclosure about estimation uncertainty, then draws a valid inference about the relative predictability of their R&D pipelines. It adds contextual detail (e.g., tirzepatide and Alzheimer’s candidates) that aligns with Lilly’s actual pipeline risks, enhancing the explanation without introducing inaccuracies. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in key aspects—predictability, strategic planning at Abbott, and high uncertainty at Lilly—though slightly less explicit on Lilly’s formal disclosure policy.

      "original_answer": "AMZN capitalized $19.6 billion in video and music content as of December 31, 2024, and amortizes these assets on an accelerated basis based on estimated usage or viewing patterns, or on a straight-line basis. This reflects a strategy of aligning amortization with expected consumer demand and monetization of content, particularly within Amazon Prime memberships. In contrast, TSLA amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to thirty years, indicating a more uniform approach to asset value recognition that does not vary with usage patterns. The differing methodologies suggest that AMZN's asset management strategy is more demand-sensitive and content-specific, while TSLA applies a standardized, time-based depreciation model consistent with broader industrial or infrastructure asset management.",
      "llm_answer": "AMZN capitalizes video and music content as definite‑lived intangible assets, amortizing them on an accelerated basis over a weighted‑average life of about 3.1 years, whereas TSLA treats its intangible assets (e.g., software, digital assets) as finite‑lived or indefinite‑lived intangibles that are amortized over 7‑30 year periods or re‑measured to fair value.

The ground truth states that AMZN capitalized $19.6 billion in video and music content as of December 31, 2024, but the LLM omits this specific dollar amount entirely. Additionally, the LLM claims AMZN uses a 'weighted-average life of about 3.1 years' for amortization, which is not present in the original answer and lacks support from the provided truth. The original answer mentions AMZN uses accelerated amortization based on usage/viewing patterns or straight-line, but does not specify a 3.1-year average life—this is an unsupported addition. For TSLA, the LLM states intangibles are amortized over 7–30 years, which matches the ground truth, but incorrectly introduces 're-measured to fair value' for indefinite-lived assets, which is not mentioned in the original and is not standard for amortization methodology under GAAP (impairment testing is used instead). (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because key numbers like $19.6 billion are missing, and unverified figures (3.1 years) are introduced. The 7–30 year range for TSLA is correct. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the contrast between AMZN’s demand-sensitive, content-driven amortization and TSLA’s standardized, long-term approach is conceptually aligned with the original. The LLM correctly identifies AMZN’s strategy as focused on rapid turnover and TSLA’s as long-term and conservative. However, the synthesis is weakened by incorrect assumptions about amortization periods and valuation methods. (4) Despite factual gaps and errors, the answer remains contextually relevant and captures the strategic contrast implied in the question. The qualitative reasoning about differing asset management strategies is reasonable, though not fully grounded in the provided truth. Thus, correctness is partially compromised by unsupported numbers and minor misrepresentations, warranting a mid-range score.",

It states that TGT had a $128 million increase in pension-related accumulated other comprehensive loss, but the ground truth shows TGT had a $22 million reduction (from $719M to $697M). The combined change is incorrectly reported as $164M and $128M for PM and TGT respectively, when the correct combined change is a net $142M increase (PM: +$164M, TGT: -$22M). (2) Calculations are incorrect: the LLM implies a combined change of $292M ($164M + $128M), but the correct net change is $142M. The ground truth explicitly states the net effect is $142M, which the LLM fails to compute or mention. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires synthesizing changes for two companies and interpreting the accounting implications.

The ground truth indicates that CRM's total is significantly higher than AMD's, with the combined total being $4,020 million. The LLM instead reports a combined total of $4,004 million (close but not exact), and incorrectly claims CRM's amount is smaller than AMD's, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) The calculation of the difference is also wrong: the LLM reports CRM's total as $2,588 million greater than AMD's, but with the numbers reversed, this is mathematically inconsistent. In reality, CRM's payments are $2,572 million greater than AMD's, so while the difference is close, it is applied to incorrect base values. The correct individual totals should be approximately AMD: $724 million and CRM: $3,296 million (based on the known difference and sum), but the LLM swaps these.

This discrepancy arises because the LLM uses $308 million for Duke Energy (DUK), which is incorrect—DUK’s actual cash paid for interest, net of capitalized amount in 2021, should be $321 million ($907M - $586M). NextEra Energy (NEE)'s value of $586 million is correct and matches the ground truth. (2) The calculation of the combined total is therefore inaccurate: $308M + $586M = $894M (as stated), but the correct sum is $321M + $586M = $907M. The comparison stating that the combined total exceeds NEE’s amount by $308 million is based on the incorrect DUK figure and thus also wrong.

(2) The individual company figures are inconsistent with the ground truth. The LLM claims Disney had a net cash inflow of $880 million in 2023 and Verizon had a net receipt of $880 million in 2023, implying a total inflow of $1.76 billion — but this does not align with the correct total of $3.18 billion. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly frames the comparison: it should be the year-over-year change in collateral payments for each company, then summed. There is no indication in the LLM answer of what the actual 2023 figures were beyond 'receipts of $880M', and the 2022 outflows are not properly contrasted to derive the correct delta. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and two years, but the calculation of the difference (change in cash flow impact from 2022 to 2023 for both firms) is incorrect.

This difference suggests that HD may adopt a more standardized approach to depreciation over a fixed range, whereas MCD tailors depreciation timelines based on lease agreements. As a result, MCD may experience more variability in annual depreciation expense depending on lease structures, while HD's approach could lead to more predictable long-term expense patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "The Home Depot’s leasehold improvements are depreciated over 5‑45 years, while McDonald’s amortizes its definite‑lived intangible assets over up to 20 years. Because HD’s leasehold improvements are written off more quickly, its depreciation expense is higher each year, whereas MCD’s longer useful‑life assumption yields a slower, more spread‑out depreciation charge.

This is a critical error in both entity and quantitative accuracy. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly claims that HD's 5–45 year range leads to faster write-off and higher annual depreciation, which is illogical—depreciation over a shorter period would increase expense, but HD’s range includes very long lives (up to 45 years), so it does not inherently imply quicker depreciation than MCD. (2) The numbers cited for HD (5–45 years) are correct, but MCD’s 'up to 20 years' is unsupported by the original answer and factually incorrect in context—MCD does not report a fixed useful life range. The comparison in depreciation speed and expense patterns is therefore based on false premises. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize that MCD’s approach is contract-driven (lease term + options), leading to variable depreciation periods, while HD uses a fixed asset-based range. Instead, it fabricates a comparison based on incorrect useful life assumptions.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies MA's expansion of digital payment options and its effect on increasing transaction volume, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it misattributes the negative impact on COF to factors like brand reputation, integration risks, and interchange fee erosion due to competition, whereas the original answer specifies that reduced consumer borrowing activity—driven by a shift away from credit card use due to digital payment growth—is the core mechanism negatively affecting COF. This is a significant deviation in reasoning and causal logic. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; no errors here. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially correct: the model connects MA's digital expansion to broader impacts on COF, but fails to correctly synthesize the specific causal chain documented in COF’s 10-K—namely, that lower borrowing activity due to payment digitization directly threatens COF’s revenue from credit products. Instead, it introduces unsupported risks (e.g., technology integration) not present in the ground truth. (4) While the answer addresses both parts of the question and mentions relevant entities (MA, COF), the qualitative inaccuracy in the causal mechanism reduces the correctness score. Contextual relevance is moderate because the response stays on topic but introduces extraneous risks. Thus, correctness is partially accurate but misses the key financial linkage described in the original.",

      "original_answer": "The difference in the net deferred tax liability positions between AMD and Salesforce (CRM) as of their respective fiscal years ending 2024 is $4,509 million (AMD net deferred tax asset of $339 million vs. CRM net deferred tax asset of $4,770 million). AMD reports a significant deferred tax liability of $3,614 million related to acquired intangibles, which contributes heavily to its overall net deferred tax liability of $339 million. In contrast, CRM reports $4,770 million in deferred tax assets and other assets, net, which includes intangible assets acquired through business combinations at $4,428 million, supporting its stronger net deferred tax asset position.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial documents, AMD's net deferred tax liability position as of its fiscal year ending January 31, 2025 (reflected in its consolidated balance sheet) shows a net deferred tax asset of $339 million (calculated as $4,509 million in deferred tax assets net of $2,136 million valuation allowance less $4,170 million in deferred tax liabilities), while Salesforce's net deferred tax liability position as of its fiscal year ending January 31, 2025 (reflected in its consolidated balance sheet on page 61) shows a net deferred tax liability of $836 million (calculated as $3,102 million in deferred tax assets net of $2,124 million valuation allowance less $3,938 million in deferred tax liabilities, resulting in a net deferred tax liability of $836 million). The difference arises primarily because Salesforce's deferred tax liabilities from acquired intangibles ($3,614 million) significantly exceed AMD's deferred tax liabilities from acquired intangibles ($3,614 million is listed for Salesforce but AMD's specific intangible-related deferred tax liability is not explicitly detailed in its net position, though AMD's total deferred tax liabilities are $4,170 million versus Salesforce's $3,938 million), and Salesforce's larger valuation allowance ($2,124 million vs. AMD's $2,136 million) and other components like GILTI and right-of-use assets further contribute to the disparity in their net deferred tax positions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains multiple critical factual errors. First, it incorrectly states that AMD has a net deferred tax asset of $339 million — while this number is correct, the LLM mischaracterizes it as an asset when the original answer and context confirm it is a liability position (though the $339M figure is actually a net deferred tax asset for AMD, the LLM's calculation is wrong). More severely, the LLM claims Salesforce has a net deferred tax liability of $836 million, which directly contradicts the ground truth stating Salesforce has a net deferred tax asset of $4,770 million. This is a massive error in both direction and magnitude. The claimed difference is therefore completely incorrect. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports Salesforce’s net deferred tax liability as $836 million instead of the correct $4,770 million net asset. It also fabricates calculations: for AMD, it claims $4,509M DTAs minus $2,136M valuation allowance minus $4,170M DTLs = $339M — but $4,509 - $2,136 - $4,170 = -$1,797M, not $339M. Similarly, for Salesforce, $3,102 - $2,124 - $3,938 = -$2,960M, not $836M liability. These calculations are mathematically incorrect. The LLM also falsely attributes $3,614M deferred tax liability from acquired intangibles to Salesforce, while the ground truth assigns that figure to AMD. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM confuses which company has which tax position and misattributes key financial drivers. It fails to correctly synthesize the role of acquired intangibles — stating Salesforce has $3,614M liability from intangibles when the truth assigns that to AMD. It also fails to note that CRM’s intangibles contribute to deferred tax assets, not liabilities. (4) Scores reflect near-total failure on quantitative accuracy due to wrong numbers and invalid calculations, poor qualitative reasoning due to reversed logic and entity confusion, moderate contextual relevance because it attempts the right concepts (DTAs, DTLs, intangibles), and a low correctness score due to fundamental factual and directional errors that invalidate the conclusion.",

The fiscal periods are not explicitly mentioned (AMD as of December 28, 2024, and Salesforce as of January 31, 2025 in the original), but the LLM provides maturity dates (April 2027 for AMD, October 2029 for Salesforce), which are plausible and consistent with typical credit facility disclosures, though not required by the question. These additions do not detract from accuracy. (2) All numeric values—$3 billion and $5 billion—are correct, and the implied $2 billion difference in available capacity is logically sound, even if not explicitly calculated. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the zero drawdown status with total facility size across two companies to assess relative financial flexibility. It appropriately concludes that Salesforce has greater immediate liquidity and flexibility, aligning with the original answer’s logic. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly different phrasing (e.g., 'opportunistic investments, share buybacks, or dividend increases' vs. 'strategic initiatives, manage financial shocks'). These are valid interpretations and do not distort meaning. The only minor shortcoming is the absence of the exact reporting dates, but since the question asks about 'latest reporting periods' and the LLM confirms full availability, the core factual and comparative integrity is preserved. Hence, a high score with slight deduction in qualitative accuracy for incomplete temporal specificity.",

In contrast, V reports a maximum daily settlement exposure of $137.4 billion for fiscal 2024 and holds $7.7 billion in total collateral as of September 30, 2024, to mitigate this risk.

It incorrectly assigns V's maximum daily settlement exposure of $137.4 billion to MA, and claims MA holds $7.7 billion in collateral as of September 2024—this is actually V's collateral amount and date. Conversely, it states V has $6.2 billion in collateral for 2023, which does not appear in the ground truth and contradicts the correct figure of $7.7 billion as of September 30, 2024. Additionally, the LLM invents an 'average daily exposure of $84.3 billion' for MA, which is not mentioned in the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: all key numbers are either swapped between companies or fabricated. The correct figures are: MA has no disclosed maximum daily exposure but holds $1.9 billion in restricted cash as of December 31, 2023; V reports $137.4 billion maximum daily exposure and $7.7 billion collateral as of September 30, 2024. The LLM reverses the companies in its numerical assignments. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the model fails to correctly associate metrics with the right companies, leading to an inverted conclusion. Instead of recognizing that V has higher exposure and more collateral, it portrays MA as having higher exposure, undermining the entire risk comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the general structure of the question (comparing exposure and collateral to infer risk strategies), but due to incorrect data mapping, the implications drawn are factually wrong. The conclusion that MA has a 'more transparent, quantified risk-mitigation approach' is unsupported and opposite to the truth, where V explicitly discloses exposure while MA does not.

It also accurately states DUK's net cash provided by operating activities as $1,004 million and NEE's as $5,358 million.

The entities (companies, metrics, year) are correctly identified, and the multi-hop synthesis across both companies and financial statements is sound.

This percentage-based comparison is a key part of the original answer and directly addresses the second part of the question about how the combined interest expense compares to each company’s operating cash flow.

This volatility in the aerospace sector, particularly around key models, likely increases risk for companies indirectly exposed through contracts or assets like Emerson’s $310 million backlog intangible asset with a 3-year estimated useful life. If Emerson’s backlog value is sensitive to sector-specific disruptions similar to Boeing’s, the useful life could be shortened due to reduced predictability or cancellations, especially if aerospace demand weakens. Thus, Boeing’s backlog adjustments suggest potential downward pressure on EMR's asset life estimate.",
      "llm_answer": "The change in Boeing’s 2023 backlog value for 737 and 777X aircraft does not directly affect the estimated useful life of Emerson’s backlog intangible asset, because the intangible’s useful life is set by its own contractual terms and is not tied to aerospace sector volatility.

The LLM incorrectly asserts no effect, contradicting the nuanced financial reasoning in the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM does not misstate any numbers (e.g., Boeing’s $20,605 million ASC 606 adjustment and Emerson’s $310M backlog intangible with 3-year life are not contradicted), so numerical accuracy is acceptable by omission. However, it fails to reference or use these figures, missing a key part of the multi-hop logic. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires connecting Boeing’s aircraft backlog changes → aerospace sector volatility → risk transmission to Emerson’s backlog intangible asset → potential revision of useful life.

KO calculates the fair value of RSUs as the closing market price per share on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period, and also expenses this value on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. While both companies use similar methodologies, COST emphasizes the achievement of long-service terms for accelerated vesting and recognizes compensation expense upon such achievement, whereas KO forfeits awards upon termination except under specific circumstances. This means COST may recognize expense earlier for long-serving employees, while KO's expense timing is strictly tied to the vesting schedule.",

It reports MA's 2023 litigation provision as $248 million and V's as $776 million, summing to $1,024 million, which is completely inconsistent with the ground truth values of $539 million (MA) and $108 million (V), totaling $647 million. The calculation of the combined amount is therefore wrong. While the LLM correctly states MA's 2021 provision as $94 million (matching ground truth), the comparison to the combined 2023 amount is based on incorrect totals, leading to a false conclusion of a 'more than ten-fold increase'—in reality, the increase is $553 million ($647M - $94M), or about 5.9 times, not over ten-fold. The entities (MA, V, litigation provision, correct years) and the structure of the response are contextually relevant and address the multi-part question format, showing some qualitative understanding of what was asked. However, the core financial data is factually wrong, indicating a failure in retrieving or synthesizing the correct figures from the source documents.

      "original_answer": "Boeing's delays and increased costs related to the Starliner Crewed Flight Test (CFT), including a $288 increase in reach-forward loss due to parachute supplier issues and a further $523 increase due to schedule delays and testing costs, contributed to production and supply chain disruptions. These disruptions are part of the broader aerospace industry challenges that GE Aerospace explicitly monitors, particularly in relation to its significant business with Boeing. GE Aerospace noted that challenges affecting Boeing, such as production issues, could impact demand, order timing, and payments. In response, GE aligned production expectations with Boeing and assessed potential business impacts, investing in manufacturing and supply chain improvements to mitigate disruptions.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's Starliner delays and cost overruns have heightened GE Aerospace's exposure to supplier risks and potential additional losses on its Commercial Crew contracts, prompting tighter production alignment and risk mitigation strategies. This includes increased monitoring of supplier performance, revised cost estimates for future production lots, and contingency planning for further delays or expenses that could impact GE's segment profit margins and RPO growth in the aerospace segment.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in quantitative details. The ground truth states that Boeing incurred a $288 million increase in reach-forward loss due to parachute supplier issues and a $523 million increase from schedule delays and testing costs—totaling $811 million in additional losses. The LLM answer does not mention these specific figures at all, failing the quantitative accuracy check entirely. There is no reference to the actual dollar amounts or their sources, which are central to the original answer. (2) The LLM incorrectly implies that GE Aerospace has 'Commercial Crew contracts' and faces 'additional losses' on them, which is not supported by the ground truth. GE Aerospace is a supplier to Boeing but is not directly under contract for the Commercial Crew program. This misrepresents the financial exposure and contractual relationship. (3) Qualitatively, the LLM captures the general direction of GE Aerospace’s response—tighter production alignment, risk mitigation, monitoring suppliers, and contingency planning—which aligns with the original answer’s mention of GE adjusting production expectations, assessing business impacts, and investing in supply chain improvements. However, it fabricates specifics like 'revised cost estimates for future production lots' and 'impact on RPO growth' that are not in the original. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and addresses the causal chain from Boeing’s Starliner issues to GE’s strategic response, correctly identifying the supplier risk and production alignment aspects. While the reasoning structure is sound and the multi-hop logic (Boeing issues → supply chain risk → GE’s mitigation) is plausible, the lack of factual grounding in numbers and entities severely undermines correctness. The answer appears reasonable but is not factually accurate, leading to a moderate score based on partial qualitative alignment with the truth.",

      "original_answer": "NVIDIA (NVDA) faced significant risks and potential financial exposure due to product defects, with the potential for high warranty, repair, and replacement costs, as well as reputational damage and loss of market share. In contrast, Texas Instruments (TXN) reported no material accruals or payments related to product warranties or liabilities during the same period, indicating minimal financial impact from warranty claims. This contrast highlights that while NVDA's complex product design and global supply chain exposed it to higher warranty-related financial risk in 2022, TXN's operations and product reliability resulted in negligible warranty costs, leading to a more favorable financial position in this regard.",
      "llm_answer": "The warranty cost experiences of NVDA and TXN in fiscal 2022 illustrate how divergent risk exposures can shape financial outcomes. NVDA’s disclosures highlight heightened warranty and product‑liability risks tied to complex hardware/software, potential defects, and extensive indemnification obligations, which can drive larger accruals and contingent liabilities that directly pressure earnings and increase exposure to costly claims. In contrast, TXN’s filing treats warranty costs as immaterial—citing historically low accrual and payment rates and stating that future claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect—reflecting a more stable cost structure and lower risk exposure that preserves profitability. Consequently, NVDA faces greater earnings volatility and contingent financial risk, while TXN’s financial results are comparatively insulated from such warranty‑related shocks.",

(4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'reputational damage' or 'loss of market share' for NVDA, which are part of the original answer and relevant to risk exposure. However, it captures the core financial risks (accruals, contingent liabilities, earnings pressure) and contrasts them effectively with TXN’s stability.

      "original_answer": "The combined business segment operating income for MMM and UNP in 2024 is $8,373 million. MMM's business segment operating income represents 18.8% of its sales, while UNP's operating income represents approximately 28.0% of its total operating revenues, indicating that UNP generated a higher proportion of income relative to its revenues compared to MMM.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, the combined business segment operating income for MMM and UNP in 2024 is **$16,747 million** (calculated as $932 million for MMM's Consumer segment + $1,578 million for MMM's Transportation and Electronics segment + $14,237 million for UNP's operating income, as derived from the consolidated income figures and segment breakdowns in the 10-K filings). The percentage of sales attributed to MMM's business segment operating income (18.9%) is **lower** than UNP's operating income as a percentage of total operating revenues (28.0%), as MMM's 18.9% is calculated on its total sales ($4,931 million), while UNP's 28.0% is calculated on its total operating revenues ($24,250 million).",

The combined business segment operating income is stated as $16,747 million, which is nearly double the correct value of $8,373 million from the ground truth. This suggests a critical error in either sourcing or summing the individual operating incomes. The LLM attributes $932M and $1,578M to MMM's segments, summing to $2,510M for MMM, but the ground truth implies MMM's total operating income is approximately $1,880M (18.8% of $10,000M in sales, though exact sales figure isn't confirmed). UNP's operating income is cited as $14,237M, which is inconsistent with the implied $5,493M (28% of $24,250M total operating revenues), making both inputs and the final sum incorrect. (2) The percentage for MMM (18.9%) is close to the ground truth (18.8%), which is acceptable within rounding, and UNP's 28.0% matches exactly. However, the sales figures used ($4,931M for MMM) contradict the implied scale of operations and are likely incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing operating income as a percentage of sales/revenues for both companies—but fails in data extraction and aggregation. The model attempts to break down MMM by segments but incorrectly aggregates them and misrepresents UNP's operating income by using a figure that appears to be total revenue or another metric, not operating income. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent of the response align with the question, and the comparative analysis is appropriately framed. However, due to major quantitative inaccuracies in the core financial figures and calculations, the correctness score is low despite some qualitative reasoning being valid.",

      "original_answer": "META is shifting from reporting ARPU to ARPP starting in Q1 2024, indicating a strategic move to better reflect revenue generation across its broader Family of products (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp), where users may engage with multiple platforms. This change aims to provide a more accurate representation of revenue per unique person rather than per user account. In contrast, AT&T experienced an increase in broadband ARPU in 2023 due to the expiration of prior-year promotional pricing, showing a direct financial benefit from pricing adjustments.

However, there is a factual inaccuracy regarding AT&T's strategy: the original answer states that AT&T's increase in broadband ARPU was due to the expiration of prior-year promotional pricing, not active promotional pricing or tiered upgrades as the LLM suggests. This misrepresents the cause of the ARPU increase. The LLM incorrectly implies AT&T is using ongoing promotions to grow ARPU, when in fact the increase came from the lapping of previous discounts. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no figures to verify or compare. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly synthesizes Meta's metric change with AT&T's ARPU trend and draws a strategic contrast.

This is a critical quantitative error that severely undermines the answer's reliability. Additionally, the LLM mischaracterizes KO's disclosures—contrary to the LLM's claim, KO *does* disclose its accounting methodology (held-to-maturity securities at amortized cost using specific identification), but simply does not provide a total dollar amount, which the ground truth correctly notes. The LLM incorrectly implies KO lacks disclosure of distinctions, when in fact it provides methodological detail. (2) The number $1,551 million is factually wrong and appears to be either a misreading of the source or confusion with another line item. There is no indication in the ground truth that COST reported $1,551 million for debt securities at cost basis in 2023. The correct total is $689 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model attempts to compare accounting approaches between COST and KO, but it fails in accurately representing both companies' disclosures.

MA, which depends on these partners to set competitive program features, may face increased pressure to provide larger incentives to merchants to maintain acceptance and co-branding partnerships, as noted in MA's 10-K. This could materially and adversely affect MA’s profitability, especially if larger merchants continue to negotiate lower interchange rates and demand more concessions, as MA acknowledges in its risk factors. Additionally, if interchange fee caps or litigation outcomes reduce interchange revenues, MA’s issuing partners may have less margin to invest in marketing or co-branding initiatives, further limiting MA’s ability to grow its network acceptance and brand strength.",

Similarly, SBUX, as a retailer, is also dependent on consumer discretionary spending, making both companies vulnerable to economic downturns.

The ground truth is $42.915 billion, but the LLM reports $30.8 billion, a difference of over $12 billion. The individual components are also factually wrong. The LLM claims Microsoft has $12,138 million ($12.138 billion) remaining under a $12.0 billion authorization, which is logically impossible (cannot have more remaining than authorized). This indicates a misreading of the data. For Texas Instruments, the LLM states $20.26 billion remaining under authorizations totaling $27 billion ($12B + $15B), but this does not align with the ground truth and appears inflated. (2) The calculations are flawed: even the sum of $12.138B + $20.26B = $32.398B, not $30.8B, so the arithmetic is also incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model misidentifies the remaining repurchase values for both companies. It incorrectly references page numbers (e.g., 'page_17', 'page_15') not present in the actual filings used for the ground truth, suggesting fabricated sources.

      "original_answer": "CMCSA amortizes theatrical film costs over 10 years from the initial release, recognizing costs in the same ratio as associated ultimate revenue, which includes all revenue sources within that period. DIS also uses a 10-year window for theatrical films but includes imputed license fees for content used on owned DTC services in its Ultimate Revenues. This means DIS incorporates internal monetization strategies directly into its amortization calculations, while CMCSA focuses on external revenue correlations, leading to different long-term revenue recognition patterns despite similar amortization periods.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in amortization periods for theatrical films between Comcast (CMCSA) and Disney (DIS) directly impacts their long-term revenue recognition strategies. CMCSA amortizes individual theatrical content costs using an accelerated or straight-line method based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues), with revenue estimates extending up to 10 years from initial release. In contrast, DIS amortizes content costs based on projected usage patterns, generally resulting in accelerated or straight-line amortization over the content's useful life or expected airing frequency, and tests for impairment using discounted cash flows at the group level. This means CMCSA's approach ties amortization more closely to actual revenue performance of each title, while DIS uses a more aggregated, usage-based pattern that may smooth revenue recognition but requires more complex impairment testing at the group level.",

While both companies use a 10-year window (correctly implied in the LLM answer through 'up to 10 years' for CMCSA), the LLM incorrectly suggests that DIS uses 'projected usage patterns' and 'group-level impairment testing' as the basis for amortization—this shifts focus away from the core difference: DIS incorporates internal monetization (e.g., content used on Disney+) directly into revenue models, whereas CMCSA relies on external revenue correlations. The LLM emphasizes 'usage-based' amortization and 'impairment testing' for DIS, which, while present in accounting practices, distracts from the primary distinction in revenue recognition strategy. Quantitatively, no explicit numbers are wrong, but the absence of the imputed fee concept—a key financial mechanism—affects accuracy. The reasoning is logically structured but based on incomplete or misaligned multi-hop synthesis, particularly failing to connect DTC strategy to amortization inputs.

TMO's non-U.S. carryforwards include $419 million that expire between 2025 and 2041, with the remainder having no expiration. This difference in expiration terms implies that TMO has more permanent flexibility with a larger portion of its losses, whereas DHR must strategically utilize the expiring portion before deadlines.

The total combined value is therefore wrong: LLM reports ~$1.25 billion, while the correct total is $1.607 billion. TMO's value is correctly cited at $1.18 billion. (2) The calculation of the combined total is incorrect due to the erroneous DHR figure. The LLM also references 'DHR’s U.S. federal and state NOLs' when the question specifically asks about *non-U.S.* NOLs, indicating a misalignment with the requested metric. Only TMO's expiration details are accurately described ($419 million expiring 2025–2041, remainder indefinite), but DHR's non-U.S. expiration terms (some indefinite, others 2022–2041) are not correctly attributed—instead, the model incorrectly discusses U.S. NOLs.

The LLM incorrectly asserts that both companies have sales-linked variable rent, when the ground truth clearly states LOW does not. This breaks the logical synthesis and leads to an incorrect conclusion about the relative exposure. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses lease structures and sales risk, but the incorrect attribution of LOW’s lease terms and omission of key data make it substantially misleading. The reasoning structure is plausible but built on false premises, warranting low scores for correctness, quantitative, and qualitative accuracy.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of 'Backlog' as an intangible asset by EMR compare with Boeing's (BA) exposure to backlog volatility, and what might this imply about their respective sensitivities to U.S.-China trade tensions?",
      "original_answer": "Boeing (BA) faces significant backlog volatility due to its exposure to the Chinese market, where geopolitical tensions, such as ongoing U.S.-China trade disputes and tariffs, could lead to order cancellations or delivery delays for aircraft like the 777X, 737-7, and 737-10. This creates uncertainty in their contractual backlog, which saw an increase in 2023 largely due to growth in BCA and BDS segments. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) treats backlog as a finite-lived intangible asset valued at $310 million with a useful life of 3 years, indicating a more stable and predictable revenue stream associated with backlog. This suggests that EMR is less directly impacted by geopolitical volatility compared to Boeing, whose backlog is more sensitive to external macroeconomic and political factors such as trade restrictions and customer delivery assumptions in China.",
      "llm_answer": "EMR treats backlog as an intangible asset, recognizing it as part of acquired intangibles (e.g., $310 million with a 3‑year useful life in the AspenTech acquisition), whereas Boeing does not record backlog as an intangible; it merely discloses backlog as a quantitative measure of future revenue. This difference makes Boeing’s earnings more directly exposed to backlog volatility—especially from U.S.–China trade tensions that could curb Chinese orders—while EMR’s intangible‑asset accounting smooths the impact of such fluctuations. Consequently, Boeing faces higher sensitivity to shifts in its backlog driven by trade restrictions, whereas EMR’s exposure is muted by its intangible‑asset treatment.",

(1) Quantitatively, the $310 million value and 3-year useful life for Emerson's backlog as an intangible asset are correctly stated, matching the original answer. There are no calculations required beyond accurate reporting of figures, which are correct. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that EMR treats backlog as a finite-lived intangible asset (specifically in the context of the AspenTech acquisition), while Boeing does not capitalize backlog but discloses it as a forward-looking metric—this distinction is critical and accurately captured. (3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes the implications: Boeing’s backlog is more exposed to U.S.-China trade tensions due to its reliance on Chinese orders and lack of accounting smoothing, whereas EMR’s intangible-asset treatment provides earnings stability. The mention of specific aircraft models (777X, 737 variants) is omitted in the LLM answer, which slightly reduces completeness, but the core logic and comparative insight remain sound. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing the comparison of accounting treatments and their implications for sensitivity to geopolitical risk. Minor deduction from 10 to 9 due to omission of specific segment drivers (BCA/BDS) and aircraft models, which add granularity in the original, but the central argument and factual basis are preserved.",

      "original_answer": "TMO's organic sales growth in 2021 was 15%, while DHR's core sales growth including Cytiva was 25%. The difference is 10 percentage points. This indicates that DHR's growth was more significantly influenced by acquisitions/divestitures (7.5% impact) compared to TMO, where acquisitions/divestitures contributed only 5% to total revenue growth.

According to the ground truth, TMO's organic sales growth in 2021 was 15%, not 23% as stated in the LLM answer. DHR's core sales growth including Cytiva was correctly stated as 25%, but the difference is therefore 10 percentage points, not 2. The LLM incorrectly calculates the gap, leading to flawed interpretation. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: TMO's growth is overstated by 8 percentage points, and the difference is off by 8 points (should be 10, not 2). These errors invalidate the conclusion. Additionally, the LLM refers to TMO's growth as 'core-sales growth' instead of 'organic sales growth,' conflating terms. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly retrieve or synthesize the correct growth figures for TMO and DHR. The conclusion that both companies' growth was primarily organic contradicts the ground truth, which states that DHR's growth was more acquisition-driven (with 7.5% impact from M&A) versus TMO's 5%. The LLM misses this key comparative insight entirely. (4) Scores reflect major factual and calculation errors (correctness: 3/10), very poor quantitative accuracy (2/10), weak reasoning due to incorrect data synthesis (3/10), and moderate relevance since the structure and intent of the response align with the question, even if the content is wrong (6/10).",

      "llm_answer": "Both Duke Energy and Southern Company Gas describe the assessment of regulatory asset recoverability as a critical audit matter rooted in the high degree of subjectivity involved in evaluating future regulatory outcomes. Each company emphasizes that management must judge the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates, including potential disallowances of capital project costs or refunds to customers, based on assumptions about actions by state public service commissions. To address this, auditors performed procedures such as reviewing regulatory orders, assessing precedent treatment of similar costs, testing management’s controls over regulatory asset evaluations, and obtaining representations from management regarding the probability of recovery—procedures that reflect the inherently judgmental nature of these estimates.",

The claimed 'low-30% range' conclusion is incorrect—DHR was at 31%, TMO at 23%, so they are not both in the low-30s. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model confuses the companies (attributing Thermo Fisher’s data to Danaher and vice versa), misrepresents the direction (positive vs negative impact), and draws an incorrect comparative conclusion. It fails to correctly synthesize the impact on organic growth rates or the relative difference (8 percentage points). (4) The contextual relevance is partially maintained as it addresses the right topic (acquisition impact on core sales growth for DHR and TMO in 2021), but the factual inaccuracies render the answer highly misleading. Due to pervasive quantitative and qualitative errors, the correctness score is very low.",

      "original_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive evaluates indefinite-life intangible assets using either a qualitative or quantitative analysis, with discount rates derived from high-quality bond yield curves and cash flow projections based on long-term return expectations. Mondelez, on the other hand, applied a market-based weighted-average cost of capital of 7.1% for Europe and North America and a risk-rated rate of 10.1% for Latin America and AMEA, leading to $26 million in impairment charges for a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. This contrast reveals that while both companies use similar valuation methodologies involving discount rates and cash flow projections, Mondelez's specific exposure to food brands—particularly chocolate and biscuits—resulted in actual impairments, highlighting higher sector-specific risks in the food category within the broader consumer staples industry.",
      "llm_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive evaluates indefinite‑life intangible assets using qualitative or quantitative impairment tests that rely on significant assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, royalty and growth rates, and brand‑specific fair‑value estimates; these estimates are inherently uncertain and can shift with macro‑economic conditions. In contrast, Mondelez’s 2023 impairment charges—$26 million for a chocolate brand and $101 million for biscuit brands—were driven by deteriorating cash‑flow expectations and higher discount rates in its chocolate and biscuit segments, highlighting sector‑specific risks such as volatile consumer demand, pricing pressure, and the sensitivity of consumer‑staples brands to changes in market conditions and cost structures.",

The ground truth states Mondelez recorded $26 million in total impairment charges for a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. However, the LLM claims '$26 million for a chocolate brand and $101 million for biscuit brands', implying a total of $127 million in impairments, which contradicts the original data. This is a major quantitative error. (2) The LLM incorrectly attributes higher discount rates and deteriorating cash flows specifically to chocolate and biscuit segments without specifying the regional application of discount rates (7.1% for Europe/North America, 10.1% for Latin America/AMEA) as detailed in the ground truth. It also fails to mention Mondelez's use of market-based WACC or risk-rated rates by region, which is a core part of the contrast. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies that both companies use cash flow projections and discount rates in intangible asset evaluation and attempts to draw a sector-specific risk comparison, it misses the key insight that Colgate-Palmolive uses high-quality bond yield curves for discount rates and long-term return expectations for cash flows—details essential to the methodological contrast. (4) The reasoning partially captures the broader implication about sector-specific risks in food vs. broader consumer staples, which is contextually relevant and well-framed around consumer demand and pricing pressures.

The ground truth states that Class A shares increased by 3.8 million (3.2M from share-based payments and 0.6M from Class B conversions), but the LLM claims a decrease of 22.6 million shares (from 1,018.6M to 996.0M), which is factually wrong. Similarly, the goodwill increase for Commercial Banking was $36 million (from $4,884M to $4,920M), but the LLM reports a $130M increase to $5,014M in 2019 and adds irrelevant 2021 data. (2) All key numbers are incorrect: share count change is wrong in sign and magnitude; goodwill change uses incorrect values and introduces a non-existent $5,014M figure. The calculation of a 22.6M decrease is mathematically inconsistent with the stated numbers (1,018.6 - 996.0 = 22.6, but this implies a decrease, while truth is an increase). The goodwill difference is miscalculated: $5,014M - $4,884M = $130M, but $5,014M is not the correct 2019 value—truth is $4,920M, so correct delta is $36M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly identify the sources for share changes (share-based payments and Class B conversions) nor link the correct goodwill values for Commercial Banking across years. It introduced data from unrelated years (2021) and misrepresented trends. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer discusses a share count decline and larger goodwill increase, which contradicts the actual scenario of modest share growth and smaller goodwill growth.

      "original_answer": "Intel set a target to reach 95% renewable electricity use globally in 2024 as part of its energy sustainability goals. This target could directly impact its operational costs through investments in renewable electricity and energy conservation. In contrast, Texas Instruments faces potential financial consequences from regulatory changes that could require additional abatement equipment, process changes, or impose fees on energy use in jurisdictions where it operates.

      "llm_answer": "Intel’s 2024 sustainability target is to achieve 95 percent renewable electricity use globally, a goal tied to a portion of executive and employee bonuses. Texas Instruments faces higher regulatory exposure because its energy‑intensive semiconductor manufacturing subjects it to stricter environmental permitting, emissions limits and potential carbon‑pricing costs, which could translate into greater compliance expenses and financial risk than Intel’s more diversified, lower‑impact operations.",

Regarding Texas Instruments, the LLM accurately describes its higher regulatory exposure due to energy-intensive manufacturing, citing potential compliance costs from environmental permitting, emissions limits, and carbon pricing—consistent with the ground truth’s mention of abatement equipment, process changes, and fees. The comparison in financial consequences is logically sound and contextually appropriate. The only minor gap is that the original emphasizes jurisdictional variability and evolving regulation more explicitly, while the LLM generalizes slightly.

      "original_answer": "Pfizer faces financial damages primarily through patent-related legal risks, such as third-party challenges to its intellectual property and potential invalidation of patents, which could lead to early generic competition and loss of product exclusivity, especially for high-value branded products. These risks are compounded by ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions and the potential retroactive impact of decisions like the Brazilian Supreme Court's invalidation of Article 40 of Brazil's Patent Law. UnitedHealth Group, on the other hand, is exposed to damages through regulatory audits and investigations, particularly risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits by CMS, which can result in retrospective payment adjustments, fines, or corrective action plans. These exposures stem from its role as a government contractor managing Medicare and Medicaid plans, where accurate health status coding directly affects capitation payments. Both companies face damages, but through distinct mechanisms: Pfizer through intellectual property disputes affecting revenue from pharmaceutical products, and UnitedHealth through regulatory compliance risks tied to government health programs.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer’s 2022 10‑K highlights legal and regulatory risks that stem primarily from its pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement environment, including government‑mandated price controls, Medicaid/Medicare payment adjustments, and extensive litigation over patents, pricing practices, and compliance with federal health‑care statutes; these expose the company to potential fines, loss of reimbursement, and costly settlements.  \nUnitedHealth Group’s 2022 10‑K emphasizes risks tied to its government‑program contracts and regulatory approvals, such as Medicare Advantage and Medicaid managed‑care funding changes, star‑rating requirements, and the need for continual regulatory clearances for its Optum services, which can trigger payment reductions, contract terminations, or exclusion from federal programs and thus threaten its cash flow and profitability.",

However, it does not fully align with the ground truth in terms of specificity and emphasis on the most critical risk mechanisms. For Pfizer, the original answer highlights patent-related risks—especially third-party challenges and the potential invalidation of patents—as the primary source of financial exposure, with specific reference to the Brazilian Supreme Court decision impacting patent exclusivity. The LLM answer mentions patent litigation but emphasizes pricing and reimbursement issues (e.g., Medicaid/Medicare adjustments, price controls), which, while present in Pfizer’s 10-K, are not the dominant legal risk mechanism described in the ground truth. For UnitedHealth, the LLM correctly identifies regulatory dependency and government program risks but omits the specific mechanism of RADV audits by CMS, which are central to the financial exposure in the original answer. Instead, it refers more broadly to funding changes and star ratings. The absence of RADV audits—a key multi-hop detail linking regulatory compliance to retrospective payment adjustments—represents a significant omission in the synthesis. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is 10), and the entities (companies, years, business segments) are correct. The reasoning is sound but not fully precise in isolating the primary risk transmission mechanisms described in the ground truth.

The original answer states that Capital One reported a 0.00% net credit loss ratio for Retail Banking loans in 2024, which is a valid and reportable figure (indicating no losses), but the LLM incorrectly interprets this as 'no data provided' or absence of a ratio. The LLM falsely claims that Capital One's 10-K does not contain a net credit loss ratio, when the ground truth confirms it is 0.00%. Similarly, the LLM denies the existence of the combined ratio, which can be correctly calculated as (0.70% + 0.00%) / 2 = 0.35%. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM gets Citigroup’s 0.70% correct but fails to acknowledge Capital One’s 0.00% ratio, leading to complete omission of the combined average of 0.35%. The dollar amount ($47.4 billion) is also omitted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to synthesize available data across both institutions, incorrectly asserting data absence rather than interpreting zero as a valid financial value. It also misses the comparative credit risk analysis — that Capital One’s 0.00% indicates a stronger credit profile.

According to the ground truth, NVDA's Work in Process inventory is $692 million, not $1,067 million, and TXN's is $1,067 million, not $245 million. The LLM swapped these values and thus calculated an incorrect combined total of $1,312 million instead of the correct $1,759 million. Additionally, the total inventories cited by the LLM ($13,685M for NVDA and $10,239M for TXN) are grossly inaccurate; the correct values are $2,605 million and $1,910 million respectively. (2) Calculations are therefore also incorrect: the difference between total inventories is $2,605 - $1,910 = $695 million (not $3,446 million), and the excess of combined Work in Process over this difference is $1,759 - $695 = $1,064 million (not $2,134 million). (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is present—LLM attempts to compute combined WIP, find the difference in total inventories, and compare—but due to incorrect data inputs at each step, the synthesis fails.

      "original_answer": "Amgen faces regulatory-driven pricing pressures stemming from Medicaid rebates, 340B statutory rates, and state-level actions by PDABs in seven U.S. states, as well as international measures such as mandatory price controls, price referencing, and cost-effectiveness assessments in the EU and other markets. These pressures directly affect sales and profitability by limiting pricing flexibility and potentially reducing product usage. In contrast, Thermo Fisher Scientific faces inflation-driven pricing pressures due to elevated inflation rates in the U.S. and other key markets, which increase costs and create downward pressure on gross margins. Additionally, economic instability raises the risk of excess and obsolete inventory, directly impacting inventory management and related financial metrics. The differences in source and impact reflect Amgen's exposure to healthcare-specific regulatory frameworks and Thermo Fisher's sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions affecting broader industrial markets.",
      "llm_answer": "The pricing pressures in Amgen's and Thermo Fisher's 2023 10-K filings differ significantly in source and financial impact. Amgen highlights pricing pressures primarily from government reimbursement policies (e.g., Medicare Part D rebates, IRA-mandated price setting, and EU pricing reforms) that directly threaten revenue and profitability, with explicit mentions of \"downward price pressure\" and \"affordability challenges\" affecting product usage. Thermo Fisher, however, frames pricing pressures more broadly within \"economic conditions\" and \"inflationary pressures\" impacting overall business, linking them to potential demand reduction and supply chain costs rather than direct reimbursement mandates, and emphasizes its focus on \"value-based pricing\" and \"affordable therapeutic choices\" as a strategic response. Crucially, Amgen's risks center on **gross margin compression from regulatory pricing changes** (e.g., IRA, EU reforms), while Thermo Fisher's risks relate to **inventory and supply chain pressures from macroeconomic factors** (e.g., inflation, currency volatility) that could increase costs and disrupt supply, though it does not explicitly tie these to gross margin erosion in the same way.

For MCD, the LLM states a '10% increase in consolidated revenue to $25.5 billion', but the ground truth does not provide consolidated revenue or net sales figures for MCD—instead, it reports a 9.0% increase in *global comparable sales*, which is a different metric. The LLM invents financials (e.g., $25.5B revenue, 40% to 46% operating margin, $11.56 EPS) not present in the original answer or supported by the knowledge graph, making these hallucinations. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because while the LOW net sales figure ($86.4B) and decline (11%) are correct, the comparable sales drop (4.7%) is missing, and all MCD numbers are fabricated. There is no evidence in the ground truth that MCD reported $25.5B in revenue or EPS of $11.56. The 9% comparable sales growth is correct but misrepresented as revenue growth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the contrast between LOW’s struggles and MCD’s success is logically framed, and strategic execution is discussed with reference to digital and drive-thru expansion, which aligns with 'Accelerating the Arches'. However, the reasoning is undermined by incorrect data substitution (using revenue and EPS instead of comparable sales and strategic outcomes). The synthesis fails to accurately reflect the source data. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core question about contrasting business outcomes and attempts to link performance to strategy. However, due to significant quantitative errors and hallucinated metrics, the correctness score is limited to 5—partially correct on LOW, mostly incorrect on MCD, with flawed reasoning based on invented data.",

However, the ground truth difference is $4,652.4 million. The LLM's calculated difference implies Simon Property Group's value was $116.8 million ($4,753.3M - $4,636.5M), which contradicts the stated $100.9M loss. This indicates a calculation error or misalignment in values. (2) The ground truth difference is $4,652.4 million, but the LLM reports $4,636.5 million — a discrepancy of $15.9 million, which is material. Additionally, representing a negative value (loss) as a positive $100.9 million without proper contextual framing (i.e., as a negative contribution) may mislead the comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies the correct companies, metric (FFO), and years (2021 for American Tower, 2019 for Simon), and attempts to compute a difference.

However, the LLM incorrectly states that TMO had a -16.5% impact, which is not supported by the original answer. Additionally, the LLM claims both companies had 23.0% core sales growth after adjusting for impacts, but the ground truth states DHR's organic growth was 23.0% and TMO's was 5.0%, a key discrepancy. The mention of 'Cytiva sales being added back' and resulting figures of 25.0% and 27.5% are not present or supported in the original answer and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the -16.5% impact for TMO is incorrect (should be 0%), the resulting organic growth rates are wrong (both listed as 23.0% instead of 23.0% for DHR and 5.0% for TMO), and the final difference in organic growth is stated as ~2.5 points when it should be 18 percentage points (23% vs 5%), not 7.5% as implied in the original answer’s difference due to the 7.5% vs 0% impact. The calculation logic is flawed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize the impact of acquisitions/divestitures on core sales to derive organic growth.

      "original_answer": "Capital One (COF) identifies interchange fees as a key revenue source that is under pressure from regulatory caps, litigation, and merchant negotiations, such as the 2016 agreements where large merchants secured lower interchange rates. These pressures could reduce the interchange fees that acquirers pay to issuers like Capital One, which in turn affects the calculation of the merchant discount rate set by acquirers in MasterCard’s (MA) four-party network. In MA’s model, the merchant discount rate considers the interchange fee, which is paid by acquirers to issuers. If interchange fees are reduced due to regulatory or market forces, acquirers may adjust the merchant discount rate accordingly to maintain profitability, potentially altering the revenue dynamics for both acquirers and issuers within MA’s network.",
      "llm_answer": "The interchange fee dynamics described by Capital One highlight that interchange fees are a key source of revenue for Mastercard’s core network and are collected from acquirers to reimburse issuers, while the merchant discount rate—set by the acquirer—covers its participation costs and includes the interchange fee. This structure ties the merchant discount rate to interchange fees, meaning any reduction in interchange fees (e.g., due to merchant pressure or regulation) directly lowers the fees that acquirers can charge merchants, thereby impacting Mastercard’s core transaction model and overall revenue.",

It correctly identifies that interchange fees are a key revenue component collected from acquirers to reimburse issuers and that the merchant discount rate—set by acquirers—includes the interchange fee. It also accurately notes that reductions in interchange fees due to regulation or merchant pressure can lower the fees acquirers charge merchants, thereby affecting MasterCard’s transaction model and revenue. However, the LLM misattributes the origin of the interchange fee pressure: the original answer specifies that Capital One (COF) describes interchange fees as a revenue source *for issuers like itself*, not for MasterCard. MasterCard does not directly earn interchange fees; it earns network fees. The LLM incorrectly states that interchange fees are 'a key source of revenue for Mastercard’s core network,' which is factually inaccurate—this is a significant conceptual error in the multi-hop reasoning. While the structural relationship between interchange fees and merchant discount rates is correctly explained, the LLM fails to fully reflect the nuance that reduced interchange fees affect issuer revenues (like COF’s) and may lead acquirers to adjust merchant discount rates to maintain margins, which indirectly impacts the ecosystem but not MasterCard’s direct revenue in the same way. There are no numbers, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable and assumed perfect.

It states that Amgen's restructuring liability decreased by $15 million (from $60M to $45M), but the ground truth indicates a $45 million decrease — the LLM incorrectly interprets the ending balance as the reduction amount. Additionally, Thermo Fisher's total restructuring-related charges are reported as $459 million in the LLM answer, whereas the ground truth specifies $583 million, with a breakdown of $160M, $46M, $264M, and $93M (summing to $583M). The LLM's figure is therefore inaccurate. (2) Calculations are flawed: the $15M decrease is wrong — if liability went from $60M to $45M, the decrease would be $15M, but the ground truth states the decrease itself was $45M, implying a drop from $90M to $45M, not $60M to $45M. The LLM likely misread the starting balance. Thermo Fisher's total is also miscalculated or misreported, as $459M does not match the disclosed $583M.

These match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., '30%' vs '30.2%'). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the sum $12,966M + $9,141M = $22,107M is correct; the percentage changes are accurately attributed. The only minor deviation is rounding UPS's decline to 30% instead of 30.2%, which is a negligible loss in precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two companies and two years is correctly synthesized to compute the combined profit and compare year-over-year changes. However, the LLM omits the explicit differential of 94.2 percentage points mentioned in the ground truth, which is part of the comparative analysis requested in the question. This is a minor completeness gap. (4) Despite this omission, the answer conveys nearly all required information with high factual fidelity, correct entities (Caterpillar/CAT, UPS, 2022–2023), and proper financial metrics. The contextual relevance is full, and the reasoning is logically structured. A score of 9 is justified due to the slight incompleteness in the comparative analysis component.",

      "original_answer": "DHR used technology obsolescence rates as part of its fair value estimation for Aldevron's intangible assets, which included developed technology, and applied these assumptions alongside discount rates and EBITDA forecasts to value intangible assets at $3.5 billion. TMO similarly relies on technology obsolescence rates when projecting cash flows for acquired intangible assets, indicating that both companies incorporate this metric to estimate the useful life and value of such assets. However, DHR explicitly mentions technology obsolescence rates as a key assumption evaluated by valuation specialists during the audit, suggesting a more quantitatively rigorous approach in that instance, whereas TMO references the metric in a broader context of cash flow projections without specifying exact rates. This implies differing levels of emphasis on the metric despite both companies using it in principle.",
      "llm_answer": "Both DHR and TMO assess technology obsolescence when valuing acquired intangible assets, but they apply markedly different obsolescence‑rate assumptions. DHR’s valuation of Aldevron’s intangibles (see Note 2 in the filing) uses a relatively aggressive obsolescence rate that shortens the estimated useful life of the technology, whereas TMO’s acquisition accounting (discussed in its MD&A) applies a more conservative obsolescence assumption, resulting in a longer useful‑life estimate. Consequently, DHR tends to amortize its acquired technology intangibles faster than TMO, reflecting a more aggressive approach to estimating useful lives, while TMO adopts a slower amortization schedule based on milder obsolescence expectations.",

However, the LLM incorrectly claims that DHR used an 'aggressive obsolescence rate' leading to shorter useful lives and faster amortization, while TMO used a 'conservative' assumption with longer lives—this comparison of relative aggressiveness is not supported by the original answer and introduces unsupported qualitative judgments. (2) There are no specific numerical values for obsolescence rates in the ground truth, so asserting 'aggressive' vs 'conservative' rates lacks quantitative basis. The $3.5 billion value is mentioned in the ground truth but omitted in the LLM response, representing a missing key financial figure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while both companies do consider technology obsolescence, the original answer emphasizes that DHR explicitly highlighted the metric in audit documentation, suggesting greater transparency or rigor, whereas TMO mentioned it more generally—this nuance is replaced in the LLM answer with a speculative comparison about amortization speed and useful life assumptions not present in the source. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topic (use of obsolescence rates in intangible asset valuation) and the right companies, but the synthesis is incorrect and introduces unsupported contrasts.

The percentages are also wrong: the LLM claims GE expects 30% recognition in 12 months, but the original answer states GE does not specify a percentage; conversely, RTX expects 30% near-term recognition, but the LLM incorrectly attributes 40% to long-term contracts.

      "original_answer": "CMCSA experienced a 24.1% increase in advertising revenue from 2020 to 2021, indicating strong growth and resilience in its advertising business. In contrast, GOOGL faces significant risks due to its reliance on advertising, which accounts for over 80% of its total revenue, including exposure to ad-blocking technologies, changing advertiser spending patterns, and intense competition. This contrast suggests that while CMCSA is currently benefiting from a favorable advertising environment, GOOGL is more vulnerable to market fluctuations and competitive pressures, highlighting different risk profiles despite both companies operating in the same advertising-dependent sector.",
      "llm_answer": "The 24.1% surge in CMCSA’s advertising revenue (driven by the Tokyo Olympics and higher pricing) contrasts sharply with GOOGL’s warning that its ad‑driven growth could decelerate due to intense competition, shifting device and geographic mixes, and the risk that new technologies or regulations may erode ad effectiveness. This divergence suggests that CMCSA is leveraging event‑specific, high‑visibility inventory to boost ad sales, while GOOGL’s heavy reliance on a broader, more commoditized ad ecosystem exposes it to longer‑term margin pressure and slower growth, positioning CMCSA as a short‑term revenue bright spot and GOOGL as a more vulnerable, innovation‑dependent player in the advertising sector.",

The synthesis across companies and risk profiles is logical and complete. (4) The LLM answer conveys the same core implication as the ground truth—CMCSA is benefiting from favorable conditions while GOOGL is more vulnerable—but frames it with additional nuance (e.g., 'commoditized ad ecosystem', 'margin pressure', 'innovation-dependent'). This reflects semantic equivalence with slightly more detailed reasoning. The only minor deviation is the absence of the specific 'over 80%' figure for GOOGL’s ad revenue dependence, which is mentioned in the ground truth but omitted here.

      "original_answer": "The 20% asset value limit on TRSs restricts both AMT and SPG in how much they can invest in taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are used to conduct non-REIT qualifying activities. For AMT, this limit constrains their ability to expand non-real estate activities and investments in TRSs, particularly those generating income from international operations, which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency controls that further complicate repatriation for REIT distribution requirements. For SPG, the same 20% cap forces them to closely monitor the value of TRS securities to ensure they remain under the threshold, requiring strategic structuring of transactions to maintain REIT compliance and avoid a 100% excise tax on non-arm's-length dealings. Thus, both companies must balance the benefits of using TRSs for operational flexibility against the constraints imposed by the REIT rules tied to TRS ownership.",
      "llm_answer": "The 20 % asset‑value cap on TRS securities forces Simon and its subsidiary REITs to keep non‑qualifying investments—including foreign‑based TRS assets—well below the 25 % overall limit and the 20 % TRS‑specific limit, which drives them to structure overseas holdings carefully to avoid breaching the REIT asset tests and to manage currency‑related repatriation constraints.

The original answer only references a single 20% asset value limit on TRSs, consistent with IRS REIT compliance rules (Code Section 856(l)), and does not mention a 25% threshold. This misstatement undermines quantitative and qualitative accuracy. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly refers to 'Simon and its subsidiary REITs', implying a corporate structure not mentioned in the ground truth; SPG (Simon Property Group) is a REIT itself, not a parent of REITs. (2) The 20% figure is correctly cited, but the erroneous introduction of a 25% limit introduces a false constraint not present in the original, leading to a quantitative accuracy score of 5. No calculations are performed, but the misuse of thresholds distorts the compliance framework. (3) The reasoning partially captures the multi-hop logic: both AMT and SPG must manage TRS asset values to maintain REIT compliance and face challenges in international operations (e.g., repatriation, structuring). However, the LLM fails to mention key details such as the 100% excise tax on non-arm’s-length transactions for SPG or the specific impact on AMT’s non-real estate activities and withholding taxes. These omissions reduce completeness and reasoning quality. (4) Despite inaccuracies, the answer remains contextually relevant, addressing TRS limits, international operations, and compliance trade-offs.

This estimate is derived from Pfizer's statement that it is reasonably possible its liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to $75 million due to settlements or statute of limitations expirations in the next 12 months, and UnitedHealth Group's comparable estimate of a $20 million decrease.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains multiple critical factual errors. First, it incorrectly states that the combined 30+ day delinquency rate for Retail Banking loans at both C and COF is 0.33%, implying a single combined rate, whereas the ground truth specifies separate rates: 0.33% for C and 6.73% for COF. This misrepresents the data and fails to provide a true combined rate (which would require weighted averaging, not stated). Second, the LLM claims this 0.33% rate is lower than COF’s nonperforming loan rate of 1.39%, but the ground truth states COF’s nonperforming loan rate is 0.99%, not 1.39%. Additionally, the correct comparison per the original answer is that COF’s delinquency rate (6.73%) is significantly higher than its nonperforming loan rate (0.99%), the opposite of what the LLM implies. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the delinquency rates are misrepresented, the combined rate is falsely presented, and the nonperforming loan rate is incorrect (1.39% vs 0.99%). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize separate delinquency rates for two companies, misattributes the rate as a joint figure, and draws an incorrect comparison due to wrong numbers. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the general topic (delinquency and nonperforming loan rates), but the factual inaccuracies severely undermine correctness. Thus, the correctness score is low at 2 due to major quantitative and reasoning errors.",

      "original_answer": "NVDA's international supply chain exposes it to risks such as low manufacturing yields, supplier loss, and product defects, which can negatively impact its gross margin. With 84% of its revenue coming from international sales, disruptions in global operations—like supplier prioritization or production delays—could significantly reduce profitability. In contrast, TXN owns much of its manufacturing capacity, allowing it to spread fixed costs over higher output as factory loadings increase. This was evident in 2021 when TXN achieved a gross margin of 67.5%, partly due to the efficiency of its 300mm production. Therefore, while NVDA's reliance on external foundries and international markets increases vulnerability to cost overruns and quality issues, TXN's internalized manufacturing strategy enhances gross margin stability and scalability.",
      "llm_answer": "NVDA's international supply chain risk and product defect exposure contrast with TXN's manufacturing strategy in terms of impact on gross margin by highlighting divergent approaches to supply chain control and margin pressure. NVDA's 84% international revenue exposes it to heightened risks of supply disruptions, currency volatility, and geopolitical instability—factors that directly threaten its gross margins through potential cost increases, excess inventory, and reduced pricing power, as evidenced by its reliance on third-party foundries and non-cancellable inventory orders placed 12+ months in advance. In contrast, TXN's vertically integrated manufacturing strategy, anchored by its 300mm production efficiency and 67.5% gross margin, leverages fixed-cost manufacturing scale to absorb economic fluctuations and secure supply chain stability, directly enabling its higher and more resilient gross margin profile.",

All numeric values—84% and 67.5%—are accurate and match the ground truth. No calculations are required, so quantitative accuracy is perfect. (2) The answer addresses all parts of the multi-hop question: it contrasts NVDA’s supply chain and defect risks with TXN’s manufacturing strategy and links both to gross margin impact. It correctly identifies that NVDA’s reliance on external foundries increases vulnerability, while TXN’s vertical integration supports margin stability. (3) The reasoning is sound and synthesizes information across entities (NVDA vs. TXN) and dimensions (revenue geography, manufacturing model, cost structure). The LLM adds context not in the original—such as currency volatility, geopolitical risk, and non-cancellable orders—which are reasonable inferences and enhance the explanation without contradicting facts. (4) Semantic equivalence is high: while the LLM uses different phrasing (e.g., 'vertically integrated' vs. 'owns much of its manufacturing capacity'), the meaning aligns with the ground truth. The only minor gap is that the original emphasizes 'spreading fixed costs over higher output' as a mechanism for margin improvement, which the LLM captures implicitly but less explicitly.

It claims Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit was $1,188 million and that it was $516 million higher than UPS's $672 million decline, which is factually wrong. According to the ground truth, Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit *increased* by $4,618 million (from $9,128M to $13,746M), not $1,188M. The comparison should be that Caterpillar’s *increase* of $4,618M was $4,618M higher than UPS’s $672M *decrease* (i.e., the net difference in direction and magnitude). Instead, the model incorrectly computes $1,188M – $672M, a calculation based on fabricated numbers. (2) The margin change is also completely wrong: the LLM states Caterpillar had a 230-basis-point *decrease*, which contradicts the truth—Caterpillar’s margin *increased* by 510 basis points (from 15.4% to 20.5%). UPS’s margin decreased by 230 basis points, which the LLM correctly notes, but falsely claims Caterpillar had the same decrease. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed entirely: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize data for either company’s profit or margin changes. It invented numbers (e.g., $1,188M) not present in the original answer and performed incorrect arithmetic. (4) Scores are low because of pervasive factual and computational errors.

This is a significant deviation. Additionally, the LLM inflates MSFT's customer-related intangibles by over 4x compared to the ground truth. ACN's net customer-related intangibles are correctly stated as $2,587,660 million. However, the LLM misrepresents MSFT's overall customer-related intangible value, undermining the core comparison. (2) The LLM correctly cites MSFT's $21,969 million fair value of intangible assets from the Activision Blizzard acquisition, aligning with the ground truth. However, it introduces additional details not in the original answer (e.g., Nuance Communications acquisition, $18.8 billion, $4,365 million intangibles), which, while factually plausible, are not part of the verified knowledge graph and distract from the focused comparison. The ACN acquisition totals ($6.46B in FY24, $2.48B in FY23) are not in the ground truth and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to correctly compare ACN’s and MSFT’s customer-related intangible values, which is the central question.

The reasoning is thus invalid. (4) Despite incorrect numbers and reasoning, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, time frame (August 2024), and types of assets. It attempts a detailed comparison and includes acquisition context, which is appropriate. However, the quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine correctness.

The LLM incorrectly reports this increase as $410 million. Similarly, Comcast's payments decreased from $965 million to $963 million, a $2 million decrease; the LLM reports only a $1 million decrease. These errors propagate into the comparative and net change calculations. The LLM states the increase was $411 million greater than the decrease (should be $451M - (-$2M) = $453 million difference in magnitude, but the question asks 'how much greater was the increase compared to the decrease', which is $451M - (-$2M) = $453M; however, the intended interpretation in the ground truth appears to be $451M - $2M = $449M net change). The LLM calculates a net change of $409 million, but the correct net change is $449 million. (2) All calculations are therefore incorrect due to wrong base numbers. Even allowing for interpretation flexibility, the numbers are too far from correct to be considered accurate.

This leads to an incorrect combined total of $6.0 billion instead of the correct $7.25 billion. The Accenture figure ($4.5 billion) is accurate. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: $4.5B + $1.5B = $6.0B is mathematically correct but based on incorrect input data. The correct sum is $4.5B + $2.75B = $7.25B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning partially succeeds—Accenture and Microsoft are correctly identified, and the intent to compare capital allocation strategies is addressed—but the synthesis fails due to the incorrect Microsoft figure. The characterization of Microsoft’s strategy as 'dividend-linked' is not supported in the ground truth, which notes timing (first fiscal quarter) but not linkage to dividends. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the answer attempts both quantitative and qualitative analysis and uses appropriate financial terminology. However, the significant numerical error undermines factual correctness, warranting a low quantitative accuracy score. The qualitative reasoning is plausible but based on incorrect data, limiting its validity.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AXP reported a Net Interest Yield on average Card Member loans of 9.2%, while BAC reported a Net Interest Yield of 2.73%. This significant difference reflects AXP's focus on high-yield proprietary card loans, with an average loan value of $15.0 billion, compared to BAC's broader asset base of $535.5 billion in average earning assets. AXP's strategy centers on maximizing yield from a more concentrated loan portfolio, whereas BAC's lower yield aligns with its larger, more diversified earning asset base, which includes a wide range of loans and investments.",
      "llm_answer": "The Net Interest Yield for AXP (9.2% in 2023) significantly exceeds BAC's (2.17% in 2023), reflecting AXP's distinct business model focused on high-margin credit products like proprietary cards and lending, where interest income is a larger component of revenue. In contrast, BAC's lower yield stems from its broader banking operations with a heavier emphasis on deposit-taking and lower-yielding assets, resulting in a more stable but less profitable net interest margin relative to its overall revenue structure.",

However, it reports BAC's Net Interest Yield as 2.17%, which is incorrect—the ground truth value is 2.73%. This is a significant quantitative error, especially in a comparison-focused question. (2) The dollar amounts for average Card Member loans ($15.0 billion for AXP) and average earning assets ($535.5 billion for BAC) are missing from the LLM answer, which weakens the multi-hop synthesis and omits key contextual data that explains the yield difference. These numbers are central to the original answer's reasoning about asset utilization strategies. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly attributes AXP's higher yield to its focus on high-margin proprietary credit products and contrasts this with BAC's broader, lower-yielding asset base. This reflects an understanding of business model differences. However, it fails to explicitly connect BAC's lower yield to its much larger and diversified earning asset base, which is a core element of the ground truth explanation. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the strategic implications of yield differences. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct conceptual framing but incomplete entity and metric coverage. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the incorrect BAC yield figure and omission of key financial figures. Correctness score is 6 because the core directional insight (AXP has higher yield due to focused model vs BAC’s diversified model) is valid, but critical data points are wrong or missing, undermining full accuracy.",

(3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes that both companies treated the expenses as non-segment items, with CMCSA excluding from Adjusted EBITDA and segment results, and GOOGL including in corporate costs, unallocated. It accurately contrasts the treatment without misrepresenting either company’s approach. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses both parts of the question—total expenses and their treatment in segment reporting.

The ground truth states the total funded status deficit is $771 million, but the LLM reports $584 million, which is off by $187 million. Additionally, the ground truth states that this deficit represents 59.7% of the total fair value of plan assets, implying the assets were approximately $1.292 billion ($771M / 0.597). In contrast, the LLM claims the deficit exceeds the total fair value of plan assets by $228 million, which would imply plan assets were only $356 million ($584M - $228M), a significant deviation. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: both the deficit amount and the relationship to plan assets are wrong. The LLM’s calculation logic is also flawed—claiming a deficit 'exceeds' plan assets implies a negative funding ratio over 100%, which contradicts the ground truth that the deficit is 59.7% of assets (i.e., assets are greater than the deficit). (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have summed the deficits from DHR and TMO for Non-U.S. Pension Benefits in 2021 and then compared that total to the sum of their plan assets. The LLM either used incorrect source data or miscalculated the sum or comparison.

Additionally, the LLM reports Microsoft's remaining authorization as $12,138 million ($12.138 billion), which contradicts the ground truth of $10.349 billion. These numerical discrepancies severely undermine the answer's correctness. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: Accenture’s total repurchases are off by over $2 billion, and Microsoft’s remaining balance is overstated by nearly $1.8 billion. The LLM also confuses Accenture’s remaining authorization ($2,694 million) with its total repurchase activity, failing to report the actual total spent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing share repurchase activity and remaining capacity between two companies—but fails in execution due to incorrect data synthesis. The model identifies the correct entities and metric (share repurchases), but does not correctly aggregate Accenture’s full-year purchases or retrieve Microsoft’s correct remaining balance. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topic and comparison, but the incorrect figures lead to a misleading conclusion.

The combined change is therefore a decrease of $20 million ($14M increase - $34M decrease), not a $24 million increase as claimed. The LLM incorrectly states both companies had increases. (2) Percentage calculations are also wrong: EMR’s increase is approximately 9.7% (14/144 ≈ 9.7%), which the LLM approximates reasonably as 10%. However, MMM’s change is a 15% decrease (34/192 ≈ 17.7%, but ground truth states 15%), while the LLM claims a 7% increase, which is directionally and quantitatively incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM did not correctly retrieve or synthesize MMM’s liability change. It incorrectly assumes MMM increased, contradicting the ground truth. The comparison of percentage changes is therefore invalid, as MMM had a large decrease, not a small increase.

      "original_answer": "Disney recorded $0.7 billion in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024 related to content assets, among others, which reduces the carrying value of those assets and signals a decline in expected future cash flows, negatively impacting financial position. In contrast, Netflix monetizes content assets as a group rather than at the individual title level and amortizes them over time, with over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset amortized within four years. This group-level monetization approach allows Netflix to spread the cost of content over time and across its subscriber base, aligning amortization with viewing patterns and supporting a more stable cost of revenue structure.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2024 Disney recorded a $1.5 billion non‑cash impairment charge for Star India and recognized additional impairments on its content assets, reflecting a reduction in the projected cash flows of those assets and resulting in accelerated amortization and lower carrying values.  By contrast, Netflix treats its content as a group of assets that are amortized on a straight‑line or usage‑based basis and only tests the group for impairment when projected cash‑flow trends indicate a decline; Netflix does not record a comparable large‑scale impairment in 2024, instead recognizing amortization expense gradually as the content is consumed.

This misrepresentation of the amount and nature of the impairment undermines factual correctness. (2) The LLM incorrectly attributes the $1.5 billion charge broadly to content assets and links it directly to accelerated amortization, which is not supported by the original answer—Disney’s impairment reduces carrying value but does not necessarily imply accelerated amortization. The original answer does not mention accelerated amortization. (3) On qualitative aspects, the contrast with Netflix is reasonably accurate: Netflix does amortize content as a group, uses viewing-based patterns, and avoids large impairment charges by spreading costs. The LLM correctly captures the conceptual difference in monetization and amortization approaches, though it adds 'straight-line or usage-based' without specifying Netflix’s group-level amortization over four years (over 90% within four years), a key detail missing. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the response addresses both companies, the fiscal year, and the core concepts of impairment, amortization, and revenue recognition.

The 2022 combined total in the ground truth is $44,614 million (decrease of $303 million), whereas the LLM reports $51,953 million (decrease of $727 million), which is entirely inaccurate. The individual company figures provided by the LLM ($32,868M for KO and $18,358M for MO in 2023) do not match the ground truth values, which must be lower since their sum is $44,311M. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM's incorrect numbers (e.g., $32,868M + $18,358M = $51,226M; $33,171M + $18,782M = $51,953M; difference of $727M), but these are based on false inputs, so quantitative accuracy fails at the data level. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly attempts to sum values across two companies and compare across years—but it uses incorrect source data, undermining the entire analysis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right question structure: it identifies the correct companies (KO and MO), the correct metric (indefinite-lived intangible assets), and the correct time points (2023 and 2022), and performs the required comparison. However, due to severe factual and numerical errors, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.",

      "question": "How do the specific structures of executive compensation disclosures in Salesforce (CRM) and IBM's 2023 10-K filings reflect differences in their corporate governance approaches, particularly in terms of transparency and risk alignment?",
      "original_answer": "Salesforce (CRM) incorporates executive compensation details by reference to its Proxy Statement, specifically citing sections like 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' 'Committee Reports,' and 'Executive Compensation and Other Matters.' IBM, on the other hand, provides more granular cross-references in its 10-K, listing detailed captions such as '2023 Summary Compensation Table,' '2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table,' '2023 Potential Payments Upon Termination Table,' and 'Compensation Program as It Relates to Risk.' These differences suggest that IBM's approach to corporate governance emphasizes detailed transparency around executive pay structures and risk alignment, while Salesforce maintains a more streamlined disclosure framework, relying on Proxy Statement incorporation without specifying individual compensation tables. This contrast in disclosure depth and categorization reveals differing philosophies: IBM's detailed labeling may cater to investor scrutiny and regulatory expectations, whereas Salesforce's approach implies a more consolidated, possibly higher-level governance perspective.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Salesforce and IBM disclose executive compensation primarily through their proxy statements and 10-K filings, but their governance approaches differ markedly in transparency and risk alignment. Salesforce’s 10-K (pages 93–97) provides a detailed, standalone executive compensation discussion in Item 11, with explicit references to its \"Amended and Restated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan\" and retention agreements for top executives (e.g., Marc Benioff), emphasizing performance-based equity and change-of-control protections. This reflects a governance model focused on aligning executive incentives with long-term shareholder value through structured equity plans. In contrast, IBM’s 10-K (pages 14–18) treats executive compensation as part of broader governance disclosures (Item 11), referencing external proxy statements for detailed compensation tables and risk-related narratives (e.g., \"Compensation Program as It Relates to Risk\"), but lacks standalone detail in its 10-K. IBM’s governance emphasizes board oversight via its Audit Committee and incorporates risk considerations into compensation design, as noted in its proxy materials, whereas Salesforce’s disclosures are more prescriptive about executive award structures and retention mechanisms, indicating a governance approach that explicitly ties compensation to performance metrics and succession planning.",

The qualitative accuracy is low due to significant factual and structural misrepresentations. The original answer states that Salesforce incorporates executive compensation by reference to its Proxy Statement without detailing specific tables in the 10-K, while IBM provides granular cross-references to specific compensation tables (e.g., '2023 Summary Compensation Table', 'Potential Payments Upon Termination', etc.) directly in its 10-K. In contrast, the LLM incorrectly claims that Salesforce’s 10-K has a 'detailed, standalone executive compensation discussion in Item 11 (pages 93–97)', which contradicts the ground truth that Salesforce relies on incorporation by reference. Similarly, the LLM asserts that IBM’s 10-K (pages 14–18) lacks standalone detail and refers externally—this inverts the truth: IBM includes more explicit table references in the 10-K itself, while Salesforce does not. The reasoning is therefore flawed in the core multi-hop comparison: the LLM reverses the disclosure strategies of the two companies. While the answer attempts to discuss governance philosophies around transparency and risk alignment, it does so based on incorrect premises about where and how information is disclosed. Contextual relevance is moderate because the response addresses the general topic of governance, transparency, and risk, but the incorrect attribution of disclosure practices undermines the validity of the conclusion.

      "original_answer": "The difference in Net Interest Yield between AXP (9.2%) and BAC's Consumer Lending segment (3.66%) in 2023 reflects contrasting financial strategies. AXP focuses on high-yield proprietary card lending, as evidenced by its $15.0 billion in average Card Member loans generating a 9.2% yield, indicating a premium credit business model. In contrast, BAC's Consumer Lending segment, with a much lower 3.66% yield on a significantly larger loan base ($304.561 billion average loans in 2023), suggests a broader, more diversified consumer lending approach with lower per-dollar returns but higher volume. This results in a $7.634 billion effective yield difference ($15.0 billion * 9.2% = $1.38 billion for AXP vs. $304.561 billion * 3.66% = $11.15 billion for BAC, with a $9.77 billion absolute difference in interest income from these segments).",

(2) The original answer includes specific average loan balances ($15.0 billion for AXP, $304.561 billion for BAC) and calculates interest income ($1.38B vs $11.15B) and the $9.77B absolute difference. The LLM omits all these figures and calculations entirely, failing to address the quantitative synthesis required by the multi-hop nature of the question. While the percentages (9.2% and 3.66%) are correctly stated, the absence of loan balances and derived interest income values represents a major omission. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially correct—comparing business models based on yield—but fails to synthesize the full picture: the trade-off between high yield on small volume (AXP) vs low yield on massive volume (BAC).

Union Pacific, on the other hand, highlights environmental remediation obligations at existing and future sites—including investigation, remediation, and monitoring costs—as likely to have a material adverse effect on its financial condition if actual costs exceed estimates.

Union Pacific similarly cites environmental liabilities under federal, state and local laws governing air emissions, water discharges, waste handling and hazardous‑material releases, noting that future regulatory changes or remediation obligations could materially affect its financial condition. The key difference is that Boeing’s environmental risk discussion is framed within the aerospace sector’s exposure to climate‑policy impacts on aircraft emissions and customer demand, whereas Union Pacific’s risk focuses on rail‑specific environmental statutes and the costs of maintaining compliance across its extensive rail network.",

(2) However, the specific environmental compliance costs cited are factually wrong. The ground truth states that Boeing's material risk stems from FAA-initiated investigation and quality control compliance costs related to the 737-9 production line—not climate-change regulation, greenhouse gas emissions, or contamination liabilities. Similarly, Union Pacific’s identified risk is specifically about environmental remediation obligations (investigation, remediation, monitoring) at current and future sites where actual costs could exceed estimates—not broadly about air emissions, water discharges, or hazardous-material releases under general environmental laws. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly synthesizes Boeing’s risk within climate policy and customer demand, which misrepresents the regulatory context. Boeing’s issue is production and safety oversight by the FAA, not environmental regulation. Union Pacific does face environmental regulation, but the LLM mischaracterizes the nature of the risk by generalizing across multiple statutes rather than focusing on remediation cost overruns.

      "original_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues for content predominantly monetized individually, while for group-monetized content, these costs are expensed in line with the pattern of usage. This reflects Disney's dual strategy of monetizing content either individually (e.g., theatrical films) or as part of a bundle (e.g., DTC subscriptions). Netflix, on the other hand, includes participations and residuals as part of its broader content production and licensing expenses, which are amortized as part of its content asset base, aligning with its primarily subscription-based DTC model. This implies that Disney's expense recognition for participations and residuals varies depending on the monetization model (individual vs. group), while Netflix's is more consistently tied to its streaming delivery and usage patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney’s amortization of participations and residuals is tied to its content‑cost classification: individual‑title assets are amortized using the “current‑period‑revenue‑to‑ultimate‑revenue” method, while group‑monetized assets are amortized on a straight‑line or accelerated basis. This results in a more front‑loaded expense pattern for Disney’s theatrical and licensed titles that generate revenue over a ten‑year horizon, whereas Netflix’s group‑based amortization spreads the cost more evenly across its subscription‑driven library. Consequently, Disney recognizes higher early‑year expense for new releases, while Netflix’s expense profile is steadier and aligned with the longer‑term, subscription‑based monetization of its content.",

Quantitatively, there are no specific numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, or exact time horizons like 'ten-year') in the original answer to verify, so the mention of a 'ten-year horizon' is an addition not present in the ground truth but not factually incorrect per se—thus, quantitative accuracy is scored highly due to absence of numeric errors. However, the LLM introduces 'straight-line or accelerated basis' for group-monetized assets, which is not stated in the original; the ground truth specifies that group-monetized costs are expensed 'in line with the pattern of usage,' which is more flexible than the specific methods cited. Additionally, the LLM implies Disney uses front-loaded expenses for theatrical titles, which is a reasonable inference but not explicitly confirmed in the original. Netflix’s treatment is simplified—the original states participations and residuals are part of broader content expenses amortized with the content asset base, while the LLM bundles this under 'group-based amortization' without clarifying that these costs are embedded in overall content amortization. The core reasoning is sound and contextually relevant, capturing the strategic difference in monetization models and their impact on expense timing.

      "original_answer": "Delays in product approvals would hinder MDT's ability to realize synergies from acquisitions, such as increasing sales of integrated products and combining technologies to develop new offerings, which are key to acquisition success as stated in MDT's 10-K. For MRK, delays in regulatory filing and approval timelines for incomplete research projects would trigger impairment testing of IPR&D assets, potentially leading to impairment losses if the fair value of the intangible asset falls below its carrying amount.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the MDT 2024 10-K disclosures (pages 17‑21), delays in product approvals would directly impair MDT’s ability to capture the synergies anticipated from acquisitions, because the company explicitly states that “the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows” and that “the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies… is a key factor for success of acquisitions.”  Similarly, the MRK 2024 10‑K (pages 73‑77) notes that IPR&D impairments are assessed using “unfavorable clinical data from existing or future clinical trials” as a trigger; therefore, prolonged approval delays would likely trigger additional IPR&D impairment charges for Merck.

(2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer requiring verification; thus, quantitative accuracy is not applicable but assumed perfect as no incorrect numbers are present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information from two different companies (MDT and MRK), connects regulatory delays to financial consequences (synergy capture and impairment), and correctly interprets the implications based on each company’s disclosures. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly rephrases MRK’s trigger as 'prolonged approval delays' while the original answer emphasizes 'delays in regulatory filing and approval timelines for incomplete research projects'—a nuance that is semantically close but slightly less precise.

Both companies defer and amortize the fees, but WMT’s recent fee hike (raising the annual fee to $65 for standard members and $130 for Executive members) is expected to add roughly $370 million of revenue over the next two years, whereas COST’s recent fee increases have been modest and are accounted for in the same deferred‑revenue manner. Consequently, while the timing of revenue recognition is comparable (straight‑line over the membership term), WMT’s larger, more aggressive fee adjustments will generate a more pronounced uplift in reported revenue and cash flow in the near term, influencing both top‑line growth and the comparability of operating margins across the two retailers.",

It incorrectly states that WMT's membership fee revenue was $4.828 billion in 2024, while the ground truth reports $3.8 billion for fiscal 2025 (not 2024). It also falsely attributes a $370 million revenue increase from fee hikes to WMT, when this figure actually applies to COST. Additionally, the claim that WMT raised its standard membership fee to $65 and Executive to $130 is unsupported by the original answer, which only mentions COST increasing its Executive fee from $120 to $130. Conversely, the LLM incorrectly assigns WMT's financials to COST, stating COST had $3.8 billion in fiscal 2025 and $3.1 billion in 2024—numbers not present in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: revenue figures are swapped between companies, fiscal years are misaligned, and projected revenue impacts are misattributed. The $370 million over two years and $190 million in fiscal 2025 belong to COST, not WMT. (3) The reasoning is flawed in its multi-hop synthesis: the model reverses the roles of WMT and COST in terms of recent fee increases and revenue scale. While it correctly notes both companies recognize revenue ratably over one year, the comparative analysis is based on incorrect data, undermining the conclusion that WMT is making 'larger, more aggressive fee adjustments.' In reality, only COST implemented recent fee hikes. (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the comparison of revenue recognition timing, fee increases, and financial reporting implications. The structure and intent align with the question, and the concept of ratably recognizing fees is correctly explained. However, due to pervasive factual and quantitative errors, especially in swapping key financial figures and attributing actions to the wrong company, the overall correctness score is low.",

      "original_answer": "Salesforce acknowledges that service interruptions—such as errors, defects, or disruptions in service—can lead to customers not renewing subscriptions, making warranty claims, or experiencing performance issues that harm their business, ultimately increasing attrition rates and reducing revenue. IBM highlights that cybersecurity incidents can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or system outages, which expose customers to liability, regulatory action, and reputational damage, leading to loss of existing or potential customers. Both issues—service interruptions at Salesforce and cybersecurity vulnerabilities at IBM—erode customer trust and satisfaction, which are critical to retaining clients in the technology services industry.",

Salesforce warns that any disruption to its platform—whether from internal failures, third‑party provider outages, or newly discovered security flaws—can erode customer confidence, increase churn, and force costly remediation or credit commitments. IBM similarly notes that cyber incidents, data breaches, or service‑level failures can damage its reputation, trigger contract terminations, and lead customers to seek alternative providers, directly undermining its ability to retain and grow its client base.",

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes risks from two different companies (Salesforce on service continuity, IBM on cybersecurity) and correctly unifies them under the theme of eroding trust and increasing attrition. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'warranty claims' (Salesforce) or 'regulatory action' and 'data breaches' as directly tied to customer loss in the way the original answer does—these specific mechanisms are slightly under-articulated, but the overall meaning remains semantically equivalent. (4) Contextual relevance is perfect: the response directly addresses how both factors impact customer retention in the tech sector. Wording differs but meaning is preserved.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AXP experienced a reserve release in its Card Member receivables portfolio due to lower delinquencies and a decrease in receivables outstanding, which directly reduced its credit loss provision. Conversely, BAC had a reserve release in its commercial portfolio primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions, which also led to a reduction in its credit loss provision.

      "llm_answer": "In 2023, AXP’s credit loss reserve release was driven by lower delinquencies and a decline in receivables, which reduced the allowance for credit losses, while BAC’s reserve release was partially offset by a commercial portfolio build‑up and higher macro‑economic stress, leading to a net increase in its allowance.

      "original_answer": "DIS reported $0.7 billion in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024, which included impairments to content assets due to changes in strategic content curation and asset valuations. In contrast, NFLX did not report specific impairment charges for content assets but instead emphasized a proactive amortization model based on viewing patterns and group-level monetization. This reveals that DIS experienced more direct write-downs of content value during the year, while NFLX manages content valuation risk through accelerated amortization and tax incentive strategies rather than discrete impairment events. The difference highlights DIS's more traditional asset impairment framework versus NFLX's subscription-based, forward-looking amortization approach.",
      "llm_answer": "The impairment charges related to content assets differ significantly between Disney (DIS) and Netflix (NFLX) in their fiscal 2024 disclosures. Disney reports $1.5 billion of non‑cash impairment charges tied to content assets (including impairments of retail assets, content assets and equity investments) and describes a detailed, asset‑group‑level impairment model that amortizes licensed and produced content over shorter windows and tests for impairment using discounted cash‑flow comparisons. Netflix’s 10‑K (pages 26‑30) does not disclose any specific impairment charges for content assets; instead it focuses on content‑related liabilities, contractual obligations and cash‑flow impacts of content acquisitions, without mentioning write‑downs or impairment testing. This contrast reveals that Disney applies a rigorous, periodic impairment review and records material write‑downs when projected cash flows fall short, whereas Netflix treats content primarily as a cash‑flow‑driven investment without reporting comparable impairment expenses, indicating a more conservative valuation approach that defers impairment recognition until a triggering event occurs.",

(2) The LLM correctly notes that NFLX does not report specific impairment charges for content assets, which aligns with the original answer. However, it mischaracterizes Netflix’s approach as deferring impairment recognition until a triggering event, whereas the ground truth emphasizes NFLX’s proactive amortization model based on viewing patterns and group-level monetization—this is a key qualitative difference in reasoning. The LLM also mentions 'pages 26–30' of Netflix’s 10-K, which is not verifiable from the knowledge graph and introduces unverified detail.

The $187 million figure for DIS is correct, and META's $32.8 billion is acceptably close to $32.82 billion (format variation is acceptable). However, the erroneous addition of Star India's spending — without confirmation of its inclusion in DIS's 2024 content expenses — invalidates the overall financial comparison. (3) The reasoning and synthesis are otherwise sound: the model correctly infers that META's large contractual obligations suggest a long-term, strategic investment in content infrastructure, while DIS's lower reported spending suggests a more limited or flexible approach. The multi-hop logic (comparing contractual commitments vs. annual expenses) is conceptually appropriate, even if based on flawed data. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer directly addresses the question about comparative content investment strategies and attempts to interpret strategic implications. However, the correctness score is limited to 6 due to the significant error in DIS's reported expenses, which undermines the factual basis of the comparison, even though the core reasoning framework is valid.",

It compares its returns against the S&P Retail Composite Index and the S&P 500 Index.

Both companies disclose investment assumptions in their 10‑K filings—MCD explicitly details its share‑repurchase program, dividend policy, and the cumulative return calculation based on price appreciation plus reinvested dividends, and HD likewise outlines its dividend history, share‑repurchase authorizations, and the methodology for its performance graph that assumes reinvestment of dividends.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer captures some correct elements but misses key quantitative and methodological details present in the ground truth. It correctly identifies that HD compares against the S&P 500 and a retail index (S&P Retail Composite), and that MCD uses the S&P 500 and DJIA. However, it fails to specify the exact investment assumption of $100 invested on specific dates—January 29, 2017, for HD and December 31, 2016, for MCD—which are critical for accuracy. These dates are materially different and central to the question about methodology differences. (2) The LLM incorrectly implies that MCD compares returns to 'DJIA companies' without clarifying the crucial point that MCD uses a market-capitalization-weighted version of DJIA returns, which differs from the actual price-weighted DJIA index. The ground truth emphasizes that MCD explicitly notes this distinction and that their DJIA returns may vary from the official index due to weighting and composition changes over time—this nuance is entirely missing. (3) Regarding multi-hop reasoning, the model synthesizes basic index comparisons correctly but fails to accurately convey the investment assumptions (timing, reinvestment method, benchmark construction), which require pulling precise disclosures from each company’s 10-K. The mention of share repurchases and dividend policies, while contextually relevant, is not directly responsive to the specific investment assumptions used in the cumulative return graphs and adds extraneous detail. (4) The correctness score is 6 due to partial factual accuracy: core index comparisons are right, but key methodological differences in timing, weighting, and index construction are omitted or inaccurately represented. Quantitative accuracy is low (5) because exact dates and investment assumptions are wrong or missing. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (7) as the structure and intent are sound, but lacks precision. Contextual relevance is high (9) since the response stays on topic and addresses both parts of the question, albeit incompletely.",

      "original_answer": "Walmart's operation of 5,566 stores across 18 countries, including formats like supercenters and warehouse clubs, combined with its omni-channel integration (pickup and delivery services in most markets, same-day delivery, and digital platforms like walmart.com.mx and walmart.ca), enhances its global competitive reach. Walmart leverages its global ecosystem and local expertise to offer affordable products and services, while also expanding into digital payments through platforms like PhonePe. This creates a competitive challenge for Costco, which acknowledges the risk of losing market share to retailers with greater financial resources and technology capabilities, such as Walmart. Walmart's broader international footprint, coupled with its investments in digital infrastructure and economies of scale, could allow it to outpace Costco in attracting global customers and members, thereby directly impacting Costco's ability to maintain its competitive position.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that Bank of America exceeds the minimum Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) requirement by 90 basis points, which aligns with the ground truth calculation (5.9% - 5.0% = 0.9% = 90 basis points). However, it incorrectly states Bank of America's SLR as 6.0% instead of 5.9%, which is a factual error despite the correct final result. This likely stems from misreading or misquoting the source (e.g., 'Table 10'), introducing inaccuracy even though the arithmetic (6.0% - 5.0%) still yields a numerically close difference. (2) The calculation logic is sound—subtracting the minimum from the reported ratio and converting percentage points to basis points—and the final answer of 90 basis points matches the ground truth. However, the input numbers are not fully accurate, as 6.0% - 5.0% = 1.0% = 100 basis points, not 90. The correct math using 5.9% - 5.0% = 0.9% = 90 basis points is what justifies the answer, but the LLM uses incorrect inputs to arrive at the right output, indicating a potential data retrieval or citation error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly links Bank of America’s SLR to the regulatory minimum, recognizes that Wells Fargo is subject to the same standard due to SIFI designation, and synthesizes this to answer how much Bank of America exceeds a requirement also binding on Wells Fargo. (4) Despite the numerical inconsistency in input data, the final conclusion is correct, and the explanation is clear and contextually appropriate.

      "original_answer": "Disney's strategic changes in content distribution, such as the reorganization of media and entertainment operations into two segments and the removal of certain content from DTC platforms, have led to impairment charges and uncertainty in the profitability of DTC products. For example, Disney noted that the cost of executing its DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which could affect content distribution across platforms and the timing of content windows. Meanwhile, Meta's changes to its Feed display algorithms and the promotion of Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, have led to reduced user engagement and financial results. These strategic shifts in both companies reflect different risks: Disney faces risks related to content curation and cost rationalization, while Meta faces risks from product changes that reduce monetization potential and content distribution effectiveness.",
      "llm_answer": "The strategic shifts in Disney’s content distribution and Meta’s product changes create distinct financial risks that are highlighted in their 2024 10‑K filings. Disney’s focus on renewing long‑term programming and distribution contracts—especially for sports and linear‑network carriage—exposes it to rising content‑rights costs and the possibility of losing key rights or being forced into less‑favorable terms, which can depress advertising and subscription revenue (e.g., recent carriage renewals that cut linear‑network bundles and shift more reliance to DTC services). In contrast, Meta’s risk stems from evolving consumer tastes, rapid technological change, and intense competition for ad‑tech and AI capabilities; its DTC streaming strategy and heavy AI investments can erode revenue if subscriber growth stalls, ad pricing declines, or new AI‑related costs outpace returns (e.g., the company’s admission that DTC losses persist and that AI initiatives carry uncertainty). Both companies therefore face revenue‑pressure risks, but Disney’s is tied to the economics of traditional licensing and carriage agreements, while Meta’s hinges on shifting consumer behavior and the profitability of its newer, technology‑driven offerings.",

However, the qualitative accuracy is low because the LLM fundamentally misrepresents both companies' strategic changes and associated risks. For Disney, the LLM incorrectly frames the risk around 'renewing long-term programming and distribution contracts' and 'rising content-rights costs,' while the ground truth identifies Disney's internal strategic reorganization and removal of content from DTC platforms leading to impairment charges and cost rationalization risks. The example about carriage renewals cutting linear bundles is not supported in the original answer and misaligns with the actual risk of DTC profitability and content window timing. For Meta, the LLM incorrectly claims Meta has a 'DTC streaming strategy'—Meta (Facebook, Instagram) does not have a DTC streaming business. The real risk in the original answer is Meta's algorithmic shift toward Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, reducing engagement and financial performance. The LLM instead cites AI investments and ad-tech competition as primary risks, which are not mentioned in the ground truth. The reasoning is therefore flawed in both cases, failing the multi-hop synthesis: it does not correctly identify the specific product or strategic changes (content removal for Disney, Reels promotion for Meta) or their direct financial implications.

The combined Net P&E value of $49,919.6 million is correctly calculated and matches the ground truth, which is a major positive. However, the conclusion about which company had a higher increase in Net P&E is incorrect. The LLM claims McDonald’s (MCD) had a $762.6 million increase, but this misinterprets the timeline. The question asks for the increase from the prior year relative to the 2022 fiscal year. For MCD, the change from 2021 to 2022 is actually a decrease of $237.6 million (as per ground truth), not an increase. The LLM incorrectly uses MCD’s 2020 to 2021 change, which is not relevant because the comparison must be between 2021 and 2022 for MCD’s 2022 filing. (2) Quantitatively, the individual Net P&E values for HD ($25,199M) and MCD ($24,720.6M) are accurate, and their sum is correct. However, the claimed $762.6M increase for MCD is wrong—it should be a negative change. The HD increase of $494M is correct.

This breaks the logical synthesis required. (4) Despite the final answer stating MCD had the higher increase, the correct answer is HD. Thus, while the combined value is accurate, the key comparative conclusion is wrong, significantly reducing correctness.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that CL faced a $367 million goodwill impairment due to pandemic-related travel retail declines and that MDLZ experienced revenue growth. However, it inaccurately states that MDLZ posted an '8% rise in operating income' and a '5.2% increase in organic net revenue,' whereas the ground truth specifies an '8.0% net revenue increase'—not operating income or organic revenue—with no mention of 5.2%. This misrepresentation of financial metrics and incorrect percentage undermines quantitative accuracy. (2) The $367 million goodwill impairment for CL is correct, but the answer omits the additional $204 million trademark impairment. For MDLZ, the 8.0% net revenue increase is misrepresented as operating and organic revenue growth with an incorrect figure (5.2%), introducing factual errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts CL’s impairment with MDLZ’s recovery due to travel retail rebound. However, it fails to mention that MDLZ’s travel business remained below pre-pandemic levels and incorrectly attributes growth to 'favorable currency and organic sales expansion,' which is not supported in the original answer. The original emphasizes recovery in 'world travel business' as a key driver, not currency effects. (4) Despite these issues, the core contrast—CL suffering impairments while MDLZ benefited from travel recovery—is well captured, and the entities (CL, MDLZ, Filorga, travel retail) and time frame (2021) are accurate, supporting a moderate correctness score.

The percentage comparison is calculated as approximately 0.6%, which rounds correctly from the precise value of 0.6383% (1.5 / 235 * 100), and stating 'about 0.6%' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth's 'approximately 0.64%'. Minor rounding difference is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (2) All numeric values are accurate: $1.5 billion and $235 billion match the original answer; the percentage calculation is sound and correctly contextualized. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is solid: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (Mastercard and Morgan Stanley), correctly identifies the relevant financial events (debt issuance vs. fixed income offerings), and performs a valid cross-company scale comparison. It also cites the correct source documents (Form 10-K) and specific pages, enhancing credibility. (4) The answer is fully relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the total value of Mastercard’s debt issuance and its relative scale compared to Morgan Stanley’s offerings.

(4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the quantitative difference and its implication on lease financing costs. The only minor shortcoming is the slight rounding of 0.81 to 0.8 without specifying 'approximately,' though this is not materially misleading.

In contrast, Meta discloses that content costs are part of its cost of revenue, which includes expenses for delivery and distribution of products, but does not specify a dollar amount for content production. Instead, Meta emphasizes revenue recognition tied to advertising impressions and user actions, suggesting that its content-related costs support a platform-based monetization model rather than direct content sales or licensing.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's 2024 disclosures show content-related costs are reported as \"Costs of services\" and \"Content costs\" within operating expenses, with significant amortization of produced and licensed content ($34.4B total capitalized content, $2.1B current portion) and production tax incentives reducing costs by $0.6B. This reflects a long-term content monetization strategy focused on theatrical releases, streaming (Disney+), and licensed content with extended amortization periods (e.g., 14-year average for acquired libraries), indicating revenue generation through prolonged monetization across multiple platforms. Meta's 2024 disclosures treat content costs as part of \"Cost of revenue\" under \"Advertising Revenue\" and \"Reality Labs Revenue,\" with content expenses expensed as incurred (e.g., licensed video/music costs recognized when content is made available or over license periods), and no long-term content library amortization schedule is provided.

However, there are key quantitative discrepancies. The ground truth states Disney's total content production costs as $34,409 million as of September 28, 2024, with $18,189 million for released content and $2,281 million for completed but unreleased content. The LLM answer cites $34.4B in 'total capitalized content' and $2.1B as the 'current portion', which does not match the specific breakdown in the original answer and conflates amortization figures with production cost disclosures. Additionally, the $0.6B production tax incentive is mentioned in the LLM answer but absent in the ground truth, introducing unverified data. (2) The LLM introduces 'Costs of services' and 'Content costs' as line items, and mentions a 14-year average amortization period, which are not present in the original answer and lack verification. Meta's treatment of content costs as part of cost of revenue is correctly noted, but the LLM adds granular detail (e.g., 'licensed video/music costs recognized when content is made available') not in the source, potentially extrapolating beyond the disclosed data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in comparing Disney’s asset-based, long-term monetization strategy with Meta’s platform-driven, engagement-focused model. The synthesis of Disney’s amortization practices and Meta’s lack of long-term content assets aligns with the original conclusion, even if some supporting details are augmented. (4) The contextual relevance is high—every part of the question is addressed with appropriate framing of monetization strategies.

The LLM claims TMO’s revenue increase was $6.993 billion and UNH’s was $53.463 billion, which sum to $60.456 billion. However, according to the ground truth knowledge graph, these individual increases are incorrect. For example, UNH’s actual revenue increase from 2020 to 2021 was approximately $30.5 billion (from $257.1 billion to $287.6 billion), and TMO’s was about $7.0 billion (from $32.2 billion to $39.2 billion), totaling ~$37.5 billion. Thus, both the component values and the final sum are wrong. (2) The calculations within the LLM answer are internally consistent (6.993 + 53.463 = 60.456), but since the input numbers are incorrect, the result is invalid.

This reversal affects all downstream analysis. Additionally, the combined Net P&E is not calculated at all in the LLM answer, despite being a key part of the question. (2) The percentages are also swapped: the LLM claims HD's Net P&E is 45.9% and MCD's is 35.0%, but the correct values are approximately 35.06% for HD and 45.90% for MCD. The total assets cited ($53,854.3M for HD and $71,876M for MCD) appear plausible but are not consistent with the ground truth implied values (HD total assets ≈ $71.86B, MCD ≈ $53.86B), suggesting a mix-up in company data.

Similarly, FedEx Corporation (FDX) also records GILTI taxes as a period cost, aligning with EMR in terms of immediate recognition of foreign intangible income taxes. This shared treatment reveals a consistent industry approach under the Industrials sector to account for GILTI without relying on deferred tax mechanisms, thereby increasing transparency and aligning with U.S. tax reform expectations post-CARES Act. The immediate expensing of GILTI by both companies results in a direct impact on their annual effective tax rates, with EMR showing volatility due to restructuring benefits and FDX emphasizing future taxable income projections to support deferred tax asset recoverability.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Emerson Electric (EMR) and FedEx (FDX) disclose that they treat GILTI as a period expense, recognizing the tax liability in the income statement as it is incurred rather than deferring it. This approach results in a lower effective tax rate (EMR ≈ 14.8 % in 2022; FDX ≈ 20.9 % in 2022) because the expense is recorded immediately, reducing the net benefit of foreign earnings.

These numbers may be factually incorrect or taken from external data not referenced in the knowledge graph, making them unsupported claims. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the percentages cited lack corroboration in the ground truth; no tax rates were mentioned in the original answer, so their inclusion introduces unverified data. There are no calculations in the LLM response, but the introduction of unsupported metrics reduces reliability. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly infers that treating GILTI as a period expense impacts the income statement directly and increases transparency. However, it characterizes this approach as an 'aggressive stance on managing foreign tax liabilities,' which contradicts the original answer’s interpretation that this reflects a consistent, transparent, and reform-aligned industry practice—not an aggressive tax strategy. This misrepresents the intent behind the accounting choice. Additionally, the original answer notes differences in how each company contextualizes the impact (EMR with restructuring benefits, FDX with deferred tax asset recoverability), which the LLM omits, missing a key comparative insight.

It correctly identifies that MA relies on liquidity and cash flow to meet obligations and that MS has exposure to performance-based fees. However, it mischaracterizes MA's primary financial risk as litigation and tax contingencies, whereas the ground truth specifies credit and settlement exposure as the core risk related to liquidity. Similarly, for MS, the LLM mentions 'contingent payments' if performance targets are not met, but the ground truth specifically identifies the reversal of unrealized carried interest and the potential need to return previously received performance fees—a more precise and critical risk that is underemphasized in the LLM response. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; however, the absence of numbers does not affect scoring since the content is qualitative. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly distinguishes between MA and MS and attempts to contrast their risk profiles. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the specific nature of MS's performance fee risk (i.e., reversal of carried interest) and misattributes MA's risk to non-core factors (litigation, tax), missing the focus on credit and settlement exposure.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual inaccuracies in the numeric values provided. According to the ground truth, the combined Costs and Expenses for DIS and META in 2024 is $100,367 million, but the LLM reports $170,421 million, which is significantly higher. The LLM states Disney's Costs and Expenses as $75,300 million and Meta's as $95,121 million, but these figures do not align with the ground truth values (which must sum to $100,367 million total, implying Disney and Meta's individual values must be lower than reported by the LLM). Additionally, while the LLM correctly identifies that Reality Labs accounts for about 21% (rounding of 20.89%) of META's total Costs and Expenses, it cites a segment expense of $19,875 million, which implies a total META cost base of ~$95,121 million — again contradicting the ground truth total. (2) Calculations: The LLM's sum ($95,121 + $75,300 = $170,421) is mathematically correct, but the inputs are factually wrong. The ground truth combined total is $100,367 million, so the individual company values must be substantially lower. The 21% figure for Reality Labs is acceptably close to the ground truth 20.89%, so this part is quantitatively reasonable. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM attempts to synthesize across two companies and a segment-level breakdown, showing structural understanding of the question. However, due to incorrect base data, the synthesis fails. It correctly identifies the relevant entities (DIS, META, Reality Labs, 2024), but uses incorrect financial figures. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major factual errors in dollar amounts despite partial correctness in percentage. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because the core financial totals are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the model understands the required comparison and structure. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) because the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate framing.",

While TMO's 2021 provision for income taxes ($1,109 million) and TMO's 2019 provision ($374 million) are correct, UNH's 2021 cash paid for income taxes is incorrectly stated as $1,148 million instead of the correct $3,050 million from the ground truth. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $2,257 million instead of $4,159 million. The difference calculation is also wrong: $2,257M - $374M = $1,883M (which the model computes correctly based on its incorrect inputs), but the true increase should be $3,785 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because two of the three core numbers are incorrect (UNH's cash paid and the resulting totals), and the comparison magnitude is off by more than half. Only TMO's figures are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model correctly identifies that it must retrieve two different companies' tax-related figures across different years and combine them—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for UNH. The logic flow (sum then compare) is valid.

Additionally, UnitedHealth Group's 2021 dividend payout is stated as $5.280 billion in the LLM answer, but the ground truth reports it as $8.0 billion—this is a major discrepancy. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs: the decrease in obligations is wrong due to incorrect base figures, and the comparison ratio (2.1x) is therefore also incorrect.

It incorrectly states that Tesla's Services and Other revenue is $8.319 billion and GM's is $5.157 billion, then concludes GM's revenue is $3.162 billion smaller than Tesla's. However, the ground truth states that Tesla generated $8,319 million ($8.319 billion) and GM generated $5,157 million ($5.157 billion), meaning Tesla's revenue is actually $3,162 million ($3.162 billion) *larger* than GM's. But the original answer claims GM's revenue is $5,157 million and Tesla's is $8,319 million, and then incorrectly calculates the difference as $3,371 million — which is also wrong. The correct difference is $8,319M - $5,157M = $3,162M. So both the original and LLM answers have issues, but the LLM flips the comparison direction entirely. (2) The LLM incorrectly reverses the comparison, saying GM's revenue is smaller when the original answer (despite its own calculation error) claims GM's is larger. This is a critical quantitative and logical error. Additionally, the LLM fabricates GM's growth rate as 33% YoY, which is not in the original answer or ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the LLM misidentifies which company has higher absolute revenue and invents a growth rate for GM. It also misinterprets the implication — claiming GM is behind Tesla, while the original answer claims the opposite (that GM has a smaller growth rate but larger absolute revenue, which contradicts the numbers given). (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right topic and metric, but the factual inaccuracies and reversed conclusion severely undermine correctness.

Additionally, the LLM fabricates specific percentages (9.65% and 8.88%) that are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided context. (2) The dates of wage increases (October 2021, March 2022, July 2022) are correctly identified and align with the ground truth. However, the numerical impact on SG&A is grossly inaccurate. The original answer notes a 17-basis-point *decrease* in SG&A ratio due to leveraging higher sales despite wage hikes, but the LLM incorrectly calculates or invents a much larger effect. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Costco tied wage increases to operational efficiency gains through sales leverage, and contrasts this with Target’s lack of disclosed financial metrics around its $15/hour policy. It also accurately notes that Target emphasizes a broader compensation philosophy including benefits. This shows correct multi-hop synthesis between the two companies’ labor strategies. (4) Despite strong contextual relevance and reasonable framing of the comparison, the severe numerical inaccuracy in the SG&A impact undermines the correctness score. The model appears to have either misread or hallucinated financial figures, which is critical in financial analysis. While the direction of the effect (SG&A % decreasing due to leverage) is correct, the magnitude is not, and the fabricated percentages reduce quantitative accuracy significantly.",

      "question": "Given that The Walt Disney Company reports advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream and Alphabet (GOOGL) notes that shifts in advertising formats and device usage are affecting monetization trends and margins, how might these evolving advertising dynamics impact the relative growth and profitability of advertising revenues for both companies?",
      "original_answer": "The Walt Disney Company lists advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream, indicating its importance to overall income. Alphabet highlights that shifts toward mobile and newer advertising formats have generally lower margins compared to traditional desktop search, and that changes in device mix, geographic reach, and AI-driven user behavior are affecting monetization trends. These dynamics suggest that while both companies benefit from advertising revenues, Alphabet faces margin pressures due to format and device shifts, which could constrain profitability growth. For Disney, if it relies heavily on traditional advertising formats, it may face challenges adapting to these same evolving dynamics, potentially limiting revenue growth unless it successfully transitions to newer, more competitive formats.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Disney and Alphabet are seeing advertising revenues grow, but the dynamics behind that growth differ enough to affect their relative growth rates and profitability. Disney’s advertising is a smaller, more traditional service‑revenue stream that is tied to subscription, affiliate and licensing fees; its margins are relatively stable but limited by the company’s reliance on linear TV and theme‑park‑related advertising. Alphabet, by contrast, notes that shifts in ad formats, device mix and emerging‑market competition are reshaping monetization, compressing margins as lower‑margin subscription, device and cloud revenues expand and as newer ad products (e.g., AI‑driven formats) command lower price‑per‑click rates. Consequently, Disney’s ad revenue is likely to grow modestly with relatively predictable profitability, while Alphabet’s ad revenue may expand faster in volume but face tighter margins due to the evolving mix of higher‑margin search ads and lower‑margin newer offerings.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is factually consistent with the ground truth in terms of core dynamics affecting advertising revenues at Disney and Alphabet, with no numeric inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect, as no specific numbers were cited in either answer, and none were fabricated). The LLM correctly identifies that Disney's advertising revenue is more traditional and tied to linear TV, implying stability but limited growth, while Alphabet faces margin pressures due to shifts in ad formats, device mix, and lower-margin AI-driven or mobile ads. This aligns with the original answer’s emphasis on Alphabet’s margin compression and Disney’s potential adaptation challenges. The LLM adds some reasonable elaboration—such as linking Disney’s ad revenue to subscription and affiliate fees and noting Alphabet’s mix shift toward lower-price-per-click AI formats—which are plausible inferences but not explicitly stated in the ground truth. While these additions don’t contradict the original, they slightly extend beyond the provided information, which prevents a perfect qualitative score. The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it synthesizes Disney’s revenue model with Alphabet’s margin trends and draws a logical comparison of their relative growth and profitability outlooks. All entities (The Walt Disney Company, Alphabet/GOOGL, advertising revenues, margins, device/format shifts) are correctly identified and contextualized. The answer fully addresses the question’s focus on relative growth and profitability impacts.

It reports €3.1 billion for both AbbVie and Eli Lilly, totaling €6.2 billion, whereas the ground truth states $3.1 billion for AbbVie and $5.34 billion for Eli Lilly, totaling $8.44 billion. The currency is also incorrect—amounts are in USD, not EUR. These errors severely undermine factual correctness. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is internally consistent (€3.1B + €3.1B = €6.2B), but the inputs are wrong. The correct sum should be $3.1B + $5.34B = $8.44B. The LLM incorrectly assigns the same value to both companies, misidentifying Eli Lilly’s amount entirely. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies the accounting treatment—foreign currency translation gains or losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss due to net investment hedge designation—the multi-hop synthesis fails because it pulls incorrect data for Eli Lilly and misstates the currency and amounts for both companies.

      "original_answer": "GM's high fixed cost structure means that small changes in vehicle sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on profitability, making them highly exposed to market fluctuations. In contrast, Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments, which commenced between 2024 and 2025 with lease terms up to 20 years, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream, reducing their short-term exposure to sales volatility. This contrast in financial structures means that GM faces greater financial risk during periods of declining sales, while Tesla's leasing model offers a buffer against immediate market fluctuations through long-term contractual revenue.",
      "llm_answer": "GM's high fixed cost structure makes its profitability highly sensitive to vehicle sales volume fluctuations, as lower sales volumes directly erode margins due to fixed manufacturing costs and limited flexibility to adjust expenses, while Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments creates predictable, recurring revenue streams that insulate it from sales volatility.

      "original_answer": "Costco did not recognize any impairment charges in 2022, indicating that the carrying value of its long-lived assets remained recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and fair value assessments using market appraisals. In contrast, Target recognized $87 million in impairment charges in 2021, showing that for certain asset groups, the carrying value exceeded the fair value estimated through similar market appraisal methods. This divergence highlights that while both companies use market appraisals to estimate fair value, the outcomes of their impairment evaluations differ significantly based on the specific performance and expectations of individual assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Costco and Target employ market appraisals as part of their fair‑value estimation for long‑lived assets, yet they differ markedly in how impairment charges are recognized. Costco explicitly records impairment losses when the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value—derived from market appraisals, third‑party broker valuations, or other techniques—and these losses are booked in SG&A expense, resulting in measurable impairment charges (e.g., $87 million in 2021). Target, by contrast, states that it reviews long‑lived assets for impairment but does not disclose any specific impairment losses in its 2022 filing, indicating that its market‑appraisal‑based fair‑value testing did not trigger a material write‑down that year.

This misattribution of the charge to Costco is a critical error. (2) The LLM claims Costco recorded measurable impairment charges (e.g., $87M in 2021), but the original answer clearly states Costco did not recognize any impairment charges in 2022 and implies no such charge was reported for 2021 either. (3) The LLM incorrectly asserts that Target did not disclose any specific impairment losses in its 2022 filing, which contradicts the ground truth stating Target recognized $87 million in impairment charges in 2021—though the 2022 status is not explicitly confirmed, the misplacement of the year and company renders the comparison invalid. (4) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM reverses the outcomes—Costco had no impairments, Target did; the answer flips this, suggesting Costco recorded charges while Target did not, which inverts the actual multi-hop insight. (5) While the general context about using market appraisals is correctly noted, the core comparative analysis is based on incorrect entity-year-metric mappings.

The tax rate analysis (Page 69) notes a 14.8% effective tax rate for 2020, which includes a \"Research and development credits\" benefit of (1.8%), but this is part of a broader tax rate calculation and not a standalone dollar figure for the credit.

These revenues are tied to traditional television broadcasting and promotional services. In contrast, GOOGL generates advertising revenues predominantly through digital platforms such as Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network properties, leveraging both performance and brand advertising models. Revenues are recognized either when a user engages with performance ads or when brand ads are displayed.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of ABBV's and LLY's sales rebate accruals for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs as of December 31, 2024, is $25,843.3 million. ABBV reported $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, while LLY reported $11,539.3 million. Both companies face challenges in estimating these liabilities due to the complexity of rebate contracts, variability in sales trends, and the lag in payment timing. These complexities require significant auditor judgment and involve subjective assumptions, which can impact the accuracy of financial reporting.",

ABBV's sales rebate accrual is accurately stated as $14,304 million and LLY's as $11,539.3 million, matching the ground truth. The combined total is correctly calculated as $25,843.3 million. (2) All numeric values are accurate and properly formatted; the sum of $14,304 million + $11,539.3 million = $25,843.3 million is mathematically correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—aggregating accruals across two companies (ABBV and LLY) for a specific date (December 31, 2024) and specific programs (Medicaid, Medicare, managed care)—is sound and fully addressed. (4) The qualitative explanation about estimation complexity, including subjective assumptions (payer mix, contract changes, lag times, regulatory updates), auditor judgment, and impact on financial reporting accuracy, aligns semantically with the original answer. Wording differs slightly but conveys the same depth and meaning. All aspects of the question are addressed with full factual and conceptual accuracy.",

      "question": "How might the availability of financing impact both Emerson Electric's (EMR) ability to innovate in decarbonization technologies and FedEx's (FDX) capital investment plans, given their respective references to financing conditions and capital-intensive operations?",
      "original_answer": "The availability of financing directly affects both Emerson Electric's (EMR) ability to innovate in decarbonization technologies and FedEx's (FDX) capital investment plans. EMR notes that the adoption of new technologies like battery storage and hydrogen use cases will depend in part on the availability of financing for such projects. This implies that if financing becomes constrained or more expensive, EMR may struggle to develop or deploy these technologies, which are critical to responding to market trends like decarbonization. Similarly, FDX emphasizes that the amount and timing of its capital investments — which include aircraft, vehicles, and technology — depend on the availability of satisfactory financing. For example, FDX had $4.1 billion available under its 2022 repurchase program and issued $970 million in Pass-Through Certificates to fund corporate purposes. If financing availability tightens, FDX may delay or reduce investments in fleet expansion or technology upgrades. Thus, a decline in financing availability would create a dual impact: slowing EMR’s innovation in climate-related technologies and constraining FDX’s capital expenditures, both of which are essential to their strategic positioning in capital- and technology-intensive industries.",
      "llm_answer": "The availability of financing directly influences both companies’ ability to invest in decarbonization and capital‑intensive growth initiatives. Emerson notes that its environmental‑sustainability strategy—including decarbonization technologies—depends on “access to satisfactory financing” and on being able to fund research, development and new product introductions, while FedEx highlights that its capital‑intensive operations (e.g., aircraft, vehicle and hub investments) rely on “availability of satisfactory financing” and on maintaining strong liquidity under its credit agreements to fund the planned $6.8 billion of 2023 capital expenditures and $1.5 billion of stock repurchases. Consequently, favorable financing conditions enable continued innovation and capital spending, whereas tighter credit or higher financing costs could constrain both firms’ strategic investments.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and captures the core multi-hop reasoning required. (1) It correctly identifies that both Emerson Electric (EMR) and FedEx (FDX) depend on financing availability for strategic investments—EMR for decarbonization innovation and FDX for capital-intensive operations. The key entities (companies, focus areas) and their dependencies are accurately represented. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM states FDX’s planned $6.8 billion in 2023 capital expenditures and $1.5 billion in stock repurchases. While the ground truth mentions $4.1 billion under a repurchase program and $970 million in Pass-Through Certificates, it does not specify the total capex for 2023. The $6.8 billion figure may come from external data or a different filing year; it is plausible but not confirmed in the provided ground truth. This introduces a minor discrepancy, though not clearly incorrect. The absence of EMR’s specific financing figures (which are qualitative in the original) is acceptable. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes EMR’s need for financing to support R&D in decarbonization with FDX’s reliance on financing for fleet and infrastructure investments, concluding that tighter credit would constrain both. This reflects proper multi-hop logic across two companies and strategic domains. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addressing how financing conditions impact innovation and capital spending. Wording differs from the original but maintains semantic equivalence. The minor quantitative uncertainty prevents a perfect 10, but overall correctness is very high.",

      "question": "What is the difference in starting hourly wages between Costco and Target in 2022, and how does this wage gap reflect on their respective compensation strategies as described in their 10-K filings?",
      "original_answer": "The difference in starting hourly wages between Costco and Target in 2022 is $2.50, with Costco offering a starting wage of $17.50 and Target offering a minimum of $15 per hour. This wage gap reflects Costco's strategy of providing higher base compensation to support employee retention and career development, as evidenced by their multiple wage increases in 2022 and emphasis on full-time employment and benefits. In contrast, Target's strategy focuses on offering a comprehensive benefits package alongside a competitive but lower starting wage, aiming to attract a diverse workforce with varying employment goals, such as students and retirees seeking supplemental income.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2022 starting hourly wages differ between Costco and Target. Costco raised its starting wage to $17.50 per hour in March 2022 (with additional increases to $18.50 by July 2022), while Target’s minimum starting wage was $15 per hour as of January 2022. This wage gap reflects Costco’s compensation strategy of paying higher wages to reduce turnover and enhance employee retention (with a 90% retention rate for U.S. employees with at least one year of service), whereas Target’s $15 starting wage aligns with its broader retail compensation approach, which includes benefits like 401(k) matching and tuition assistance but does not emphasize premium hourly pay as a core retention strategy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the starting hourly wages for Costco ($17.50) and Target ($15) in 2022, resulting in a $2.50 wage gap, which matches the ground truth. It adds that Costco increased wages to $18.50 by July 2022, which is factually accurate and provides additional context not in the original answer but does not contradict it. The 90% retention rate for U.S. employees with at least one year of service is a correct qualitative detail from Costco’s 10-K and supports their retention strategy. (2) All numbers and dates are accurate: Costco’s March 2022 wage increase to $17.50 and subsequent rise to $18.50, and Target’s $15 minimum wage as of January 2022, are correctly cited. The $2.50 difference is accurate based on the starting points. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing wage levels, linking them to retention (Costco) and benefits-inclusive strategy (Target), and drawing conclusions about compensation philosophies using 10-K disclosures. The LLM correctly synthesizes wage data with strategic intent from both companies’ filings. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent and slightly more detailed than the ground truth, particularly in mentioning later wage increases and specific benefits like 401(k) matching and tuition assistance at Target. The only minor shortcoming is not explicitly stating that Target’s strategy includes attracting part-time or supplemental-income workers (e.g., students, retirees), which is in the original answer. However, the core compensation strategy contrast is accurately conveyed. Thus, the answer is highly accurate with only a slight omission in contextual nuance, warranting a 9/10 on correctness and qualitative accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "AVGO disclosed that delays in the manufacture and delivery of its products could cause delays in a customer's end-product delivery, which may result in contractual compensation requirements and a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of the affected products. This directly impacts AVGO's ability to retain customers. IBM, on the other hand, stated that if it fails to adequately and timely anticipate and respond to changes in customer and market preferences, competitive actions, or disruptive technologies, client demand for its products or services may decline, which would negatively affect customer retention. Both companies identify a direct link between operational or strategic shortcomings and potential customer retention issues, though through different mechanisms.",
      "llm_answer": "AVGO’s 10‑K warns that delays in delivering its semiconductor products could cause customers to postpone or cancel purchases, leading to lost revenue and reduced retention, while IBM’s 10‑K notes that failing to anticipate shifts in client preferences or market demand can erode client relationships and diminish the company’s ability to retain customers.

(1) It correctly identifies that AVGO's product delivery delays could lead to customer purchase cancellations and lost revenue, impacting retention—this aligns with the ground truth mentioning contractual compensation and delayed market acceptance. For IBM, it accurately reflects that failure to anticipate market preferences may erode client relationships and reduce retention, consistent with the original answer’s emphasis on declining demand due to misaligned offerings. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes risk disclosures from two different companies and links each to customer retention through distinct mechanisms (operational delays for AVGO, strategic misalignment for IBM). The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits specific consequences like 'contractual compensation' for AVGO and 'disruptive technologies' for IBM, which slightly reduces completeness but does not alter the essential correctness. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing how each company's disclosed risks impact customer retention. Wording differs but meaning is semantically equivalent.

      "original_answer": "Goldman Sachs estimates potential loss from credit exposures using a combination of current and potential exposure metrics, incorporating market movements within a specified confidence level and applying netting and collateral arrangements. They also conduct regular and tailored stress tests to estimate losses under hypothetical severe market or economic events, reviewing these estimates to identify and mitigate risk concentrations. In contrast, Visa estimates potential loss in legal and regulatory matters by assessing the probability and amount of loss based on management's judgment, historical data, legal advice, and specific case details. Visa also adjusts estimates as new information becomes available and uses loss-sharing agreements to reduce liability. While Goldman Sachs uses quantitative financial modeling and market-based stress scenarios, Visa relies more heavily on qualitative legal assessments and contractual mechanisms to manage potential loss.",
      "llm_answer": "Goldman Sachs estimates credit‑risk loss using forward‑looking credit‑exposure models that incorporate current and potential exposure, counterparty‑specific credit ratings, collateral, and netting arrangements, and it applies stress‑test shocks and probability‑weighted loss estimates. Visa, by contrast, treats potential liability in litigation and regulatory matters as a contingent loss that is accrued only when a loss is deemed probable and reasonably estimable, relying on historical loss experience and qualitative judgment rather than quantitative market‑risk metrics; its forward‑looking assumptions are limited to the likelihood of a loss and an estimated amount, without the same exposure‑level, confidence‑interval or stress‑scenario calculations used by Goldman Sachs.",

The LLM correctly contrasts Goldman’s quantitative, market-based modeling with Visa’s more qualitative, legally driven approach. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense—but the LLM accurately represents any implied metrics or methodologies (e.g., 'probability-weighted', 'stress-test shocks') without introducing errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes distinct risk estimation frameworks across two different companies (Goldman Sachs for credit risk, Visa for legal/regulatory liability), compares their use of forward-looking assumptions, and highlights differences in methodology (quantitative modeling vs. judgment-based accruals).

For BKNG, the document does not contain any information about dividends received by Booking.com from its subsidiaries in 2023 or 2022. The document only mentions Booking.com's revenue and geographic information, but no dividend data is provided. Therefore, the combined total of dividends received by BKNG and GM from their respective subsidiaries in 2023 cannot be determined from the provided sources, as BKNG's dividend information is absent.

In reality, the question and original answer imply that both companies' data were available in the knowledge graph (presumably from their respective 10-K filings), but the LLM only had access to GM's document and incorrectly concluded BKNG's data was absent. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly reports GM's 2023 ($1.8 billion) and 2022 ($1.7 billion) dividends, which matches the ground truth. However, it omits BKNG's $107 million (2023) and $3,087 million (2022), leading to a complete failure in calculating the combined totals ($1,907 million in 2023 and $4,787 million in 2022) and the year-over-year decrease of $2,880 million. These calculations are entirely missing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model should have synthesized BKNG and GM data across documents, but instead defaulted to incompleteness due to lack of one document. Since the original answer assumes both datasets are available, the LLM should not have dismissed the question as unanswerable. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the response addresses the right companies and metric (dividends from subsidiaries), but fails to deliver the required synthesis.

According to the ground truth, EMR's Cash Used in Investing Activities in 2022 was $5,334 million, not $6,816 million as stated by the LLM. Similarly, FDX's actual outflow was $6,816 million, not $6,763 million. The LLM incorrectly assigns FDX's capital expenditure figure ($6,763 million) as its total investing cash outflow, which is close but not identical to the correct total. The combined total is therefore wrong: $13,579 million (LLM) vs. $12,150 million (ground truth), a difference of over $1.4 billion. (2) The calculation of the sum is arithmetically correct based on the incorrect inputs, but the inputs themselves are factually inaccurate. The LLM also swaps key figures—$6,816 million is actually FDX’s total investing outflow (not EMR’s), and $6,763 million is FDX’s capital expenditures (a component, not the total). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM misattributes the drivers of cash outflows. It claims EMR’s outflow is due to 'fleet modernization and network-security investments', but the ground truth shows EMR’s outflow is driven by acquisitions ($5,702 million in purchases of businesses). Conversely, FDX’s actual strategy—dominated by capital expenditures of $6,763 million—is correctly identified in the ground truth, but the LLM incorrectly presents this as the total outflow rather than a component, and mislabels the strategy as applying to FDX while wrongly assigning a different strategy to EMR. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to address both the quantitative total and the strategic interpretation, but both the numbers and the reasoning are largely incorrect, severely undermining the qualitative and quantitative accuracy. The conclusion about FDX’s spending has some basis but is misrepresented, while EMR’s strategy is entirely mischaracterized.",

      "original_answer": "Intel has historically faced significant delays in achieving expected manufacturing yields for its 10nm and 7nm process technologies, which led to missed customer product design windows, increased product costs, and allowed competitors like TSMC-based firms to gain a competitive edge in performance and energy efficiency. These yield issues have directly impacted Intel’s gross margin due to higher per-unit costs and underutilized capacity. NVIDIA, on the other hand, faces risks from its reliance on third-party foundries, where failure to achieve high manufacturing yields—either due to issues in product design or the foundry's proprietary process technology—can similarly increase costs and reduce product availability. Both companies face shared implications: lower manufacturing yields lead to higher product costs, reduced gross margins, and potential loss of market share due to delayed or uncompetitive product offerings.",

By contrast, Visa’s preferred stock (see page 89) also carries a liquidation preference but its redemption mechanism ties the conversion rate adjustments to litigation escrow releases and anniversary releases, and the conversion of its series B and C preferred shares is subject to staged conversion based on the resolution of U.S. and Europe litigation, whereas Goldman Sachs’ redemption is governed simply by the stated preference plus accrued dividends and requires board and Federal Reserve approval.",

This figure appears to be pulled from a document (page 207) but does not match the known issuance of Series X (90,000 shares × $25,000 = $2.25 billion) and Series Y (80,000 × $25,000 = $2.0 billion), which correctly sum to $4.25 billion. The LLM’s number is over 3x higher, indicating a severe miscalculation or misattribution. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies that Goldman Sachs’ preferred stock has liquidation preference and ranks ahead of common stock, and that dividends are included, it fails to specify the actual series (X and Y) or their share counts and per-share preferences, which are key to the multi-hop calculation. (3) On qualitative aspects, the comparison to Visa’s preferred stock includes some accurate elements—such as conversion conditions tied to litigation—but introduces details (e.g., 'conversion rate adjustments to litigation escrow releases') not present in the ground truth. The ground truth emphasizes Visa’s participation in dividends on an as-converted basis and convertibility into Class A common or Series A preferred, which the LLM omits. Instead, the LLM adds unverified procedural details about staged conversion based on litigation resolution, which may be contextually plausible but are not supported in the provided truth. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question—redemption value and comparison—and attempts multi-hop reasoning between GS and Visa. However, the core numerical error undermines the correctness score. The reasoning is partially sound but based on incorrect data and includes unsupported specifics. Thus, while structurally relevant, it is factually inaccurate on the most critical point: the total redemption value.",

      "original_answer": "ABBV experienced a lower effective tax rate in 2024, partially due to acquisition costs related to business development activities, indicating that strategic acquisitions influenced its tax position. Meanwhile, LLY spent $3.35 billion on IPR&D (primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic) and $947.7 million on a manufacturing site in Wisconsin, showing a significant allocation of capital toward innovation and manufacturing expansion. Comparing the two, ABBV's business development activities influenced its tax efficiency, while LLY's spending reflects a focus on expanding R&D capabilities and production infrastructure, suggesting different strategic emphases despite both engaging in business development activities.",
      "llm_answer": "ABBV's acquisition-related tax impacts are reflected in its effective tax rate discussion, where it notes that 2024's lower effective tax rate was \"partially offset by increases due to acquisition costs related to certain business development activities\" and that the rate was \"lower than prior periods due to the resolutions of various tax positions pertaining to multiple prior tax years, including the closing of U.S. IRS examinations covering three tax years, partially offset by increases in unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to prior years.\" In contrast, LLY's 2024 spending on IPR&D ($3.35 billion) and manufacturing site acquisitions ($947.7 million) is presented as discrete business development expenditures—$3.35 billion for in‑process research and development and $947.7 million for a manufacturing facility—without any tax‑rate impact disclosed, indicating that LLY treats these costs as pure operating investments rather than tax‑affected items. Consequently, ABBV integrates tax considerations into its strategic growth narrative, while LLY emphasizes direct investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity as core growth priorities.",

All dollar amounts and contextual details are factually accurate and match the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $3.35 billion and $947.7 million are correctly reported with acceptable formatting (e.g., $3.35 billion). No calculations were required, but the presentation of discrete expenditures is precise. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly contrasts ABBV’s tax-affected business development strategy with LLY’s direct investment approach, synthesizing information across both companies’ 2024 filings. It accurately infers that ABBV's acquisitions have tax implications while LLY treats its spending as operational investments without disclosed tax impacts. (4) The answer conveys the same strategic comparison as the ground truth: ABBV integrates tax considerations into growth strategy, while LLY prioritizes R&D and manufacturing expansion. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that both companies are engaged in business development—just that they differ in how they account for or report it—slightly weakening the synthesis.

In contrast, Target reported that higher merchandise costs were a factor negatively impacting its gross margin percentage in 2021, even though it maintained a much higher gross margin at 28.3%. This shows that while both companies faced pressure from merchandise cost increases, Costco experienced a direct decline in gross margin percentage, whereas Target was able to offset some of the cost pressures through other factors like digital fulfillment efficiencies and favorable category mix.",

However, the LLM states it rose from 88.87% to 89.52%, which is incorrect. The calculated change of 0.65 percentage points is also wrong—the actual increase is 0.3 percentage points (89.5 - 89.2). Additionally, the LLM incorrectly claims that Target’s gross margin was 'significantly lower than Costco’s,' when in fact Target’s 28.3% gross margin was much higher than Costco’s 11.13% in 2021 and 10.48% in 2022.

This compares to Comcast's Studios segment, which typically has future revenue visibility from existing licensing agreements equal to approximately one-half year to one year of annual Studios content licensing revenue. Thus, while Netflix's obligations are forward-looking and not yet fixed, they represent a significant multi-year financial commitment that is expected to be recognized over time, similar to Comcast’s revenue recognition pattern from licensing content over a 1–2 year horizon.",

This is a major factual error. The figure of $11.38 billion does not appear in the original answer and is unsupported by the provided ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised due to this incorrect number; even if it were derived from a misinterpretation of a contractual obligations table, it does not align with the stated 'approximate range' in the ground truth. The comparison to Comcast’s Studios segment is mostly accurate: stating that future revenue visibility is roughly half a year to one year of annual licensing revenue, and that it is recognized over one to two years, aligns well with the original. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly identifying that Netflix has forward-looking obligations while Comcast has revenue visibility from existing agreements, and drawing a comparison in terms of time-based recognition patterns. However, the flawed input (wrong Netflix obligation amount) undermines the validity of the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the structure, entities, and intent of the comparison are appropriate and address both parts of the question. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the conceptual framework and entity identification (Netflix, Comcast Studios, licensing obligations vs. revenue visibility) are correct, but the core financial figure is wrong.

However, the LLM claims this cannot be determined and incorrectly asserts that Eli Lilly is not mentioned in AbbVie's 10-K — but the question does not require Eli Lilly to be mentioned in AbbVie’s filing; it asks for a combination of values from both companies’ respective 10-K filings. (2) The LLM invents specific acquisitions (e.g., ImmunoGen, Cerevel Therapeutics, DJS Antibodies Ltd) with fabricated values such as $1,280 million and duplicate $897.7 million figures not present in the ground truth, which only reports a single $1.3 billion figure for AbbVie. These numbers are inconsistent with the original answer and demonstrate serious quantitative inaccuracies.

Tesla, on the other hand, recognizes a Sales Return Reserve based on historical experience and expected future market values when offering resale value guarantees, indicating a proactive financial obligation tied to vehicle buyback programs.

This omission affects completeness and quantitative accuracy. Tesla's recognition of a reserve tied to resale-value guarantees is accurately described, though specific references to ASC 460 and quarterly adjustments are not in the ground truth and may be plausible but unverifiable. (2) The number $191 million is correct, but the absence of the prior year value ($234 million) and the change (a $43 million decrease) means the quantitative comparison is incomplete. No incorrect numbers are presented, but the lack of full data limits accuracy. (3) The reasoning correctly distinguishes between LOW’s general return risk and Tesla’s structured buyback obligations, showing sound multi-hop synthesis across companies and financial concepts. However, the failure to mention the downward trend in LOW’s reserve weakens the analysis of financial obligations over time.

In contrast, PEP's 10-K provides a more granular definition of segment cost of sales, explicitly listing components such as raw materials, direct labor, plant overhead, purchasing and receiving costs, production planning, inspection costs, and raw materials handling facilities. PEP also clarifies that these costs exclude the impact of comparability items, which are managed centrally and reported in corporate unallocated expenses. By comparing these disclosures, it becomes evident that while MDLZ offers precise dollar amounts per region, PEP provides a more detailed breakdown of cost components, enhancing operational transparency.

The correct combined net change is a decrease of $69 million (ABT: -$72M, AMGN: -$4M → -$76M total net change? Wait: AMGN decreased from $32M to $28M, so -$4M; ABT: $313M to $241M = -$72M; total = -$76M? But original answer says 'decrease of $69 million' — this discrepancy suggests possible error in ground truth or misinterpretation. However, per original answer, combined net change is -$69M, so LLM's $72M is incorrect. Moreover, LLM incorrectly claims AMGN's data was 'not disclosed,' but original answer clearly provides AMGN's figures: $32M (2021) to $28M (2023), indicating a $4M decrease. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: LLM incorrectly reports the total net change as $72M instead of $69M, omits AMGN’s $4M decrease, and fails to calculate the correct combined change. It also misattributes ABT’s change as the total. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to synthesize data from both companies, incorrectly asserting that AMGN’s data is missing when it should have been extractable (per ground truth). It also fails to compare the patterns of additions and deductions — e.g., ABT’s consistent additions and write-offs vs AMGN’s minimal additions and no write-offs — instead stating no details were available. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the structure of the question (net change, patterns) but fails on content due to missing and incorrect data. The qualitative reasoning is weak due to incorrect assumptions about data availability and lack of comparative analysis. Final score reflects major factual and synthesis failures despite correct mention of ABT’s $72M decrease.",

      "original_answer": "The $571 million in 2028 operating lease payments reported by LOW indicates the company is primarily a lessee, leasing assets such as real estate or equipment to support its operations. In contrast, TSLA's $197 million in 2028 operating lease receivables suggests it is primarily a lessor in this context, leasing out assets—likely manufacturing or logistics equipment. This contrast reflects fundamentally different asset utilization strategies: LOW is deploying capital by leasing assets to support its retail and operational footprint, while TSLA is generating revenue by leasing out assets it owns, potentially as part of its broader capital efficiency and asset-light initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "The contrasting asset utilization strategies are evident in the operating lease commitments: Lowe's reports $571 million in operating lease payments, reflecting a focus on securing long‑term lease obligations for its store and distribution network, whereas Tesla reports $197 million in operating lease receivables, indicating that it is primarily a lessor of solar and vehicle assets, generating future lease income rather than incurring lease expense. This disparity underscores Lowe's strategy of heavy reliance on leased real‑estate and equipment to support its retail operations, while Tesla leverages its owned assets to create lease‑based revenue streams.",

(2) Quantitatively, all numbers match the original answer exactly—no calculations are required, but the values are correctly attributed to the respective companies and financial line items. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that LOW, as a lessee with significant lease payments, relies on leased assets (e.g., real estate) for operations, while TSLA, as a lessor with receivables, generates income by leasing out assets it owns. The interpretation aligns with the ground truth’s conclusion about contrasting strategies—LOW deploying capital via leasing-in, TSLA generating revenue via leasing-out. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM specifies 'solar and vehicle assets' as the leased assets, which adds detail not present in the original; while plausible, this is an assumption not directly supported in the provided data, slightly reducing qualitative precision.

The calculated increase of $1,094 million is also wrong; the correct deterioration is $1,087 million ($(2,219) - $(1,132)). (2) Quantitative accuracy fails: all key numbers are incorrect. The LLM uses only FDX's figures and ignores EMR entirely, leading to a complete misrepresentation. Calculations based on wrong inputs are also inaccurate.

AIG reports $42 million in >90 days delinquent loans from its commercial real estate portfolio, while COF reports $3,504 million in >90 days delinquent credit card loans and $484 million in >90 days delinquent consumer banking loans (specifically auto loans). This results in a total of $42M + $3,504M + $484M = $3,891M. AIG's delinquencies are spread across multiple commercial real estate categories, indicating a diversified but small risk exposure.

Together they total **$1.02 billion**, reflecting AIG’s relatively low credit‑risk exposure in its CRE book (≈5 % of its loan book is >90 days delinquent) versus Capital One’s higher risk profile, where >90‑day delinquencies represent about **1.4 % of its total loan portfolio** and account for a larger share of its allowance for credit losses.",

COF's (Capital One) delinquent credit card and consumer banking loans total $3,504M + $484M = $3,988M, not $846M. The combined total is therefore $3,891M ($3.891 billion), not $1.02 billion. These numerical discrepancies are significant and materially incorrect. (2) Calculations are flawed: $174M + $846M = $1.02B is arithmetically correct, but both inputs are wrong. The ground truth sum of $42M + $3,504M + $484M = $3,891M is accurate. The LLM’s numbers do not match the source data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present—LLM attempts to combine AIG and COF delinquencies and interpret credit risk exposure—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval. It incorrectly attributes $174M to AIG (vs. $42M) and vastly underreports COF’s delinquencies ($846M vs. $3,988M). (4) Entity identification is mostly correct—AIG and COF (Capital One) are properly identified, and the relevant portfolios (commercial real estate, credit card, consumer banking) are addressed. However, the qualitative analysis (e.g., 5% delinquency rate for AIG, 1.4% for COF) introduces unsupported percentages not in the original answer and not verifiable from the provided truth.

The TSLA gross lease receivables figure ($4,742 million) is correct. However, due to the incorrect LOW value, the calculated difference is wrong: $4,742M - $4,343M = $399M (LLM) vs. the correct $4,742M - $4,224M = $518M (ground truth). (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the core financial figure for LOW is from the wrong year, leading to an incorrect subtraction. While the TSLA number is accurate, the use of 2023 data for LOW instead of 2024 undermines the entire calculation. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—subtracting one value from the other to find the difference—but it fails on multi-hop synthesis because it pulls the LOW liability data from an incorrect fiscal year. The model correctly identifies the entities (LOW and TSLA) and the relevant metrics (lease liabilities and lease receivables), but does not align them with the correct time period. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, metrics, and overall intent of the question. However, the use of outdated data for LOW results in a materially incorrect conclusion, warranting a low correctness score despite partial accuracy.",

It incorrectly states that Emerson Electric provided $9,832 million in cash from operating activities in 2022, which is actually the value for FedEx (FDX), not Emerson. The ground truth states Emerson provided $2,922 million, so the LLM swapped or misattributed the values. This leads to the false conclusion that both companies provided equal cash from operations, when in fact FedEx provided $6,910 million more than Emerson. The second part of the answer regarding the $515 million reduction in cash due to changes in operating working capital for Emerson is correct. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $9,832 million figure is correctly reported for FedEx but wrongly assigned to Emerson. The difference of $6,910 million (9,832 - 2,922) is not mentioned, and the comparison is therefore invalid. Only the $515 million working capital impact is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly synthesize the cash from operating activities for both companies. It conflates the two entities' financials, undermining the comparative analysis. While it correctly retrieves Emerson’s working capital impact, it fails to contrast the two companies’ operating cash flows accurately. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate financial terminology, but the core quantitative error in the first part drastically reduces its usefulness.

The original answer implies both companies contributed to the decrease, but the LLM claims PEP had zero change, which contradicts the expected synthesis. (2) The reported $1,208 million decrease for MDLZ alone exceeds the total combined decrease in the ground truth, making it factually inconsistent. Even if MDLZ’s number were accurate (which cannot be verified independently here), the sum is incorrect because PEP must have had a decrease as well to align with the $985 million total.

      "original_answer": "General Dynamics contributed $135 million in 2021, while the required contribution for 2022 was only $40 million, indicating a discretionary over-contribution of $95 million. This reflects a strategy of optimizing tax deductibility and contract recovery within its capital deployment framework.

These figures match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting ($135 million vs $135 million). 2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect—both amounts are correct, and the comparison is valid. The calculation of $95 million excess is logically sound and consistent with the ground truth, even if not explicitly computed. 3) The qualitative reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly characterizes General Dynamics’ strategy as discretionary and beyond minimum requirements, and contrasts it with Union Pacific’s GAAP-aligned, funded-status-driven approach. It captures the essence of differing strategies—strategic capital deployment vs. regulatory and solvency considerations—even if it does not mention 'tax deductibility and contract recovery' or 'balance sheet-driven' in those exact terms. The omission of these specific motivations slightly reduces qualitative precision but does not distort the meaning. 4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the response directly addresses both parts of the multi-hop question: the quantitative difference in contributions and the comparative pension funding strategies across the two companies.

In fiscal year 2022, Disney recognized $10,224 million in amortization of produced content costs, primarily in 'Cost of services'. AT&T also uses 'Ultimate Revenues' for amortization but applies it to both individual and group monetized content, with a similar 10-year estimation period. However, AT&T places greater emphasis on the fair value of programming and subscription revenue projections, especially for streaming and OTT services.

The LLM incorrectly frames AT&T’s approach as fundamentally different in concept (e.g., 'rather than a broader Ultimate Revenues concept'), when in fact both companies use the concept—the difference lies in application and emphasis, not presence or absence.

      "original_answer": "Disney faces significant challenges in managing churn rates on its DTC platforms, particularly in response to price increases and economic downturns, which can reduce consumer willingness to pay for streaming services. In contrast, AT&T has successfully reduced churn by bundling services, with subscribers purchasing two or more services experiencing significantly lower churn than single-service subscribers. This comparison reveals that the streaming industry faces more price sensitivity and subscriber volatility due to a crowded market and economic pressures, whereas the telecom industry benefits from integrated service offerings that enhance customer retention. The competitive dynamics differ in that Disney must balance price increases with subscriber retention amid rising competition and economic uncertainty, while AT&T leverages its 5G network and bundled plans to maintain subscriber loyalty in a more mature, saturated market.",

      "original_answer": "KO's operating income declined by $1,319 million in 2024, partly due to higher SG&A expenses and an 11% unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact from a stronger U.S. dollar against currencies like the Mexican peso and Brazilian real. MDLZ's segment operating income grew by $3 million, despite higher SG&A expenses and unfavorable currency-related items, due to countervailing gains from higher net pricing and cost controls.

The ground truth states KO's operating income declined by $1,319 million (not $1.3 billion or ~$1.3 bn), and MDLZ's segment operating income grew by only $3 million (not $90 million). These discrepancies are significant—especially the $87 million overstatement for MDLZ. The net dollar difference is therefore grossly inaccurate: the correct value is $1,322 million ($1,319M decline vs. $3M growth), not $1.4 billion. While $1.3 billion is a reasonable approximation of $1,319 million, $90 million is not a defensible approximation of $3 million. (2) Calculations: The net difference in the LLM answer ($1.3 bn + $0.09 bn = $1.39 bn ≈ $1.4 bn) is mathematically correct based on its incorrect inputs, but the inputs themselves are factually wrong. The correct calculation is $1,319M - (-$3M) = $1,322M, which the LLM fails to match. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that both companies faced higher SG&A and unfavorable currency impacts, and that MDLZ still achieved growth due to offsetting factors like pricing and cost controls—this part of the reasoning aligns with the ground truth. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the actual reported outcomes from the filings, undermining the core of the multi-hop comparison. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to severe quantitative inaccuracies despite some contextual alignment. Quantitative accuracy is 2/10 because most numbers are wrong.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase's Return on Common Equity (ROE) was 17%, significantly higher than AIG's ROE of 8.6%. This difference is primarily due to JPM's much higher net income of $49,552 million compared to AIG's net income of $3,614 million, as well as JPM's substantially larger average common shareholders' equity of $300,474 million versus AIG's $41,930 million. The ROE calculation (Net Income / Average Common Shareholders' Equity) highlights how JPM’s higher profitability relative to its equity base results in a stronger ROE performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The ROE for AIG in 2023 was 8.6% versus JPMorgan Chase's 17%, a significant gap driven by AIG's lower net income ($3.614 billion) relative to its average common shareholders' equity ($41.93 billion), while JPMorgan reported $49.552 billion net income on $300.474 billion common equity. This difference stems from AIG's reduced earnings—partly due to lower net realized gains and higher tax expenses—compared with JPMorgan's stronger income growth and higher profitability metrics.",

All numbers match the ground truth, with acceptable format variations (billion vs million). (2) The ROE calculation logic (Net Income / Average Common Shareholders' Equity) is implicitly correct, and the comparison of relative profitability and equity bases is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from both companies' 2023 financials is synthesized to explain the ROE difference. The LLM adds extra qualitative insight (AIG's lower net realized gains and higher tax expenses; JPMorgan's stronger income growth) not present in the original answer, which is plausible and contextually relevant, though not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth. This does not detract from accuracy but slightly extends beyond the provided data. (4) All entities (AIG, JPMorgan Chase, 2023, ROE, net income, average common shareholders' equity) are correctly identified and used.

      "original_answer": "GD's ROIC declined from 14.0% in 2019 to 11.9% in 2021, indicating a downward trend in the efficiency of its capital investments over this period. In contrast, UNP emphasizes that ROIC is used as a key performance metric for evaluating long-term capital investments and is specifically incorporated into the determination of equity compensation for executives. This suggests UNP places increasing strategic importance on ROIC as a performance incentive, even as GD's ROIC has decreased over the same timeframe.",

This aligns with UNP's rationale for using ROIC as a performance metric—emphasizing its role in evaluating long-term capital efficiency and as a key criterion for executive compensation—since GD's ROIC performance, while not showing dramatic growth, still supports the metric's relevance in assessing sustained operational effectiveness and capital allocation discipline.",

It correctly identifies GD's ROIC trend as starting at 14.0% in 2019 and ending at 11.9% in 2021, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states a drop to 11.8% in 2020 and a 'slight increase' to 11.9% in 2021, implying a rebound. The ground truth does not provide 2020 data, so this specific intermediate value and the characterization of a rebound are unsupported and likely inaccurate. (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially compromised because the model introduces a precise but unverified 11.8% for 2020, which is not in the original answer. While the final 11.9% is correct, the implied trajectory (decline, then increase) differs from the ground truth's simple 'declined from 14.0% to 11.9%'—a steady downward trend without recovery. (3) The reasoning is flawed in the synthesis: the LLM claims GD's 'relatively flat and modestly improving' ROIC 'aligns with' UNP's rationale for using ROIC in executive compensation. This is a misinterpretation—the original answer contrasts GD's declining ROIC with UNP's increasing strategic emphasis on ROIC, highlighting a divergence, not alignment. The multi-hop logic fails because it incorrectly infers agreement between the two companies' contexts. (4) Despite these issues, the answer correctly identifies both companies, the metric (ROIC), the time frame (2019–2021), and UNP's use of ROIC in executive compensation.

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola reported a $1,319 million decrease in operating income in 2024, with higher SG&A expenses cited as a primary driver of the decline. This was compounded by other factors such as commodity costs, other operating charges, and foreign exchange impacts. In contrast, Mondelez listed higher SG&A expenses as one of several cost pressures, including costs from the Simplify to Grow Program, remeasurement losses, manufacturing costs, and an intangible asset impairment charge from 2023.

      "llm_answer": "The impact of higher SG&A expenses on operating performance differed between Coca‑Cola and Mondelez in 2024: Coca‑Cola’s SG&A rose 4% (driven by higher advertising, stock‑based compensation and other operating costs) and, combined with higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign‑exchange effects, pushed consolidated operating margin down to 21.2% from 24.7% in 2023, while Mondelez’s SG&A increase was offset by stronger pricing and volume gains, allowing its operating margin to stay relatively stable (the document shows Mondelez’s segment operating income grew 7.1% on a modest revenue rise, indicating SG&A pressures were less damaging to its operating performance).",

The original answer states that Coca-Cola reported a $1,319 million decrease in operating income with higher SG&A as a primary driver, but the LLM introduces specific figures not in the ground truth—such as a 4% SG&A increase, operating margin decline from 24.7% to 21.2%, and attributions to advertising and stock-based compensation—which are not mentioned in the original. These numbers, while plausible, are not present in the ground truth and thus represent fabrication or hallucination. Similarly, the LLM claims Mondelez’s SG&A increase was offset by pricing and volume gains and that segment operating income grew 7.1%, none of which appear in the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the LLM introduces precise percentages and margins (e.g., 4%, 21.2%, 24.7%, 7.1%) that are not in the original answer. The only correct quantitative element is the implication that both companies faced higher SG&A, but even the comparative impact is misrepresented. The original does not provide operating margins or growth percentages for Mondelez. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model attempts to compare the differing impact of SG&A between two companies, but it fails to accurately reflect the original synthesis. The original emphasizes that Coca-Cola singled out SG&A as a key factor in declining performance, while Mondelez listed it among several cost pressures including legacy charges (e.g., intangible asset impairment from 2023). The LLM omits these specific cost pressures and instead invents a narrative around pricing and volume, misrepresenting Mondelez’s situation.

However, according to the ground truth, Netflix has non-current operating lease liabilities of $2,046,801 thousand ($2,046.801 million) and total assets of $24,039,780 thousand ($24,039.78 million), which is approximately 8.5%. Verizon’s figures are correctly stated in the original answer as $20,002 million in lease liabilities and $380,255 million in total assets (5.3%). The LLM incorrectly applies Verizon’s numbers to Netflix. (2) Quantitative accuracy fails completely for Netflix: the lease liabilities are off by over $18 billion (using $20,002M instead of ~$2,047M), and total assets are off by over $350 billion (using $380,255M instead of ~$24,040M). The 5.3% figure belongs only to Verizon, not Netflix.

While it correctly states Emerson's (EMR) net earnings attributable to common stockholders in 2022 as $3,231 million, it incorrectly claims FedEx (FDX) reported net earnings available to participating securities as $2,250 million, which is fabricated. The original answer and question both state that FDX's amount was $25 million (assumed for immaterial value), not $2,250 million. The LLM invents a multiplier of 90 shares without any basis in the data or typical SEC assumptions, leading to a completely incorrect comparison. (2) The correct calculation is $3,231 million - $25 million = $3,206 million. The LLM's calculation of $3,231 million - $2,250 million = $981 million is based on false inputs and is therefore invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have simply taken EMR's $3,231 million and subtracted the assumed $25 million from FDX. Instead, it introduces unsupported assumptions about share counts and scales the $25 million arbitrarily, showing flawed logic and misunderstanding of financial metrics. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right companies and metric types, but the severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies—especially the invented calculation—warrant low scores in correctness, quantitative accuracy, and reasoning.",

      "original_answer": "Apple faces a direct negative impact on gross margins due to foreign exchange risk, as a stronger U.S. dollar reduces its net sales and gross margins when expressed in USD. In contrast, Intel expects gross margins to be impacted by strategic investments in manufacturing capacity and process technology under its IDM 2.0 strategy, forecasting non-GAAP gross margins between 51% and 53% over the next several years. While Apple's financial planning must account for FX volatility through hedging instruments and pricing adjustments, Intel's planning focuses on absorbing upfront costs of long-term strategic investments that are expected to drive future revenue growth and margin improvement. This contrast highlights differing financial risk profiles: Apple managing external market volatility versus Intel managing internal strategic investment impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s foreign‑exchange risk is highlighted by its sensitivity analysis, which estimates a potential one‑day loss of about $1 billion on its derivative positions, reflecting exposure to currency movements that can affect revenue and margins. In contrast, Intel’s IDM 2.0 strategy focuses on heavy capital investment and capacity expansion, projecting non‑GAAP gross margins of 51‑53 % and expecting cash from operations to remain strong but free cash flow to be pressured in the short term. Consequently, Apple’s financial planning must prioritize managing FX volatility and preserving liquidity, while Intel’s planning centers on funding long‑term growth investments and sustaining margin targets despite near‑term cash‑flow constraints.",

No calculation errors are present. (2) The answer correctly identifies both companies (Apple and Intel), the relevant financial metrics (foreign exchange risk, gross margins, cash flow), and the strategic context (IDM 2.0).

(4) The core message is semantically equivalent to the ground truth: Apple manages external market volatility, Intel manages internal investment-driven impacts. The only minor gap is that the LLM emphasizes cash flow pressure more than the original and does not explicitly mention that Intel’s margin outlook is tied to absorbing upfront manufacturing costs, slightly reducing qualitative completeness.

      "original_answer": "AIG adjusts its Return on Common Equity (ROCE) by excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, as well as other fair value fluctuations, to reflect what it considers a more stable measure of underlying profitability. In contrast, JPM reports a Return on Common Equity (ROE) of 17% for 2023 without explicitly adjusting for such unrealized gains and losses, implying that its ROE may be more sensitive to market value changes. Therefore, AIG’s adjusted ROCE may appear more stable compared to JPM’s ROE, which includes the effects of market volatility on its financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in how AIG and JPMorgan Chase treat unrealized gains and losses on available‑for‑sale securities—specifically, AIG’s use of an adjusted book‑value per share and adjusted return on common equity that excludes cumulative unrealized gains/losses related to its Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and deferred tax assets, while JPMorgan reports standard GAAP ROCE based on net income—creates a material divergence in the metrics used to calculate ROCE. Consequently, AIG’s adjusted ROCE is not directly comparable to JPMorgan’s GAAP ROCE, as AIG’s measure removes fluctuations from fair‑value changes that JPMorgan includes in its reported earnings. This asymmetry means that ROCE comparisons between the two firms are distorted by the differing treatment of these unrealized gains and losses.",

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing accounting treatments across two firms and explaining how differing inclusion/exclusion of fair value changes impacts comparability of ROCE.

Additionally, the combined impact in the ground truth is 11.8 percentage points (11 + 0.8), but the LLM claims a combined effect of 'roughly 15%' on operating-income growth decline, which is factually incorrect and not aligned with the source.

      "original_answer": "The rising interest rate environment in 2023 positively impacted AIG's fixed and fixed index annuity sales due to a strong partnership with Blackstone, although it also led to an increase in surrenders as policyholders sought better returns elsewhere. AIG noted that fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods generally in the five-to-ten-year range, and older contracts with higher minimum interest rates contributed to better-than-expected persistency. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase reported a $15.1 billion noninterest revenue, which included higher commissions on annuity sales in its Banking & Wealth Management segment, driven by the impact of First Republic and strong market levels. This indicates that both companies benefited from the rising rate environment, with AIG experiencing increased annuity sales despite higher surrender risks, and JPM seeing higher annuity-related fee income.",
      "llm_answer": "The rising interest rate environment in 2023 boosted yields on new investments and narrowed spreads for AIG’s Life and Retirement business, making fixed and fixed-index annuities more attractive to customers; however, it also drove higher surrender activity as policyholders responded to better crediting rates and older contracts with higher minimum rates began exiting their surrender charge periods.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect. (1) Quantitative Accuracy: The combined total is grossly miscalculated. The LLM states $2,430,113 million (i.e., ~$2.4 quadrillion), which is nonsensical and orders of magnitude off from the correct value of $4,649,312,000 (~$4.65 billion). It incorrectly reports NFLX's current liability as $2,425,847 million (~$2.4 trillion) instead of $383.3 million, and VZ's as $4,266 million ($4.266 billion) — only VZ's figure is approximately correct in magnitude but misrepresented in context. (2) The calculation of the combined total is mathematically wrong and based on incorrect inputs. (3) Qualitative Accuracy: The LLM falsely claims that the current liabilities represent 100% of each company's total lease obligations, which contradicts the ground truth showing NFLX's current portion is 15.8% of $2,430.1M and VZ's is 17.7% of $44.7B. It fails to recognize that 'current' is a subset of 'total' operating lease liabilities. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is completely flawed: it did not correctly identify or differentiate between current and total lease liabilities for either company, nor did it compute the correct percentages. (5) Contextual Relevance: While the answer attempts to address the question structure, the factual foundation is so erroneous that the response is misleading. Only the mention of December 31, 2023, and the correct company tickers (NFLX, VZ) provide minimal relevance.",

      "question": "What is the total amount of cash returned to shareholders by both Accenture and Microsoft in fiscal year 2022, and how does this reflect their respective capital allocation strategies?",
      "original_answer": "The total cash returned to shareholders by both Accenture and Microsoft in fiscal year 2022 is $19.0 billion. Accenture returned $6.6 billion through share purchases of $4.1 billion and dividends of $2.5 billion, while Microsoft returned $12.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone through share repurchases and dividends. This reflects Accenture’s balanced approach to capital allocation between dividends and share buybacks, and Microsoft’s more concentrated return in the final quarter, suggesting a potentially more aggressive repurchase strategy or timing decision.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, the total cash returned to shareholders by Accenture and Microsoft in fiscal 2022 was $6.6 billion for Accenture (comprising $4.1 billion in share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividends) and $12.4 billion for Microsoft (comprising $9.8 billion in share repurchases and $2.6 billion in dividends). This reflects Accenture's capital allocation strategy of prioritizing share repurchases ($4.1 billion) alongside dividends ($2.5 billion), while Microsoft's strategy emphasized significantly larger share repurchases ($9.8 billion) with a smaller dividend payout ($2.6 billion), demonstrating a stronger emphasis on equity reduction through buybacks relative to dividend distributions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key financial figures: Accenture returned $6.6 billion ($4.1B repurchases + $2.5B dividends), and Microsoft returned $12.4 billion ($9.8B repurchases + $2.6B dividends). These match the ground truth in total and components. The combined total of $19.0 billion is implied (6.6 + 12.4 = 19.0), though not explicitly stated, which is a minor omission but not factually incorrect. (2) All numbers are quantitatively accurate. The Microsoft return is correctly broken into $9.8B and $2.6B, summing to $12.4B, and Accenture’s $4.1B + $2.5B = $6.6B. The ground truth mentions Microsoft’s $12.4B was returned in Q4 alone, which the LLM omits, but this detail is contextual and not critical to the total or strategy assessment. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is correctly synthesized across two companies and their respective capital actions. The LLM accurately contrasts Accenture’s balanced approach with Microsoft’s heavier emphasis on buybacks, which aligns with the ground truth’s interpretation. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the total returns and the strategic implications. The only minor shortcoming is not explicitly stating the combined $19.0B total, though it is easily inferred. This justifies a high score but not perfect, as the question asks for the total amount, which should be clearly stated.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of the basic earnings per common share (EPS) amounts disclosed by AIG and American Express for the year ended December 31, 2024, is $12.32.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the basic EPS amounts for AIG and American Express for the year ended December 31, 2024, are disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Note 21). For AIG, the Basic EPS is $14.04, and for American Express (AXP), the Basic EPS is $14.04 (as shown in the same table on page page_100, where the \"Basic\" column lists $14.04 for 2024). The combined total is $14.04 + $14.04 = $28.08. However, the question specifically asks for the combined total of the basic EPS amounts disclosed by AIG and American Express. The document confirms that AIG's Basic EPS is $14.04 (page page_100, row \"Basic\" under \"Earnings per Common Share\"), and American Express (AXP) is referenced in the context of the same table, where its Basic EPS is also $14.04 (as the table lists \"Basic\" for the year 2024 as $14.04, which applies to both entities as per the standard EPS disclosure format in the 10-K).

The ground truth states the combined total EPS is $12.32, but the LLM calculates $28.08 by summing $14.04 for both AIG and American Express. This is wrong because both companies cannot have the same EPS value of $14.04 as per the actual data in the knowledge graph. (2) The quantitative error is severe: the individual EPS values are incorrect, and the sum is therefore also wrong. The correct combined total is $12.32, implying the individual values must be different (e.g., one might be $6.00 and the other $6.32, or similar). The LLM incorrectly assumes both are $14.04 based on a misreading of a table, possibly conflating the two companies' data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have retrieved distinct EPS figures for AIG and American Express from their respective filings or a comparative table, but instead treats them as having identical values without justification. It also references 'page_100' and a Note 21, but fabricates or misinterprets the source, as the correct data does not support its claim. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right metric (basic EPS), time period (December 31, 2024), and companies (AIG and American Express), but the factual and calculation errors render the answer highly inaccurate.

According to the ground truth, General Dynamics spent $1,501 million on share repurchases in 2024, but the LLM claims no repurchase activity was disclosed, which contradicts the known data. Emerson's repurchase amount ($435 million) is correctly stated, but its operating cash flow is reported as $3.3 billion by the LLM, whereas the ground truth is $4,350 million ($4.35 billion), making the LLM's figure incorrect. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the total repurchase amount should be $1,936 million, but the LLM fails to include General Dynamics' $1,501 million, leading to a major undercount. Additionally, the operating cash flows are misrepresented—Emerson’s is understated and General Dynamics’ is given as $3.317 billion instead of $4,112 million ($4.112 billion). These errors invalidate any derived percentages or comparisons. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to synthesize the correct data for both companies across the required metrics (repurchases and operating cash flow), and incorrectly concludes that General Dynamics did not disclose repurchases when it should have retrieved that information. The comparison to operating cash flow (e.g., 10% and 36.4%) is entirely missing due to incorrect inputs. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses the right companies and the general topic of share repurchases and operating cash flow, but due to major factual and numerical errors, the conclusion does not align with the ground truth.

Additionally, the LLM incorrectly reports individual Federal tax provisions of $4,892 million for VZ and $2,504 million for NFLX, which are not supported by the ground truth. (2) The calculation of the combined total ($4,892 + $2,504 = $7,396) is arithmetically correct, but based on false inputs. The claim that the combined Federal tax provision equals the total income tax provision is contradicted by the ground truth, which states that Federal provisions represent only 42.3% (NFLX) and 67.2% (VZ) of their respective total income tax provisions—meaning other components (e.g., state/local taxes) exist. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model fails to correctly extract and synthesize Federal vs. total income tax data for both companies, and incorrectly assumes equivalence between Federal and total income tax provisions.

It also incorrectly assigns the same $3,819 million value to both Emerson and FedEx, while the correct values are $3,231 million (EMR) and $3,819 million (FDX). The calculated total of $7,638 million is therefore incorrect; the correct combined total is $7,050 million. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM computes $3,819 + $3,819 = $7,638, which is mathematically correct but based on wrong inputs. The correct sum is $3,231 + $3,819 = $7,050 million. The comparison to Emerson's standalone earnings is also wrong because it uses $3,819 million instead of $3,231 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present— the model attempts to combine earnings from two companies and compare the sum to one—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Emerson. This suggests a failure in entity-metric mapping (assigning FedEx's number to Emerson).

The LLM assigns a precise number to AT&T that is not present in the original answer and fabricates a number for Google that does not match the disclosed amount. (2) Quantitatively, both numbers are wrong: the $857 million for Google has no basis in the ground truth, and attributing $731 million to AT&T is incorrect. The ground truth explicitly states that AT&T's amount is indeterminate. Even the sum or any derived total would be invalid due to these misassignments. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The model fails to correctly synthesize information across the two companies' disclosures. It incorrectly attributes specific figures to both entities when only one (Google) provides a clear number.

      "original_answer": "The difference between Medtronic's and Pfizer's Non-GAAP Adjusted Effective Tax Rates for fiscal year 2023 is 4.8 percentage points (13.8% - 9.0% = 4.8%). For Medtronic, the most significant non-GAAP adjustments contributing to this rate included amortization of intangible assets (15.0%), restructuring and associated costs (21.5%), and certain tax adjustments, net (-910 million). For Pfizer, the effective tax rate for non-GAAP Adjusted income was 9.0% in 2023, significantly influenced by restructuring and acquisition-related items totaling $1.2 billion, including $785 million of integration costs, $190 million of transaction costs, and $125 million of employee termination-related charges.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, Medtronic's Non-GAAP Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for fiscal year 2023 was 13.8% (as shown on page 34, Non-GAAP column), while Pfizer's Non-GAAP Adjusted Effective Tax Rate for fiscal year 2023 was 16.0% (as shown on page 33, Non-GAAP column). The divergence of 2.2 percentage points was primarily driven by Medtronic's significant non-GAAP adjustments related to restructuring costs (21.5% effective tax rate impact) and acquisition/divestiture-related items (8.4% effective tax rate impact), which collectively reduced its tax rate more substantially than Pfizer's adjustments. Pfizer's adjustments did not include comparable large-scale restructuring or acquisition-related tax impacts that would significantly lower its effective tax rate.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key numbers. It incorrectly states Pfizer's Non-GAAP Adjusted Effective Tax Rate as 16.0%, while the ground truth is 9.0%. This leads to a completely wrong difference of 2.2 percentage points (13.8% - 16.0% = -2.2%, but reported as 2.2%), whereas the correct difference is 4.8 percentage points (13.8% - 9.0% = 4.8%). This is a critical quantitative error. (2) The LLM misrepresents Pfizer's tax rate and fails to report the correct non-GAAP adjustments for Pfizer, which in reality include $1.2 billion in restructuring and acquisition-related items (with specific breakdowns: $785M integration, $190M transaction, $125M termination costs). Instead, it claims Pfizer had no significant adjustments, which contradicts the ground truth. (3) For Medtronic, the LLM correctly identifies restructuring costs (21.5%) and mentions acquisition/divestiture-related items (though cites 8.4% impact not in the original), but omits the amortization of intangible assets (15.0%) and the $910 million tax adjustment, which are key components in the original answer. (4) The reasoning is partially sound in attempting multi-hop comparison between two companies' tax rates and adjustments, but due to incorrect data, the synthesis is flawed. The conclusion about the divergence being due to Medtronic's larger adjustments is directionally plausible but based on incorrect premises. (5) Contextually, the answer addresses the right question structure—difference in tax rates and contributing adjustments—but fails on factual accuracy, especially on Pfizer's side. The citation of page numbers (e.g., 'page 34', 'page 33') appears fabricated, as no source documents were provided in the query. Overall, the answer is mostly incorrect due to wrong core numbers and missing/correct adjustments, warranting a low correctness score.",

      "question": "How do McDonald's and Starbucks each incorporate occupancy costs into their respective financial structures, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to managing leased properties?",
      "original_answer": "McDonald's incorporates occupancy costs primarily through its lessee role in a significant real estate portfolio, where it often owns the building but leases the land. These occupancy costs, such as property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance, are generally paid by franchisees for franchised locations, which make up the majority of McDonald's restaurants. This indicates a strategy where the financial burden of occupancy costs is largely shifted to franchisees, allowing McDonald's to maintain a more asset-light model. In contrast, Starbucks directly incorporates occupancy costs into its store operating expenses for company-operated locations, reflecting a more direct financial responsibility for these costs. This reveals that McDonald's leverages its franchise model to outsource occupancy-related financial obligations, while Starbucks assumes these costs as part of its operational expenditures, highlighting a more vertically integrated approach to property management.",
      "llm_answer": "McDonald's and Starbucks both incorporate occupancy costs into their financial structures, but with distinct operational and strategic implications. McDonald's explicitly references occupancy costs within its store operating expenses, particularly for company-operated locations, where leasehold improvements, site maintenance, and property-related costs are capitalized and depreciated as part of long-lived assets. In contrast, Starbucks treats occupancy costs—such as rent and related expenses—as part of its store operating expenses but emphasizes the separation between company-operated and franchised locations, where franchisees typically bear occupancy costs under their lease agreements. This divergence reflects McDonald's asset-heavy model of owning or long-term leasing real estate, requiring careful management of leased property value and depreciation, while Starbucks relies more heavily on franchising to offload occupancy responsibilities, focusing its financial reporting on revenue generation and brand licensing rather than property stewardship.",

While it correctly identifies that occupancy costs are part of store operating expenses for company-operated locations, it incorrectly states that McDonald's has an 'asset-heavy model of owning or long-term leasing real estate' and that Starbucks 'relies more heavily on franchising to offload occupancy responsibilities.' In reality, McDonald's owns a vast amount of real estate (often the land and building) and leases to franchisees, making it asset-heavy in property ownership, while Starbucks has a much smaller franchise footprint and directly bears occupancy costs for its company-operated stores. The original answer correctly notes that McDonald's shifts occupancy cost burdens to franchisees, whereas the LLM incorrectly attributes this model to Starbucks. Conversely, the LLM wrongly claims Starbucks 'relies more heavily on franchising,' when in fact only a small fraction of Starbucks stores are franchised, compared to over 90% of McDonald's locations being franchised. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no numbers to verify or calculate, hence a score of 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to correctly synthesize the relationship between franchise model structure and financial responsibility for occupancy costs. It draws the opposite conclusion from the evidence, misattributing McDonald's real estate leverage to Starbucks and misunderstanding the financial implications for each.

      "original_answer": "Emerson (EMR) experienced potential net earnings impacts due to its use of derivatives, particularly when hedges were not fully effective at offsetting changes in underlying hedged items, such as foreign currency exposures and commodity-based manufacturing costs. This lack of perfect offsetting could directly affect earnings volatility. In contrast, FedEx (FDX) reported net earnings allocable to common shares of $3,819 million in fiscal 2022, which reflects the outcome of its overall risk exposure and earnings management strategies, including those that may have influenced earnings per share. The difference in financial outcomes highlights how EMR's derivative-related earnings volatility contrasts with FDX's reported net earnings, which were influenced by both operational performance and share dilution effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s hedging activities, as disclosed in its 10‑K (pages 52‑56), focus on mitigating commodity price exposure (e.g., copper and aluminum) and foreign‑currency risk through designated cash‑flow and fair‑value hedges, with gains/losses deferred in equity or recognized in earnings when the hedge is ineffective. In contrast, FedEx’s fiscal‑2022 net earnings (page 99) reflect a $1.07 billion income‑tax provision and a $1.44 billion total tax expense, driven largely by tax rate changes, valuation allowances, and the impact of the CARES Act carryback, rather than by hedging gains or losses. Thus, Emerson’s risk‑management strategy yields earnings that are insulated from commodity and currency volatility, while FedEx’s earnings are directly affected by tax‑related items and do not stem from hedging outcomes.",

However, the ground truth states that FedEx reported net earnings allocable to common shares of $3,819 million in fiscal 2022—this key figure is entirely missing from the LLM response, and the tax figures cited are not present in the original answer or supported by the knowledge graph. There is no verification that these tax amounts are accurate, and they contradict the focus of the original answer, which emphasized net earnings outcomes, not tax details. (2) The LLM incorrectly frames Emerson’s hedging as successfully insulating earnings from volatility, stating that gains/losses are deferred or recognized only when ineffective. However, the original answer emphasizes that Emerson’s hedges were *not always effective*, leading to potential earnings volatility due to imperfect offsetting—this critical nuance is reversed in the LLM answer, undermining its correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks for a comparison of how risk management strategies led to different financial exposures and outcomes, but the LLM shifts focus to tax items for FedEx, which are not mentioned in the ground truth and appear to be hallucinated or misattributed. The original answer contrasts EMR’s derivative-related earnings volatility with FDX’s net earnings influenced by operational performance and share dilution, not tax effects. (4) While the LLM correctly identifies the types of risks Emerson hedges (commodity prices, foreign currency), it fails to align with the original conclusion about differential earnings impacts. The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses risk management and earnings outcomes, but the qualitative inaccuracies in reasoning and missing core data (e.g., FDX’s $3,819M net earnings) severely limit correctness.

Similarly, Target's revenue per square foot is stated as $466.15 in the original answer, but the LLM fails to compute this despite claiming to have Target's sales ($114,641 million) and square footage (274 million sq ft). A simple division ($114,641M / 274M sq ft) yields ~$418.40, which actually matches Walmart’s figure in the ground truth—indicating a likely mix-up in entities.

The prior year (2023) combined outflow is stated as $3,144 million by the LLM, but the correct value is $3,642 million. The conclusion that there was a 'slight increase' is therefore incorrect — the actual change is a decrease of $1,696 million.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar adjusts residual values for operating leases by prospectively changing depreciation expense on a straight-line basis, while for finance leases, residual value adjustments reduce finance revenue over the remaining lease term. FedEx, on the other hand, evaluates salvage values as part of depreciation for long-lived assets like aircraft, adjusting estimated service lives or residual values based on usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors.

The ground truth specifies that FedEx evaluates salvage values for long-lived assets like aircraft as part of depreciation policy, not specifically in the context of lease types (operating vs. finance leases). The LLM incorrectly frames FedEx’s approach as being applied to 'leases' and tied to lease-type adjustments, which is not supported by the original answer. FedEx’s method relates to owned capital assets, not leased equipment per se. This misattribution undermines the core comparison. (4) The LLM implies both companies apply residual value adjustments within lease accounting frameworks, but the original answer clarifies that FedEx’s approach is broader—pertaining to depreciation of long-lived assets, not lease-specific residual value adjustments.

Conversely, it incorrectly attributes the $179 million outflow to both companies, when in fact only PFE reported $(179) million (outflow). Additionally, the LLM uses an incorrect total net cash used in investing for MDT—$2,366 million instead of the correct $(3,493) million—leading to erroneous proportion calculations. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: the claimed 7.6% for MDT (179/2,366) is based on wrong inputs; the correct proportion for MDT would be $4M / $3,493M ≈ 0.1%, which is negligible. For PFE, the calculation of 0.6% (179/32,278) is numerically accurate but misinterpreted in significance due to incorrect comparison.

Instead, it focuses on point-of-sale recognition, licensing, and deferred revenue, which, while accurate, shifts emphasis away from the net presentation aspect highlighted in the original answer. (4) Despite missing some nuances in both companies’ disclosures, the LLM captures the core contrast: McDonald’s emphasizes growth outcomes, while Starbucks details accounting mechanics.

      "question": "How does the difference in the expected life of stock options between Emerson Electric (EMR) and FedEx (FDX) in 2022 reflect a potential variation in their stock option exercise behaviors, and what impact could this have on the volatility estimation period used in their financial models?",
      "original_answer": "Emerson Electric (EMR) reported an expected life of 5.1 years for its stock options in 2022, while FedEx (FDX) estimated the expected life based on actual exercise history and noted that options have a maximum term of 10 years. Since FDX examines actual exercise behavior to determine expected life and uses a period equal to that expected life for calculating volatility, a longer expected life (up to 10 years) would lead to a longer historical period being used for volatility estimation. In contrast, EMR’s shorter expected life of 5.1 years would result in a shorter historical period being used for volatility, potentially leading to different volatility inputs in their financial models and, consequently, different option valuations.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in expected option life—Emerson’s options exhibit an average remaining life of 2.2 years (as shown on page 73), whereas FedEx’s options have an average remaining life of 6.3 years (page 98)—reflects a more prompt exercise behavior for Emerson’s workforce, likely driven by lower volatility and a shorter post‑grant holding horizon. This shorter life shortens the volatility‑estimation window used in FedEx’s Black‑Scholes model, resulting in a lower implied volatility input and consequently a less volatile option‑pricing environment for FedEx relative to Emerson.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. The ground truth states that Emerson Electric (EMR) reported an expected life of 5.1 years in 2022, but the LLM claims an average remaining life of 2.2 years (citing page 73), which contradicts the correct value. Similarly, FedEx (FDX) is said to have an expected life based on actual exercise history with a maximum term of 10 years, but the LLM incorrectly states a 6.3-year average remaining life (page 98), which is not supported by the original answer. These numbers are both quantitatively and contextually wrong. (2) The calculations or comparisons involving these numbers (e.g., difference in expected life, impact on volatility estimation) are therefore based on false premises. The claim that 'shorter life shortens the volatility-estimation window used in FedEx’s Black-Scholes model' is illogical—FedEx uses a longer expected life, so it would use a longer historical period for volatility, not shorter. The LLM reverses the logic and misattributes the effect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have connected EMR’s fixed 5.1-year assumption to a shorter volatility period versus FDX’s behavior-based, potentially longer (up to 10-year) estimate requiring a longer historical volatility window. Instead, the LLM inverts the comparison and uses incorrect data points labeled as 'average remaining life' rather than 'expected life,' confusing two different metrics. (4) Despite incorrect facts and reasoning, the answer attempts to address the question’s core theme—linking expected life to volatility estimation period—and maintains relevant terminology (e.g., Black-Scholes, volatility input), earning partial credit for contextual relevance. However, due to major factual and logical errors, the correctness score is very low.",

      "original_answer": "Lowe's faces direct labor cost pressures in a competitive U.S. labor market, where it must attract and retain associates with expanded skill sets amid low unemployment and increasing wage rates. This affects its ability to maintain service quality and execute omnichannel strategies, as noted in its 2024 10-K filing. Nike, on the other hand, is exposed to wage rate fluctuations and labor standards in international markets where its contract manufacturers operate. These external wage pressures influence Nike's manufacturing and sourcing costs, as well as its ability to maintain production timelines and cost controls. While both companies face wage-related challenges, Lowe's labor issues are internal and operational, directly affecting its U.S. retail strategy, whereas Nike's are external and supply chain-based, affecting product availability and cost of goods sold. The two companies must strategize differently—Lowe's through workforce development and retention, Nike through supplier management and sourcing diversification.",
      "llm_answer": "Lowe's labor cost pressures stem from a competitive U.S. labor market, rising wages and benefits, high turnover in entry‑level roles, and the need to attract and retain skilled associates and corporate staff to execute its omnichannel and supply‑chain initiatives; these external wage pressures force Lowe's to manage labor expenses tightly while investing in training and technology to sustain its retail strategy. In contrast, Nike's overseas manufacturing wage dynamics are shaped by foreign labor standards, geopolitical trade policies, and tariff‑related cost fluctuations that affect its global supply chain and product cost structure, compelling Nike to focus on sourcing strategies, supplier compliance, and diversification to mitigate wage‑driven cost changes and protect its global retail positioning.",

Nike's exposure is accurately described as stemming from overseas manufacturing wage dynamics, including foreign labor standards and supply chain cost structures. The distinction between Lowe's internal, operational labor challenges and Nike's external, supply chain-based pressures is clearly and correctly drawn. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either answer that require verification; thus, quantitative accuracy is not applicable but assumed correct as no numbers were introduced or misstated.

The LLM adds useful context (e.g., geopolitical trade policies, tariffs) not in the original but plausibly aligned with Nike’s 10-K disclosures and does not contradict the ground truth.

In contrast, American Express continues to recognize interest income on loans held for sale until they are sold, as reflected in its calculation of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.

In contrast, American Express (AXP) explicitly recognizes interest income on loans held for sale, as evidenced by its financial tables showing \"Interest income\" and \"Net interest income\" for its CardMember loan portfolio, including loans held for sale, which it continues to recognize until the loans are sold.

For LMT, the correct 2021 amount is $1,787 million (correctly cited by LLM), but the 2020 amount is $440 million (LLM says $908 million), which is wrong. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on incorrect inputs: LLM computes $1,787M + $1,310M = $3,097M (math correct, numbers wrong); ground truth is $1,787M + $723M = $2,510M. For 2020, LLM computes $908M + $440M = $1,348M, but correct total is $440M + (-$233M) = $207M (LLM says $1,348M). The comparison between years is therefore completely inaccurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model must retrieve and correctly synthesize data from two companies across two years.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several inaccuracies compared to the ground truth. While it correctly identifies that online sales had a positive impact on LOW's comparable sales, it fails to specify the exact contribution of 50 basis points as stated in the original answer. Instead, it vaguely notes that online sales contributed positively while overall comparable sales declined 2.7%, which is not part of the ground truth and introduces unverified data. For NKE, the LLM claims digital sales declined 5% (or 8% in North America), but the original answer specifies an 8% decline in digital sales overall (without regional qualification), so the 5% figure is unsupported. The resulting performance difference of 58 basis points between LOW and NKE — a critical quantitative conclusion in the ground truth — is entirely missing. (2) The calculation of a 58 basis point difference (50 bps positive vs 80 bps negative, net 130 bps spread, but interpreted in context as a 58 bps performance gap in contribution) is not reflected or computed in the LLM response. The introduction of a 2.7% decline in comparable sales for both companies is extraneous and not present in the original answer, potentially confusing correlation with causation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model attempts to contrast digital sales impact between LOW and NKE, but it fails to synthesize the precise numeric contributions required. It does not compute or reference the key differential metric (58 bps) that results from comparing LOW’s +50 bps online boost to NKE’s -8% (equivalent to -80 bps) digital decline. This missing synthesis undermines the core of the question. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, time period (fiscal 2024), and topic (digital sales impact on comparable sales). However, due to significant quantitative inaccuracies and omission of the key comparative metric, the correctness score is low. The answer provides qualitative contrast but lacks the precise financial metrics and calculation that define the ground truth.",

TGT operated 245,939 million square feet as of February 3, 2024, while WMT reported 699 million square feet as of January 31, 2024. This large disparity indicates that WMT maintains a significantly larger retail footprint, but TGT has increased its retail square feet slightly from 244,584 million to 245,939 million, whereas WMT has reduced its retail square feet from 702 million in the prior year to 699 million, suggesting contrasting strategies in store expansion or contraction.",

This results in a disparity of approximately 244,886 thousand square feet, with Walmart operating significantly more physical retail space. The difference reflects Walmart's strategy of maintaining and expanding a larger store footprint to support its extensive domestic and international operations, whereas Target's approach appears more focused on optimizing existing space and channeling growth through digital integration and targeted store investments rather than physical expansion.",

It reports TGT's retail square footage as 245,939 thousand square feet (i.e., 245.939 million), but the ground truth is 245,939 million square feet—off by a factor of 1,000. Similarly, it states WMT has 1,053 thousand square feet (1.053 million), whereas the correct value is 699 million, making the LLM's figure far too low. The calculated difference of 244,886 thousand square feet (~244.9 million) is therefore completely incorrect; the true difference is 453,061 million square feet. (2) The calculation is invalid due to wrong inputs. The LLM computes a difference of ~244.9 million square feet, but the correct difference is 453,061 million—over 1,800 times larger. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states WMT has more space than TGT, when in fact the ground truth shows TGT has vastly more (245,939 million vs. 699 million). This suggests a critical unit confusion—likely misreading 'million' as 'thousand'. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the LLM draws conclusions opposite to the ground truth. It claims WMT has a much larger footprint and is expanding, but the truth is WMT reduced from 702 million to 699 million, while TGT increased slightly. The LLM’s strategic interpretation is thus based on false premises.

In contrast, NVIDIA discloses that it amortizes completed IPR&D assets over periods ranging from one to twenty years, using a method that reflects the pattern of economic benefits unless that pattern cannot be reliably determined, in which case a straight-line method is used.

However, the key differentiator asked in the question—how they differ in determining amortization periods—is not adequately addressed. The original answer highlights that Cisco does not specify a defined range and only refers to the 'estimated useful life,' while NVIDIA explicitly discloses amortization over a range of one to twenty years and specifies the use of an economic benefits method (or straight-line if not determinable). The LLM answer fails to mention NVIDIA's specific 1–20 year range or its disclosed amortization method, which is a critical omission. It incorrectly implies the two companies have the 'same approach' when in fact their disclosures differ significantly in specificity. While the entities (Cisco, NVIDIA), context (2022 10-Ks), and high-level accounting treatment are correct, the lack of detailed comparative disclosure—especially the missing quantitative range (1–20 years) and methodological detail from NVIDIA—results in a partially correct response.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Disney's DTC offerings are negatively impacted by declines in traditional content distribution models, which affect the cost of content allocable to its DTC services, thereby reducing profitability. This is explicitly stated in Disney's 10-K, which notes that declines in traditional forms of distribution have led to higher costs being allocated to DTC offerings. Meanwhile, Meta's advertising business is affected by changes in feed display and ranking algorithms that reduce time spent and user engagement, which in turn lowers advertising effectiveness and revenue. The 10-K explicitly states that these algorithmic changes have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the distribution of content by publishers and marketers, lowering their incentive to invest in Meta's platform. Both companies report that these content distribution challenges directly affect their financial performance: Disney through increased costs and reduced profitability in its DTC segment, and Meta through lower ad targeting capabilities and reduced engagement metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, Disney’s DTC offerings faced profitability pressures because the company must invest heavily in content curation, technology upgrades, and marketing while forgoing traditional revenue streams such as affiliate fees and licensing; the 10‑K explicitly links these costs to “impairment charges” and “reduced revenue from traditional sources” that directly depress DTC margins. Meta’s advertising business is similarly constrained by content‑distribution hurdles: the filing notes that changes to mobile operating systems, browser privacy policies, and third‑party platform rules “limit our ability to target and measure ads,” which “adversely affect monetization” and therefore the profitability of its ad‑driven revenue model.

(1) For Disney, the LLM correctly identifies that DTC profitability is under pressure and references reduced traditional revenue and impairment charges, which are mentioned in the 10-K. However, it misrepresents the core mechanism: the ground truth specifies that declines in traditional distribution lead to higher content costs being allocated to DTC (due to reduced affiliate fee base), thereby reducing profitability. The LLM instead emphasizes forgone revenue and investment in tech/marketing, which, while contextually relevant, is not the specific allocation mechanism explicitly described in the filing. (2) For Meta, the LLM cites mobile OS changes, browser privacy, and third-party rules affecting ad targeting—this is factually accurate and present in Meta’s 10-K. However, it omits the specific content distribution challenge highlighted in the ground truth: algorithmic changes to feed ranking that reduce content distribution by publishers, lowering engagement and advertiser incentive. This is a significant omission, as the question asks for mechanisms explicitly described in the 10-K linking content distribution to financial performance. The LLM focuses on targeting/measurement issues (more related to privacy changes) rather than reduced organic reach due to algorithmic feed changes. (3) Quantitatively, there are no numbers, dates, or calculations in either answer, so no inaccuracies exist—score is 10. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and addresses both companies and their financial models.

This indicates a significant decline in the tax benefit associated with retiree obligations. Meanwhile, LMT explicitly states that retiree benefits are excluded from business segment operating profit because they are not considered part of management's evaluation of segment performance.

However, the LLM claims the asset 'increased by $1.7 billion' due to a 'non-cash pension settlement charge,' which is factually incorrect and contradicts the actual direction and magnitude of change. This error fundamentally misrepresents UNP's financial position. (2) The calculation and numbers are entirely wrong: instead of a $216 million decrease, the model reports a $1.7 billion increase—off by nearly $1.9 billion in magnitude and opposite in direction. No such figure appears in the ground truth, and there is no mention of a non-cash pension settlement charge. (3) On qualitative reasoning, the LLM correctly identifies that LMT excludes retiree benefits from segment operating profit and attributes this to management's performance evaluation, aligning with the ground truth. It also correctly contrasts UNP’s inclusion of retiree benefits in its tax accounting with LMT’s exclusion at the segment level.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies both key financial figures: Gilead's $0.9 billion liability for future royalties and Eli Lilly's $924.7 million purchase price for the manufacturing facility. These values match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting variations ($0.9 billion = $900 million). (2) The quantitative comparison is accurate—Gilead's commitment is indeed $75.3 million higher than Lilly's ($900M - $924.7M = -$24.7M? Wait: correction—$900M - $924.7M = -$24.7M would imply Lilly paid more, but ground truth claims Gilead’s is higher by $75.3M. This reveals a critical error in the ground truth logic: $900M - $924.7M = -$24.7M, meaning Lilly actually paid more by $24.7M, not the other way around. Therefore, the ground truth contains a calculation error. The LLM avoids making a numerical comparison and instead states the amounts are 'roughly comparable,' which is factually sound and more accurate than the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is solid: the LLM synthesizes data across two companies (Gilead and Eli Lilly), two different types of transactions (royalty liability vs. asset acquisition), and correctly contextualizes them as significant 2024 financial commitments. However, it attributes both investments to Gilead ('investments made by Gilead in 2024'), which is incorrect—Eli Lilly's acquisition is separate. This is a material entity attribution error. (4) Despite this, the core financial data is correct, and the conclusion about comparable scale is reasonable. The correctness score is 8 due to the misattribution of Lilly's acquisition to Gilead, but quantitative accuracy is 10 because all numbers are correct and the LLM avoids propagating the ground truth’s calculation mistake.",

      "question": "How does the difference in the treatment of pension expenses under FAS and CAS standards impact the FAS/CAS operating adjustment amounts reported by LMT and RTX, and what does this imply about their respective U.S. government contract cost recovery mechanisms?",
      "original_answer": "The difference in pension expense treatment under FAS and CAS standards leads to a divergence in cost recognition patterns between financial reporting and government contract pricing. LMT reports a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million in 2021, which reflects the difference between CAS expenses (used in pricing contracts) and FAS service costs (used in GAAP financial reporting). RTX explains that CAS pension expense includes service cost and amortization of demographic or economic variances, and is only recognized for unfunded plans, whereas FAS pension expense includes service cost and is generally recognized for all plans. This implies that both companies must reconcile these differences to recover pension costs through U.S. government contracts, with RTX noting that changes in plan funding status can directly affect CAS expense and thus the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in pension expense treatment under FAS (GAAP) versus CAS (U.S. government cost accounting) creates a material “FAS/CAS operating adjustment” that LMT and RTX report in their segment results.  In both companies the adjustment is a large, non‑cash reconciling item—$1.96 billion for LMT and $1.88 billion for RTX in 2021—driven by higher CAS pension expense than the service‑cost component of FAS, and it is this adjustment that is added back to segment operating profit to arrive at consolidated operating profit.  Because CAS pension costs are recoverable through the pricing of U.S. government contracts, the adjustment reflects the portion of pension expense that can be passed on to the government, while the residual (the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment) is ultimately borne by the company and therefore impacts the amount of cost recovery it can claim on its contracts.  Consequently, the size of the adjustment signals how much of their pension‑related costs each contractor can recoup from U.S. government contract pricing, with larger adjustments indicating a greater reliance on contract cost‑recovery mechanisms to offset pension liabilities.",

It accurately notes that CAS pension costs are recoverable through U.S. government contracts and that the adjustment reflects cost recovery mechanisms. However, there is a critical quantitative inaccuracy: the ground truth states that LMT's 2021 FAS/CAS operating adjustment is $1,960 million, which the LLM correctly reports as $1.96 billion. But the LLM claims RTX's adjustment is $1.88 billion in 2021—this figure is not present in the original answer, which does not provide any specific dollar amount for RTX. This is a significant factual overreach. 2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the unsupported RTX figure. While $1.96 billion for LMT is correct (equivalent to $1,960 million), the RTX number is fabricated or misattributed, as the ground truth does not specify an amount. No calculation is possible without source data, but the inclusion of a precise but unverified figure reduces trustworthiness. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes the implications of differing FAS vs. CAS rules, links them to cost recovery in government contracts, and infers that the size of the adjustment reflects reliance on such recovery. It also correctly identifies that CAS includes amortization of variances and is tied to unfunded plans, though this detail is more explicitly stated in the original for RTX. 4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the impact on FAS/CAS adjustments and the implication for cost recovery. Despite the incorrect RTX number, the conceptual framework is sound and semantically aligned with the ground truth. The score is reduced primarily due to the unsupported quantitative claim.",

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) experienced structural refranchising activities in Asia Pacific during 2024, including the refranchising of bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023, and in territories in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines in early 2024. These refranchisings were included as structural changes in the analysis of net operating revenues and impacted the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. KO distinguishes between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume, noting that structural changes typically do not affect consolidated unit case volume, which reflects all sales of Company beverage products regardless of ownership interest in the bottling partner. In contrast, Altria (MO) incorporates volume growth rates as a key assumption in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the NJOY transaction, particularly for future growth opportunities in the e-vapor category. MO used an income approach with Level 3 fair value inputs, including discounted cash flow analyses based on volume growth projections and operating margins, and amortizes these intangible assets over approximately 18 years. This reflects a forward-looking financial valuation approach, whereas KO’s use of volume growth is operational and tied to current structural changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca‑Cola’s 2024 structural refranchising in Asia Pacific reduced the volume of unit cases sold by its bottling partners, contributing to a modest 1 % rise in consolidated unit‑case volume after accounting for those refranchises. In contrast, Altria incorporates volume‑growth assumptions into the fair‑value measurement of acquired intangible assets (e.g., the e‑vapor brands from the NJOY purchase), where higher projected volume growth directly increases the valuation of those assets.",

      "contextual_relevance": 8,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding Coca-Cola's unit case volume impact. The claim that refranchising 'reduced the volume of unit cases sold' and led to a 'modest 1% rise in consolidated unit-case volume' is not supported by the ground truth. The original answer explicitly states that structural changes like refranchising do not affect consolidated unit case volume, which reflects all sales regardless of ownership changes. This is a major error in both quantitative and conceptual understanding. Additionally, no 1% figure appears in the ground truth, making this a fabricated statistic. (2) The dates of refranchising are partially correct—Vietnam in January 2023 and India, Bangladesh, Philippines in early 2024—but the LLM incorrectly frames these as occurring in 2024 only, omitting the 2023 Vietnam refranchising. Altria’s use of volume growth in intangible asset valuation via discounted cash flows and Level 3 inputs is correctly identified in spirit, though the LLM omits key details like the 18-year amortization period and the specific use of an income approach. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts KO’s operational use of volume data with MO’s forward-looking valuation use. However, it fails to accurately represent KO’s structural refranchising impact due to the incorrect assertion about unit case volume, undermining the comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both companies and the core contrast between operational volume impact and financial valuation assumptions. However, due to the critical error in representing Coca-Cola’s volume metrics and the invention of a 1% growth figure, the correctness score is limited to 5. The qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct framing of Altria’s approach, while quantitative accuracy is low due to the unsupported percentage and misstated timeline.",

      "original_answer": "Disney faces potential monetary fines from FCC violations related to its television broadcasting operations, which include the licensing of stations that must be renewed every up to eight years. Non-renewal or revocation of these licenses due to violations could result in significant financial penalties and operational disruptions. Meta, on the other hand, is subject to substantial monetary remedies from non-compliance with its FTC consent order and other global privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. The FTC has already initiated proceedings seeking significant modifications to the consent order, including restrictions on data usage and potential board changes, which could lead to costly compliance adjustments and monetary penalties. While both companies face exposure to regulatory fines, Meta's liabilities appear broader and more complex due to the global nature of its regulatory obligations and the potential for sweeping operational changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney’s FCC‑related exposure is limited to the risks of owning and renewing broadcast licenses—primarily fines, license non‑renewal or restrictions on ownership that could curtail its eight TV stations and related carriage agreements.  By contrast, Meta’s regulatory liabilities stem from multiple ongoing FTC enforcement actions, a pending consent‑order that imposes sweeping privacy and data‑use restrictions, and a suite of U.S. state and EU privacy laws (CCPA/CPRA, GDPR, DMA, DSA, etc.) that can trigger substantial fines, mandatory business‑practice changes, and costly compliance programs across its global platform.

(4) The LLM enhances the original slightly by naming additional regulations (DMA, DSA, CPRA), which are contextually appropriate and reflect Meta’s broader compliance landscape, without introducing inaccuracies. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the explicit mention of the FTC seeking board changes or modifications to the consent order—mentioned in the original—which would strengthen the parallel to Disney’s operational risks.

General Motors' forfeited units had a weighted-average grant date fair value of $36.55 per unit, while Lowe's forfeited units had an average grant-date fair value of $205.94 per unit.

The lower average grant‑date fair value of GM’s forfeited units ($36.55 vs. Lowe’s $175.74) reflects a more aggressive equity‑compensation strategy that emphasizes larger stock‑based awards with higher perceived value, whereas Lowe’s strategy relies on fewer, lower‑valued awards, resulting in a smaller average fair‑value per forfeited unit.",

For General Motors, the LLM reports $99.3 million in forfeited value (vs. ground truth $98.685 million), which is close but not exact; however, it incorrectly calculates this as 2.7 million units × $36.55, while the ground truth does not provide unit counts, so this breakdown is speculative. More critically, for Lowe's, the LLM reports $12.1 million in forfeited value (vs. ground truth $10.708 million) and a grant-date fair value of $175.74 (vs. truth of $205.94), both of which are materially off. (2) Calculations are inconsistent: the LLM implies 69 thousand units for Lowe’s (12.1M / 175.74 ≈ 68.8K), but this unit count is not in the ground truth and appears fabricated. The correct average fair value for Lowe’s is $205.94, not $175.74, making the LLM’s figure a significant error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly interprets lower per-unit fair value as indicating a 'more aggressive' equity strategy for GM, when in fact the data shows Lowe’s has a much higher per-unit value, suggesting more valuable awards. The LLM reverses the comparison and draws an illogical conclusion. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the required companies and fiscal year and attempts to compare equity strategies—but due to incorrect numbers and reversed logic, the qualitative analysis is misleading.

It states RTX's adjustment was $1,106 million, but the correct value is $1,796 million. These numbers are not only wrong but misattributed—$1,796 million is actually RTX's correct value, not LMT's.

      "question": "How do the civil monetary penalties mentioned in Gilead Sciences' (GILD) and Eli Lilly's (LLY) 2024 10-K filings differently impact their respective financial and regulatory risk profiles, and what specific regulatory actions or legislative provisions contribute to these impacts?",
      "original_answer": "Gilead Sciences (GILD) faces civil monetary penalties due to potential non-compliance with FDA regulations, particularly in manufacturing and post-approval requirements, which could lead to product recalls, suspension of approvals, and reputational damage. These penalties are tied to operational risks such as product quality failures and remediation costs. In contrast, Eli Lilly (LLY) faces civil monetary penalties stemming from non-compliance with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly its new manufacturer discount program under Medicare Part D, which begins in 2025. The IRA-mandated penalties could significantly affect LLY’s revenue, especially for products like Jardiance, which is subject to a 66% discount under the government price-setting mechanism starting in 2026. While both companies face civil monetary penalties, GILD’s exposure is rooted in regulatory compliance and product safety, whereas LLY’s is tied to legislative reforms impacting pricing and reimbursement, with direct financial consequences from mandated discounts and rebate obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "The civil monetary penalties referenced in Gilead’s 10‑K (pages 22‑26) are tied to violations of FDA regulations—particularly post‑approval safety reporting, manufacturing compliance, and anti‑counterfeiting enforcement—while Eli Lilly’s penalties (pages 43‑47) stem from breaches of EU pricing and reimbursement rules, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s Medicare price‑setting provisions and related 340B‑program compliance. Both companies face heightened financial risk, but Gilead’s exposure is driven by U.S. regulatory enforcement of product safety and supply‑chain integrity, whereas Lilly’s is shaped by evolving U.S. and EU drug‑pricing legislation and related tax‑related penalties.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains partially correct information but includes significant inaccuracies that affect the overall correctness. (1) It correctly identifies Gilead Sciences' (GILD) civil monetary penalties as tied to FDA regulations, including post-approval reporting and manufacturing compliance, which aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on product safety and regulatory compliance risks. However, it incorrectly states that Eli Lilly’s (LLY) penalties stem from 'EU pricing and reimbursement rules'—the original answer and actual 10-K filings confirm these penalties are related to U.S. legislation, specifically the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), not EU regulations. This is a major factual error in entity and regulatory context. (2) The LLM mentions the 340B program and 'tax-related penalties' without support in the ground truth, which specifies that LLY’s exposure is due to the IRA’s manufacturer discount program under Medicare Part D starting in 2025, with a 66% discount for drugs like Jardiance beginning in 2026—this specific quantitative detail is missing in the LLM response. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in contrasting GILD’s operational/regulatory risks with LLY’s legislative/financial risks, but the synthesis fails due to the incorrect attribution of EU regulations. (4) While the general structure and intent of the answer are relevant and address the comparative risk profiles, the inclusion of non-existent EU-related penalties and omission of key details like the 66% discount and 2026 timeline reduce factual accuracy. Number format is not an issue, but critical quantitative and qualitative elements are missing or incorrect, leading to a mid-range score.",

      "question": "Considering the impact of increased energy costs on both Coca-Cola (KO) and Walmart (WMT) in 2024, and given that KO reported intensified inflation affecting its operations and WMT noted increased costs of electricity and petroleum products, by how much would the combined inflation-adjusted energy cost increase for both companies be if KO experienced a 12% rise in energy costs on a $2.5 billion energy budget and WMT saw a 9% increase on a $3 billion energy expenditure?",
      "original_answer": "The combined inflation-adjusted energy cost increase for Coca-Cola and Walmart in 2024 would be $570 million. KO’s energy cost increase would be $300 million (12% of $2.5 billion), and WMT’s increase would be $270 million (9% of $3 billion), totaling $570 million.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined inflation‑adjusted energy cost increase would be roughly $345 million, calculated as a $300 million rise for Coca‑Cola (12 % of its $2.5 billion energy budget) plus a $45 million rise for Walmart (9 % of its $3 billion energy expenditure).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical calculation error in Walmart's energy cost increase. It states a $45 million rise for Walmart (9% of $3 billion), but 9% of $3 billion is $270 million, not $45 million. Coca-Cola's calculation is correct: 12% of $2.5 billion = $300 million. The combined total is therefore incorrectly reported as $345 million instead of the correct $570 million. (2) Numeric values: KO's $300 million increase is accurate; WMT's $45 million is wrong (should be $270 million); total $345 million is incorrect (should be $570 million). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies both companies, their energy budgets, and the percentage increases, and attempts to sum the impacts—this shows sound reasoning structure—but fails in arithmetic execution. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness penalized heavily due to major quantitative error despite correct setup; Quantitative Accuracy low due to incorrect calculation; Qualitative Accuracy moderate because logic and entity identification are correct; Contextual Relevance high because the answer addresses the right companies, metrics, and intent of the question.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect in its quantitative claim. The ground truth states that Cisco's increase in revenue from contracts with customers was $1,100 million in fiscal year 2022. However, the LLM claims a $5,753 million increase, calculated as $6,944 million – $1,191 million. These component numbers do not align with the ground truth and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. There is no support for these figures in the original answer, making the calculation entirely inaccurate. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies that Broadcom (AVGO) adopted ASU 2021-08 related to contract assets and liabilities from contracts with customers, it adds that it 'implements ASC 606', which, while contextually related, was not part of the original answer and slightly misrepresents the focus of ASU 2021-08, which specifically addresses business combinations, not the general implementation of ASC 606. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly retrieve or synthesize Cisco's revenue increase. It invents a calculation using unsupported numbers, failing the core requirement of factual retrieval from the knowledge base. (4) Despite the incorrect numbers, the answer addresses both parts of the question and correctly identifies the companies, fiscal year, and the relevant accounting standard (ASU 2021-08), which maintains some contextual relevance and partial qualitative accuracy.

      "question": "How does the shift in GE's Renewable Energy revenue mix, particularly from Onshore Wind and Grid Solutions, contrast with the negative mix effects in Union Pacific's Bulk and Industrial segments, and what are the respective financial impacts on each company's performance in 2023?",
      "original_answer": "GE's Renewable Energy segment saw a positive revenue mix effect, particularly from increased demand in Onshore Wind projects in the U.S. and a significant $2 gigawatt HVDC systems agreement in Grid Solutions, which contributed to a $5.7 billion (22%) increase in segment revenues. In contrast, Union Pacific experienced negative mix effects in both its Bulk and Industrial segments, with fewer food and refrigerated shipments and a shift toward short-haul rock shipments, contributing to a decline in freight revenues despite volume increases in some areas.",
      "llm_answer": "GE’s Renewable Energy revenue mix shifted toward higher‑margin Grid Solutions and Onshore Wind, with Grid orders up sharply (e.g., a 2‑GW HVDC deal) and Onshore Wind benefiting from IRA tax credits that cut product costs and boosted RPO; this drove a $2.1 bn revenue increase and narrowed the segment loss by $0.8 bn in 2023. In contrast, Union Pacific’s Bulk and Industrial freight segments suffered negative mix effects—lower coal and food‑refrigerated volumes and a shift to lower‑priced short‑haul rock—dragging down freight revenue and forcing the railroad to absorb higher operating costs, resulting in a 3% decline in total freight revenue and pressure on earnings.",

      "contextual_relevance": 8,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies in key quantitative figures. The ground truth states that GE's Renewable Energy segment revenue increased by $5.7 billion (22%), but the LLM claims only a $2.1 billion increase, which is significantly off. Additionally, the LLM introduces a 'narrowed segment loss by $0.8 bn' and a '3% decline in total freight revenue' for Union Pacific—neither of which appear in the original answer and are unsupported by the provided truth. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies the 2-GW HVDC deal in Grid Solutions and mentions Onshore Wind growth due to IRA tax credits (contextual details not in the original but plausible), the core financial impact numbers are incorrect. The original specifies a $5.7B revenue increase for GE; the LLM reports $2.1B, a major discrepancy. For Union Pacific, the original notes declining freight revenues due to mix effects but does not quantify total revenue change—yet the LLM asserts a 3% decline, introducing unsupported data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts GE’s positive mix (Onshore Wind, Grid Solutions) with Union Pacific’s negative mix (Bulk/Industrial shifts), and identifies relevant drivers like short-haul rock shipments and refrigerated freight declines. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the financial impacts, especially the magnitude of GE’s revenue gain. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both companies, the correct segments, and the concept of revenue mix effects. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct directional logic but flawed specifics. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect dollar amounts and invented percentages. Correctness score reflects partial credit for correct entities and trends but significant deductions for incorrect financial impacts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, ABT's 'State Taxes, Net of Federal Benefit' contributed 0.4% to its effective tax rate, while GILD's contribution from the same component was 2.5%. The difference between these contributions is 2.1 percentage points.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the numeric values. According to the ground truth, ABT's 'State Taxes, Net of Federal Benefit' contribution was 0.4%, not 2.5% as stated in the LLM answer. Similarly, GILD's contribution was 2.5%, not 4.2%. The calculated difference in the LLM answer is 1.7 percentage points (4.2% - 2.5%), but the correct difference is 2.1 percentage points (2.5% - 0.4%). These errors fundamentally undermine the quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation method (taking the difference) is logically sound, but it is applied to incorrect base values, leading to an incorrect result. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing state tax contributions between two companies to infer relative state-level tax burdens—is conceptually valid and aligns with the question. The LLM correctly identifies that a higher contribution indicates a higher incremental burden, which shows understanding of the metric's implication. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question: the numerical difference and its interpretation regarding tax burden. However, due to the severe inaccuracies in the core data, the conclusion, while logically structured, is based on false premises. The qualitative reasoning is acceptable, and the response is relevant, but the factual foundation is flawed, warranting a low correctness score.",

The ground truth states that the FAS/CAS adjustment increased by $75 million for LMT and $690 million for RTX, totaling $765 million. The LLM incorrectly reports only a $690 million increase, omitting LMT's $75 million and misstating the total. Furthermore, the LLM claims this adjustment led to a $6.8 billion increase in operating profit, which is not supported by the original answer—no such figure is mentioned, and the original only states the adjustment positively impacted operating profits without quantifying the total profit impact. (2) The calculation of the combined increase is wrong: $75M + $690M = $765M, not $690M as stated. The $6.8 billion figure appears fabricated and is not present in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly synthesize the individual company adjustments (LMT and RTX) and incorrectly infers a large operating profit impact not stated in the original. It also fails to mention RTX's merger as a driver, which is a key qualitative point.

      "original_answer": "KO evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering forecasted taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings, which affects whether a valuation allowance is needed. WMT also assesses realizability of deferred tax assets by analyzing future taxable income sources, including the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and holds $32.4 billion in net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, some of which will expire if unused. Therefore, the reversal of taxable temporary differences plays a key role in both companies' determination of whether deferred tax benefits will be realized, with WMT's large carryforwards and KO's indefinite reinvestment strategy both influencing the need for valuation allowances.",
      "llm_answer": "The reversal of taxable temporary differences—particularly the realization of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards—directly impacts the realizability assessment of deferred tax assets for both KO and WMT. KO’s indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings allows it to avoid recording a U.S. deferred tax liability on the excess of book basis over tax basis in foreign subsidiaries, preserving more of its deferred tax assets. In contrast, WMT has a substantial $32.4 billion of net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, but its ability to realize these benefits is constrained by a valuation allowance of approximately $7.4 billion, reflecting uncertainty about future taxable income sufficient to utilize the losses before they expire. Consequently, while KO’s indefinite reinvestment strategy enhances the likelihood of realizing its deferred tax assets, WMT’s large carryforward portfolio is offset by a valuation allowance, limiting the net realizability of its deferred tax assets.",

It also correctly notes that both companies consider these reversals in assessing realizability of deferred tax assets. However, the LLM introduces a specific valuation allowance figure of '$7.4 billion' for WMT, which is not present in the original answer or ground truth. This number is unsupported by the provided information and constitutes a factual overreach, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The $32.4 billion figure for WMT's carryforwards is accurate and matches the ground truth. However, the $7.4 billion valuation allowance is not mentioned in the original answer and cannot be verified from the given context, making it an incorrect addition. No other numbers are present, so this is the primary quantitative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is largely sound: the model correctly links KO’s indefinite reinvestment to the treatment of deferred tax assets and connects WMT’s large carryforwards to realizability concerns. It appropriately contrasts the two companies’ situations and explains how temporary difference reversals affect deferred tax asset realizability. However, the unsupported valuation allowance figure undermines the reasoning's factual basis. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, addressing both companies and the core accounting concept.

This involves significant judgment in estimating future utilization, overhaul timing, and cost changes, with audit procedures including retrospective reviews and specialist evaluations. GE also follows ASU 2018-12 (LDTI) for future policy benefits, which requires current assumptions on long-duration contracts, including $26,832 million in long-term care liabilities. UNP, on the other hand, accounts for personal injury liabilities under FELA, recording accruals at the low end of a probable range when outcomes are uncertain, with a disclosed range of $383 million to $494 million.

(2) Quantitatively, the LLM fails to include any of the specific numbers from the ground truth: the $26,832 million in long-term care liabilities at GE and the $383M–$494M range for UNP’s personal injury liabilities. These are critical omissions, especially since the question asks about financial statement disclosures, which include such ranges. The absence of these figures severely undermines quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking GE’s estimation uncertainty in service agreements and UNP’s personal injury liabilities to accounting standards—but it misattributes standards and misses key practices like GE’s use of incurred costs relative to total estimated costs and UNP’s policy of accruing at the low end of the probable range. The audit procedures (retrospective reviews, specialist evaluations) are omitted. (4) Despite these flaws, the LLM captures the general theme of significant judgment, auditor scrutiny, and disclosure of assumptions and outcome ranges, which maintains contextual relevance. However, the incorrect standards and missing quantitative details reduce correctness and qualitative accuracy significantly.",

      "original_answer": "Gilead Sciences capitalized and treated acquired IPR&D projects as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which led to a significant $800 million impairment charge in 2019 when the value of projects related to the treatment of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma declined due to changes in market opportunities. In contrast, Abbott Laboratories generally expensed IPR&D costs as incurred unless the project had an alternative future use. This reveals that Gilead took on more financial risk by capitalizing IPR&D, exposing it to potential impairment charges, whereas Abbott's approach resulted in more immediate expense recognition and lower long-term asset exposure.",

It incorrectly states that Abbott treats IPR&D costs as indefinite-lived intangible assets that are amortized upon approval. In reality, Abbott generally expenses IPR&D costs as incurred unless there is an alternative future use, which is the opposite of capitalizing them. This fundamentally misrepresents Abbott's financial strategy. Gilead’s treatment is correctly described in the original answer as capitalizing IPR&D as indefinite-lived assets, leading to the $800 million 2019 impairment, which the LLM correctly cites. (2) Quantitatively, the $800 million figure and 2019 date are accurate, satisfying quantitative accuracy for those elements. No calculations were required. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM reverses the accounting policies of the two companies. It claims Gilead writes down aggressively (which is true post-capitalization), but then incorrectly frames Abbott as the capitalizing party, undermining the comparison. The conclusion that Gilead is 'risk-averse' and Abbott 'capital-intensive' in R&D is backwards given the actual strategies: capitalizing IPR&D (Gilead) is riskier due to potential impairments, while expensing (Abbott) is more conservative. (4) Correctness is low due to this core inversion of facts. Quantitative accuracy is high because the numbers cited are correct.

CSCO's contribution is given as $43 million (31%), but it should be $1,136 million (80.1%). These errors affect every part of the quantitative response. (2) Calculations are fundamentally flawed: $95M + $43M = $138M matches internally, but all inputs are wrong. The correct sum is $282M + $1,136M = $1,418M.

This indicates that MS, on average, assumes a higher degree of co-movement between its equity instruments and broader market indices compared to BAC’s assumptions for its debt instruments.

According to the ground truth, MS reports an equity correlation range of 25% to 97% with a weighted average of 49%, but the LLM incorrectly states MS's range as 0% to 100% and gives two conflicting weighted averages (67% or 73%), which are both incorrect. BAC's data (5% to 97%, 25% average) is accurately reported. These numerical errors severely undermine factual correctness. (2) The calculation and comparison of correlation ranges and averages are therefore flawed—MS’s actual lower bound (25%) is meaningfully higher than BAC’s (5%), indicating a structurally different baseline assumption, but this is obscured by the LLM’s incorrect 0%–100% range. The LLM’s claim of a 67% or 73% average is also far off from the true 49%, overstating MS’s assumed co-movement. (3) The reasoning and synthesis are partially sound: the LLM correctly interprets that a higher average correlation implies greater sensitivity to market co-movement and links this to valuation impact on derivatives and structured liabilities. It also correctly contrasts BAC’s lower average with MS’s higher one (despite using wrong numbers), showing understanding of the conceptual relationship between correlation assumptions and risk exposure. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the question’s core about how correlation ranges reflect differing exposures to market co-movement risk, and the qualitative logic aligns with the ground truth interpretation—just with incorrect data.

In contrast, while AMD discloses its policy to record ROU assets and lease liabilities for both operating and finance leases, it does not provide specific dollar amounts for its ROU assets in the provided excerpt. This reveals that Apple offers greater quantitative transparency regarding its lease obligations, whereas AMD's disclosure is primarily qualitative and policy-focused. The difference highlights varying levels of detail in lease accounting disclosures between the two companies, which could impact investor understanding of their balance sheet strength and lease-related risks.",

In contrast, AMD's disclosure is minimal and lacks quantitative detail—its Note 6 (Leases) only states that \"finance leases are immaterial\" without providing any ROU asset values, lease liability figures, maturity schedules, or discount rate information, making it impossible to assess the scale or structure of its lease obligations. This disparity reveals Apple's superior lease accounting transparency, as it fully adheres to ASC 842 requirements with granular, comparable data, while AMD's approach suggests either less material lease activity or a less rigorous disclosure practice, reducing comparability for investors analyzing lease-related financial impacts.",

The difference is therefore not 0.1 percentage points but |29.0% - 55.0%| = 26.0 percentage points. (2) The regulatory minimum is correctly stated as 18.0% for MS, but the LLM incorrectly applies this same minimum to BAC and claims BAC exceeds it by 37 points (29.0% - 18.0% = 11.0, not 37). In reality, BAC's required ratio is 21.5%, so it exceeds by 7.5 points (29.0 - 21.5), while MS exceeds by 37.0 points (55.0 - 18.0). The conclusion that BAC exceeds by a larger margin is false—MS exceeds by a much larger margin. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails completely: the model swaps the companies' values, invents a negligible difference, and miscalculates the excess over regulatory minimums. It does not correctly synthesize BAC’s Q4 2023 data with MS’s December 31, 2023 data. (4) Due to pervasive factual errors, incorrect calculations, and flawed logic, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. Contextual relevance is slightly higher because the answer attempts to address the right question structure (difference and comparison of regulatory margins), but with wrong data.",

      "original_answer": "GD's post-retirement benefit obligations require significant future contributions, as seen by the $241 million required in 2025, which creates a defined short-term liquidity need. In contrast, GE's obligations are not only subject to required contributions but also to external economic factors such as interest rates and investment returns, which can increase liabilities unpredictably and create variable liquidity pressures. Together, these disclosures show that while GD faces a known and planned liquidity outflow, GE faces uncertain and potentially larger liquidity demands due to market exposure tied to its post-retirement benefit obligations.",

While GD contributed $73 million to its qualified pension plans in 2024 with a required 2025 contribution of $241 million, GE’s pension and post‑retirement liabilities are explicitly exposed to economic factors such as interest‑rate changes, investment performance and health‑care cost volatility, which can strain leverage and cash flow.

These match the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—both dollar amounts and years are correct, with acceptable formatting ($73 million, $241 million, 2024, 2025). No calculations are required beyond correct reporting. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes GD’s fixed future obligation with GE’s market-sensitive liabilities to conclude that GE faces greater and more uncertain liquidity pressure. This aligns with the ground truth’s core insight about defined vs. variable liquidity demands. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly overemphasizes GE’s 'larger' liquidity pressure without fully acknowledging that GD’s $241M is a concrete near-term outflow, whereas GE’s additional risk stems from uncertainty, not necessarily current magnitude. Still, the qualitative comparison is logically supported.

In contrast, RTX excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment when reporting organic changes in operating profit for year-over-year comparability, treating it as a non-recurring, non-operational item to provide transparency into the underlying performance of the business.

It correctly identifies that LMT includes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment in unallocated items and cites the $1.96 billion (equivalent to $1,960 million) figure, which matches the ground truth for 2021 (not 2022 as implied). However, the question asks about 2022 financial reporting, and the ground truth data is from 2021, creating a mismatch in time period. The LLM incorrectly implies the $1.96 billion adjustment is from 2022, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The statement that 'the adjustment reduces the net operating profit of RTX more than that of LMT' is factually incorrect. According to the ground truth, RTX excludes the FAS/CAS adjustment to enhance comparability, meaning it removes it from operating profit analysis, while LMT includes it. Thus, the adjustment increases LMT's reported operating profit but does not reduce RTX's net profit—rather, RTX segregates it. The claim about RTX having a greater reduction in net operating profit misrepresents the treatment and impact. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the contrasting treatments—LMT incorporating the adjustment vs. RTX excluding it for comparability purposes. Instead, it incorrectly frames the difference as a differential impact on net profit, missing RTX’s intent to improve year-over-year comparability by removing non-operational items. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core topic—differences in FAS/CAS treatment and impact on comparability—but correctness and qualitative reasoning are undermined by factual and logical errors.

The combined total is calculated as $37,695.5 million ($37.6955 billion), while the ground truth is $37.70 billion.

      "original_answer": "Merck's supply constraints for ProQuad and Gardasil vaccines, along with the 3% decline in global Gardasil sales due to reduced demand in China, could lead to lower vaccination rates, potentially increasing the incidence of preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, and HPV-related conditions. This, in turn, may result in higher utilization of medical services and increased claims costs for health insurers like CVS. However, CVS has stated in its 10-K that it faces limitations in detecting, forecasting, and pricing for medical cost trends, especially during periods of significant volatility in utilization and costs. The ACA and other regulations further restrict CVS's ability to adjust pricing based on these increased costs. Therefore, the combination of Merck's supply and demand issues and CVS's forecasting and pricing constraints could amplify volatility in CVS's medical cost trends, limiting its ability to take timely corrective actions and negatively impacting its operating results.",
      "llm_answer": "CVS’s Health Care Benefits segment must forecast medical‑cost trends to set premiums, but it faces two headwinds: (1) Merck’s supply constraints for ProQuad and Gardasil, coupled with a drop in global Gardasil demand, could tighten vaccine availability and pricing, making it harder to predict cost trends; and (2) the 10‑K notes that “we may not be able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims,” which amplifies forecasting risk when pricing is constrained.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—combining data from two companies and interpreting capital structure implications—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval. The conclusion about lease reliance is reasonable in context but understates Amazon's dominant position because the LLM incorrectly reports Amazon's liabilities as only slightly higher than McDonald's, when in fact they are over six times larger.

Schwab outlines forward-looking expectations that link capital management to earnings growth and stockholder value creation through expense discipline and thoughtful capital allocation. These disclosures highlight a strategic focus on delivering shareholder value, which contrasts with Wells Fargo's more risk-averse framing around maintaining sufficient capital during economic downturns.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 filings reveal divergent capital‑management philosophies: Wells Fargo emphasizes strict regulatory capital requirements and dividend‑distribution limits tied to its banking‑holding‑company status, whereas Charles Schwab frames capital management as a lever to maximize market valuation and stockholder returns, explicitly linking capital decisions to earnings growth and shareholder value creation. Schwab’s forward‑looking statements highlight that it expects to return capital to shareholders through dividend increases and share‑repurchase authorizations, and it ties its capital‑management strategy to achieving targeted CET1 ratios, maintaining liquidity buffers, and supporting ongoing investments that drive client‑asset growth and ultimately higher stockholder returns.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) All factual elements are correct: Charles Schwab's emphasis on capital management as a lever for maximizing market valuation and stockholder returns is accurately portrayed, as is Wells Fargo's focus on capital sufficiency under adverse conditions. The LLM correctly identifies Schwab’s forward-looking expectations around capital returns via dividends and share repurchases, which are not in the original answer but are consistent with typical disclosures and do not contradict the ground truth. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts, CET1 ratios) in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no incorrect numbers are introduced. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes contrasting strategic priorities between two firms across their 2023 filings and correctly attributes forward-looking capital management statements to Schwab. The only minor gap is that the original answer emphasizes Schwab’s linkage of capital management to 'expense discipline' and 'thoughtful capital allocation,' which the LLM mentions implicitly but not verbatim. However, the core idea of linking capital decisions to shareholder value is clearly conveyed. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the response directly addresses both parts of the question: differing strategic priorities and Schwab’s forward-looking disclosures tying capital to shareholder returns. The addition of CET1 ratios and liquidity buffers adds appropriate detail without straying from the topic. Overall, the answer is factually correct, comprehensive, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth with only slight expansion beyond it.",

(2) Calculations are arithmetically correct based on the wrong inputs, but the sum $9,255 + $12,697 = $21,952 is not factually accurate due to incorrect source data. The comparison statement that the sum exceeds intersegment revenue is technically true in both cases, but based on flawed magnitude. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM identifies the need to pull data from two companies (CMCSA and VZ), extract specific revenue line items, sum them, and compare to another metric from CMCSA—so the logical framework is correct.

      "original_answer": "The 33% decline in Merck's 2024 U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet, driven by lower pricing, competitive pressures, and Medicaid rebate changes, affects CVS's Health Care Benefits segment by potentially reducing pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service demand and increasing medical cost trends. CVS notes that adverse economic conditions, including changes in drug utilization and provider behavior, can increase its costs and limit its ability to manage medical cost trends. Lower drug utilization due to reduced prescribing of Merck's diabetes medications could decrease PBM revenue for CVS while simultaneously shifting more cost burden to medical claims if alternative treatments are more expensive, thereby increasing medical costs for CVS and straining its ability to manage benefit costs and maintain profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "The decline in U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet—driven by competitive pricing pressures, the loss of exclusivity, and higher Medicaid rebates under the American Rescue Plan—directly pressures CVS’s Health Care Benefits segment, which is highly sensitive to shifts in drug utilization and provider behavior.

It accurately links reduced drug utilization and pricing pressure to lower PBM revenue and margin compression, aligning with the ground truth's emphasis on CVS's sensitivity to drug utilization and provider behavior. However, the LLM omits the specific 33% decline in Merck’s 2024 U.S. sales, a key quantitative fact from the original answer, which reduces quantitative accuracy. (2) The ground truth specifies a 33% decline in 2024, but the LLM does not mention any percentage or year, missing a critical numeric detail. While it references the American Rescue Plan correctly as a driver of higher Medicaid rebates, it does not tie the impact to 2024 or quantify the sales drop, leading to a moderate deduction in quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that lower sales of these drugs imply reduced utilization, which affects CVS’s PBM revenue and cost management capabilities. It also appropriately connects government pricing changes and provider behavior to forecasting challenges and margin pressure, demonstrating strong qualitative reasoning and entity linkage (Merck’s drugs → drug utilization → CVS PBM economics). (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing the question’s focus on CVS’s sensitivity to drug utilization shifts. The omission of the 33% figure and the specific year prevents a top score in correctness, but the conceptual and causal analysis is robust and semantically aligned with the ground truth.",

The combined total of long-term lease liabilities is stated as $25,252 million ($25.252 billion), whereas the ground truth is $91.38 billion—more than three times higher. Amazon's liability is reported as $13,524 million ($13.524 billion) in the LLM answer, but the correct value is $78.3 billion. Similarly, McDonald's is listed as $11,728 million ($11.728 billion), but the actual figure is $13.058 billion. These discrepancies are massive and fundamentally undermine the answer's validity. (2) Calculations are also wrong: the LLM's sum of $13,524M + $11,728M = $25,252M is arithmetically correct, but all input numbers are factually incorrect. The comparison claiming Amazon's liability is 'significantly larger' is misleading—while true in the LLM's fictional dataset, in reality, Amazon's $78.3B is vastly larger than McDonald's $13.058B, making up ~85.4% of the total, not a near 50/50 split as implied. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly retrieve or synthesize data from the two companies' 2024 filings.

Additionally, the LLM claims SCHW's SLR (8.5%) exceeds WFC's (10.0%), which is false if WFC were actually at 10.0%, making the comparison backwards. However, the date (December 31, 2023) and SCHW's SLR of 8.5% are correct. (2) The calculation of the difference between the two banks' SLRs is invalid due to the incorrect attribution of WFC’s SLR. The original answer computes a 5.5 percentage point difference based on SCHW at 8.5% vs. WFC’s minimum requirement of 3.0%, but the LLM misrepresents this by using a fabricated 10.0% for WFC.

It reports Comcast's 2023 Business Revenue as $121,572 million and Verizon's as $131,748 million, which are not only vastly larger than the ground truth values but also appear to be total revenues rather than Business Revenue specifically. The correct figures are $22 million for Comcast and $13,372 million for Verizon in 2023. The LLM's combined total of $253,320 million is therefore grossly inaccurate compared to the correct total of $13,394 million. Similarly, the prior-year figures provided by the LLM ($121,427M for Comcast 2022 and $134,578M for Verizon 2022) are incorrect and appear to reflect total company revenues, not Business Revenue.

However, it incorrectly states that Merck reported $551 million in 2022, when in fact CVS reported $551 million and MRK reported $384 million. The LLM swaps the companies, attributing CVS's 2022 figure to Merck. It also introduces 2023 data ($277M for Merck, $125M for CVS), which is not mentioned in the original question or ground truth, adding irrelevant and unverified information. (2) The sum calculation for 2024 is correct ($177M + $361M = $538M), but the comparison to 2022 is flawed: the correct 2022 total is $935M ($551M + $384M), not referenced properly in the LLM answer. The decrease of $397M (42.5%) from 2022 to 2024 is omitted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly synthesize the 2022 data across both companies and misattributes figures between CVS and MRK. It also introduces a year (2023) not asked for, indicating a failure in reasoning scope.

      "original_answer": "GM Financial incorporates disposable personal income as one of several economic factors in its static pool modeling to forecast expected credit losses on retail finance receivables, adjusting the allowance for loan losses based on projected impacts of changes in this metric. Lowe’s, on the other hand, depends on disposable personal income as a core demand driver that influences homeowner spending on repairs and upgrades, particularly among millennials forming households and elderly individuals aging in place. Therefore, a decline in disposable personal income could simultaneously increase credit risk in GM’s finance receivables while reducing demand in Lowe’s home improvement market, creating dual financial pressures across both companies.",
      "llm_answer": "Both GM Financial and Lowe’s rely on disposable personal income as a key indicator of future demand, but they apply it in different parts of their businesses. GM Financial incorporates disposable‑personal‑income trends into its static‑pool models for estimating credit losses on retail finance receivables, using income forecasts to gauge borrower repayment ability and set allowance levels. Lowe’s, by contrast, treats disposable personal income as a core demand driver for home‑improvement spending, linking higher income levels to greater consumer willingness to invest in repairs and upgrades. In short, GM Financial uses income data to forecast loan‑losses, while Lowe’s uses it to forecast overall home‑improvement demand.",

      "question": "Considering the impact of excess inventory risks on both Apple and AMD, how might a decrease in customer demand affect both companies' financial positions given their respective commitments to suppliers and manufacturing processes?",
      "original_answer": "A decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory for both Apple and AMD, leading to financial risks such as write-downs, increased production costs, and unutilized purchase commitments. Apple orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments, with manufacturing purchase obligations covering forecasted requirements for up to 150 days. If demand decreases, Apple risks forecasting incorrectly and producing excess components or products, which could lead to inventory write-downs and unutilized purchase commitments. Similarly, AMD has prepayment arrangements with certain vendors, and a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and increased production costs. AMD's reliance on long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements makes it particularly vulnerable to financial strain if demand decreases and inventory cannot be utilized. Together, these dynamics show how both companies' financial positions could be adversely impacted by a shared risk of excess inventory stemming from mismatched supply and demand.",
      "llm_answer": "A decline in customer demand would strain both Apple and AMD’s financial positions because each relies on long‑term supply commitments and fixed‑price contracts with key manufacturers. For Apple, reduced demand would likely leave excess inventory and force it to absorb higher per‑unit costs from prepayments to suppliers, pressuring gross margins. For AMD, weaker demand would similarly increase inventory levels and could trigger penalties under its wafer‑purchase agreements with GlobalFoundries, while also limiting the company’s ability to meet purchase targets and potentially leading to excess inventory costs. In both cases, lower sales would diminish cash flow and could compel the firms to renegotiate or cancel supplier commitments, further eroding profitability.",

It correctly identifies that both companies face financial strain from long-term supplier agreements and potential excess inventory. The quantitative accuracy is perfect—there are no specific numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, days of obligations) in the LLM answer, but it does not introduce any incorrect figures, and where it references concepts like prepayments and purchase agreements, they align with the ground truth. However, the LLM omits a key detail from the original answer: Apple’s manufacturing purchase obligations cover forecasted requirements for up to 150 days, which is a critical multi-hop element showing the extent of its forward-looking commitments. Additionally, while the LLM mentions 'penalties under wafer-purchase agreements with GlobalFoundries' for AMD, this specific vendor relationship and penalty mechanism is not present in the ground truth and introduces an unsupported inference, slightly reducing qualitative accuracy. The core reasoning—linking reduced demand to excess inventory, higher costs, and strained supplier commitments—is sound and relevant, and the answer addresses both companies and their respective vulnerabilities.

      "question": "How does the difference in contract mix between General Dynamics' defense segments and Lockheed Martin's contract structure influence their respective operating earnings and margin volatility?",
      "original_answer": "General Dynamics notes that operating earnings and margin volatility in its defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance, and contract mix, particularly emphasizing that contract mix refers to the proportion of higher- versus lower-margin work, which can vary based on contract type (e.g., fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development vs. production). Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, explicitly states that it operates under both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, with the latter including cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee structures. These cost-reimbursable contracts introduce variability in fees based on performance assessments or cost targets, directly affecting earnings and margins. Therefore, while both companies experience margin volatility due to contract mix, Lockheed Martin's detailed exposure to performance-based fees in its cost-reimbursable contracts introduces an additional layer of earnings sensitivity compared to General Dynamics' broader categorization of contract type and work stage impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "The defense segment contracts at General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin differ in mix and structure, which directly affects their operating earnings and margin volatility. General Dynamics' defense contracts are primarily cost‑plus‑fixed‑fee and cost‑reimbursable agreements that provide a fixed fee and are subject to government pricing regulations, leading to relatively stable margins but exposure to cost‑reimbursement limits. In contrast, Lockheed Martin relies more heavily on fixed‑price contracts with performance‑based incentives, creating greater earnings volatility as profitability hinges on meeting cost and schedule targets. Consequently, General Dynamics' margins are less sensitive to contract mix fluctuations, while Lockheed Martin's margins fluctuate more with changes in contract type, performance adjustments, and incentive fee outcomes.",

Contextually, the response addresses the core question about how contract mix influences operating earnings and margin volatility at General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin, maintaining relevance throughout. However, the qualitative accuracy is low due to significant factual inaccuracies in the characterization of each company's contract structure. The original answer (ground truth) states that General Dynamics emphasizes contract mix in terms of higher- vs. lower-margin work and distinguishes between fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, but the LLM incorrectly claims General Dynamics' contracts are 'primarily cost-plus-fixed-fee and cost-reimbursable,' which is not supported in the ground truth. Conversely, the LLM asserts that Lockheed Martin relies 'more heavily on fixed-price contracts with performance-based incentives,' which reverses the emphasis in the original answer: Lockheed Martin is described as having significant cost-reimbursable contracts (including cost-plus-award-fee, etc.) where fees vary based on performance, not fixed-price contracts. In fact, the ground truth does not state that Lockheed Martin relies more on fixed-price contracts. This misattribution leads to an incorrect causal explanation for margin volatility. While both companies are correctly linked to margin volatility from contract mix, the LLM misrepresents the source: it incorrectly frames Lockheed Martin’s volatility as stemming from fixed-price performance incentives, whereas the original answer highlights that it is the performance-based fees within cost-reimbursable contracts that create additional sensitivity. The reasoning is thus flawed in its multi-hop synthesis—failing to accurately map each company’s contract types to the correct earnings drivers. As a result, despite correct general themes, the answer is partially incorrect on key factual distinctions, warranting a correctness score of 5.",

Morgan Stanley's asset management fees grew by 8%, while Charles Schwab's asset management and administration fees grew by 20.2%. Therefore, Morgan Stanley's growth was 8% compared to Schwab's 20.2% growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Morgan Stanley's 2024 asset management revenue was $5,627 million, while Charles Schwab reported $5,716 million in asset management and related fees for the same year. Morgan Stanley's asset‑management fees grew 8% year‑over‑year, compared with a 9% increase for Charles Schwab, meaning Morgan Stanley's growth lagged Schwab's by 1 percentage point.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numbers. While the Morgan Stanley asset management revenue ($5,627 million) is close to the ground truth (implied $5,627M vs actual $5,627M), Charles Schwab's reported asset management and related fees are incorrect: LLM states $5,716 million, but ground truth implies $5,716 million is not accurate—actual combined total is $11,343 million, meaning Schwab should be $5,716 million only if Morgan Stanley were $5,627 million, which matches, so this may be numerically consistent. However, the critical error lies in growth rates: LLM states Charles Schwab’s growth was 9%, but ground truth is 20.2%. This is a major quantitative discrepancy. Morgan Stanley’s 8% growth matches ground truth. (2) Calculations: The combined revenue is not explicitly stated by the LLM, though $5,627M + $5,716M = $11,343M, which matches ground truth—so sum is correct by implication. However, the comparison of growth rates is wrong: LLM says Schwab grew 9%, leading to a 1 percentage point difference, but actual difference is 8% vs 20.2%, so Morgan Stanley lagged by 12.2 points. This invalidates the conclusion. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across two companies and compare growth rates, which is correct in structure, but uses incorrect data for Schwab’s growth, breaking the logic chain. (4) Scores justified: Correctness scored low (4) due to major error in growth percentage (9% vs 20.2%), despite partial numerical accuracy in revenue totals. Quantitative accuracy is 4 due to one correct number (Morgan Stanley revenue and growth), one incorrect (Schwab growth), and implied correct sum. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) because reasoning structure is sound but based on flawed data. Contextual relevance is high (8) as the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate framing.",

      "original_answer": "General Dynamics recognizes revenue on long-term government contracts using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs at completion, which directly ties revenue fluctuations to changes in cost estimates and production volume. This method means that changes in estimated costs without corresponding changes in contract value impact profitability. Lockheed Martin, under cost-reimbursable contracts, is reimbursed for allowable costs plus a fee, with profitability capped by a ceiling amount and influenced by performance assessments or cost incentives. Therefore, while General Dynamics' profitability is sensitive to cost estimation accuracy and contract maturity, Lockheed Martin's earnings depend on cost control and performance-based incentives within a fixed funding limit.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in revenue recognition methods between General Dynamics' defense segments and Lockheed Martin's cost-reimbursable contracts directly impacts how operating earnings and contract profitability are reported. General Dynamics uses percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost for continuous transfer of control contracts and recognizes revenue at point-in-time for non-continuous obligations, while Lockheed Martin recognizes revenue over time for cost-reimbursable contracts based on costs incurred or right-to-invoice, with profit booking rates adjusted for risks and variable consideration. This results in Lockheed Martin's profitability being more sensitive to cost variances and risk assessments in long-term contracts, whereas General Dynamics' earnings are influenced by backlog conversion rates and the timing of revenue recognition tied to contract milestones or customer acceptance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is contextually relevant and correctly identifies that both companies use cost-based methods for revenue recognition on long-term government contracts, which is central to the question. It accurately notes General Dynamics uses a cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method and that Lockheed Martin recognizes revenue over time on cost-reimbursable contracts—this aligns with the ground truth. However, the qualitative analysis diverges in key aspects of profitability drivers. The original answer correctly emphasizes that General Dynamics' profitability is sensitive to changes in cost estimates without corresponding contract value adjustments, while Lockheed Martin’s profitability is capped by ceilings and influenced by performance incentives and cost control within fixed funding. The LLM answer incorrectly reverses the sensitivity: it claims Lockheed Martin’s profitability is more sensitive to cost variances and risk assessments, whereas in reality, cost-reimbursable contracts insulate contractors from cost overruns (as long as within allowable limits), making performance incentives and ceiling amounts more critical. Conversely, General Dynamics’ method directly ties profit to estimation accuracy, which the LLM underemphasizes. Instead, the LLM focuses on 'backlog conversion rates' and 'timing of milestones,' which are not highlighted in the ground truth and introduce inaccuracies in the comparative reasoning. There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10 by default. The answer is well-structured and relevant but contains significant conceptual inaccuracies in the multi-hop synthesis of how each firm's revenue model affects operating earnings and contract profitability.",

      "original_answer": "Gilead expenses milestone payments as incurred in asset acquisitions unless there is an alternative future use, while Johnson & Johnson expenses milestone payments up to regulatory approval and capitalizes them afterward. This means Gilead's income statement reflects the full cost of milestone payments immediately, whereas JNJ delays recognition until regulatory approval is obtained, thereby deferring some costs to future periods through amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead treats milestone payments in acquisitions as contingent consideration recorded at fair value, with subsequent fair‑value adjustments recognized in research and development expense on the income statement. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson records milestone payments in research and development collaborations as expenses when incurred (or capitalizes them only after regulatory approval), without the contingent‑consideration fair‑value remeasurement. Consequently, Gilead’s income statement can show periodic R&D expense fluctuations tied to milestone revaluations, whereas JNJ’s R&D expense reflects the actual cash outlays at the time of payment.",

However, the qualitative accuracy is low due to significant misrepresentation of the financial treatment of milestone payments. The original answer states that Gilead expenses milestone payments in acquisitions as incurred (unless alternative future use exists), implying immediate income statement impact. In contrast, the LLM claims Gilead treats them as contingent consideration with fair value adjustments flowing into R&D expense—a characterization more aligned with business combination accounting under ASC 805, which is not supported by the ground truth. This introduces incorrect reasoning about periodic fluctuations due to revaluations, which is not mentioned in the original. For JNJ, the LLM correctly notes that milestone payments in R&D collaborations are generally expensed when incurred but adds a nuance about capitalization after regulatory approval, which aligns partially with the original. However, it omits the key point that JNJ capitalizes post-approval milestones, leading to deferral and amortization—critical for understanding income statement impact. The contrast in income statement effects (immediate vs. deferred recognition) is partially captured but distorted by the erroneous framework applied to Gilead. Contextual relevance is high as the response addresses both companies and the income statement impact. Overall, while some directional insights are present, the core accounting treatments are misrepresented, especially for Gilead, warranting a correctness score of 6 for partial accuracy with significant errors in multi-hop reasoning and entity-specific financial policies.",

It incorrectly states that both COST and MDLZ had $139 million in financing cash outflows, but the ground truth shows COST had $136 million and MDLZ had $139 million. The combined total is therefore $275 million, not $278 million. (2) The year-over-year changes are completely misrepresented. The LLM claims COST's outflow increased from $125M to $139M (a $14M increase), but the truth is COST decreased from $291M to $136M (a $155M decrease). Conversely, MDLZ decreased from $125M to $139M is factually impossible (that would be an increase, not a decrease). The ground truth states MDLZ decreased by $14M from $125M to $139M — this itself is contradictory (as $139M > $125M), but assuming typo, likely meant $111M or similar; however, per original answer, MDLZ went from $125M to $139M — which is inconsistent with 'decrease'. Upon re-evaluation, the original answer likely contains a typo: 'from $125 million in 2023 to $139 million in 2024' cannot be a decrease. However, it claims a $14M decrease — so likely the 2023 value should be $153M. But since we must base evaluation on the provided 'ground truth', we assume it is correct in direction. The LLM misattributes the larger decrease to COST, but according to ground truth, COST decreased by $155M (larger than MDLZ's $14M), so COST had the larger decrease — contradicting the original answer’s claim that MDLZ had larger decrease. This suggests the original answer has internal inconsistency. However, per instruction, we treat the original answer as ground truth. Thus, the LLM contradicts it by saying COST had larger decrease, while original says MDLZ did. But numerically, $155M > $14M, so original answer likely has error in conclusion. Despite this, the LLM still fails: it reports wrong values, wrong trends (increase vs decrease), and wrong reasoning. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize data across companies and years. It repeated the same number for both firms, confused direction of change, and miscalculated totals.

The ground truth correctly sums $358 million (ADBE unvested share-based awards) + $271 million (QCOM derivative assets) + $346 million (QCOM derivative liabilities) = $975 million. However, the LLM incorrectly cites ADBE's figure as $4,039 million (which refers to *outstanding* restricted stock units and performance shares as of December 3, 2021, not the *unvested share-based awards* for fiscal year ending 2022), leading to a major factual error.

The growth rate for Morgan Stanley is accurately reported at 8%. For Charles Schwab, the LLM states a growth rate of 19%, while the ground truth specifies 18.6%. This is a minor rounding discrepancy, likely due to the model calculating (4,146 - 3,492) / 3,492 ≈ 18.72%, which rounds to 18.7% or possibly 19% depending on precision. This does not constitute a material error but is a slight deviation from the exact figure. (2) All numbers are consistent with the ground truth: $5,627M + $4,146M = $9,773M is correct. The Schwab base-year fee of $3,492M is not in the original answer but is a valid supporting detail and aligns with an 18.6% growth rate (3,492 * 1.186 ≈ 4,146).

The LLM incorrectly reports the combined total as $2.1 billion ($2,100 million), which is $311 million higher than the correct amount.

Additionally, the LLM introduces Amgen's growth figures (≈11% worldwide, 39% U.S.), which are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. The original answer does not mention any growth percentage for Amgen, only that it operates in a single segment.

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin's FAS/CAS operating adjustment in 2021 was $1,876 million, which was $1,831 million higher than the approximate $45 million impact of the Raytheon Merger on RMD's operating profit in 2020. This large difference suggests that accounting adjustments like the FAS/CAS operating adjustment can be significantly larger in magnitude than direct merger impacts, highlighting the importance of understanding non-operational financial adjustments in evaluating defense industry performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The FAS/CAS operating adjustment for Lockheed Martin in 2021 was $1.96 billion, while the approximate impact of the Raytheon merger on RMD’s operating profit in 2020 was about $45 million. This difference shows that accounting‑related adjustments (the FAS/CAS pension and other unallocated items) are far larger in magnitude than the merger‑related profit contribution, indicating that in the defense industry the effects of complex accounting standards often outweigh the direct financial impact of major acquisitions.",

However, it reports Lockheed Martin's FAS/CAS operating adjustment in 2021 as $1.96 billion ($1,960 million), whereas the ground truth value is $1,876 million. This results in an incorrect difference (implied $1,915 million vs. actual $1,831 million), though the question does not explicitly ask for the difference to be calculated. (2) The numbers are mostly accurate except for the Lockheed Martin figure, which is off by $84 million—a significant deviation in a financial context. The $45 million merger impact is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (Lockheed Martin and Raytheon/RMD), two years (2021 vs. 2020), and two types of financial impacts (accounting adjustment vs. merger impact). The conclusion about the relative magnitude of accounting adjustments versus merger impacts is logically drawn and aligns with the ground truth. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—the answer addresses both parts of the question and draws an appropriate industry-level insight.

The LLM's calculation of the 2024 total ($76M) is correct numerically but based on swapped inputs, making it coincidentally accurate. The comparison stating that 2024 is higher than 2022 is directionally correct, but the magnitude of increase is not addressed — the correct difference is $23 million, which the LLM fails to mention. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize data across two companies and two years.

      "original_answer": "HON demonstrates a higher proportion of cost of goods sold relative to total expenses. HON's cost of products and services sold in 2021 was $457 million, representing 80.3% of its total expenses ($569 million). RTX's cost of sales was $34 million, representing 23.8% of its total expenses ($143 million).

However, RTX's total expenses are significantly higher at **$64,427 million** (page 105), compared to HON's total expenses of **$33,783 million** (page 71).  \n\nCalculating the proportion:  \n- HON: COGS / Total Expenses = $1,000 / $33,783 ≈ **2.96%**  \n- RTX: COGS / Total Expenses = $15,895 / $64,427 ≈ **24.67%**  \n\nThus, **RTX demonstrates a substantially higher proportion of COGS relative to total expenses** (24.67% vs. 2.96%). This indicates that RTX operates with a **cost structure heavily weighted toward direct production costs**, suggesting greater exposure to manufacturing or project-based cost volatility, whereas HON's cost structure is more dominated by non-COGS expenses (e.g., R&D, SG&A), implying a more diversified or service-oriented operational model.  \n\n*(Note: RTX's COGS figure is derived from \"Cost of products and services sold\" of $15,895 million on page 105, while HON's COGS is explicitly stated as $1,000 million on page 71.

These numbers do not match the ground truth: HON's COGS was $457 million (not $1,000M) and total expenses $569 million (not $33,783M); RTX's COGS was $34 million (not $15,895M) and total expenses $143 million (not $64,427M).

      "original_answer": "Costco projects a $370 million increase in membership revenue over the next two fiscal years, with $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025, primarily in the latter half of the year. This increase stems from membership fee hikes and higher penetration of Executive Members. Meanwhile, Mondelez notes significant cost inflation pressures, including rising raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs, which have continued to increase. Both companies address cost pressures through pricing strategies—Costco via membership fees and Mondelez through product pricing adjustments. The additional revenue Costco anticipates could help offset inflationary pressures, supporting its membership-driven profitability model. In contrast, Mondelez may need to rely more heavily on pricing actions and cost-saving initiatives to maintain profitability. These differing strategies reflect their business models and exposure to cost inflation, shaping how each company approaches profitability in a challenging cost environment.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco’s projected $370 million increase in membership revenue over the next two fiscal years is expected to boost its profitability by expanding a high‑margin, recurring‑revenue stream that cushions the impact of rising operating costs. Meanwhile, Mondelez faces higher raw‑material and labor expenses, which it aims to offset through pricing actions, cost‑saving initiatives, and productivity improvements; however, the company anticipates that these inflationary pressures will constrain margin expansion unless it can fully pass costs on to consumers.

Intel's negative effective tax rate was primarily driven by significant tax credits and adjustments such as research and development tax credits (-11.4%), non-US income taxed at different rates (-13.4%), and foreign derived intangible income benefit (-9.7%), which collectively reduced their tax burden. In contrast, Apple's effective tax rate, although lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, was positively influenced by fewer such adjustments, resulting in a more conventional effective tax rate. This comparison highlights how different business structures, global operations, and tax incentives can lead to divergent effective tax outcomes even under the same statutory rate.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 effective tax rates reveal contrasting impacts of tax credits, deductions, and adjustments: Apple’s rate was driven by a substantial benefit from R&D tax credits (reducing its rate by 99.0 percentage points) and a higher proportion of income taxed at lower foreign rates, resulting in a negative 119.8 % effective rate, whereas Intel’s rate was elevated by a one‑time $10.2 billion state‑aid tax charge and higher foreign earnings, leading to a 24.1 % effective rate that exceeded the statutory 21 % rate. Consequently, Apple’s tax position reflects significant tax‑credit and foreign‑rate advantages, while Intel’s reflects the offsetting effect of large one‑time tax assessments and less favorable credit utilization.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect in terms of factual content. It claims Apple had a negative 119.8% effective tax rate due to a 99.0 percentage point reduction from R&D credits, which contradicts the ground truth that Apple's actual effective tax rate was 14.7%. Similarly, it states Intel had a 24.1% effective tax rate due to a $10.2 billion state-aid tax charge, whereas the truth is Intel had a -3.2% rate due to significant tax credits and adjustments. These errors completely invert the actual tax positions of both companies. (2) Specific number verification: Apple’s correct rate is 14.7% (not -119.8%); Intel’s is -3.2% (not 24.1%). The alleged 99.0 percentage point benefit for Apple is fabricated; no such figure exists in the ground truth. Intel’s supposed $10.2 billion charge is also false—its tax position was reduced by credits, not increased by penalties. The ground truth lists specific credit impacts: R&D credit (-11.4%), non-US income (-13.4%), FDII benefit (-9.7%)—none of which are mentioned in the LLM answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: instead of correctly attributing Intel’s negative rate to tax credits and Apple’s moderate rate to fewer adjustments, the model reverses causality and invents non-existent factors. It fails to synthesize the correct drivers of effective tax rates for either company. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the answer attempts to discuss tax credits, foreign income, and effective tax rates in a comparative framework, which aligns with the question’s intent. However, due to pervasive factual and quantitative errors, the qualitative and correctness scores are near minimum.",

      "original_answer": "The difference in the percentage of residential real estate loans to total loans between Morgan Stanley (27%) and Charles Schwab (62%) is 35 percentage points. Morgan Stanley reported $87 million in residential real estate loans, with an allowance for credit losses (ACL) of $87 million as of December 31, 2022. Charles Schwab reported $15 million in ACL for residential real estate loans, which accounted for 62% of its total loans in 2024. This indicates that while both firms disclose their loan percentages and ACL, Charles Schwab has a significantly higher concentration in residential real estate loans relative to its total portfolio compared to Morgan Stanley.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, the percentage of residential real estate loans to total loans is 29% for Morgan Stanley (as shown in the \"Residential Real Estate\" allocation within the allowance for credit losses table on page 114) and 42% for Charles Schwab (as shown in the \"Residential Real Estate\" allocation within the same table on page 114). \n\nMorgan Stanley's allowance for credit losses for residential real estate loans is $97 million (as stated in the \"Residential Real Estate\" row of the allowance for credit losses rollforward table on page 115), while Charles Schwab's allowance for credit losses for this category is $256 million (as stated in the \"Residential Real Estate\" row of the allowance for credit losses rollforward table on page 115). \n\nThus, the difference in the percentage of residential real estate loans to total loans is 13 percentage points (42% - 29%), and the allowance for credit losses for this category is $256 million for Charles Schwab and $97 million for Morgan Stanley.",

According to the ground truth, Morgan Stanley's residential real estate loans as a percentage of total loans is 27%, not 29%, and Charles Schwab's is 62%, not 42%. The difference is therefore 35 percentage points, not 13. Additionally, Morgan Stanley's allowance for credit losses (ACL) for residential real estate loans is $87 million, not $97 million, and Charles Schwab's is $15 million, not $256 million. These numerical discrepancies are substantial and materially alter the conclusion. (2) Calculations are incorrect due to wrong inputs: 42% - 29% = 13% is mathematically correct but based on false data. The correct difference is 62% - 27% = 35 percentage points. Dollar amounts for ACL are completely mismatched—$256M vs $15M for Schwab is off by over 1,600%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to extract percentages and ACL figures from both firms and compute the difference—but it fails at entity-data alignment. It likely misread or misattributed data from the 10-K tables, possibly confusing categories or years. The reference to 'page 114' and 'page 115' suggests fabricated or hallucinated sourcing, as no actual filings are provided in context.

However, it incorrectly states PFE's development milestone commitment as $308 million, conflating the total potential value of the Valneva agreement (upfront + development + commercial milestones) with development milestones alone. The ground truth specifies only $35 million tied to development milestones, not $308 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $1.908 billion instead of the correct $1.635 billion. (2) The calculation error stems from using an inflated value for PFE's commitment. While $1.6 billion (AMGN) is accurate, adding $308 million (PFE) instead of $35 million results in a significant quantitative discrepancy. The format variation ($1.6 billion vs $1.6B) is acceptable, but the values themselves are not equivalent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly extracting AMGN's milestone commitment and identifying PFE's agreement with Valneva—but fails in precise synthesis by not isolating only the development milestone component for PFE. The model appears to have used the total potential deal value rather than filtering for development-specific milestones. (4) Scores reflect that core facts for AMGN are correct and the question structure is well-understood (hence moderate contextual relevance and qualitative accuracy), but major quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine the correctness. A score of 4 is justified due to one correct major figure and correct identification of agreements, but with critical errors in the second entity’s value and the final sum.",

According to the ground truth, HD had a 0.3% decrease in comparable average ticket in fiscal 2023, which is correctly stated, but the LLM incorrectly claims HD's transaction-based revenue was impacted by a '0.1% drop' in average ticket—this contradicts both its own earlier statement (0.3%) and the ground truth (0.3%). More critically, the LLM states that LOW’s comparable average ticket increased 8.8% in fiscal 2022 and then declined 0.3% in fiscal 2023, but the ground truth indicates LOW had only a 0.1% decrease in fiscal 2023, not 0.3%, and no data is provided about fiscal 2022. The 8.8% growth figure is entirely unsupported by the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM fabricates a '2.9% drop in comparable customer transactions' for LOW and attributes a 'net 4.7% comparable sales decline' to both companies, which is not mentioned or inferable from the original answer. (2) Number verification: HD’s average ticket drop from $90.36 to $90.07 (a ~0.3% decline) is accurate and aligns with ground truth. However, LOW’s 0.1% decrease is misrepresented as 0.3% in the LLM answer. The $90.36 and $90.07 figures are missing in the LLM response, reducing quantitative completeness. The 4.6% drop in LOW’s customer transactions from the ground truth is ignored and replaced with a false 2.9% figure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly synthesizes trends across years and companies, introducing data from fiscal 2022 (8.8% growth) not referenced in the question or ground truth. It fails to contrast HD’s slightly worse performance with LOW’s smaller decline in average ticket and misattributes revenue impacts. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major factual errors in percentages and invented metrics.

It incorrectly states LMT's 2019 FAS/CAS operating adjustment as $1,960 million, which is actually the 2021 value; the correct 2019 value is $2,049 million (from ground truth). This leads to an incorrect cumulative total: LLM calculates $5,796 million ($1,960 + $1,876 + $1,960), but the correct sum is $5,405 million ($2,049 + $1,876 + $1,960). The RTX increase attributed to the Raytheon merger in 2021 is correctly cited as $690 million.

Coca-Cola also expenses repair and maintenance costs when incurred but provides more detailed context around asset management, including depreciation ranges for buildings and equipment, and explicitly states that costs not extending economic life are expensed.

This difference means Costco’s asset base grows more slowly and its expense line (cost of goods sold or SG&A) reflects higher periodic expense, whereas Coca‑Cola’s strategy builds capitalized assets that are amortized over time, implying a more investment‑oriented approach to maintaining and upgrading its long‑lived property, plant and equipment.",

However, it introduces a key inaccuracy by claiming that Coca-Cola capitalizes expenditures that extend an asset's useful life or add utility, while the original answer does not mention any capitalization by Coca-Cola—only that it expenses costs that do not extend economic life. This implies a distinction in accounting treatment that is not supported by the ground truth, which states both companies expense such costs and does not indicate that Coca-Cola capitalizes any repair or maintenance costs. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; no calculations or figures are present, hence no errors—scored as 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies the common practice of expensing and links it to financial statement impact (e.g., immediate reduction in net income). However, it incorrectly infers differential asset management strategies based on assumed capitalization by Coca-Cola, which is not stated in the ground truth. The original answer emphasizes disclosure differences (Coca-Cola provides more context on depreciation ranges and policy), not actual differences in capitalization practice. Thus, the reasoning overreaches by implying a structural difference in accounting treatment rather than a difference in transparency and reporting granularity. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies, the financial statement impact, and strategic implications. However, the qualitative accuracy is reduced due to the unsupported claim about capitalization, leading to a misleading conclusion about Coca-Cola’s strategy being 'investment-oriented' versus Costco’s 'streamlined' approach—while the ground truth attributes the difference to disclosure practices, not underlying capitalization behavior.

The calculated difference in the ground truth is 112 - 3 = 109 thousand, but the LLM reports 134 thousand (137 - 3), which is incorrect due to the wrong input.

In contrast, Netflix (NFLX) expenses Participations and Residuals in line with the amortization of production costs.

      "llm_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the estimated revenue life of each title (often up to 10 years) in proportion to the title’s realized revenue, whereas Netflix amortizes its content costs on an accelerated basis over the shorter of the title’s contractual window of availability or an estimated useful life of about 4 years, reflecting its subscription‑based, binge‑watch model. Consequently, Disney’s expense pattern aligns more closely with the actual consumption of revenue over a longer horizon, while Netflix’s expense pattern front‑loads amortization and matches its faster‑turnover content strategy.

(1) Quantitatively, the answer correctly states that Netflix amortizes content over about 4 years, aligning with the ground truth that over 90% of content is amortized within four years. While the LLM says 'roughly four years' instead of citing the 'over 90%' threshold, this is a reasonable simplification and does not distort the meaning. Disney's longer amortization period (up to 10 years) is consistent with revenue-based estimation, which matches the ground truth description of expensing based on current revenue to total estimated revenue. (2) The answer correctly identifies the key distinction: Disney aligns expenses with revenue patterns, while Netflix aligns them with production cost amortization, which is tied to a shorter, usage-driven pattern. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that Netflix’s model leads to front-loaded amortization due to its binge-watch, subscription-based strategy, which is logically consistent with the ground truth. (4) All entities (Disney/DIS, Netflix/NFLX, participations and residuals, amortization periods) are correctly identified and contrasted. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention that Netflix’s expense pattern is tied directly to the amortization of production costs (a nuance in mechanism), but the practical outcome—alignment with a ~4-year amortization—is accurately conveyed.

      "question": "What is the total cost basis of short-term investments reported by Costco (COST) in 2024, and how does this compare to The Coca-Cola Company's (KO) accounting policy for determining the cost basis of debt securities when classifying them as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale?",
      "original_answer": "Costco (COST) reported a total cost basis of $1,239 million for its short-term investments in 2024. The Coca-Cola Company (KO) determines the cost basis of its debt securities using the specific identification method. For KO, debt securities that the company intends to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost, while those classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax. This means that while COST's reported cost basis is straightforward and aggregated, KO applies a more nuanced policy based on classification, which affects how the cost basis translates into reported values on the balance sheet.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's total cost basis for short-term investments reported in 2024 was $1,239 million, which includes $689 million in available‑for‑sale securities and $550 million in held‑to‑maturity certificates of deposit. In contrast, The Coca‑Cola Company classifies debt securities as held‑to‑maturity when it has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity, carrying them at amortized cost; otherwise, such securities are measured at fair value (either trading or available‑for‑sale).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the total cost basis of $1,239 million for Costco's short-term investments in 2024 is correct. The breakdown into $689 million in available-for-sale securities and $550 million in held-to-maturity certificates of deposit sums to $1,239 million, which matches the ground truth total. These figures are reported accurately with acceptable formatting. (2) Regarding The Coca-Cola Company's accounting policy, the LLM correctly states that held-to-maturity securities are carried at amortized cost when the company has the intent and ability to hold them to maturity, and others are measured at fair value (either trading or available-for-sale). This aligns with the ground truth, though it omits the specific mention that KO uses the specific identification method for cost basis determination, which is a minor but notable omission in the qualitative detail. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly separates Costco's reported cost basis from Coca-Cola's accounting policy and draws a valid comparison in approach—aggregated cost basis vs. classification-dependent treatment. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent, as all parts of the question are addressed: Costco's cost basis in 2024 and Coca-Cola's policy for debt securities. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the omission of KO's use of the specific identification method, which is part of the ground truth and relevant to the cost basis determination. However, the core facts, numbers, and reasoning are correct and well-synthesized.",

The ground truth states the combined customer advances are $1,929 million, but the LLM reports a combined negative value of -$2,012 million. The LLM incorrectly treats customer advances as negative amounts (liabilities with negative signs), which contradicts standard financial reporting where liabilities are reported as positive values. (2) The individual numbers cited—$897 million for Caterpillar and $1,115 million for Emerson—are close in magnitude but incorrectly signed. Even if absolute values were used, their sum would be $2,012 million, which does not match the ground truth of $1,929 million, indicating possible outdated or incorrect data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model misinterprets the nature of the financial metric (customer advances as contract liabilities should be positive values), applies incorrect signs, and performs an arithmetic sum that does not align with verified data.

This results in a difference of $10,112 million.

According to the ground truth, HD reported a net deferred tax asset of $(230) million (a liability), not $247 million, and there was no mention of a valuation allowance for HD. The LLM incorrectly states that HD maintains a 'full allowance against its California deferred tax assets,' which is not supported by the original answer. Additionally, the difference in net deferred tax assets between TSLA and HD is $10,112 million, but this is not computed or mentioned in the LLM response. (2) Quantitatively, the TSLA figure of $9,882 million is correct, but HD's value is completely wrong: $247 million vs. the correct $(230) million. This leads to an incorrect basis for comparison and invalidates any derived conclusions. The valuation allowance for TSLA ($892 million) is not mentioned in the LLM answer, undermining the analysis. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM claims Tesla 'largely released' its valuation allowance due to positive evidence, but the original answer does not state this—it only notes the allowance was applied. For HD, the LLM fabricates a specific reserve for California, which is absent in the ground truth. The multi-hop synthesis fails because the model misrepresents both companies' tax positions.

      "original_answer": "American Express recognizes discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs and typically enters into fixed-period contracts with large merchants that range from three to seven years, often with auto-renewal features. In contrast, PayPal recognizes transaction revenue at the point of service and does not disclose entering into long-term fixed contracts with large merchants. Instead, PayPal notes that large merchants generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volumes, implying a more volume-driven and less contractually bound relationship. These differences suggest that American Express relies on longer-term contractual commitments from large merchants, while PayPal’s model appears more transactional and volume-based.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express records merchant‑discount fees as discount revenue at the moment a Card‑Member transaction occurs and recognizes it over the fixed‑term (typically 3‑7 year) contract, often on a daily basis; large‑merchant contracts may include auto‑renewal provisions.  \nPayPal recognizes transaction revenue when the payment is processed, but it also records a network‑rate fee received from third‑party acquirers at the time of the transaction; its large‑merchant agreements are generally for fixed periods with renewal clauses, and the associated revenue is recognized as the fee is earned.  \n\nThus, the key differences are: (1) timing of revenue recognition—Amex records discount revenue when the transaction occurs and spreads it over the contract term, whereas PayPal records its network‑rate fee at the point of transaction and recognizes it immediately; and (2) contract duration—American Express’s large‑merchant agreements are typically longer (3‑7 years) with possible auto‑renewal, while PayPal’s large‑merchant arrangements are also fixed‑period but are structured around individual acquirer negotiations and may have different renewal mechanics.",

This misrepresents a core aspect of the revenue model. Similarly, the LLM claims PayPal's large-merchant agreements are 'generally for fixed periods with renewal clauses,' but the original answer states PayPal does not disclose long-term fixed contracts, implying a more transactional, volume-based model without such commitments. These are major qualitative inaccuracies. (2) Quantitatively, the 3–7 year contract duration for American Express is correctly cited, and the timing of transaction recognition (at point of service) for PayPal is accurate. However, the incorrect characterization of revenue recognition timing—especially the claim that Amex spreads revenue over the contract—introduces a material error in financial logic. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in comparing the two companies on revenue timing and contract structure, but the synthesis is flawed because it draws conclusions from incorrect premises. The model fails to correctly contrast Amex's contractual, long-term model with PayPal's non-disclosed, volume-driven approach.

In contrast, Emerson Electric showed customer advances of $(897) million in 2023, representing a liability position where the company had collected customer payments in advance but had not yet fulfilled the associated obligations.

This is a major error, especially since the sign (negative vs. positive) and magnitude are both incorrect. Additionally, Caterpillar's $1,929 million is correctly reported but written as $1.929 billion (which is numerically equivalent), so that part is acceptable. However, the Emerson figure is not only wrong in amount but also mischaracterized—$(897) million indicates a net liability due to overcollection, while $1,860 million would imply a much larger advance liability, which is not supported by the truth. (2) The LLM references 'page 61' as a source, which is not part of the provided context and cannot be verified, introducing unverifiable information. (3) The qualitative reasoning attempts multi-hop synthesis by discussing revenue recognition and contract assets/liabilities, which shows an understanding of accounting concepts, but it misapplies them. The ground truth emphasizes that Emerson has a negative customer advance balance (i.e., net liability), while Caterpillar has a large positive advance balance—highlighting contrasting dynamics. The LLM fails to note the negative sign for Emerson, which is critical, and instead implies both have positive liabilities, undermining the core comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses customer advances and attempts to contrast accounting treatments, but due to incorrect data and flawed interpretation of Emerson’s position, the conclusion does not reflect the actual dynamic.

      "original_answer": "Merck recognized $4.0 billion in upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses in 2023 due to the nature of its pharmaceutical collaboration agreements, where such payments do not result in additional intellectual property rights and are tied to ongoing clinical studies that are highly likely to continue. This reflects a business model centered on drug development partnerships where upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In contrast, CVS defers and amortizes upfront payments received from vendors over the life of the contract based on sales volume or on a straight-line basis, depending on whether the payments are linked to purchase commitments. This reflects CVS's business model as a pharmacy services and retail provider with ongoing vendor relationships tied directly to product sales volume. The difference in accounting approaches highlights how Merck's payments are tied to development risk and innovation, while CVS's payments are tied to stable, volume-based supply chain agreements.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck records the $4.0 billion of upfront payments from Daiichi Sankyo as immediate R&D expense because the agreement provides for contingent milestone payments and the likelihood of program termination before those milestones is remote, so the upfront consideration is expensed rather than capitalized.

However, it incorrectly attributes the payment to Daiichi Sankyo without confirmation in the original answer, which does not specify the partner. This is a factual overreach. Additionally, while the LLM correctly states that CVS amortizes upfront payments over contract terms, it frames this as revenue recognition (implying CVS receives and spreads revenue), whereas the original answer clarifies these are payments *received from vendors* tied to purchase commitments, not revenue from partnerships. The LLM misses the key distinction that CVS’s model is tied to supply chain and sales volume, not partnership duration. (2) Quantitatively, the $4.0 billion figure is accurate and correctly attributed to 2023 in context (implied by the original answer), and no other numbers are introduced. (3) The reasoning partially captures the multi-hop contrast: Merck’s expensing reflects development risk, and CVS’s amortization reflects long-term contracts. But the LLM fails to fully synthesize the core difference—Merck’s payments relate to R&D innovation with no IP transfer, while CVS’s are volume-based supply chain incentives. The explanation lacks the depth of business model contrast (drug development vs. pharmacy retail/vendor rebates).

In contrast, TSLA elects not to present short-term leases (12 months or less) on the balance sheet, recognizing only long-term lease assets and liabilities.

It correctly states that TSLA only presents lease liabilities for terms longer than 12 months and references a specific long-term lease liability amount of $3,671 million as of 12/31/2023, which aligns with typical reporting practices (though this specific number is not in the original answer, it is plausible and contextually consistent with TSLA's selective recognition). The core financial treatment difference—HD including all relevant lease obligations vs. TSLA excluding short-term leases—is accurately conveyed. (2) Quantitatively, the $7,082 million figure for HD is correct. The $3,671 million figure for TSLA is not present in the original answer but may be factually accurate based on external data; since the original answer does not provide a specific number for TSLA’s long-term lease liabilities, the inclusion of this figure does not contradict the ground truth and appears to be a valid detail from the cited page (80). No calculation errors are present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two companies (HD and TSLA), compares their lease accounting policies under ASC 842, and draws a logical conclusion about balance sheet impact and comparability. The use of right-of-use assets and present-value methodology for TSLA adds contextual depth without introducing error. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original in terms of key facts and implications, with slightly more granular detail (e.g., page references, incremental borrowing rate). The only minor limitation is that it doesn’t explicitly mention the impact on total liabilities ($75,486 million) or explicitly state the effect on financial leverage ratios and comparability as the original does—this slight omission prevents a perfect 10.

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola's 2024 revenue distribution shows that 13.7% comes from Latin America and 10.8% from Asia Pacific, totaling 24.5%. Colgate's employee distribution indicates that 30% of its global workforce is based in Latin America and 33% in Asia Pacific, totaling 63% of its employees. Therefore, while Coca-Cola generates 24.5% of its revenue from these two regions, Colgate employs 63% of its global workforce in the same geographic areas.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined percentage of Coca-Cola's 2024 revenue from the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions is 24.5% (13.7% + 10.8%).

However, it incorrectly stated Colgate's employee distribution in Asia Pacific as 'roughly 17%', whereas the ground truth reports 33%. The Latin America figure (30%) is correct. This major error in Colgate's Asia Pacific employee percentage significantly undermines the accuracy. (2) Calculations: Coca-Cola's sum (13.7% + 10.8% = 24.5%) is accurate. Colgate's implied total (30% + 17% = 47%) is incorrect; the correct total from ground truth is 63% (30% + 33%). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identified the need to compare Coca-Cola's regional revenue with Colgate's regional employee distribution, showing appropriate synthesis across entities and metrics. However, due to the incorrect Colgate Asia Pacific figure, the comparison is flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the structure and intent align with the question, and qualitative reasoning is partially sound, but the quantitative inaccuracy in a core data point reduces correctness significantly. Hence, correctness and quantitative accuracy are scored mid-range, qualitative accuracy slightly higher due to correct logic framework, and contextual relevance high due to proper framing.",

      "question": "How does Apple's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations potentially impact its gross margins, and how does Intel's inventory valuation methodology affect its ability to manage gross margin volatility?",
      "original_answer": "Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations because a stronger U.S. dollar reduces the dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales, especially when it chooses not to raise international pricing. This directly affects its gross margins. Intel, on the other hand, manages gross margin volatility through its inventory valuation methodology, which involves forecasting demand and writing off excess or obsolete inventory when demand forecasts exceed actual demand. This impacts gross margins by adjusting the cost of goods sold based on inventory write-offs and manufacturing output decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations can negatively impact its gross margins in several ways. A weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar can reduce the dollar value of foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, potentially leading the company to raise international prices—which could reduce demand—or to refrain from raising prices, which would directly compress gross margins. Conversely, a strengthening of foreign currencies can increase the cost of foreign-sourced components, also pressuring gross margins, even as it benefits reported sales.\n\nIntel manages gross margin volatility in part through its inventory valuation methodology, which involves estimating obsolete or excess inventory based on demand forecasts and assessing write-downs when actual demand falls short. This process, combined with adjustments to depreciation schedules for manufacturing equipment and careful evaluation of long-lived assets and intangible assets for impairment, allows Intel to better align cost recognition with actual market conditions, thereby helping to stabilize gross margins amid fluctuating demand, pricing pressures, and technological changes.",

(1) It correctly identifies that Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted by foreign exchange fluctuations, particularly when a stronger U.S. dollar reduces the dollar value of foreign currency sales and the company chooses not to raise prices—this matches the original answer. The LLM adds nuance by noting that a weakening of foreign currencies can pressure margins through reduced sales value, and also mentions that strengthening foreign currencies could increase component costs, which is a reasonable extension supported by financial logic, though not explicitly in the ground truth. (2) No specific numbers, dates, or percentages are involved in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense—however, all qualitative financial mechanisms are correctly described, so the score of 10 is justified. (3) For Intel, the LLM accurately describes how inventory valuation methodology—specifically forecasting demand and writing down excess or obsolete inventory—affects gross margin volatility. It adds relevant context about depreciation schedules and impairment of long-lived assets, which, while not in the original answer, are consistent with GAAP inventory and asset valuation practices and enhance the explanation without introducing error. The core multi-hop reasoning—linking Intel's inventory practices to gross margin management—is sound and correctly synthesized. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both parts of the multi-part question with accurate entities (Apple, Intel), correct financial concepts (gross margins, FX exposure, inventory write-downs), and logical flow. The only reason for not giving a perfect 10 is that the original answer emphasizes Intel’s use of inventory write-offs specifically in response to demand forecast overages, which is slightly more precise than the LLM’s broader discussion of asset impairments—though not incorrect, it adds peripheral detail not in the ground truth.

Neither the individual components nor the final sum match the ground truth. (2) The quantitative values used in the LLM answer—$471 million for Colgate-Palmolive's unfunded benefit payments and $588 million for Coca-Cola's total benefit payments—are not aligned with the knowledge graph data. The correct values should have resulted in a sum of $683 million, indicating that at least one, and likely both, of the component figures are wrong. The arithmetic sum ($471M + $588M = $1,059M) is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model retrieves incorrect data for at least one of the companies. It correctly identifies that it needs to combine Colgate-Palmolive’s unfunded 2025 benefit payments with Coca-Cola’s 2025 total pension and postretirement benefit payments, showing understanding of the required synthesis.

According to the ground truth, AVGO's increase was $11,128 million and NVDA's was $1,704 million, resulting in a combined increase of $12,987 million. The LLM incorrectly reports AVGO's increase as $1,704 million (which is actually NVDA's correct increase) and NVDA's increase as $1,373 million (incorrect). The LLM also reports a total combined increase of $3,077 million, which is far below the correct total of $12,987 million. (2) The calculations are incorrect: the LLM appears to have miscalculated both companies' year-over-year changes and confused the values between companies. For example, it claims AVGO increased from $2,541M to $4,245M (a difference of $1,704M), but this value actually matches NVDA’s correct increase amount, not AVGO’s. Similarly, NVDA’s reported increase of $1,373M does not match the ground truth of $1,704M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed — the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize the correct 'Total Other Long-Term Liabilities' values for both companies across fiscal years 2023 and 2024. It also swaps or misattributes the correct figures between AVGO and NVDA. (4) Despite these major errors, the answer structure is relevant and attempts to address both parts of the question — the combined increase and which company had a higher increase — earning moderate points for contextual relevance.

In contrast, FedEx's 2024 report does not provide specific dollar amounts but notes that lower volumes contributed to reductions in purchased transportation costs, indicating a more qualitative, volume-driven narrative. This contrast suggests that UPS emphasizes granular cost visibility and segmentation, while FedEx focuses on strategic cost optimization through volume adjustments and operational efficiencies.",
      "llm_answer": "The contrast in disclosure detail about purchased transportation costs—where UPS provides a clear, standalone line item in its operating expense breakdown while FedEx only mentions it within broader operating expense tables and does not isolate it in narrative discussion—suggests that UPS places greater emphasis on transparency around cost drivers in its logistics operations. This level of detail may reflect UPS's focus on granular cost management and operational visibility, particularly in a volume-sensitive market where purchased transportation is a significant and variable expense. In contrast, FedEx's more integrated and less granular presentation indicates a different approach to cost reporting, potentially prioritizing consolidated performance metrics over detailed segment-level cost disclosures.

The absence of exact numbers is not a critical omission since the focus of the question is on the contrast in disclosure approach, not the specific calculation or use of those numbers. (2) The years (UPS 2022, FedEx 2024) and entities (UPS, FedEx) are correct. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that UPS’s detailed line-item reporting reflects a strategy of transparency and granular cost visibility, while FedEx’s lack of specific disclosure and reliance on narrative about volume-driven cost reductions suggests a more strategic, aggregated approach. This multi-hop synthesis across companies and reporting styles is logically valid. (4) The LLM captures the core insight—that UPS emphasizes transparency and segmentation while FedEx focuses on volume-based optimization—even if it phrases FedEx’s approach in terms of 'consolidated performance metrics' rather than explicitly stating 'qualitative, volume-driven narrative.'

Verizon's collateral payments of $712 million in 2024 are correctly reported. The difference between Disney's receipts and Verizon's payments is $3.388 billion according to the ground truth, but the LLM fails to compute or mention this difference.

No calculation of the difference is provided by the LLM. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present—the LLM attempts to contrast Disney’s net receipt position with Verizon’s net payment position, which aligns with the ground truth interpretation.

The LLM does not mention the explicit statement from Home Depot that the valuation allowance was 'not material,' which is a factual omission but not a numerical error. (2) On completeness: the LLM captures the core of both companies' strategies—Tesla’s use of VIEs to transfer credit risk and receive upfront cash, and Home Depot’s retention of receivables with an allowance for doubtful accounts. However, it omits the detail that Tesla consolidates the VIEs and retains decision-making power, which is a key aspect of the VIE structure per the ground truth.

(3) On entity accuracy: both companies are correctly identified, and the financial concepts (VIEs, allowance for doubtful accounts, credit risk management) are accurately applied. (4) On reasoning and semantic equivalence: the LLM correctly infers that Tesla outsources credit risk via securitization-like structures while Home Depot uses traditional internal risk management, which aligns with the ground truth’s conclusion about Tesla’s operational involvement versus Home Depot’s conservative, self-contained framework.

Coca-Cola, on the other hand, reported a significantly higher fair value of long-term debt at $38,052 million as of the same date. Coca-Cola’s disclosure also included context about the use of interest rate swaps to manage fair value exposure due to changes in benchmark interest rates, which directly affects the valuation of its debt. Additionally, Coca-Cola extinguished $485 million of long-term debt in 2024, resulting in a $22 million gain, suggesting active debt portfolio management. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive’s disclosure focused solely on valuation methodology without mentioning active debt restructuring or hedging activities. These differences indicate that while both companies report fair value for long-term debt, Coca-Cola’s disclosures suggest a more dynamic debt management strategy involving interest rate hedging and proactive debt retirement, whereas Colgate-Palmolive’s approach appears more static in terms of valuation and reporting.",

(1) Quantitatively, it falsely attributes to Colgate-Palmolive the $22 million gain from early extinguishment of $485 million debt — this actually belongs to Coca-Cola, not Colgate-Palmolive. The LLM also incorrectly states that Colgate-Palmolive uses interest-rate and cross-currency swaps for fair value adjustments, while the ground truth indicates no such hedging activities were disclosed by Colgate. Conversely, the LLM claims Coca-Cola has no discussion of swaps or early retirements, when in fact Coca-Cola explicitly disclosed both the use of interest rate swaps and the $22 million gain from extinguishing $485 million in debt. (2) These numerical misattributions are critical and completely undermine the answer’s validity. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is flawed: the LLM draws the opposite conclusion from the evidence — asserting Colgate uses active hedging and debt retirement, while portraying Coca-Cola as traditional — when the ground truth shows Coca-Cola is the one with dynamic debt management (swaps and early extinguishment), whereas Colgate’s disclosures were limited to valuation methodology without mention of such activities. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the general topic of debt management strategies and fair value disclosures, so it remains relevant in theme, but the factual inversion renders it substantively wrong. Due to complete failure in factual accuracy and multi-hop synthesis, the correctness score is near-zero.",

      "original_answer": "The difference in the 2024 healthcare cost trend rate assumption between DIS and VZ impacts their respective financial obligations related to postretirement medical plans by influencing the estimated future benefit payments and liabilities. VZ assumes a 2024 healthcare cost trend rate of 8.80%, which is significantly higher than the 4.50% rate to which it will gradually decline after 2034. This high initial assumption increases VZ’s projected healthcare costs and long-term liabilities. Meanwhile, DIS acknowledges that assumptions like the healthcare cost trend rate significantly affect reported net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations, though it does not specify its own rate. However, DIS also estimates $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts, which directly reduces its net future benefit payments. Therefore, while both companies are impacted by healthcare cost trend assumptions, VZ’s higher assumed rate increases its financial burden, whereas DIS benefits from subsidies that offset some of its obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 healthcare cost trend rate assumption differs between Disney (DIS) and Verizon (VZ). Disney uses a 7.00% rate that gradually declines to 4.00% by 2034, while Verizon's rate is higher at 8.80% for 2024 with a similar decline to 4.50% by 2034. This difference impacts the projected postretirement medical benefit obligations, with Verizon's higher trend rate assumption leading to larger projected medical expenses and thus greater financial obligations for retiree healthcare costs compared to Disney.",

It claims DIS uses a 7.00% healthcare cost trend rate declining to 4.00% by 2034, but the ground truth states that DIS does not specify its 2024 rate, only acknowledging the sensitivity of its obligations to such assumptions. This is a major error in quantitative and entity-specific information. VZ's 8.80% rate declining to 4.50% after 2034 is correctly stated. (2) The dollar amount of $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts for DIS, a key offsetting factor in the original answer, is completely omitted in the LLM response. This omission undermines the completeness and correctness of the comparison. (3) While the LLM correctly reasons that a higher trend rate increases financial obligations, it fails to incorporate the critical nuance that DIS benefits from subsidy receipts that reduce its net obligations—a key multi-hop element linking DIS’s financial strategy to its net liability. The reasoning is partially sound but based on incorrect input data for DIS. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core question about how differing trend rates affect obligations, and the direction of the impact (higher rate = higher liability) is logically correct. However, due to the incorrect attribution of DIS’s trend rate and omission of subsidy effects, the overall correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is poor due to false numbers; qualitative accuracy is moderate due to sound logic but flawed premises; contextual relevance remains strong as the structure and intent align with the question.",

      "original_answer": "As of December 2021, KO reported approximately 1,725,000 outstanding nonvested performance share units at the threshold award level, while PEP reported zero outstanding awards at the threshold level. This indicates that KO maintained a minimum guaranteed award level, whereas PEP's structure only supported awards at the target or higher performance levels. KO's approach suggests a more conservative compensation design that ensures some value delivery even under lower performance, while PEP's structure appears more performance-contingent, requiring at least target-level achievement to vest any awards.",
      "llm_answer": "KO and PEP differ in their Performance Share Unit (PSU) award structures primarily in the performance metrics used and the vesting periods. KO's PSUs (referenced in page 99) are tied to a three-year performance period with criteria including net operating revenues, earnings per share, and free cash flow, and include a relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) modifier that can adjust the final award up or down based on shareholder return relative to a comparator group. PEP's PSUs (referenced in page 92) also use three-year performance periods with similar financial metrics but emphasize \"earnings per share\" and \"free cash flow\" as adjusted by the Audit Committee, and similarly incorporate a TSR modifier for final award adjustments. Both companies use Monte Carlo models to value TSR-modified PSUs, but KO's disclosures highlight the specific performance criteria adjustments and the impact of strategic realignments on expense recognition, while PEP's focus is on the mechanics of award settlement and the role of the Talent and Compensation Committee in defining criteria. This reveals that both companies tie executive compensation to long-term performance and shareholder value, but KO's structure more explicitly integrates strategic realignment outcomes into its PSU design, whereas PEP emphasizes financial metric adjustments and TSR-based modifiers for final award determination.",

The original answer focuses on a key structural difference in PSU awards as of December 2021: KO had approximately 1,725,000 outstanding nonvested PSUs at the threshold level, while PEP had zero. This critical quantitative distinction is entirely missing from the LLM response. Instead, the LLM discusses performance metrics, vesting periods, TSR modifiers, and valuation models—details not present in the ground truth and not directly responsive to the question about structural differences in award levels. (2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: the LLM fails to report any of the key numbers (1.725M for KO, 0 for PEP), which are central to the comparison. There are no calculations in the LLM answer, but the omission of these specific figures constitutes a major factual gap. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The question requires comparing the existence (or absence) of threshold-level awards between two companies to infer executive compensation strategy. The LLM instead fabricates differences in performance metrics and governance processes that are not supported by the ground truth, failing to synthesize the actual data point that reveals KO has a guaranteed floor while PEP does not. (4) While the LLM stays on topic regarding executive compensation and PSUs, and mentions both companies and some plausible elements (e.g., TSR modifiers), it misses the fundamental insight about threshold awards and thus provides a factually incorrect basis for strategic interpretation. The conclusion about KO being more conservative and PEP more performance-contingent is correct in the ground truth but unsupported by the LLM's own reasoning.

This reverses the comparison and reports an incorrect magnitude. (2) The individual financial figures cited are partially accurate: Alphabet's increase from $74,842M to $84,293M is a correct $9,451M increase. However, Meta's reported increase from $116,609M to $134,902M is a $18,293M increase, which is inconsistent with the ground truth implication that Meta's growth must have been lower than Alphabet's. In fact, according to the ground truth, Alphabet's growth ($9,451M) should exceed Meta's, but the LLM claims Meta grew by $18,293M — nearly double Alphabet's growth — which invalidates the final conclusion. Either the input data provided to the LLM is incorrect, or it misread Meta's numbers.

The claimed combined growth of 4.3% is not supported by the data and misrepresents the actual dollar increase. (2) The financial figures are significantly off: JNJ’s actual sales were $7.1B (not $6.3B), and MDT’s were $8.959B (not $7.14B). The LLM also fabricates product-level data—SPRAVATO is reported as growing 84.1% to $689M, but the ground truth does not specify this figure; more critically, it attributes MDT’s growth to TREMFYA and CONCERTA, which are not MDT products—TREMFYA is a JNJ immunology drug, and CONCERTA is a JNJ ADHD medication. MDT (Medtronic) focuses on neuromodulation devices, not pharmaceuticals. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly synthesizes product dynamics, assigning drugs to the wrong companies and misrepresenting growth drivers.

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) adjusts the fair value of its derivative instruments for nonperformance risk using credit default swap (CDS) rates applied to each contract by counterparty, noting that this adjustment did not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values. PepsiCo (PEP) also reviews credit default swap rates as part of its counterparty credit risk assessment, which includes evaluating netting agreements and credit ratings. While neither company provides a specific dollar adjustment from CDS impacts, both incorporate CDS rates into their broader risk management and valuation frameworks for derivatives. The question highlights the shared methodology despite no explicit dollar impact being quantified.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca-Cola and PepsiCo incorporate credit default swap (CDS) rates into the valuation of their derivative instruments by applying an adjustment for nonperformance risk based on current CDS rates for each counterparty. This adjustment, which reflects the estimated impact of counterparty credit risk on the fair value of derivatives, was determined to not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of their derivative instruments. The combined impact of this adjustment on the fair value of their derivative assets and liabilities is not materially disclosed in the provided financial statements.",

(1) It correctly states that both Coca-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) use credit default swap (CDS) rates to adjust for nonperformance risk in derivative valuations, applying them by counterparty. The key qualitative point—that the adjustment did not have a significant impact on fair values—is accurately reflected. (2) There are no specific dollar amounts or numerical figures in the original answer, and the LLM correctly notes that the combined impact is not materially disclosed, which matches the ground truth’s emphasis that no explicit dollar impact is quantified. Thus, quantitative accuracy is perfect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across both companies, correctly identifying shared methodology in using CDS rates within derivative valuation frameworks, while acknowledging the absence of a disclosed combined financial impact. (4) The only minor limitation is that the LLM slightly condenses PepsiCo’s broader risk assessment (which includes netting agreements and credit ratings), but this does not detract from the core accuracy.

It incorrectly assigns $590.9 million to TXN and $241 million to ACN, reversing the actual values from the ground truth (ACN: $590,892; TXN: $241). This leads to a grossly incorrect combined total of $831.9 million instead of the correct $591,133. The 2023 figures are also reversed: LLM states ACN had $285 million and TXN $434.2 million, while the truth is ACN: $434,179 and TXN: $285. Although the 2023 total is approximately correct ($719.2 million vs. $719,179), this appears coincidental due to reversal and unit inflation. (2) The LLM treats the values as millions of dollars when the original figures are in thousands or units (e.g., $590,892 is ~$0.59 million, not $590.9 million). This introduces errors of magnitude. The calculation of the 2024 total is wrong both in inputs and scale. The comparison claim that 2024 is lower than 2023 is correct in direction but based on incorrect data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly identify or synthesize the lease asset values per company per year, swaps entities, and misrepresents scale. It fails to accurately pull and combine data across ACN and TXN for both years. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative inaccuracy (2) due to magnitude and reversal errors; low qualitative accuracy (3) as reasoning is flawed despite attempting comparison; moderate contextual relevance (6) because it addresses the right topic and comparison direction, but with wrong data.

The ground truth states the combined total is $1.407595 trillion (or 1,407.595 billion), while the LLM reports $1,400 billion, which is a difference of approximately $7.595 billion. This underreporting is substantial enough to affect financial analysis, especially in high-precision contexts. (2) The calculation should have summed MET's and WFC's 2023 deposits to reach 1,407.595 billion; the LLM either rounded excessively or miscalculated. While rounding to the nearest hundred billion might be acceptable in some contexts, the loss of nearly $7.6 billion in precision is not justifiable without explicit indication of rounding. (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the model correctly identified the two entities (Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and Wells Fargo & Company), the correct metric (2023 deposits), and performed a multi-hop synthesis by combining data from both companies. There is no confusion in entity or metric identification. (4) Contextual relevance is perfect—the answer directly addresses the question and expresses the result in billions as requested.

This represents a major quantitative and qualitative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—LLM attempts to sum two companies' sales and compare growth rates—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval or synthesis.

The combined Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) is incorrectly calculated as $188,424 (should be $189,024), due to a summation error: $188,359 + $65 = $189,024, not $188,424. This is a significant calculation mistake. Accenture’s Net Income is reported as $7,264,787 in the LLM answer, but the ground truth is $7,419,197—a difference of over $150,000, which affects the accuracy of the comparison. Texas Instruments’ Net Income is listed as $4,799 without units, though context implies millions (correct in ground truth as $4,799 million), which is acceptable but imprecise. (2) The calculation of the combined OCI is wrong, and the Net Income figures are not fully accurate, undermining quantitative reliability. The percentage comparison (implied minor portion) is qualitatively reasonable but not numerically substantiated in the LLM response.

      "original_answer": "Boeing's financial exposure is highly sensitive to changes in gross margins, where a 1% change in margin could result in a $330 million impact on operating earnings due to its reliance on firm orders and complex estimation process for program profitability. Raytheon, with a $78 billion defense backlog as of December 31, 2023, also depends on firm orders to drive future revenue and operational planning. A decline in firm orders would reduce Raytheon’s future revenue visibility and could impact its ability to manage long-term contracts efficiently, while Boeing would face direct earnings volatility due to its margin sensitivity and program cost structures. Together, both companies face significant financial risk if firm orders decrease, though the mechanisms differ—Boeing through margin volatility and Raytheon through reduced backlog conversion.",
      "llm_answer": "The change in firm orders directly influences the financial exposure of Boeing and Raytheon through their long‑term contract accounting and backlog dynamics. Boeing’s gross‑margin sensitivity of roughly $330 million means that any shift in firm orders that alters estimated program margins would materially affect its pre‑tax earnings, especially on fixed‑price development programs such as the VC‑25B, KC‑46A, and 737‑MAX. Raytheon’s $78 billion defense backlog provides a large, relatively stable revenue foundation, but its operating profit is still vulnerable to order‑book mix changes; unfavorable earnings‑change (EAC) adjustments on fixed‑price contracts can erode margins, and the company’s defense bookings are a key driver of future net sales and operating profit. Consequently, while Raytheon’s massive backlog cushions short‑term volatility, both firms face significant earnings exposure if firm‑order trends shift the assumptions used to estimate contract revenues, costs, and margins.",

No incorrect numbers or dates are present. (2) The answer addresses all parts of the multi-hop question: it explains how changes in firm orders affect Boeing via margin sensitivity and program cost structures (especially on fixed-price contracts), and how Raytheon’s financial exposure is tied to backlog stability and future revenue visibility. (3) Entities are correctly identified—Boeing (BA), Raytheon Technologies (RTX), relevant financial metrics (margin sensitivity, backlog), and time reference (implied 2023 year-end via backlog figure).

The LLM adds contextual depth by naming specific Boeing programs (VC-25B, KC-46A, 737-MAX), which, while not in the original answer, are plausible examples and do not detract from accuracy. The only minor gap is that the original emphasizes Boeing’s 'direct earnings volatility' versus Raytheon’s 'reduced backlog conversion' as distinct risk mechanisms, which the LLM captures implicitly but could have stated more explicitly.

(2) The calculation itself ($1,417M - $999M = $418M) is arithmetically correct, but it is based on incorrect source numbers, making the quantitative output invalid. Furthermore, the ground truth suggests a much larger disparity, indicating that either ACN or TXN (or both) have materially different committed payments than reported by the LLM. (3) The reasoning framework is sound—comparing total committed payments from each company’s 2024 10-K—but fails in execution due to incorrect data extraction. The model attempts the necessary multi-hop synthesis (pulling data from two different filings and computing a difference), but the underlying data is inaccurate, undermining the conclusion.

In contrast, UPS specifically excludes five distinct categories: goodwill and asset impairment charges, a one-time compensation payment to supervisors, a regulatory matter expense, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal expense, and defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses.

In contrast, 3M's disclosures focus on excluding \"special items\" like litigation costs, divestiture gains, PFAS-related matters, and restructuring charges, but its page 18-22 content does not specify exclusions matching UPS's detailed list of operational exclusions.

      "original_answer": "COF organizes its risk management around a Framework supported by the right culture, talent, and skills, with seven major risk categories. Associates across the first, second, and third lines of defense are responsible for managing these risks. In contrast, SCHW has a more structured committee-based approach, with the Operational Risk Oversight Committee providing governance for operational risk, including subcommittees covering Information Security, Cybersecurity, Technology, Fraud, Third-Party Risk, Data Integrity, and Model Governance. SCHW’s governance also includes risk appetite statements, tolerance levels, and metrics established by the Global Risk Committee and its subcommittees, which are reviewed and approved by senior management and the Board Risk Committee.",
      "llm_answer": "The governance structure for managing the Operational Risk Segment differs between COF and SCHW in terms of committee oversight and risk categories addressed. At COF, the Operational Risk Management Program is overseen by the Chief Operational Risk Officer in collaboration with the CTRO, with risk categories covering internal/external fraud, cyber and technology risk, data management, model risk, third-party management, and business continuity, and reporting flows to senior leaders, the executive committee, and the Board. In contrast, SCHW's risk governance includes a dedicated Operational Risk Oversight Committee within its Global Risk Committee structure, which approves operational risk policies, tolerance levels, and governance processes, while also integrating operational risk management within its broader ERM Framework that encompasses seven major risk categories including operational risk, and reports to the Board Risk Committee and Global Risk Committee.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct in structure and captures the key contrast between COF and SCHW in operational risk governance, with accurate entity identification and contextual relevance. Quantitatively, there are no numbers, dates, or financial figures to verify, so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10. Contextual relevance is strong—the response directly addresses the question about governance differences, committee oversight, and risk categories. However, qualitative accuracy is slightly reduced due to inaccuracies in the description of COF’s governance structure. The original answer states that COF’s risk management is based on a Framework supported by culture, talent, and skills, with seven major risk categories managed across three lines of defense, but does not mention a 'Chief Operational Risk Officer' or 'CTRO'—these specific roles and acronyms are not in the ground truth and may be fabricated or inferred incorrectly. Additionally, while the LLM lists several risk categories for COF, the original does not specify them, instead referring to seven major categories without naming them. In contrast, the description of SCHW is more accurate: it correctly identifies the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, its subcommittees (implied through listing), and the role of the Global Risk Committee and Board Risk Committee. The LLM also correctly notes risk appetite, tolerance, and metrics governance, though it condenses the flow of approval. Overall, core facts about SCHW are correct and the contrast is reasonably presented, but the unsupported details about COF’s structure and risk categories reduce the qualitative and overall correctness scores.",

All values match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation of the combined payable ($1,753 + $4,079 = $5,832 million) is accurate. However, the LLM answer omits the explicit comparison of the combined liability to the combined total current assets (i.e., $5,832 / $48,279 ≈ 12.1%), which was part of the original answer and directly addressed the second part of the question. While it notes that the liability is 'significantly smaller' than the individual current assets, it does not compute or mention the 12.1% ratio, missing a key analytical point. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—correctly identifying and summing payables across two companies and referencing their respective current assets. However, the synthesis is incomplete as it fails to combine the current assets ($9,497 + $38,782 = $48,279 million) and compute the percentage, which is a required part of the comparison.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of self-insurance liabilities for Amazon and Lowe's as of their respective fiscal years ended in 2024 is $8.932 billion. Amazon reported $8.5 billion in self-insurance liabilities, while Lowe's reported $432 million. This significant disparity reveals that Amazon assumes a much larger self-insured risk exposure compared to Lowe's, which may reflect Amazon's broader operational scale, more complex global logistics network, and higher employee base, all of which contribute to greater potential liabilities that the company retains rather than insuring through third-party providers.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in the quantitative values. According to the ground truth, Amazon's self-insurance liabilities are $8.5 billion, not $966 million as stated in the LLM answer. Lowe's value of $432 million is correct. The combined total in the ground truth is $8.932 billion, whereas the LLM calculates a sum of $1.398 billion ($966M + $432M), which is significantly off due to the incorrect Amazon figure. (2) The date for Amazon’s filing is listed as January 31, 2025, which corresponds to fiscal year 2024 (correct contextually), so the time period is accurate. However, the dollar amount is grossly inaccurate—$966 million vs. $8.5 billion is an error by nearly a factor of 9. This undermines all downstream analysis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to combine data from both companies and draw a comparative insight about risk exposure—but because it is based on incorrect data, the conclusion is misleading. The reasoning that Amazon has higher self-insurance exposure is directionally correct, but the magnitude and supporting data are wrong. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses both parts of the question: total liabilities and interpretation of risk exposure. However, the severe numerical inaccuracy drastically reduces correctness. The qualitative reasoning is partially valid but built on false premises. Thus, the correctness score is low due to the critical error in Amazon’s liability figure.",

While it correctly states that Boeing received $1.7 billion in tax refunds from the CARES Act in 2021, it incorrectly claims Union Pacific made net tax payments of $1.5 billion, whereas the ground truth specifies only $12 million. This is a significant error in magnitude. The resulting difference in tax-related cash flows is also wrong: the LLM calculates $3.2 billion ($1.7B inflow vs $1.5B outflow), but the correct difference is $1,712 million ($1,700M + $12M), as Boeing had a $1.7B inflow and Union Pacific a $12M outflow. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the $1.5B figure for Union Pacific is off by over two orders of magnitude. Calculations based on incorrect inputs cannot be accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to compare tax cash flows between two companies and compute a difference—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Union Pacific. The synthesis structure is correct, but the factual foundation is flawed.

Sam's Club, as a segment of Walmart, receives the majority of its non-fuel merchandise through 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically across the U.S., along with some shared Walmart U.S. distribution facilities. This robust and strategically placed distribution infrastructure enables Sam's Club to efficiently receive and stock merchandise, including PEP's products, at scale.

There are no calculations required beyond correct reporting of these figures, which the LLM handles precisely. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links Sam's Club’s distribution infrastructure to Walmart’s broader supply chain, and then to PepsiCo’s revenue dependency. It captures the causal chain—efficient distribution enables large-scale sales, supporting significant revenue reliance—though it omits a minor but relevant detail from the ground truth: that some shared Walmart U.S. distribution facilities are also used, and that concentrate sales to independent bottlers contribute to the revenue stream sold to Walmart. This omission slightly reduces completeness but does not distort the overall logic. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent in intent and meaning, with concise and relevant reasoning. The contextual relevance is perfect, directly addressing how infrastructure supports revenue dependency.

MMM's correct long-term lease obligation is $405 million (total lease liabilities minus current obligations), not $3,635 million. The LLM also incorrectly applies a subtraction of current obligations ($405M - $163M) for MMM that is not supported by the ground truth, which directly reports MMM's long-term lease obligation as $405M.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, Netflix reported hedging gains of $124 million, which were included in 'Streaming revenues' and primarily related to foreign exchange hedges on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing/production costs denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Google reported hedging gains of $211 million as part of its total revenues of $350,018 million, reflecting gains from its foreign exchange risk management activities. Netflix's hedging directly impacts both revenue and cost of revenues depending on the nature of the hedged item, while Google's hedging gains appear as a separate line item before being incorporated into total revenues. Given that Netflix's international revenue (excluding the U.S. and Canada) accounted for the majority of its streaming revenue, the $124 million gain suggests a more targeted approach to managing revenue volatility from foreign exchange movements. Google's larger hedging gains relative to Netflix, despite having a much larger revenue base, may indicate a more extensive or aggressive hedging program to manage its global exposure across multiple business lines.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Netflix and Google reported hedging gains of $124 million and $211 million respectively in 2024, which represent a modest offset to the foreign‑exchange volatility embedded in their international revenue streams.  For Google, the $211 million gain is a small fraction of its $350 billion total revenue (≈0.06 %) and roughly 2 % of the $10.5 billion of foreign‑currency exposure implied by its APAC and Other Americas growth rates, indicating that its hedging program only partially mitigates FX risk.  Netflix’s $124 million gain similarly offsets a limited portion of its overseas earnings, especially given the company’s heavy reliance on international subscriber growth.  Consequently, while both firms use derivative hedges to smooth earnings, the relative size of their hedging gains suggests that their foreign‑exchange risk management strategies are primarily defensive—aimed at reducing volatility rather than materially improving profitability.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer captures the core idea that both Netflix and Google reported hedging gains in 2024 and attempts to contextualize them relative to revenue and FX risk, but contains significant quantitative inaccuracies and omissions. First, the claim that Google's $211 million gain is 'roughly 2% of the $10.5 billion of foreign-currency exposure implied by its APAC and Other Americas growth rates' introduces a figure ($10.5 billion) and calculation not supported by the original answer or standard SEC disclosures—this is speculative and factually unsupported. The original answer does not mention any implied FX exposure amount for Google, so this calculation fails the quantitative accuracy test. Second, while the total revenues for Google ($350 billion) are approximately correct (actual: $350,018 million), the LLM rounds it to $350 billion without noting the exact figure, which is acceptable, but then derives a percentage (0.06%) that distracts from the actual structure of reporting. More critically, the original answer emphasizes *how* each company accounts for hedging gains—Netflix includes them in 'Streaming revenues' and they relate to both revenue and cost hedges, while Google reports them as a separate line before total revenues. This key qualitative distinction in accounting treatment and risk management approach is entirely missing in the LLM answer. Additionally, the original highlights that Netflix’s international revenue constitutes the majority of its streaming revenue, making the $124 million gain significant in context and indicative of a targeted strategy—this insight is underdeveloped in the LLM response, which only vaguely references 'overseas earnings' and 'subscriber growth.' The LLM concludes both strategies are 'defensive,' which is reasonable, but misses the nuanced contrast in scope and integration of hedging (Netflix: targeted on revenue/costs; Google: broader, larger gains but proportionally small). Thus, while the answer is contextually relevant and attempts multi-hop reasoning, it introduces unsupported calculations and omits key differentiating factors in accounting and strategy, reducing its correctness.",

It reports GD's 2021 non-current assets as $67,214 million and RTX's pension plan non-current assets as $1,370 million, leading to a total of $68,584 million, which is vastly different from the ground truth of $6,811 million. These numbers are off by an order of magnitude and are therefore factually incorrect. (2) The quantitative accuracy is extremely low: the reported values do not match the ground truth, and the sum is incorrect. Even allowing for format variations, the numbers are not plausibly close. The correct combined value is $6,811 million, meaning the LLM's total is over 10 times larger than it should be. (3) While the LLM attempts multi-hop reasoning by identifying noncurrent assets from two companies (GD and RTX) and attempting to sum them, the underlying data extraction is fundamentally flawed. It likely misread the financial statements, possibly confusing total assets with noncurrent assets or misidentifying line items. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the model correctly interprets the question structure, identifies the right companies and fiscal year, and attempts to cite specific pages and perform the correct operation (addition).

The original question asks for the *total* investment banking fees incurred by *both Danaher and Merck*. The ground truth answer is $154 million, implying that Merck incurred $9 million in such fees (or Danaher’s portion attributed to investment banking was lower and combined with Merck totals $154M). However, the LLM only discusses Danaher, omitting Merck entirely. (2) The number $145 million is accurate for Danaher’s total separation costs (as per context), but the answer does not isolate investment banking fees specifically, nor does it include Merck’s fees. Thus, the quantitative total is incorrect for the question asked. There is no calculation error per se, but an incomplete data synthesis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires aggregating investment banking fees from *two companies* (Danaher and Merck) related to corporate separation in 2023. The LLM only addresses one company and does not extract or infer Merck’s fees, failing the multi-hop requirement.

      "original_answer": "PEP's 2021 consolidated net revenue included approximately 13% from sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club. This dependency is significant because Walmart organizes its operations into three reportable segments, one of which is Sam's Club, indicating that a portion of PEP's revenue is tied to Walmart’s warehouse membership club business in the U.S. This shows a direct financial link between PEP and the Sam's Club segment within Walmart’s broader corporate structure.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, PEP's 2021 consolidated net revenue included approximately 13% from sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam's Club), as noted in the \"Our Customers\" section on page 9. This financial dependency connects to Walmart's reportable segments through the structure of Walmart's own reporting: Walmart U.S. (which includes Sam's Club) reported $393,247 million in net sales for fiscal 2022 (and $369,963 million for fiscal 2021), while Sam's Club (a distinct reportable segment) reported $73,556 million in net sales for fiscal 2022.

All numeric values related to Walmart’s segments—$369,963 million for Walmart U.S. in fiscal 2021 and $73,556 million for Sam's Club in fiscal 2022—are factually accurate and correctly cited from the source documents. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 13% dependency is correctly stated, and the financial figures for Walmart’s segments are reported accurately with proper units and fiscal years. The LLM references fiscal 2021 for Walmart U.S. net sales appropriately, aligning with the question’s focus on PEP’s 2021 revenue. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM connects PEP’s customer dependency to Walmart’s organizational structure, correctly noting that Sam's Club is a distinct reportable segment within Walmart. It appropriately cites Walmart’s own segment disclosures to reinforce the structural separation, thereby validating the financial linkage. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM introduces Walmart U.S. as a segment that includes Sam's Club, which contradicts Walmart’s actual structure—Sam's Club is a separate segment from Walmart U.S.—but this does not undermine the core point about PEP’s revenue being tied to a distinct Sam's Club segment. This nuance slightly affects qualitative accuracy but does not invalidate the overall reasoning. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing both the percentage and the connection to Walmart’s segment structure. The synthesis across PEP’s customer disclosures and Walmart’s segment reporting demonstrates strong multi-hop understanding. The correctness score is 9 due to the minor mischaracterization of Walmart’s segment hierarchy, but all key facts and financial dependencies are accurately conveyed.",

      "original_answer": "Cisco accounts for variability in its cooperative marketing programs by estimating expected usage of these programs, applying either the expected value or most likely estimate method, and updates these estimates at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. This directly impacts their revenue recognition, as deviations from these estimates could adversely affect revenue. Intel, on the other hand, participates in cooperative advertising and marketing programs that partially reimburse customers for marketing activities, and these expenses are accounted for as part of their operating expenditures. While Intel does not explicitly quantify the variability impact, these programs are subject to defined criteria and influence marketing spend forecasting and brand investment returns.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Cisco and Intel treat cooperative marketing programs as variable‑consideration elements in their revenue‑recognition models. Cisco estimates the expected usage of these programs (rebates, co‑op advertising credits, etc.) based on historical utilization and updates the estimate each reporting period; any deviation from that estimate can materially affect the amount of revenue recognized. Intel similarly uses an expected‑value approach for its co‑marketing rebates and credits, adjusting the estimate when actual program participation differs from the forecast, which can also cause fluctuations in reported revenue. In each company’s financial statements, the resulting revenue adjustments are recorded as part of the “variable consideration” component of their revenue‑recognition policies and can cause corresponding changes in net sales, gross margin, and operating income.",

While Cisco's approach is accurately described—estimating expected usage of cooperative marketing programs using expected value or most likely amount, updating estimates periodically, and recognizing the impact on revenue—the LLM incorrectly states that Intel treats these programs as part of variable consideration in revenue recognition. According to the ground truth, Intel accounts for its cooperative marketing programs as operating expenditures, not as a reduction of revenue. These are costs incurred to support customer marketing activities and are recorded as selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) or marketing expenses, not as variable consideration affecting net sales. Therefore, deviations do not directly impact revenue recognition or gross margin as implied. The LLM answer incorrectly aligns Intel’s model with Cisco’s revenue-centric approach, which misrepresents Intel’s financial statement impact. There are no numerical values in the question or answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. The reasoning is logically consistent within the incorrect framework, but the multi-hop synthesis fails because it does not distinguish between revenue-side (Cisco) and expense-side (Intel) treatments.

This is reflected in the “Right‑of‑use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities” table where pre‑payments are part of the ROU asset amount.\n\n- **Raytheon Technologies (RTX)** – The RTX 10‑K excerpts (pages 75‑79) describe lease pre‑payments as part of the “initial direct costs” that are included in the ROU asset, but they are not highlighted as a separate component; the focus is on the present value of lease payments and variable lease payments, with pre‑payments implicitly folded into the ROU asset calculation without a distinct disclosure. \n\nThus, both companies incorporate lease pre‑payments in the ROU asset, but GD explicitly calls out pre‑payments as a component of the ROU asset calculation, whereas RTX treats them as part of the broader initial direct costs without a separate emphasis.",

The LLM also misrepresents the comparison: it claims the sum exceeds NFLX’s 2024 Revenues ($39,000,966k), but in reality, $21,043,945k is only about 53.96% of $39,000,966k — less than half, not more. (2) Number formats use 'k' suffix (e.g., $21,038,464k), implying thousands, which would make values billions — a critical error.

The original answer states $5,736,947,000 — the same number without the 'in thousands' clarification. However, the LLM incorrectly implies that $5,736,947 is the value in thousands, which would mean a total of ~$5.7 trillion — off by a factor of 1,000. This is a severe numerical misrepresentation. The correct figure is $5,736,947,000, and while the digits match, the unit handling makes this misleading and factually inaccurate. (2) On qualitative accuracy, the LLM correctly identifies that T does not report a standalone 'Other Cost of Revenues' line item and instead amortizes deferred customer contract fulfillment costs into other categories, particularly linking them to 'Other cost of revenues' and 'Selling, general and administrative' expenses. It accurately contrasts NFLX’s explicit disclosure with T’s integrated reporting approach, showing proper multi-hop reasoning across both 10-Ks. (3) Contextually, the answer is highly relevant, citing specific pages and sections from both filings, and addresses both parts of the question: the NFLX dollar amount and the structural difference in T’s reporting. (4) Despite strong reasoning and contextual alignment, the numerical error undermines the core factual claim, warranting a moderate correctness score. The qualitative and contextual strengths prevent a lower score, but the quantitative inaccuracy is too significant to score above 6.",

      "question": "How do elevated commodity costs impact both General Motors' electric vehicle raw material sourcing strategy and McDonald's restaurant profitability, given their respective exposures as detailed in their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "original_answer": "Elevated commodity costs impact General Motors by increasing the cost of EV raw materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt, which are essential for their transition to electric vehicles. GM's sourcing strategy involves securing supply through long-term commitments and higher inventory levels, which exposes them to increased costs due to market volatility and government policies. Similarly, McDonald's profitability is affected by rising commodity costs for ingredients like beef, chicken, and pork, which are subject to volatility due to climate conditions, global demand, and regulatory factors. These increased costs cannot be fully mitigated through hedging, directly affecting restaurant profitability. Both companies face financial risks from commodity cost fluctuations, though the specific materials and mitigation strategies differ based on their industries.",
      "llm_answer": "Elevated commodity costs are expected to pressure both companies’ profitability: GM notes that higher prices for raw materials such as steel, aluminum, copper, lithium and other EV‑critical minerals increase production expenses and could force the company to hold larger inventories or accept less favorable supply terms, while McDonald’s highlights that commodity price volatility for items like beef, chicken and pork can directly erode restaurant margins and that hedging only partially mitigates the risk. Both filings stress that these cost pressures are tied to broader macro‑economic conditions and supply‑chain constraints, making them a material risk to earnings.",

McDonald's exposure to beef, chicken, and pork price volatility and partial hedging limitations are also correctly stated. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers requiring verification—both responses are qualitative and consistent. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes information from both GM and McDonald’s 2023 10-Ks, comparing their differing but parallel exposures to commodity cost pressures. The answer links macroeconomic and supply chain factors as common drivers, which reflects the intended cross-company analysis. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the LLM omits explicit mention of GM’s long-term supply commitments (a key part of their sourcing strategy) and does not name all specific materials (e.g., cobalt), though 'other EV-critical minerals' provides reasonable coverage.

      "original_answer": "Boeing has an indefinite environmental indemnification liability with no recorded amount due to uncertainty about future claims related to its BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas, and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma. Union Pacific's environmental liability is influenced by factors like remediation type, contaminant volume, and regulatory changes, though specific figures are not disclosed. Both companies face uncertain environmental liabilities, but Boeing's exposure is tied to specific facility sales without a recorded value, while Union Pacific's liability is shaped by broader operational and regulatory factors.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's indefinite environmental indemnification liability for its BCA facilities in Kansas and Oklahoma is disclosed in Note 17 of the 10‑K (page 103), where it states that the company agreed to indemnify buyers for costs relating to pre‑closing environmental conditions at those sites and cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments, so no liability has been recorded. In contrast, Union Pacific’s environmental liability is described in its own 10‑K (pages 46‑50) as being tied to specific remediation techniques and subject to change as regulatory requirements evolve, resulting in a quantifiable environmental liability balance of $243 million (2021) with an open‑site count of 376 and a recorded liability that can be tracked and measured. Thus, Boeing’s exposure is indefinite and unquantifiable, whereas Union Pacific’s liability is a known, measurable amount influenced by ongoing remediation technology choices and regulatory shifts.",

This number ($243M) is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth, making it an unsupported addition. Additionally, the mention of '376 open sites' is not in the original answer and introduces unverified detail. On qualitative accuracy, the LLM correctly identifies Boeing's indefinite indemnification liability with no recorded amount due to uncertainty, citing the correct rationale (inability to estimate future payments) and referencing the correct context (facility sales in Kansas and Oklahoma). It also correctly contrasts Boeing's unquantified exposure with Union Pacific's liability being influenced by remediation and regulation. The reasoning is logically structured and addresses the comparative nature of the question. Contextually, the answer is highly relevant, citing appropriate sections of the 10-Ks and focusing on the right comparison points. However, the introduction of specific, unsupported figures undermines the quantitative accuracy significantly. While the core contrast (indefinite vs. measurable) is conceptually valid, the claim that Union Pacific's liability is 'known' and 'measurable' goes beyond the ground truth, which explicitly states that 'specific figures are not disclosed'.

      "original_answer": "Costco noted that changes in foreign exchange rates impacted their Net Sales Growth by affecting the conversion of international financial results into U.S. dollars, though no specific percentage was provided. In contrast, Procter & Gamble disclosed that foreign exchange had a 2% positive impact on their total company Net Sales Growth in fiscal year 2022.

      "llm_answer": "Costco's net sales growth was positively impacted by foreign exchange rate changes in its international operations, as evidenced by the \"Increases in comparable sales excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency and gasoline prices\" table showing that Canada and Other International segments had higher growth rates when excluding currency effects (e.g., Canada's comparable sales growth was 12% excluding currency vs. 15% reported, and Other International was 10% vs. 13%). In contrast, Procter & Gamble's total company performance showed no meaningful impact from foreign exchange on its overall net sales growth, as its reported net sales growth of 5% (from the organic sales growth table) was unaffected by currency adjustments, with the \"Foreign Exchange Impact\" column showing 0% for all categories including the total company.

      "original_answer": "Cisco (CSCO) records a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments in excess of future demand forecasts, aligning with its valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. This suggests a proactive financial recognition of inventory risk stemming from fixed supplier agreements. In contrast, Intel (INTC) emphasizes judgment and sensitivity analyses in its inventory valuation, particularly for excess and obsolete inventory, due to factors like dynamic pricing, customer forecasts, and limited historical data for new product launches. Intel’s audit process involves extensive testing of demand forecasts and pricing assumptions, indicating a more analytical and forward-looking approach to inventory risk. The $11.1 billion net inventory figure for Intel further underscores the scale and complexity of its inventory management challenges compared to Cisco’s more commitment-driven risk exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco's inventory valuation approach emphasizes proactive supply‑chain risk mitigation, reflected in its detailed discussion of excess and obsolete inventory reserves, extensive purchase commitments, and the use of firm, non‑cancelable contracts to secure component supply, whereas Intel relies on a more conservative, audit‑driven framework that treats inventory at the lower of cost‑or‑net realizable value with a focus on first‑in‑first‑out costing and less explicit reserve disclosure. Consequently, Cisco’s strategy signals heightened vigilance over inventory obsolescence tied to rapid technology cycles and supply constraints, while Intel’s approach underscores compliance with rigorous audit standards and a disciplined, principle‑based assessment of inventory realizability.",

It also correctly notes Intel’s use of lower of cost or net realizable value and FIFO costing, which are consistent with audit-driven frameworks. There are no numeric values in the LLM answer, so no quantitative errors are present—hence a perfect quantitative accuracy score. (2) However, the LLM misrepresents Intel’s approach as 'conservative' and 'less explicit reserve disclosure,' which contradicts the ground truth stating Intel uses 'judgment and sensitivity analyses' with 'extensive testing of demand forecasts and pricing assumptions'—indicating a more analytical, not less transparent, process. The ground truth also highlights Intel’s $11.1 billion net inventory, a key detail reflecting scale and complexity, which the LLM omits entirely. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking inventory practices to supply chain and audit considerations—but fails to accurately synthesize Intel’s forward-looking analytical approach versus Cisco’s commitment-driven liability recognition. The LLM incorrectly frames Intel as more 'audit-driven' in a compliance sense rather than emphasizing its reliance on forecasting models and sensitivity analyses.

      "original_answer": "AIG reclassified a $37.6 billion loan receivable from AIGFP, which was deconsolidated following its Chapter 11 filing, while Schwab issued $6.2 billion in senior notes to prepare for upcoming maturities and to maintain liquidity during the TD Ameritrade integration. AIG’s action was tied to a restructuring event involving a formerly consolidated subsidiary with a full allowance for credit losses, indicating a reactive and potentially high-risk situation. In contrast, Schwab’s issuance was a proactive liquidity management strategy in a rising interest rate environment.

      "original_answer": "A 10% across-the-board reduction in U.S. defense appropriations would directly impact both General Dynamics and Raytheon Technologies due to their heavy reliance on federal funding. For General Dynamics, which reported that 70% of its 2021 revenue came from the U.S. government, such a reduction could lead to program cuts, delays, or terminations, especially for multi-year contracts that depend on annual appropriations. This would disrupt revenue timing and potentially reduce contract values. Raytheon, with its exposure to fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts, would face compounded risk because under FPI contracts, cost overruns beyond a negotiated ceiling are not recoverable. A reduction in appropriations could force RTX to absorb more costs without corresponding revenue increases, especially on complex development contracts where cost overruns are common. Both companies could see reduced profitability and liquidity challenges if they are unable to offset lost revenue or manage cost-sharing pressures under FPI and OTA contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "A 10% across-the-board reduction in U.S. defense appropriations would likely force GD to scale back or delay multi‑year programs and could trigger funding shortfalls for its U.S. government contracts, especially those that rely on annual appropriations and may be terminated for convenience. For RTX, the impact would be amplified on fixed‑price incentive (FPI) contracts, where any cost overruns beyond the negotiated ceiling would be borne entirely by the company, potentially eroding margins and compelling renegotiations or write‑downs of existing contracts. Both firms would face heightened cash‑flow pressure and could see earnings volatility as funding streams shrink and contract terms are renegotiated.",

No incorrect numbers or dates are present. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: while no explicit calculations are made, the 10% reduction impact is correctly interpreted as leading to funding shortfalls and cost absorption, consistent with the original. The absence of a specific dollar figure or percentage error supports a full score here. (3) Reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis: the model correctly links GD’s reliance on government funding to risks in multi-year contracts under appropriations cuts, and separately connects RTX’s FPI contract structure to margin erosion under cost pressure—both requiring inference across financial risk and contract type. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit mention of 'liquidity challenges' or 'OTA contracts' from the original, which slightly reduces completeness but does not impair core understanding.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in quantitative details. The ground truth states ABBV has $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals and DHR generated $497 million in operating cash flows from working capital changes in 2024. The LLM answer omits both figures entirely, failing to mention any specific numbers, which is a critical omission given the financial nature of the question. (2) There are no correct numbers cited in the LLM response, so quantitative accuracy is very low. The absence of $14,304 million for ABBV's rebate accruals and $497 million for DHR's working capital impact severely undermines the factual foundation of the answer. (3) The reasoning partially captures the conceptual distinction: ABBV faces challenges in estimating rebate liabilities due to timing lags with government and third-party payers, while DHR’s cash flow is affected by operational timing. However, the LLM misattributes DHR’s operating cash flow sensitivity to 'acquisitions, capital expenditures and financing activities'—which relate to investing and financing cash flows, not operating cash flows. The ground truth correctly identifies working capital changes (e.g., collections and payments timing) as the driver of DHR’s operating cash flow impact. This reflects a misunderstanding of cash flow statement mechanics. (4) Despite these errors, the LLM answer remains contextually relevant by addressing the core theme—payment timing affecting cash management differently at each firm—and correctly identifying ABBV’s reserve estimation challenge. It synthesizes a plausible contrast, albeit with incorrect financial drivers for DHR and missing key data. Thus, while the conceptual framework is partially sound, the lack of numbers and mischaracterization of DHR’s cash flow drivers limit correctness.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing's indefinite indemnification for environmental conditions related to its BCA facilities in Wichita, Tulsa, and McAlester exposes it to uncertain future liabilities, as it cannot estimate the number or magnitude of potential claims. Union Pacific, while not directly responsible for Boeing's indemnifications, faces its own environmental liabilities tied to remediation and monitoring costs, which are also uncertain due to regulatory changes and third-party financial viability. Therefore, while Boeing could face indirect liability through its indemnification obligations, Union Pacific’s liability could increase if environmental conditions at these locations require more extensive remediation, especially if other responsible parties are unable to contribute.",
      "llm_answer": "The Boeing Company’s indefinite environmental indemnification for the BCA facilities creates a contingent liability that is disclosed only in Note 13 of its 10‑K, where it states that it cannot estimate the maximum potential exposure and therefore no liability has been recorded. Union Pacific’s 10‑K does not mention any environmental indemnification related to those facilities, but it does disclose environmental remediation liabilities of $243 million (with a current portion of $60 million) in Note 13 and provides a range of possible future remediation costs of $325–$358 million for personal‑injury claims. Consequently, Boeing may face future payments under the indefinite indemnity, while Union Pacific’s exposure is limited to the disclosed environmental liability and the $325–$358 million possible cost range for personal‑injury claims.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding Union Pacific's disclosures. The original answer states that Union Pacific faces its own environmental liabilities tied to remediation and monitoring, but does not mention specific dollar amounts or personal-injury claims in the context of the BCA facilities. The LLM incorrectly introduces a $243 million liability with a $60 million current portion and a $325–$358 million range for personal-injury claims, which are not present in the ground truth and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. These numbers are not supported by the knowledge graph and represent a significant quantitative error. (2) There is no verification that these figures come from Union Pacific’s Note 13 in relation to the BCA facilities; in fact, the ground truth does not specify any numerical disclosures from Union Pacific at all. Boeing’s inability to estimate exposure is correctly noted, aligning with the original answer, but the claim about disclosure only in Note 13 lacks corroboration in the provided truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—Boeing’s indemnification creates uncertain future liabilities, and Union Pacific has separate environmental exposures—but the synthesis fails because it falsely attributes specific liabilities and claim ranges to Union Pacific that are not in the ground truth. The connection between the two companies’ liabilities is misrepresented by implying Union Pacific has quantified exposure related to the BCA facilities through personal-injury claims, which the original answer does not state. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the response addresses the core issue of future liabilities stemming from environmental obligations. However, the correctness score is reduced to 5 due to major quantitative inaccuracies and unsupported specifics, even though some qualitative elements (e.g., Boeing’s unquantifiable risk) are accurate. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the structure of reasoning follows a logical path, but with flawed inputs. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the introduction of false numerical data.",

Additionally, the LLM states the international pension benefits at FDX have a 'net funded status of $489 million', implying they are overfunded, while the ground truth reports a 'net unfunded status of $499 million', meaning they are underfunded. This reverses the actual financial position and is a critical error. (2) The calculation of the sum ($6,159M + $2,011M = $8,170M) is mathematically correct, but the inputs are factually wrong. The comparison direction — stating that the combined liability exceeds the international pension amount — is consistent with the ground truth in magnitude comparison, but the reasoning is flawed due to incorrect signs (overfunded vs underfunded).

The original answer states that Intel's effective tax rate was 15.6% *lower* than Cisco's, implying a 15.6 percentage point difference. However, the LLM interprets this as Intel's rate being 15.6% (a rate value), and Cisco's as 17.7%, resulting in a 2.1 percentage point difference—this contradicts the ground truth. This misinterpretation fundamentally undermines the numerical accuracy. (2) The numbers themselves are incorrect: the LLM assigns specific rates (15.6% for Intel, 17.7% for Cisco), but the ground truth does not provide absolute rates—only that Intel's was 15.6 percentage points lower. There is no verification that Cisco's rate was 17.7% or Intel's 15.6%; thus, both the individual values and the difference are fabricated. (3) The qualitative reasoning about R&D tax credits is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that R&D tax credits provided a benefit based on eligible spending and were independent of pre-tax income, aligning with the original answer's explanation.

This indicates that inventory directly influences Nike's cost of sales and profitability. In contrast, Tesla does not explicitly mention inventory costs as a distinct component of its cost of sales. Instead, Tesla emphasizes design and engineering capabilities, modular manufacturing approaches, and integration of technologies to optimize cost characteristics. Tesla's focus is on reducing manufacturing complexity, such as through direct integration of batteries with vehicle body structures, to improve manufacturability, weight, range, and cost efficiency.

In contrast, TSLA included freight as part of its cost of revenue for the Energy Generation and Storage segment, where it added to the overall cost structure.

However, the LLM claims that higher freight costs *reduced* NKE’s margin by 110 bps—this reverses the actual effect. For TSLA, the ground truth indicates freight is included in cost of revenue (as an expense), but the LLM incorrectly states that Tesla faced only 80 bps of margin pressure from foreign currency, with freight having a smaller impact—this data is unsupported and misrepresents the original answer.

No such numbers appear in the ground truth for TSLA. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: instead of contrasting how freight costs *differently affected* gross margins—positively for NKE via cost reduction, and structurally as a cost component for TSLA—the model fabricates comparative margin pressures and introduces foreign currency effects, which were not part of the original analysis.

Cisco's product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to increased costs from freight, expedite fees, and higher component and commodity costs.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 2.1 percentage point decrease is correctly cited, and no other numbers are misstated. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer synthesizes Cisco's cost factors and risk exposure, and correctly links Oracle's increased inventory to supply chain risks, though it omits Oracle's specific challenge of being unable to pass all cost increases to customers. This is a minor omission that slightly reduces completeness but does not distort the overall picture. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question—impact on inventory risk and cost factors behind Cisco's margin decline.

(2) The quantitative inaccuracy in the international rate (3.55% vs. 2.26%) undermines the conclusion about how the difference compares to FDX's international rate. The LLM claims the 0% difference is 'equal to' the international rate, which would only be true if the international rate were 0%, but even with the incorrect 3.55% value, the logic is flawed. The correct interpretation — that the difference (0) is not equal to the international rate (2.26%) — is missing.

      "original_answer": "Union Pacific Railroad's fuel expenses increased by $668 million in 2021 due to a rise in locomotive diesel fuel prices from $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon, driven primarily by higher fuel prices excluding volume changes. Meanwhile, Boeing noted that fuel prices are a key factor influencing demand for commercial aircraft, as airlines are cost-sensitive and fuel is a major operating expense. Higher fuel prices could lead airlines to delay or cancel aircraft orders, reducing Boeing's revenues and cash flows. Therefore, the fuel price increase directly raised Union Pacific's operating costs and could indirectly reduce Boeing's commercial airplane sales and profitability through airline cost pressures.",
      "llm_answer": "The increase in fuel prices from 2020 to 2021 significantly raised Union Pacific Railroad’s operating expenses, as documented on page 36, where fuel costs jumped 56 % (from $1,314 million to $2,049 million) due to higher diesel prices and higher gross ton‑miles, even though fuel consumption per ton‑mile improved slightly. In contrast, Boeing’s commercial aircraft demand is highly sensitive to fuel price fluctuations, as noted on page 12, which explains that higher fuel prices can depress airline profitability and traffic, leading to reduced orders and potential cancellations of aircraft—effects that were evident in Boeing’s 2021 disclosures of lower demand amid rising fuel costs.",

The ground truth attributes the $668M increase primarily to price changes (from $1.50 to $2.23/gallon), while the LLM notes both price and volume (gross ton-miles) as factors, adding context not contradicted by the original. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM’s numbers are consistent with typical 10-K disclosures; the 56% increase is mathematically sound (1,314 * 1.56 ≈ 2,049), and while the exact $668M figure isn't cited, the derived $735M is close and may reflect different segmentation of fuel cost components. (3) For Boeing, the LLM accurately captures the qualitative sensitivity of aircraft demand to fuel prices, correctly stating that higher fuel costs reduce airline profitability and can lead to order reductions or cancellations—mirroring the original’s logic. It also references Boeing’s 2021 disclosures of lower demand, adding contextual support. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects rising fuel prices to Union Pacific’s operating costs and separately to Boeing’s demand dynamics via airline economics. The synthesis across two companies and causal chains is logically coherent and factually grounded. (5) Minor deduction in quantitative accuracy due to the unexplained variance in the dollar increase ($735M vs $668M), but since percentages and directional impacts are correct, and the reasoning accounts for both price and volume (which the ground truth excludes), the answer remains highly accurate.

      "question": "What percentage of total revenue did hardware represent for Oracle in 2022, and how does this compare to Cisco's segment reporting structure?",
      "original_answer": "Oracle reported $3,183 million in hardware revenue out of total revenues of $42,440 million in 2022, meaning hardware represented 7% of total revenue. In contrast, Cisco did not report hardware revenue separately but instead disclosed revenue by geographic segments, managing its business primarily on a geographic basis without breaking out hardware as a distinct category. This reflects a structural difference in how the two companies report their financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, Oracle reported **$38.018 billion in product revenue for fiscal 2022**, representing **73.7% of total revenue** ($51.557 billion). This includes hardware revenue within the broader product category, though the exact percentage of total revenue attributable *solely* to hardware is not explicitly stated. The document confirms hardware is part of Oracle's \"three operating segments\" (cloud and license, hardware, and services), with hardware revenue declining by 5% year-over-year to $3.183 billion in constant currency (as noted in the \"Total Revenues by Business\" table on page 47).  \n\nCisco's segment reporting structure, as referenced in the question, is not detailed in the provided Oracle documents. The sources only include Oracle's financial disclosures and product/category breakdowns (e.g., Secure, Agile Networks, Internet for the Future), but no comparative data or segment structure for Cisco is present in the supplied pages. Thus, a direct comparison of Cisco's segment reporting cannot be derived from the given materials.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Oracle's hardware revenue as $3.183 billion and notes it is part of a broader product category, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states Oracle's total revenue as $51.557 billion, whereas the ground truth reports $42,440 million ($42.44 billion) for 2022. This leads to an inaccurate context around product revenue (73.7% of total), which is not relevant to the question and stems from using incorrect total revenue. The 7% figure for hardware as a percentage of total revenue is missing in the LLM answer, though the numerator ($3.183B) is correct. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised due to the incorrect total revenue figure, although the hardware revenue amount is accurate. The calculation of 7% (3,183 / 42,440 ≈ 0.0703) is not performed or stated, which is central to the question. (3) The LLM acknowledges that hardware is a separate operating segment and that revenue declined, showing correct entity and structural understanding. However, it fails to compute the required percentage, a key part of the multi-hop reasoning. Regarding Cisco, the LLM correctly notes that no Cisco segment data is available in the Oracle filings, but the original answer draws a valid comparison based on external knowledge (Cisco’s geographic reporting structure), which the LLM avoids—likely due to source limitations. Still, the question implies comparative knowledge, and the LLM’s refusal to engage in comparison based on source constraints limits its qualitative completeness. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, but the use of incorrect total revenue and omission of the 7% calculation reduces correctness. The failure to synthesize the final percentage and compare Cisco’s reporting structure as per ground truth limits the score to 7 despite mostly accurate component data.",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) debt to interest rate changes contrast with the credit risk concerns highlighted by General Electric (GE) regarding short-term rates, and what does this imply about their respective exposures to macroeconomic volatility?",
      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) states that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of its outstanding debt of $18.7 billion at December 31, 2023, indicating low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. In contrast, General Electric (GE) explicitly lists changes in short-term interest rates as a risk factor that could materially affect its business operations, financial results, and liquidity. GE also notes that downgrades in its credit ratings could significantly impact its funding profile and costs. This contrast implies that GE is more exposed to macroeconomic volatility related to interest rates, particularly due to its credit profile and sensitivity to short-term rate movements, whereas LMT has a more stable debt structure that is less affected by such changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin’s debt sensitivity to interest‑rate changes is modest—its $18.7 billion of outstanding debt would experience only a limited change in fair value from a 10 % rate shift, reflecting a relatively low‑duration, fixed‑rate profile. In contrast, General Electric explicitly flags short‑term‑rate volatility as a material credit‑risk concern that could impair its liquidity and funding costs, highlighting a far greater exposure to macro‑economic swings. Consequently, LMT’s macro‑economic vulnerability is primarily tied to long‑term financing stability, whereas GE’s is tied to near‑term funding pressures and broader credit‑rating risks.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Lockheed Martin's $18.7 billion debt and its low sensitivity to a 10% interest rate change, aligning with the ground truth. It accurately contrasts this with GE's explicit risk disclosure regarding short-term rates and credit rating impacts. All key facts are present and semantically equivalent. (2) Quantitatively, the $18.7 billion figure is correct and matches the original answer; the 10% interest rate change benchmark is also accurately referenced. No calculations are required, but the interpretation of 'not material' as 'limited change' or 'low sensitivity' is valid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes LMT’s interest rate sensitivity (or lack thereof) with GE’s credit risk exposure, drawing a logical contrast in macroeconomic vulnerability. The inference about LMT having a 'low-duration, fixed-rate profile' is a reasonable interpretation of low sensitivity, though not explicitly stated in the ground truth—this adds insight without contradicting facts. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing both companies’ exposures and the implication for macroeconomic volatility. The only minor gap is that the original answer explicitly mentions GE’s concern about credit rating downgrades affecting funding, which the LLM touches on with 'credit-rating risks' but could have emphasized more. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, well-reasoned, and complete with only slight nuance missing.",

      "original_answer": "Disney's Entertainment segment incurs programming and production costs that include amortization of capitalized production costs, licensed programming rights, subscriber-based fees for Hulu Live programming, live news production costs, participations and residuals, and intercompany fees for sports programming on ABC and Disney+. In contrast, the Sports segment's programming and production costs primarily involve amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs for live sports programming. These costs are central to both segments but reflect different content focuses—general entertainment versus live sports. Meanwhile, Comcast's 2024 10-K shows that it also reports a dedicated 'Programming and Production Costs' line item in its financial disclosures (Note 4), indicating that both companies treat these costs as a significant, segmented component of their operations. However, while Disney breaks down its costs by intercompany licensing and streaming platform fees, Comcast does not provide the same level of granular detail in the provided excerpt, suggesting a potentially different approach to internal cost allocation or reporting transparency.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's Entertainment segment allocates programming and production costs primarily to content creation and licensing within its entertainment operations, while its Sports segment incurs similar costs for sports rights and production but treats them as part of its distinct sports content operations.

(1) There are no numeric values in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that Disney allocates programming and production costs differently between its Entertainment and Sports segments, noting sports rights and production for the Sports segment. However, it incorrectly claims that Comcast 'consolidates' these costs across segments 'without segment-specific allocation distinctions.' The ground truth states that Comcast reports a 'Programming and Production Costs' line item in Note 4 of its 2024 10-K, indicating it does report this cost category, but does not provide the same granular breakdown as Disney. The LLM overreaches by inferring a structural consolidation and lack of segment-specific treatment, which is not supported by the evidence—Comcast may still allocate internally but simply report less transparently. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to accurately compare Disney’s detailed intercompany and platform-specific cost allocation (e.g., Hulu Live, ABC, Disney+) with Comcast’s more aggregated disclosure. Instead, it fabricates a contrast in operational structure (unified vs. segmented) not present in the source. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the core question about cost allocation differences and is relevant, but misses key nuances like intercompany fees and streaming platform costs unique to Disney, and misrepresents Comcast’s approach.

Both companies exclude certain adjustments from their core operating performance metrics—GM excludes items like transformation costs, litigation, and currency impacts when calculating EBIT-adjusted and ROIC-adjusted, whereas HD focuses on comparable sales and operational efficiency metrics without a formal ROIC-adjusted measure.

Most critically, it incorrectly states that 'HD does not report ROIC in its disclosures,' which directly contradicts the ground truth stating that HD reports ROIC as 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020. This is a major error in entity and metric reporting. Additionally, the LLM claims HD lacks a formal ROIC-adjusted measure and does not detail components, but the ground truth confirms HD does report ROIC and refers to a 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' section for definition and reconciliation—information the LLM omits or misrepresents. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the correct ROIC values (44.7% and 40.8%) for HD are entirely missing from the LLM answer, and no correct calculations or percentages are cited. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize that both companies report ROIC, with GM providing a detailed methodology and HD referencing further disclosures. Instead, it incorrectly asserts HD does not report ROIC at all, breaking the logical chain.

      "original_answer": "MDLZ's top five customers accounted for 16.7% of its 2021 net revenues. Walmart International contributed 18% of Walmart's fiscal 2022 consolidated net sales. Thus, Walmart International's contribution to total company sales was slightly higher than the share of MDLZ's revenues from its top five customers.",

(2) However, the LLM incorrectly claims that the document does not provide Walmart International's percentage of consolidated net sales, when in fact it does state that Walmart International represented 18% of total net sales in fiscal 2022 — a key fact needed for the comparison. The question does not ask for the contribution of supercenters specifically, but rather uses 'operates supercenters among other formats' as descriptive context, not as a metric to extract. The LLM misinterprets the second part of the question as requiring format-level sales data (e.g., supercenters), when the actual comparison is between MDLZ's top customer concentration (16.7%) and Walmart International's overall contribution (18%). (3) This reflects a failure in multi-hop reasoning: while the model retrieves both correct figures, it fails to perform the valid comparison because it incorrectly assesses data availability.

      "original_answer": "A $15 billion increase in cross-jurisdictional activity would move American Express (AXP) from $60 billion to $75 billion on a four-quarter trailing average, potentially reclassifying it from Category III to Category II under the enhanced prudential standards. This would subject AXP to more stringent capital, liquidity, and prudential requirements, including the advanced approaches capital framework. For Charles Schwab (SCHW), increasing its cross-jurisdictional activity from $25 billion to $40 billion would not trigger a category change, as it remains below the $75 billion threshold for Category II, so it would remain under Category III requirements, including the standardized approach framework and stress capital buffer.",

Under the Category III framework, each firm would become subject to heightened capital and liquidity standards, including a dynamic stress‑capital buffer (SCB) of 2.5 % of CET1, a static 2.5 % capital‑conservation buffer for the bank subsidiary, and the full suite of enhanced prudential requirements such as the Market‑Risk Rule, LCR/NSFR mandates, and the expanded risk‑based capital approach that would recalculate risk‑weighted assets using more granular methodologies.  Consequently, the additional $15 billion of cross‑jurisdictional activity would likely consume a larger portion of their available capital buffers, potentially tightening dividend and share‑repurchase flexibility and increasing the amount of high‑quality liquid assets they must hold to meet the 100 % LCR and NSFR requirements.",

Similarly, Charles Schwab (SCHW) is misclassified as Category IV, while the ground truth shows it is in Category III. The $15B increase would move AXP to $75B, potentially triggering a Category II reclassification—this part is partially correct in logic but wrong in baseline category. However, SCHW would only reach $40B, well below the $75B threshold, so no category change occurs—this is misrepresented in the LLM answer, which suggests both would move to Category III and possibly II. (2) Quantitative accuracy is poor: the LLM invents a $700B asset threshold for AXP to reach Category II, which is not mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth does not reference Category IV at all, nor does it mention dynamic SCB percentages (2.5%), capital-conservation buffers, or granular RWA methodologies as direct consequences of the category change—these details are speculative or overgeneralized. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify the starting regulatory categories, misapplies thresholds, and assumes both firms are below Category III when only SCHW remains below the Category II threshold. It also introduces conditions (e.g., total assets > $700B) not present in the original data. (4) Despite these errors, the answer captures some relevant regulatory concepts (LCR, NSFR, stress capital buffer, enhanced prudential standards), showing contextual understanding. However, incorrect entity states and thresholds undermine factual correctness. The core conclusion—that AXP faces stricter requirements and SCHW does not—is partially correct but obscured by inaccuracies. Hence, correctness is scored low (4), quantitative accuracy very low (3), qualitative reasoning moderate (5), and relevance acceptable (7).",

      "original_answer": "The weighted average exercise price per share of options exercised at Boeing is $73.93, while at Union Pacific it is $118.11. The difference between the two is $118.11 - $73.93 = $44.18.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, the weighted average exercise price per share of options exercised at Boeing in 2022 is not disclosed in the Union Pacific 10-K filing (pages 64–68), and Boeing’s 10-K pages (115–119) only provide data for 2021 exercises ($73.93 weighted average exercise price). The question specifically asks for the 2022 comparison, but neither source contains Boeing’s 2022 exercise price data. Therefore, the required information is unavailable. \n\nThe Union Pacific 10-K pages focus on pension plans and do not include stock option exercise prices for Boeing. Boeing’s 10-K pages only detail 2021 exercises (weighted average $73.93), with no 2022 figures provided. Thus, the comparison cannot be made. \n\n**Answer:** The weighted average exercise price per share of options exercised at Boeing in 2022 is not provided in the given documents, making the comparison to Union Pacific impossible.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect in its conclusion. The ground truth states that Boeing's weighted average exercise price in 2022 is $73.93 and Union Pacific's is $118.11, with a difference of $44.18. However, the LLM claims this data is unavailable, specifically asserting that Boeing's 2022 figure is not provided and only 2021 data is available. This contradicts the ground truth, which clearly provides Boeing's 2022 number as $73.93—identical to its 2021 value. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM fails to report any correct comparison or numbers from 2022, despite the ground truth providing both values and a correct calculation ($118.11 - $73.93 = $44.18). The mention of $73.93 is accurate but misattributed to 2021 only, when it is also the correct 2022 value per the knowledge graph. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly infers data absence and does not synthesize the correct multi-hop information. It mistakenly assumes that because Boeing's 10-K mentions $73.93 in a 2021 context, it cannot apply to 2022, but the ground truth confirms it is valid for 2022. The model fails to make the correct cross-company, cross-year synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—it addresses the right companies and metric, and attempts to locate the data, but ultimately denies the availability of information that is, according to the ground truth, present. Thus, while the response is logically structured, it is factually wrong, leading to a correctness score of 0.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, the combined total cost of revenue is $68,217 million, but the LLM reports $76,468 million, which is incorrect. The LLM states Adobe's total cost of revenue as $2,354 million, which is far below the correct value (implied to be around $2,350 million is plausible, but the sum with Microsoft's cost does not align with the ground truth combined total). More critically, Microsoft's total cost of revenue is reported as $74,114 million, which contradicts the ground truth implication that the sum of both companies is $68,217 million—meaning Microsoft's standalone cost cannot exceed that. (2) The percentage for Adobe (21.4%) matches the ground truth and is correctly calculated ($503M / $2,354M ≈ 21.4%), which is accurate. However, the LLM reports Microsoft's service and other cost proportion as 79.4%, while the ground truth states 73.2%, a significant discrepancy. The LLM uses $58,842M / $74,114M ≈ 79.4%, but either the numerator or denominator (or both) must be incorrect based on the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to compute totals, proportions, and comparisons across two companies and metrics—but the faulty input data undermines the validity. The synthesis approach is correct, but based on incorrect underlying numbers. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question: combined cost and comparative proportions. However, due to major quantitative errors in core financial figures and percentages, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.

In contrast, American Express includes AOCI in its CET1 Capital calculation, as evidenced by its regulatory capital components table (page 67) which defines CET1 capital as \"common shareholders' equity, adjusted for ineligible goodwill and intangible assets and certain deferred tax assets\" without excluding AOCI, and by referencing the inclusion of AOCI in its capital ratios (e.g., \"We continue to include accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in regulatory capital\").

According to the ground truth, Google's financing cash flows for finance leases in 2024 were $405 million, not $794 million as stated; Verizon's were $794 million, not $1,000 million. Similarly, for right-of-use assets, Google's was $313 million, not $1,051 million, and Verizon's was $1,051 million, not $818 million. These misattributions lead to incorrect totals: the LLM reports $1,794 million in combined cash flows (correct total is $1,199 million) and $1,869 million in combined right-of-use assets (correct total is $1,364 million). (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM's incorrect numbers but do not match the ground truth. The correct difference is $165 million less in cash flows versus right-of-use assets, but the LLM implies a smaller difference of $75 million ($1,869M - $1,794M), which is also incorrect due to wrong inputs.

      "original_answer": "BMY's non-GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19 in 2023 primarily due to lower revenues and product mix, which were influenced by U.S. government pricing pressures such as the IRA, including Medicare drug price negotiations and inflation-linked rebates. These pressures are expected to significantly impact BMY's business and results of operations. In contrast, Merck discloses that it uses non-GAAP EPS to enhance investor understanding of its performance, internally for planning and forecasting, and as a component in employee compensation. Merck excludes items like acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, and investment income/losses to better assess underlying business trends. While BMY's non-GAAP EPS is negatively impacted by external regulatory pressures, Merck emphasizes internal performance assessment and strategic decision-making as the basis for its non-GAAP reporting.",

BMY attributes the impact of U.S. government pricing pressures to a reduction in non‑GAAP EPS, noting that lower prices and reimbursement rates from initiatives such as the IRA and Medicare drug‑price negotiations directly depress earnings. Merck, by contrast, cites non‑GAAP EPS as a management‑focused performance measure that excludes acquisition, restructuring, R&D capitalization and other items, and does not single out pricing pressure as a primary driver of EPS changes. Consequently, while both firms use non‑GAAP EPS for internal decision‑making, BMY frames pricing pressure as a key headwind affecting EPS, whereas Merck treats non‑GAAP EPS as a broader, non‑GAAP indicator largely insulated from such pricing pressures.",

The absence of the exact $0.19 figure is a minor omission but does not distort the factual narrative. (2) The explanation correctly identifies that BMY's non-GAAP EPS was negatively affected by U.S. government pricing pressures such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Medicare drug-price negotiations, which matches the original answer. (3) For Merck, the LLM accurately captures the rationale for using non-GAAP EPS—namely for internal management, planning, and excluding items like acquisition costs, restructuring, and investment gains/losses—without attributing pricing pressures as a key driver, which is consistent with the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "Nike evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by forecasting future taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization, but does not guarantee realization due to uncertainties in projected future taxable earnings. In contrast, Tesla concluded that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable based on recent taxable income and expected future taxable earnings, leading to the release of $6.54 billion in valuation allowance.

TSLA maintains a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets (e.g., California state losses) because it concludes these assets are not more likely than not realizable, whereas it releases allowances for U.S. federal and other state assets based on sufficient positive evidence of future taxable earnings.

(2) No explicit numbers are wrong (so quantitative accuracy is acceptable), but the absence of the $6.54 billion figure, which is central to the original answer, reduces precision. The mention of 'California state losses' as an example is plausible but not confirmed in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: it connects TSLA’s reliance on future earnings to valuation allowance decisions and contrasts this with NKE’s approach. However, it inaccurately implies that Tesla maintains a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets *because* of lack of realizability, without clarifying that Tesla recently reversed a major allowance based on positive evidence—this reverses the emphasis of the original answer, which highlights Tesla’s *favorable* outlook. The characterization of Tesla’s approach as 'more aggressive' is interpretive and not in the original. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses the comparative treatment of deferred tax assets, but misses the critical contrast in outcomes: Tesla’s conclusion of 'more likely than not realizable' leading to a large allowance release vs. Nike’s more cautious stance.

It claims that BAC's noninterest expense increased by $0 million (from $5,601M to $5,601M) and JPM's also increased by $0 million (from $34,819M to $34,819M), which contradicts the ground truth. According to the original answer, BAC's increase was $965 million and JPM's was $614 million, so the difference was $351 million. The LLM reports a $1,000 million difference despite both increases being $0 in its own calculation, which is logically inconsistent. (2) The numbers are completely wrong: BAC’s actual increase was $965M, not $0M; JPM’s was $614M, not $0M; the difference was $351M, not $0M or $1,000M. The LLM also fabricates identical 2022 and 2023 values for both banks, suggesting no change, which is false. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed entirely: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the noninterest expense figures for BAC and JPM across 2022 and 2023, and the comparison is based on erroneous data. (4) The correctness score is 1 because the answer is fundamentally wrong on all quantitative and qualitative dimensions. The only minor redeeming factor is that it attempts to address the question structure (dollar amounts and difference), but with entirely fabricated data. Quantitative accuracy is 1 due to total factual inaccuracy. Qualitative accuracy is 1 due to flawed logic and entity/metric misrepresentation.

The question asks for the total shares *authorized* for issuance under equity compensation plans as of December 31, 2023, but the LLM provided the number of shares *remaining available for future issuance*, which is a different metric. According to the ground truth, AbbVie had 185 million shares authorized (not 62 million remaining), and UnitedHealth Group had 120 million authorized (not 70 million remaining). These numbers are not equivalent and cannot be used interchangeably. (2) The numeric values are therefore inaccurate: 62,004,889 vs. 185,000,000 for AbbVie and 70,000,000 vs. 120,000,000 for UnitedHealth Group. Even allowing for format variation, the values are not close and represent different financial concepts. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed because the model did not correctly identify the required metric (authorized shares) and instead used remaining shares available, leading to an incorrect comparison. The conclusion about which company has a larger pool is reversed—AbbVie has more authorized shares than UnitedHealth Group, but the LLM implies otherwise by citing remaining shares. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses equity compensation plans and the correct companies and date, but it answers a different question than the one asked.

This is a major quantitative error that completely misrepresents Union Pacific's financial position. Additionally, Boeing's net loss is reported as $4.202 billion, while the correct figure is $4,290 million ($4.29 billion), introducing a minor but notable discrepancy. (2) The operating loss for Boeing is correctly cited as $2,902 million, and Union Pacific's net income of $6,523 million is accurate. However, the 'Other Income, Net' for Union Pacific is wildly incorrect—$447M vs. the true value of -$297M—making the comparison between the two companies invalid. The difference in other income is not $104 million (as implied), but actually $848 million ($551M - (-$297M)), which the model fails to compute or reflect. (3) The reasoning framework is partially sound: the model attempts to link 'Other Income, Net' to net income/loss and contrast the two companies' performance. However, due to the incorrect value for Union Pacific, the multi-hop synthesis collapses. The conclusion that Boeing’s other income helped reduce its operating loss is plausible, but the claim that Union Pacific had positive other income is false, undermining the comparative analysis.

However, due to the critical error in Union Pacific’s 'Other Income, Net', the qualitative and quantitative accuracy scores are severely impacted.

This is a critical error. (2) The calculation cited for PM—'net-revenue growth of 1.5% versus 11.7% when currency and acquisitions are excluded'—is logically inconsistent: if growth *excluding* acquisitions is 11.7%, then acquisitions would *subtract* from growth, not add, which contradicts the LLM's own interpretation. This reveals flawed reasoning. (3) Qualitatively, the model fails to correctly identify the key contrast: KO had a negative 4% impact, while PM had *zero* impact. Instead, it fabricates a significant positive impact for PM, failing the multi-hop comparison entirely. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the right companies and year, and attempts to interpret financial impacts, so it is relevant but fundamentally incorrect in its core claims. The contrast drawn is the opposite of the truth, warranting a very low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, LMT reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million as part of its unallocated items, directly contributing to its consolidated operating profit of $9,123 million. This adjustment was a significant component of LMT's unallocated net total of $1,744 million. In contrast, RTX's FAS/CAS operating adjustment was embedded in its pension and PRB expense treatment, where the adjustment reconciled CAS expense (used for U.S. government contract pricing) with FAS service cost under GAAP. RTX noted that the FAS/CAS adjustment resulted in consolidated pension expense equal to the FAS service cost, though no specific dollar amount was provided for 2021. The difference lies in LMT explicitly quantifying the adjustment as a standalone unallocated item, while RTX integrated it within broader pension cost reporting without isolating its dollar impact.",
      "llm_answer": "The FAS/CAS operating adjustment differs between LMT and RTX in magnitude and composition: LMT reports a $1,796 million FAS/CAS operating adjustment for 2021 (up from $1,106 million in 2020), driven by a $741 million increase in CAS expense offset by only a $51 million rise in FAS service cost, whereas RTX shows a $1,960 million adjustment in 2021 (up from $1,876 million in 2020), reflecting a larger $741 million CAS expense increase but also a $51 million rise in FAS service cost, illustrating that RTX’s adjustment is higher due to its greater overall pension expense base. Specific amounts highlighting the disparity are LMT’s $1,796 million versus RTX’s $1,960 million for 2021, with the underlying drivers being a $741 million CAS expense jump for RTX and a $51 million increase in FAS service cost for LMT.",

These reversals and fabrications of key figures severely undermine accuracy. (2) The LLM invents detailed drivers such as a '$741 million increase in CAS expense' and '$51 million rise in FAS service cost' for both companies, which are not present in the ground truth. The original answer does not provide year-over-year changes or component-level breakdowns for either company, especially for RTX. Any calculations or comparisons based on these numbers are therefore invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The question asks for differences in treatment and impact between LMT and RTX. The ground truth highlights that LMT explicitly reports the adjustment as a standalone unallocated item, while RTX integrates it within pension cost reporting without isolating the dollar impact. The LLM fails to capture this qualitative distinction correctly and instead fabricates quantitative comparisons that contradict the source. It reverses the roles of the companies in terms of disclosed amounts and implies both disclosed detailed adjustments, which RTX did not.

These numbers are significantly inflated. Additionally, the LLM misstates Netflix's and Verizon's obligations due in the next 12 months as $11.4 billion and $2.5 billion respectively, which are not supported by the ground truth (Netflix: part of $31.425B total beyond 12 months, with content portion $11.824B; Verizon: $6.2B of $16.7B total purchase obligations due in next 12 months). (2) Calculations are entirely incorrect: the correct combined content-related obligations beyond 12 months is $11.824B + $10.5B = $22.324B, not $43.0B. The LLM also fails to correctly compute or reference total obligations beyond the next 12 months for either company (Netflix: $31.425B, Verizon: $44.5B), instead focusing on unrelated or incorrect near-term figures. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly extract and synthesize content-related obligations from each company’s filings, conflates total obligations with content-specific ones, and invents comparisons not grounded in the data. It does not correctly separate content obligations from other liabilities (e.g., debt, leases) as required.

There is no indication in the original answer or context that $92 million is the correct figure for this specific transfer. (2) Quantitatively, the $92 million figure is incorrect and significantly underreports the actual transfer amount. The calculation or interpretation of the transfer amount is flawed, even if the model attempts to reference a 'settlement note'—this does not align with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model correctly identifies that PM (PMI) would account for gains or losses through other comprehensive earnings.

The ground truth states only that gains/losses are recognized in other comprehensive earnings, net of deferred taxes, and do not immediately impact the income statement—without mentioning amortization or the corridor method. This addition introduces a factual inaccuracy regarding PM's accounting policy.

This discrepancy arises from incorrect calculation or misreading of the source: the LLM claims interest expense rose from $2,535M to $9,489M (a difference of $6,954M), but according to the ground truth, the correct increase is $6,583M, implying either the input data in the model's source differs or there was a calculation error.

In contrast, VZ recognizes rent expense for short-term operating leases on a straight-line basis as well, but classifies the expense in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense based on the use of the facility or equipment.

Consequently, NFLX’s income‑statement presentation shows a single “Operating lease expense” line (with variable payments expensed as incurred), while VZ’s presentation separates “Operating lease cost” and “Short‑term lease cost” and discloses the lease‑liability maturity schedule, giving investors a clearer view of the timing and magnitude of future cash outflows for each company.",

The LLM answer misses this key distinction about *expense classification by functional use* in VZ’s income statement and instead emphasizes balance sheet capitalization criteria and disclosures (e.g., discount rates, maturity schedules), which, while true, are not the core differentiator asked about in the question. The LLM also introduces concepts like 'non-lease components' and 'renewal periods reasonably certain to be exercised' that were not in the ground truth and are less relevant to the specific query about income statement presentation of short-term leases.

Furthermore, ABT’s actual reported liability is $1,150 million (not derived from $261 + $1,239), so the LLM fabricates a breakdown not present in the original data. The sum of $1,150M (ABT) + $1,501M (TMO) = $2,651M is correct in the ground truth, but the LLM fails to compute this accurately. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is unsound: the model fails to correctly extract ABT’s liability, invents a false calculation for both companies, and misattributes the same component numbers ($261M and $1,239M) to both firms without evidence. It does attempt to synthesize across two companies, but based on incorrect data. (4) Despite the severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, metric, and year, and attempts to sum and compare liabilities—hence a moderate relevance score. However, the correctness score is low due to fundamental errors in numbers and logic.",

      "original_answer": "The total net actuarial loss for Boeing in 2021 was $19,031 million, while for Union Pacific it was $813 million. This results in a $18,218 million disparity. This difference impacts Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss by contributing directly to its value, as seen in Boeing's $17,725 million recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for 2021, compared to Union Pacific's $954 million total (including amortization), which reflects the cumulative effect of actuarial losses over time.",

However, it incorrectly reported Union Pacific's net actuarial loss as $1,092 million instead of the correct $813 million. This led to an incorrect difference of $17,939 million instead of the correct $18,218 million—a significant quantitative error. (2) The calculation of the difference is mathematically correct based on the wrong inputs, but the use of an incorrect value for Union Pacific undermines the accuracy. The ground truth specifies $813M for UNP, while the LLM states $1,092M, which is a material discrepancy. (3) The reasoning about how the disparity impacts Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) is qualitatively sound: the LLM correctly notes that actuarial losses flow through Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and are amortized over time, contributing to AOCL. However, it omits specific recognition amounts in AOCL—Boeing’s $17,725M and Union Pacific’s $954M—which were part of the original answer and important for completeness. (4) Despite the incorrect numbers, the LLM captures the correct financial mechanism (OCI recognition and amortization), showing good qualitative understanding and contextual relevance. The error is primarily in data retrieval for Union Pacific’s actuarial loss, leading to a partially correct answer with significant factual inaccuracy in key figures.

This will enhance transparency around the performance of P&G's Beauty segment, which includes Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care products. Target's 2024 financial reporting shows that Beauty was its second-largest sales category at $13,173 million, underscoring the category's market significance.

This matches the ground truth, which also notes interim reporting begins in 2026 — a detail omitted in the LLM answer but not contradicted. The LLM accurately reports Target's 2024 net sales in the Beauty category as $13,173 million and correctly calculates its proportion (12.3%) of total net sales ($106,566 million), confirming quantitative accuracy. (2) All numeric values — $13,173 million, $106,566 million, 12.3% — are correct and consistent with the ground truth. The percentage is accurate: (13,173 / 106,566) ≈ 12.36%, which rounds to 12.3%. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM connects P&G's new disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 to the market significance of the Beauty category as demonstrated by Target’s sales data. It correctly infers that the increased transparency aligns with the segment's commercial importance. However, it omits the ground truth’s point about enhanced stakeholder comparison of P&G's Beauty segment performance relative to broader market trends, slightly reducing completeness. (4) Despite this minor omission, the LLM conveys the core multi-hop insight: regulatory changes increase disclosure for P&G’s Beauty segment just as the category's importance is highlighted by major retailers like Target. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent. Scores reflect high accuracy with a small deduction in qualitative accuracy due to incomplete synthesis of the comparative stakeholder insight.",

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation of the sum (5,268 + 1,633 = 6,901) is accurate, and the comparison between the combined R&D and NVDA’s operating expenses is factually correct.

This misstatement affects the logical conclusion. The ground truth correctly notes it represents approximately 92.9% of NVDA’s operating expenses, implying it is less, not more. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound — the model retrieves and synthesizes data from two companies across their respective 2022 fiscal years and compares it to a broader expense category from one company.

According to the ground truth, RTX's FAS/CAS operating adjustment increased by $690 million from 2020 to 2021, but the LLM claims an increase of only $84 million (from $1.876B to $1.960B), which is factually incorrect. This miscalculation undermines the entire response. (2) For LMT's average FAS/CAS adjustment from 2019 to 2021, the ground truth states $1,961.3 million (~$1.961B), which the LLM approximates reasonably well as $1.96 billion—this part is quantitatively acceptable. However, the LLM fails to compute or mention the key comparative metric in the original answer: that RTX’s $690M increase was approximately 35.2% of LMT’s average annual adjustment. Instead, it incorrectly focuses on RTX’s 2021 level being similar to LMT’s average, which misrepresents the question’s intent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The question asks for two things: the RTX increase (a year-over-year difference) and how that increase compares to LMT’s three-year average (a cross-entity comparison involving calculation). The LLM fails the first hop (wrong RTX delta) and does not perform the required second-hop comparison (ratio of RTX’s increase to LMT’s average). (4) Scores reflect major quantitative inaccuracy (especially the $84M vs $690M error), partial qualitative accuracy due to correct identification of entities and general metric types, and moderate contextual relevance since the answer discusses the right companies and metric, albeit with wrong numbers and incorrect synthesis.)",

Additionally, the percentage contribution of broadband revenue to CMCSA's total revenue is stated as 8.5%, but the correct value is approximately 21% ($25,489 / $121,572). For AT&T (T), the broadband revenue is correctly reported as $9,669 million, but the total revenue used in the calculation is $122,428 million instead of the correct $120,741 million, leading to a slightly inaccurate percentage (8.1% vs correct 8%). (2) Calculations are flawed: the sum of $10,455M + $9,669M = $20,124M is mathematically correct but based on wrong inputs. The correct sum is $25,489M + $9,669M = $35,158M.

In contrast, Union Pacific capitalizes material costs as part of its property investments, with $2.9 billion in capital investments during 2021, where material costs are evaluated based on whether they meet criteria for extending asset life or improving efficiency. These differing treatments reflect distinct financial impacts: Boeing faces potential future losses tied to cost overruns, while Union Pacific increases long-term asset value through selective capitalization of material costs.",

Union Pacific, by contrast, capitalizes property costs only when they meet strict minimum‑unit, life‑extension or efficiency‑improvement criteria, expensing most other expenditures immediately. Consequently, Boeing’s approach can inflate balance‑sheet assets and create volatile earnings through catch‑up adjustments, whereas Union Pacific’s stricter capitalization limits balance‑sheet exposure but may understate long‑term asset value, leading to different risk profiles and earnings volatility for the two companies.",

While it correctly identifies Adobe's lease liability as $428 million and Qualcomm's as $806 million, it fails to perform the required calculation—the sum of these two values is $1,234 million, which matches the ground truth. The LLM incorrectly concludes that the combined value 'cannot be determined,' which is false; the question asks for a sum across two disclosed values, both of which are present in the provided data. (2) Quantitatively, the individual numbers ($428M and $806M) are accurate and correctly extracted, but the critical error lies in not summing them. The correct total is $1,234 million, and the failure to compute this renders the quantitative accuracy very low despite correct inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model correctly identifies the relevant disclosures in both 10-Ks but fails to synthesize them via a simple arithmetic operation, which is the core of the multi-hop task. This represents a breakdown in basic reasoning rather than data extraction. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the response addresses the right companies, metrics, and filings, but the conclusion is directly contrary to the correct interpretation of the question, which expects aggregation across entities. The model misunderstands the nature of the request, treating it as a search for an explicitly stated combined value rather than a derived one.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X program in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to higher costs from the new IAM 751 labor agreement. Lockheed Martin recognized $1.31 billion in additional reach-forward losses in the fourth quarter for a classified contract in its MFC business segment, driven by the increased likelihood that all fixed-price options under the contract would be exercised. Together, these fourth-quarter reach-forward losses totaled $2.201 billion, with labor agreements and contractual cost structures directly influencing the financial outcomes for both companies.",
      "llm_answer": "The fourth‑quarter 2024 reach‑forward losses were $1.31 billion for Boeing (BA) and $100 million for Lockheed Martin (LMT). Boeing’s loss stems from its MFC segment’s fixed‑price development contracts, where performance issues, higher estimated costs and the likelihood of exercising all remaining options triggered the additional loss; Lockheed’s loss is tied to the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program, where performance problems, lower flight‑hour forecasts and contractual uncertainties about future funding and recovery of pre‑contract assets drove the charge.",

It incorrectly assigns $1.31 billion in reach-forward losses to Boeing and $100 million to Lockheed Martin, which is the reverse of the ground truth: Boeing actually recorded $891 million and Lockheed Martin $1.31 billion. The total combined loss in the ground truth is $2.201 billion, but the LLM's total would be $1.41 billion, which is incorrect. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the numbers are not only wrong but swapped between companies. The LLM also cites $100 million for Lockheed Martin, which does not match the $1.31 billion in the original answer. No correct sum is presented. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is flawed: Boeing’s loss is attributed to the 777X program due to labor costs from the IAM 751 agreement, not MFC segment fixed-price contracts as stated by the LLM. Lockheed Martin’s loss is due to a classified contract in MFC with fixed-price options becoming more likely to be exercised, not the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program or issues with flight-hour forecasts and funding uncertainties. The LLM misidentifies both programs and drivers. (4) Contextual relevance is partially maintained as the answer addresses reach-forward losses in Q4 2024 for both companies and attempts to explain contributing factors, but the incorrect entities, programs, and financial figures undermine the response.

      "original_answer": "CMCSA's video revenue decreased in both 2022 and 2023, primarily due to declines in the overall number of residential video customers. This downward trend reflects ongoing challenges in the traditional video services market. In contrast, AT&T reported $2,257 million in video revenue in 2021 but no longer reports a separate video segment by 2023, indicating a strategic shift away from this business line. While CMCSA continues to experience revenue declines in video services, AT&T's discontinuation of video segment reporting suggests a more definitive exit from or integration of its video offerings into other business units.",

The ground truth does confirm CMCSA's declining trend but does not provide exact dollar amounts or percentages. Therefore, the inclusion of precise numbers introduces unverified quantitative claims, reducing factual accuracy. (2) AT&T's $2,257 million video revenue in 2021 is correctly cited, and the discontinuation of segment reporting by 2023 is accurately noted. However, the LLM implies a direct numerical comparison between CMCSA’s recent decline and AT&T’s 2021 figure, which is misleading due to different timeframes and reporting statuses. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that CMCSA continues to report declining video revenue while AT&T no longer reports it separately, indicating a strategic shift. This aligns with the ground truth’s interpretation. However, the unsupported revenue figures for CMCSA undermine the quantitative comparison.

However, the UNH cost of products sold is slightly off: ground truth is $46,694 million ($46.694 billion), but LLM reports $46.7 billion, which is a minor rounding difference. More notably, the LLM states UNH’s cost of products sold represents 13.2% of total operating costs, while the ground truth is 12.6% (based on $46,694M / $367,991M). This discrepancy suggests either incorrect input data or miscalculation. ABT’s proportion is correctly approximated at 53% (actual: 52.9%), and total operating cost of $35.1 billion is accurate (vs $35,125 million). (2) Calculations: The sum $18.7B + $46.7B = $65.4B is correct. ABT’s percentage (18,706 / 35,125 ≈ 53.2%) is reasonably rounded to 53%. UNH’s percentage should be 46,694 / 367,991 ≈ 12.68%, which rounds to 12.7%, not 13.2% — indicating a factual or computational error.

      "original_answer": "An investor would assess that Amazon's explicitly disclosed exposure to foreign exchange risk—resulting in a $2.3 billion fair value decline under a 10% adverse movement—provides a concrete estimate of FX sensitivity for foreign-denominated assets. Tesla, while not quantifying its FX exposure directly, holds available-for-sale marketable securities that are also subject to fair value adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. If Tesla's marketable securities included significant foreign-denominated holdings similar to Amazon’s foreign funds, an investor would infer that Tesla could also face material fair value declines under a similar FX shock. This would negatively impact Tesla’s equity valuation through accumulated other comprehensive income, just as Amazon experiences, thereby creating parallel valuation risks for both companies under sustained foreign exchange volatility.",

Consequently, a comparable 10% adverse FX shock could produce a multi‑billion‑dollar hit to Amazon’s equity through accumulated other comprehensive income and a comparable mark‑to‑market loss for Tesla, potentially compressing both companies’ market‑cap valuations.",

These quantitative and entity-specific facts are correct. (2) All numbers and percentages match the ground truth: $2.3 billion and 10% adverse FX move are accurately reported. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—linking Amazon’s disclosed FX sensitivity to Tesla’s potential exposure via similar asset types—but contains a key error in accounting treatment: available-for-sale securities are marked to market through *accumulated other comprehensive income* (AOCI), not *directly in earnings*. The LLM incorrectly states Tesla's valuation changes would be 'recognized directly in earnings', which misrepresents the accounting impact. This undermines the qualitative accuracy, as it misleads on how equity valuation would be affected. (4) Despite this error, the core insight—that both companies could face material equity valuation impacts from FX shocks due to fair value accounting for foreign-denominated assets—is valid and contextually relevant. The conclusion about potential market-cap compression is reasonable. However, the incorrect accounting treatment reduces the qualitative accuracy score.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing pricing models based on revenue per customer is appropriate, and the conclusion about CMCSA having a higher price point is directionally correct. However, the flawed data undermines the validity of the inference. The explanation for the difference (bundled services vs. streaming subscription) is missing in the LLM answer, reducing qualitative accuracy. (4) Correctness is severely penalized due to the major numerical error in Netflix's revenue, which is off by over 50%. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to this error. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the reasoning framework is logical but based on false premises.

      "original_answer": "Capital One (COF) reported an increase in purchase volume, which directly contributes to the 'purchase volume' component of Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) as defined by Mastercard (MA). MA defines GDV as the sum of purchase volume and cash volume (e.g., cash disbursements, balance transfers, and convenience checks). Since COF’s increase is specifically in 'purchase volume,' it maps directly to the portion of GDV that excludes cash volume, meaning the rise in COF's purchase volume contributes proportionally to the growth in MA's GDV, particularly on a local currency and U.S. dollar-converted basis.",

These numbers appear fabricated or incorrectly sourced, significantly undermining quantitative accuracy. The ground truth does not specify any numerical percentage or dollar amount for Capital One’s purchase volume increase, so including such precise figures constitutes a major factual error. (2) Despite the incorrect numbers, the qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Capital One’s purchase volume increase impacts the 'purchase volume' component of Mastercard’s GDV, and it acknowledges that this is a key part of GDV. It also correctly links this to Mastercard’s assessment revenue drivers (cross-border and domestic), which shows understanding of the broader financial context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—connecting Capital One’s reported metric to Mastercard’s definition of GDV—is logically valid and aligns with the ground truth. The answer correctly isolates 'purchase volume' as a core component of GDV and distinguishes it from other potential elements (like cash volume), even if it doesn’t explicitly mention cash volume. However, the omission of cash volume as a component of GDV (per MA's definition) represents a partial failure in completeness and conceptual precision. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response stays focused on the relationship between COF and MA metrics and addresses the core linkage between purchase volume and GDV.

This reflects UNH's financial performance trends driven by Medicare Advantage funding pressures, Medicaid redeterminations, and the $8.3 billion loss on the sale of its Brazil operations, while ABT's decline stems from broader operational challenges and investments in its healthcare business, both indicating significant headwinds in their core markets.",

According to the ground truth, ABT had a net earnings *increase* of $7,679 million, while UNH had a decrease of $7,902 million, resulting in a combined change of -$7,232 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states that *both* companies had a $7.9 billion decrease, claiming ABT declined from $13.4B to $5.5B (a $7.9B drop), which contradicts the ground truth showing ABT's earnings increased. The UNH decline is directionally correct but the magnitude is misrepresented (stated as $7.9B vs actual $7,902M = ~$7.9B, which is close but based on incorrect prior values). The combined decline of $15.8B is therefore incorrect—double the actual net change in absolute terms and wrong in sign. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM computes a $15.8B total drop by adding two $7.9B drops, but this ignores the ground truth that ABT actually increased earnings. The correct calculation is +7,679M – 7,902M = -223M, but the original answer states -$7,232M, suggesting possible typo in ground truth or misalignment in data; however, per instructions, we treat the original answer as ground truth. Even so, LLM’s numbers do not align with any plausible interpretation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model should have retrieved and contrasted ABT’s positive change with UNH’s negative change, but instead falsely reported both as declining. This breaks the synthesis across entities.

This amount flowed directly to Tesla's net income. In contrast, Amazon disclosed that a 1% increase in its inventory valuation allowance would result in an additional $370 million in cost of sales. While Amazon's FX exposure is not explicitly quantified, changes in exchange rates could influence inventory valuation allowances, particularly for inventory held in foreign jurisdictions, thereby indirectly affecting its financial performance.",

However, it fails to include the specific quantitative disclosures from the ground truth: Tesla's $257 million favorable FX impact and Amazon's $370 million sensitivity to a 1% increase in inventory valuation allowance. These omissions are significant because the question explicitly asks for 'specific financial sensitivities disclosed'—a core requirement.

While the LLM describes the direction of impact, it does not quantify it as required by the original answer and the 10-K disclosures.

      "llm_answer": "The combined reach‑forward losses recorded by Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) in 2024 for their aircraft programs total roughly **$1.4 billion** – BA recorded a $1.41 billion loss on its MFC program (including $1.31 billion of additional losses in Q4 2024) and LMT recorded a $100 million cumulative loss on its Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program.  \n\nBoth companies disclose that the losses stem from different program‑specific issues: Boeing’s loss reflects deteriorating performance, higher estimated costs and schedule delays on its classified MFC contract and related fixed‑price development options, while Lockheed Martin’s loss is tied to the Canadian CMHP’s lower flight‑hour usage, funding uncertainties and the risk of further cost overruns on that military‑customer program.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The combined total of reach-forward losses is stated as roughly $1.4 billion, but the ground truth is $4,099 million ($4.099 billion), which is significantly higher. The LLM incorrectly attributes a $1.41 billion loss to Boeing on its MFC program, when in fact Boeing’s losses were $2,608 million in Q3 and $891 million in Q4 (totaling $3.5 billion) on the 777X program, not MFC. Lockheed Martin’s loss is reported as $100 million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program, but the actual loss was $1.4 billion on a classified program within MFC. (2) Calculation and number verification: The LLM’s sum of $1.41B + $0.1B = $1.51B (rounded to $1.4B) is mathematically close to their stated total, but all input values are factually wrong. The correct sum is $2,608M + $891M + $1,400M = $4,899M? Wait — correction: $2,608M (BA Q3) + $891M (BA Q4) = $3,499M for Boeing; plus LMT’s $1,400M = $4,899M? But original answer says $4,099M. Recheck: $2,608 + $891 = $3,499; $3,499 + $1,400 = $4,899 — discrepancy in ground truth? No — original answer says $4,099 million. This suggests possible error in ground truth or misreading. Wait: original answer says 'combined total... is $4,099 million'. But $2,608 + $891 = $3,499; $3,499 + $1,400 = $4,899. So either the ground truth has a typo or the numbers are misstated. However, assuming the original answer is authoritative, the LLM still fails because it reports $1.4B total, which is far below even the possibly incorrect $4,099M. But more importantly, the attribution is wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM confuses Boeing’s 777X program with MFC (a Lockheed segment), and misattributes LMT’s loss to a Canadian helicopter program instead of a classified fixed-price development program. It also reverses or distorts the causes: Boeing’s issues are with 777X production delays, labor, and supply chain — not a classified MFC contract. LMT’s loss is due to cost overruns on a classified fixed-price program — not low flight hours or funding uncertainty on CMHP. (4) Scores justified: correctness is low (2/10) due to almost all facts being incorrect; quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) — numbers are off by billions; qualitative accuracy is 2 due to wrong programs, causes, and entities; contextual relevance is 3 because it addresses reach-forward losses and causes, but for wrong companies and programs.",

According to the ground truth, BMY's current liability is $57 million and DHR's is $58 million, summing to $115 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states BMY's current liability as $57 million (correct) but assigns DHR's noncurrent liability ($544 million) as its current liability, leading to a false total of $601 million. For noncurrent liabilities, the LLM reverses the companies' values: it assigns $544 million to BMY (which is actually DHR's noncurrent liability) and $254 million to DHR (which does not match the ground truth of $544 million for DHR and $524 million for BMY). The correct combined noncurrent total is $1,068 million, but the LLM calculates $798 million based on incorrect inputs. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on wrong data, so quantitative accuracy is very low. The correct totals are $115M (current) and $1,068M (noncurrent), but LLM reports $601M and $798M respectively—both incorrect.

These numbers are drastically different and not within any reasonable rounding or formatting variation.

The actual sum is $101 + $1,058 = $1,159 million. Additionally, the LLM misattributes PM's entire movement to a negative $36 million from post-employment, whereas in reality PM had positive $101 million from Post-Employment and $40 million from Post-Retirement. Altria’s breakdown is also incorrect—ground truth shows $85M and $5M respectively, not reflected at all in the LLM response.

      "original_answer": "MET reported a $429 million loss in 2021 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its non-VA program derivatives, indicating a direct financial impact from currency movements. Meanwhile, Visa uses established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates to calculate its nominal payments volume, which is a key metric for determining service revenues.

The key financial implication—that exchange rates are materially impactful for MET’s derivative valuations but not for Visa’s revenue calculations—is correctly conveyed. (2) Quantitatively, the $429 million figure is accurate and properly attributed to MET in 2021; no calculations are required beyond correct reporting of this value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two different companies (MET and Visa), two different financial treatments of exchange rates (impact on derivatives vs. use in volume calculation), and correctly infers the differing financial significance. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that Visa’s use of fixed rates supports consistency in service revenue reporting—a nuance present in the original answer—but this does not undermine the core accuracy.

However, it fails to include GD's unvested restricted stock shares, claiming the data is not in the provided pages. Since the ground truth includes a combined figure, the data for GD must have been available in the source documents (or knowledge graph), and the model failed to retrieve or synthesize it.

However, the LLM reports Danaher's increase as $1,137 million (off by $100 million) and calculates a total increase of $2,167 million (off by $258 million). While the BMY increase of $1,030 million is correct, the DHR figure is inaccurate. (2) The LLM provides specific values for beginning and ending Gross PPE (e.g., BMY from $10,419M to $11,449M), which are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified here, but the implied difference for BMY ($1,030M) matches. For Danaher, the LLM states an increase from $7,142M to $8,279M, which equals $1,137M — this contradicts the ground truth of $1,237M, indicating a $100M error. The total combined increase is therefore miscalculated as $2,167M instead of $1,909M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model correctly identifies both companies, the metric (Gross PPE), and the year-over-year change, and attempts to sum the increases and compare growth.

      "original_answer": "For MDLZ, favorable volume/mix was a key contributor to the 14.7% organic net revenue growth, alongside higher net pricing. This favorable volume/mix was driven by performance in AMEA, Latin America, and Europe, which saw improved product mix and volume gains, while North America remained flat. In comparison, PM reported an 8.6% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions, which was also attributed to favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, partially offset by lower cigarette volume. Thus, while both companies benefited from favorable volume/mix, MDLZ experienced broader regional volume and mix improvements, whereas PM's gains were more product-specific, centered on HTUs.",

It incorrectly states Broadcom's sales of investments as $17,732 million (correct value: $228 million) and Broadcom’s purchases as $175 million (correct value: $346 million). These numbers are significantly off and not supported by the ground truth. Microsoft’s sales ($14,354 million) and purchases ($37,651 million) are correctly reported. However, due to the incorrect Broadcom figures, the combined sales ($32,086 million vs correct $14,582 million) and combined purchases ($37,826 million vs correct $38,000 million) are both wrong. The net outflow is not calculated in the LLM answer, but the conclusion that purchases exceeded sales is directionally correct, though based on incorrect totals. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM’s incorrect numbers but do not match the ground truth. The correct combined sales are $228M + $14,354M = $14,582M, and combined purchases are $346M + $37,651M = $37,997M (~$38,000M). The LLM’s sums are based on false inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM attempts to aggregate across two companies and compare sales vs purchases—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Broadcom. This suggests a failure in entity-metric alignment for AVGO. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question: combined sales, combined purchases, and comparison.

The ground truth states that V (Visa) reported a risk-free rate of 1.1% in 2022, but the LLM incorrectly states it as 0.5%. This is a critical error affecting the core quantitative comparison. Additionally, the difference between MET's 2.48% and V's 1.1% is 1.38%, which the LLM fails to compute or mention, despite the question explicitly asking for the difference. (2) Number verification: MET’s 2021 highest risk-free rate is correctly cited as 2.48% (within the 0.08%–2.48% range), which matches the ground truth. However, V’s 2022 rate is wrong—0.5% vs. correct value 1.1%. This invalidates any derived analysis depending on that figure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that MET used a range and V used a single-point estimate, which reflects an understanding of differing financial assumptions in valuation models. However, because the V rate is incorrect, the synthesis is flawed. The LLM also mentions 'performance-based share valuation' which is not in the original and slightly shifts focus from general stock option valuations.

This negatively impacted net revenues and partially offset the benefits from higher net pricing, contributing to only a 0.6% increase in segment operating income ($3 million). In contrast, PM saw a favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by higher heated tobacco unit (HTU) volume, which contributed to an 8.6% increase in net revenues (excluding currency and acquisitions) and a 25.1% increase in operating income (excluding currency and acquisitions).

While it correctly identifies MDLZ's unfavorable volume/mix and PM's growth from heated tobacco unit (HTU) volume, the specific numbers are incorrect. The ground truth states MDLZ's volume/mix impact was -2.4 percentage points, not -2.1 as claimed. More critically, the LLM claims MDLZ's operating income increased by 4.6% before being offset—this is false; the ground truth reports only a 0.6% increase ($3 million) in segment operating income. The $90 million reduction in operating income is unsupported by the original data. For PM, the LLM correctly cites the 25.1% operating income growth (excluding currency and acquisitions), but incorrectly adds a 13.4% total operating income rise and a $339 million increase, which are not in the original. The HTU volume growth is cited as 12-15%, but the original does not specify a percentage range for volume growth—only that it drove an 8.6% revenue increase. (2) Calculations: The LLM fabricates dollar impacts ($90M, $339M) and percentage changes (4.6%, 13.4%) not present or implied in the ground truth. The only correct calculation is PM’s 25.1% operating income growth (excluding currency and acquisitions). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly contrasts MDLZ’s volume challenges with PM’s HTU-driven growth, showing understanding of the comparative structure. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the net impact: MDLZ had a small positive increase (0.6%), not a decline, while PM’s strong growth is correctly emphasized. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4) due to major quantitative errors despite some correct qualitative trends. Quantitative accuracy is poor (3) due to fabricated numbers.

In contrast, Qualcomm's valuation allowance reflects uncertainty in realizing future tax benefits, which directly impacts its deferred tax asset carrying value and overall financial position.

      "llm_answer": "Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue was $18,284 million, while Qualcomm's fiscal 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was $1,154 million, giving a combined total of $19,438 million. Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the contract term as services are delivered, whereas Qualcomm's valuation allowance reflects a reduction in the carrying value of its deferred tax assets due to uncertainty about future taxable income, resulting in a direct reduction of earnings rather than revenue recognition.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue was $11.3 billion, but the LLM reports $18,284 million ($18.284 billion), which is over 60% higher. Similarly, Qualcomm's valuation allowance is reported as $1.2 billion in the ground truth, but the LLM states $1,154 million ($1.154 billion), which is close but still incorrect. The combined total is therefore wrong: $19.438 billion (LLM) vs. the correct $12.5 billion. (2) Number verification: $11.3B + $1.2B = $12.5B is the correct sum; the LLM's sum of $18,284M + $1,154M = $19,438M is mathematically correct based on its inputs but built on incorrect data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly identifies that it must extract two figures from different companies and combine them, and it attempts to contrast the recognition methods. The qualitative explanation of revenue recognition (ratable over time) and valuation allowance (due to uncertainty in future taxable income) is reasonable and aligns with accounting principles. However, the failure to retrieve correct figures from the source data undermines the reasoning. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent of the response match the question, and the conceptual contrast is appropriately framed. However, the correctness score is low due to major factual errors in core financial data, which are critical in financial analysis. Quantitative accuracy is severely penalized due to incorrect base figures, even though the format (millions) and calculation logic are acceptable.",

      "question": "How do the disclosures in the financial statements of Disney and Google reveal different operational dependencies on advertising revenues, based on their respective breakdowns of revenue sources and operating activities?",
      "original_answer": "Disney discloses that advertising revenues are a significant component of its service revenues, alongside affiliate fees, subscription fees, and other revenue streams tied to media networks and entertainment offerings. This indicates that advertising plays a key but not dominant role in its service-based revenue model. In contrast, Google explicitly states that advertising revenues from Google Search, Network properties, and YouTube ads are its largest source of cash provided by operations, highlighting a much more central and foundational role of advertising in Google’s financial structure. Therefore, while both companies rely on advertising revenues, Disney integrates it as one of several major revenue streams, whereas Google positions it as the core driver of its operating cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's financial statements reveal that its advertising revenue is embedded within broader service revenues (e.g., affiliate fees, subscription fees, and licensing) and is not a standalone, explicitly quantified line item in its segment reporting. Instead, Disney's revenue breakdown by segment (e.g., Media and Entertainment Distribution, Parks, Experiences and Products) shows advertising-related income as part of \"significant service revenues\" like affiliate and subscription fees, but the disclosures do not isolate advertising as a primary dependency. In contrast, Google's financial statements explicitly highlight advertising as the **core driver** of its revenue, with \"Google Services\" (which includes advertising) contributing $91.855 billion in operating income in 2021, and the text explicitly states that \"advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube ads\" are the \"largest source of cash provided by operations.\" Google's revenue breakdown by segment (Google Services, Google Cloud, Other Bets) directly ties its financial performance to advertising, whereas Disney's disclosures treat advertising as one of many service revenue streams without segment-level emphasis on its dependency. Thus, Disney's revenue model relies on diversified service and product sales (e.g., parks, merchandise, licensing), while Google's operational dependency is fundamentally anchored to advertising as the primary revenue engine.",

(1) It correctly conveys that Disney treats advertising as part of broader service revenues without isolating it as a standalone segment-level metric, while Google explicitly identifies advertising as its core revenue driver. The key qualitative distinction—that advertising is foundational for Google but one of several streams for Disney—is accurately captured. (2) The LLM introduces a specific quantitative figure: 'Google Services' contributing $91.855 billion in operating income in 2021. While this number is plausible and consistent with Google's financials (e.g., Alphabet's 2021 10-K reports ~$91.8B in operating income from Google Services), the original ground truth does not include this specific number. Since the ground truth does not confirm or deny this figure, and the LLM does not contradict it, this addition does not constitute an error but slightly exceeds the provided truth. No incorrect calculations or misstated numbers are present. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in revenue disclosure practices and operational dependencies across two companies, drawing on segment reporting and cash flow emphasis. (4) The answer is contextually rich, directly addressing the question about operational dependencies as revealed in financial disclosures.

Specifically, Danaher deems acquisition-related transaction costs significant if they exceed the typical range, especially for larger acquisitions. In contrast, Pfizer excludes acquisition-related items such as transaction, integration, restructuring charges, and additional depreciation costs because they are unique to each transaction and represent costs incurred to restructure and integrate businesses post-acquisition. Pfizer also notes that these integration costs may span several years and are often tied to external approvals.

In contrast, Pfizer excludes acquisition-related items to present a clearer picture of the underlying performance of its established business, emphasizing the sustainability of its core operations and financial metrics used for executive compensation and investor communication, while also acknowledging that such costs are unique to each transaction and not reflective of ongoing business activities. Both companies use these adjustments to enhance comparability, but Danaher’s approach underscores a more pronounced separation between acquisition integration and core business performance, whereas Pfizer’s rationale aligns with its focus on long-term operational stability and governance of financial incentives tied to adjusted earnings.",

These figures are quantitatively accurate with no errors in numbers or percentages. (2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect—each percentage is correctly cited and contextually placed with the right company and metric. (3) However, the LLM answer falls short in completeness and reasoning depth. While it notes that HD’s ticket growth had a 'proportionally stronger impact' than LOW’s, it omits the key multi-hop insight from the ground truth: that LOW’s lower comparable sales growth despite strong ticket growth was due to a decline in customer transactions (-4.2%). This missing causal explanation significantly weakens the qualitative accuracy, as the synthesis across both drivers (ticket size and transaction volume) is incomplete. The original answer explains *why* LOW’s sales growth was lower, while the LLM answer only observes the disparity without diagnosing it. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the response directly addresses the relationship between average ticket and sales growth for both companies.

      "original_answer": "FedEx applies fuel surcharges on both air and ground services that are adjusted weekly (with some international FedEx Express surcharges updated monthly), allowing it to more closely align surcharge revenue with current fuel prices. In contrast, Union Pacific notes that its fuel surcharge programs trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, which can lead to volatility in quarterly and yearly results, especially during periods of rapid fuel price changes. This difference in fuel surcharge responsiveness means FedEx can more quickly pass fuel cost increases to customers, while Union Pacific faces a built-in delay that may expose it to more financial risk during volatile fuel markets.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx mitigates fuel cost volatility by adjusting its fuel surcharge weekly, allowing near‑real‑time recovery of price changes, whereas Union Pacific’s two‑month lag in surcharge recovery means it bears fuel price fluctuations longer before passing them to customers, making FedEx’s mechanism more responsive to rapid fuel price swings.",

This aligns with the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the 'weekly' adjustment for FedEx and 'two-month lag' for Union Pacific are correctly stated and match the original answer. No calculations are required, but the temporal comparison is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—linking adjustment frequency to risk exposure and responsiveness during fuel price swings. The LLM synthesizes the operational mechanism with financial impact, though it omits a minor detail from the original answer: that some international FedEx Express surcharges are updated monthly. This omission does not affect the core conclusion but slightly reduces completeness.

The ground truth indicates that the correct difference is $2,122 million, meaning either Danaher's 'other long-term liabilities' was $0 or not present, and Pfizer's liability alone accounts for the full difference. The LLM fails to extract or acknowledge this key comparison. (2) The LLM incorrectly repeats '$2,122 million' as Pfizer's liability but then misuses it by suggesting it's also a value for Danaher, which is factually wrong and confusing. The number $2,122 million is the difference, not necessarily Pfizer's standalone value. There is no indication of correct calculation or data extraction. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have retrieved Pfizer's noncurrent deferred tax liability, located Danaher's 'other long-term liabilities' in its 2024 10-K, and computed the difference.

(2) The numbers are not only incorrect but misattributed: the $7,429 million figure cited for MCD is actually NKE's cash provided by operations in fiscal 2024, not an increase and not for MCD. There is no basis for the $9,600 million figure for NKE. The correct calculation is $2.2B (MCD) + $1.588B (NKE) = $3.788B, which rounds to $3.79B, but the ground truth states $4.016B—this slight discrepancy may stem from more precise underlying figures, but the LLM's error is far larger. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM swaps the attributions between companies.

(2) Quantitative accuracy fails on nearly all counts: percentages are wrong (6.2% vs correct 5.1% for LOW), dollar values are incorrect (both listed as $4,952M, but HD was actually $9,225M), and derived calculations (percentage point difference and dollar difference) are therefore completely wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize flooring sales percentages and dollar amounts from each company's fiscal 2022 data, and incorrectly compares them. It does not compute the correct percentage point difference (1.0) or the correct dollar difference ($4,273M). (4) Scores are low because the answer contradicts the ground truth on all key metrics. Contextual relevance is slightly above zero because the answer attempts the right structure (comparing percentages and dollar values) and mentions the correct companies and fiscal year, but all substantive content is incorrect.",

      "original_answer": "Apple involved Ernst & Young's tax subject matter resources to assess the technical merits of its tax positions, based on knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with taxing authorities. Oracle similarly involved tax subject matter professionals during its audit to evaluate the technical merits of uncertain tax positions, using the same type of external expertise. Both companies also referenced communications with taxing authorities and, in Apple’s case, received external legal counsel confirmation letters. This shared reliance on external tax specialists reveals that both companies face complex tax compliance challenges that require third-party validation to ensure their tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained under scrutiny.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Apple and Oracle disclosed that their auditors—Ernst & Young—performed detailed testing of controls and substantive procedures over the evaluation and measurement of uncertain tax positions, including involvement of tax specialists and external legal counsel confirmation letters. This reliance on external tax experts underscores the highly technical and judgment‑intensive nature of their tax compliance strategies, reflecting the complexity of navigating multi‑jurisdictional tax laws and the significant discretion required to assess uncertain tax positions.",

It accurately reflects the reliance on third-party expertise to evaluate technical merits, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly implies that Ernst & Young served as the auditor for both companies, while the ground truth does not confirm that Oracle used Ernst & Young—only that Apple did.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model correctly synthesizes the use of external specialists and legal counsel in tax position evaluations and infers the complexity of tax compliance. However, the erroneous conflation of audit firms across the two companies weakens the qualitative accuracy. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer directly addresses how each company incorporated external specialists and interprets the implications for tax strategy complexity.

The LLM flips the relationship between reported and organic growth. It also fabricates a 5% net sales growth for Costco in 2024 and mentions 'U.S.' as part of 'international operations', which is incorrect—Costco’s international segment excludes the U.S. There is no mention in the ground truth of Costco’s reported net sales growth or new warehouse openings in this context. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the -4.0% FX impact is misrepresented, the -1.5% organic growth is incorrectly stated as 2.5%, and the 5% growth figure for Costco is unsupported. No calculations are required in the original, but the LLM invents numbers and comparisons. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the question asks how FX impacts reflect contrasting cost structures, the LLM fails to reference Costco’s lower wage and benefit costs—a key part of the ground truth—and instead invents explanations around 'tighter cost control' and 'lower exposure to currency volatility', which are not stated. The synthesis between Colgate’s FX headwinds and Costco’s structural cost advantages is missing. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to compare FX impacts and cost structures across the two companies, but the incorrect data and invented details undermine the analysis.

It also correctly reports Apple's total assets as $352.76B (~$352,755M) and Oracle's as $109.30B (~$109,297M), within acceptable rounding. However, the key error lies in the interpretation of the comparison: the question asks how the *combined* non-current assets compare to the *combined* total assets, but the LLM instead reports the percentage of non-current assets relative to each company's own total assets (86% of Apple’s and 58% of Oracle’s), which misaddresses the question. The correct comparison is that $295,014M is ~64.3% of $462,052M (combined total assets), which the LLM fails to compute.

This means PYPL's credit risk exposure would directly consider these interest receivables in their financial statements. In contrast, SCHW excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans when calculating its allowance for credit losses, indicating that accrued interest is treated separately and not subject to the same credit risk provisions as the principal loan amounts. This results in different financial statement visibility of credit risk exposure between the two companies, with PYPL including interest receivable in asset balances subject to credit risk and SCHW isolating it from credit loss estimation.",

Consequently, PYPL’s credit‑risk exposure is reflected in its fair‑value and unrealized‑loss disclosures, whereas Schwab’s credit‑risk exposure is measured only on the principal balance of its loan portfolio, resulting in a more conservative credit‑loss provision.",

The ground truth states that PYPL reports $36 million in accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2021, included in other current assets. However, the LLM answer incorrectly states that PYPL reports accrued interest receivable within 'funds receivable and customer accounts'—a detail not supported by the ground truth—and omits the specific $36 million figure and the December 31, 2021 date, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that SCHW excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis used in allowance for credit losses, aligning with the ground truth. However, it adds that Schwab bases its allowance on 'amortized cost net of accrued interest,' which, while semantically close, misrepresents the technical accounting treatment and lacks precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to contrast PYPL’s inclusion versus SCHW’s exclusion of accrued interest in credit risk assessment. However, it mischaracterizes PYPL’s treatment by implying credit risk is reflected via 'fair-value and unrealized-loss disclosures,' whereas the ground truth emphasizes that PYPL includes the receivable in asset balances subject to credit risk. This misrepresents the mechanism of credit risk exposure. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core comparison of financial statement treatments.

      "original_answer": "LOW reported a sales return reserve of $245 million in 2022, reflecting a concrete financial liability set aside to account for expected product returns based on historical experience. In contrast, TSLA disclosed that its sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience and are 'immaterial in all periods presented,' indicating that the company does not set aside significant reserves due to its assessment that the economic incentives for customers to return vehicles are low. This contrast reveals that LOW, as a traditional retail business, faces more frequent and predictable product returns requiring explicit financial provisioning, while TSLA's automotive sales model, especially with resale value guarantees, involves less immediate return risk due to structured buyback terms and customer financing arrangements. As a result, TSLA's revenue recognition policy assumes lower variability in returns, whereas LOW's policy reflects a more direct and material exposure to returns.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2022 sales return reserve for Lowe’s (LOW) is $245 million versus $252 million for Tesla (TSLA), reflecting a lower estimated return rate for Lowe’s home‑improvement products versus the higher uncertainty and longer warranty cycles that drive a larger reserve for Tesla’s vehicles. This disparity shows that Lowe’s applies a relatively conservative, historical‑based reserve for product returns, while Tesla uses a more complex, market‑value‑adjusted reserve that accounts for resale‑value guarantees and the greater volatility of its automotive resale prices. Consequently, Lowe’s revenue recognition is simpler and less sensitive to future return fluctuations, whereas Tesla’s policy incorporates dynamic estimates of resale value and return likelihood, leading to a more variable and often larger reserve.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors. It states that Tesla (TSLA) had a sales return reserve of $252 million in 2022, which is incorrect. The ground truth explicitly states that TSLA considers its sales return reserves 'immaterial in all periods presented' and does not report a significant reserve value. This is a critical factual inaccuracy. The $245 million figure for LOW is correct. (2) The quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $252 million figure for TSLA is fabricated or misattributed, and the comparison of reserve sizes is therefore completely reversed—LOW has a material reserve while TSLA does not. No valid calculation or comparison can be made from incorrect inputs. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM claims Tesla has a 'larger reserve' due to 'warranty cycles' and 'resale-price volatility', but the truth is that Tesla does not maintain a significant reserve because returns are structurally limited by buyback terms and low economic incentive to return. The model inverts the reality: it portrays Tesla as having higher return risk and provisioning, when in fact it has lower immediate return exposure. The characterization of Tesla’s method as 'market-value-adjusted' and 'more complex' is unsupported by the original answer, which emphasizes immateriality and low return likelihood. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the question’s structure (comparing policies, linking to revenue recognition), but the conclusions are based on false premises. The core multi-hop insight—that LOW faces predictable retail returns requiring provisioning while TSLA’s model minimizes return risk—is entirely missed and replaced with an incorrect narrative. Thus, despite addressing the question format, the answer fails on factual and logical grounds.",

According to the ground truth, MA's weighted-average fair value per option granted in 2021 was $80.92, but the LLM incorrectly states it as $12.76. MET's value is correctly reported as $9.02. The calculated difference in the LLM answer is $3.74, whereas the correct difference is $80.92 - $9.02 = $71.90. Thus, both the input value for MA and the final result are incorrect. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: one of the two key numbers is wrong ($12.76 vs $80.92), and the resulting calculation is therefore invalid. Only MET’s value is accurate.

According to the ground truth, the total combined Sales Return Reserve for LOW and TSLA is $378 million. However, the LLM states that LOW's reserve is $245 million and TSLA's is $265 million, which sum to $510 million—$132 million higher than the correct total. This indicates at least one, possibly both, of the individual figures are incorrect. (2) The quantitative accuracy is poor: even allowing for format variations, the numbers themselves do not match the ground truth. The sum of $245M + $265M = $510M is materially off from $378M, indicating either misreading of the filings or incorrect sourcing. Additionally, the dates cited (January 28, 2022, and December 31, 2021) may reflect fiscal year-ends but need to align with the 2022 10-K reporting period; while this is plausible, the mismatch in totals undermines confidence. (3) The reasoning shows correct multi-hop structure—identifying the reserve for each company and implying summation—but fails in execution due to incorrect base data. The model recognizes it must extract from two separate 10-Ks and combine them, which is sound logic, but the synthesis is based on erroneous inputs.

The ground truth states HD reported $10,453 million in Paint Sales and LOW reported $5,132 million, resulting in a difference of $5,321 million. The LLM incorrectly reports the difference as $1,327 million, which is off by over $4 billion. Additionally, the percentages are wrong: the correct values are ~3.5% of HD's total sales and ~5.5% of LOW's total sales, but the LLM reports 1.1% and 3.5%, respectively. These errors suggest incorrect data retrieval or miscalculation. (2) The numbers are not accurate: $10,453M - $5,132M = $5,321M (correct), not $1,327M. The percentage of HD's total sales ($5,321M / $150,000M ≈ 3.5%) and LOW's ($5,321M / $97,000M ≈ 5.5%) are standard calculations based on total revenue from the same filings, which the LLM fails to match. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing paint sales between two companies and expressing the difference as a percentage of total sales—but the underlying data is incorrect, leading to flawed synthesis. The model appears to understand what computation is required but uses incorrect input values. (4) Due to major factual and calculation errors, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.

The combined total of $19.31 is accurate ($3.86 + $15.45 = $19.31). (2) Percentage changes are correctly approximated: the exact change for Bristol-Myers Squibb is (3.86 - 2.95) / 2.95 = 30.85%, which the model rounds to 31% (acceptable); Thermo Fisher's change is (15.45 - 17.63) / 17.63 = -12.36%, rounded to -12% (also acceptable). Minor rounding is within tolerance and does not affect factual correctness. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies and two years, correctly computes the combined EPS, and compares directional changes.

Amazon's Cash Provided by Investing Activities was $(49.8) billion in 2023, primarily due to purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures of $48.1 billion, with investments like $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, PBC. Nike, in contrast, reported $894 million in Cash Provided by Investing Activities for fiscal 2024, mainly driven by a $1,721 million cash inflow from the net change in short-term investments. Amazon's negative figure reflects heavy capital investments and acquisitions, while Nike's positive inflow highlights a strategy of liquidating short-term investments.",
      "llm_answer": "The net difference in Cash Provided by Investing Activities between Amazon's 2023 report of $(49.8) billion and Nike's 2024 report of $894 million is approximately $50.7 billion (i.e., Amazon used about $50.7 billion more cash in investing activities). This divergence is explained by Amazon’s large-scale investments in marketable securities, capital expenditures for AWS infrastructure, and acquisitions, which generated a net cash outflow of $49.8 billion, whereas Nike’s investing cash flow was driven by a modest net inflow of $894 million from the sale and maturity of short‑term investments and other portfolio adjustments.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly calculated the net difference as approximately $50.7 billion, which is semantically equivalent to the ground truth value of $(50.694) billion (difference due to rounding: 49.8 + 0.894 = 50.694). The use of 'approximately $50.7 billion' is acceptable and accurate within standard rounding conventions. (2) All key financial figures are correct: Amazon’s $(49.8) billion in 2023 and Nike’s $894 million in 2024 are accurately cited. The LLM correctly interprets Amazon’s outflow and Nike’s inflow, though it omits specific details like Nike’s $1,721 million inflow from short-term investments and Amazon’s $1.25 billion note to Anthropic, PBC. These omissions are minor and do not affect the core accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that Amazon’s negative cash flow stems from capital expenditures, marketable securities activity, and acquisitions (including AWS infrastructure), while Nike’s positive cash flow comes from portfolio adjustments and short-term investment maturities. The contrast in corporate strategy—Amazon investing heavily vs. Nike liquidating—is accurately captured. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing both the quantitative difference and the qualitative explanation. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slight lack of specificity in citing exact components (e.g., $1,721 million figure), which were present in the ground truth and would enhance completeness. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and relevant.",

      "original_answer": "Amazon's cost of sales explicitly includes inbound and outbound shipping costs, which are a major component of its fulfillment expenses. This means that any increases in shipping costs directly raise Amazon's cost of sales, thereby reducing gross margins unless offset by other factors. In contrast, Nike reported that lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs contributed to a 220 basis point gross margin expansion. This indicates that while Amazon's cost structure is sensitive to shipping cost increases, Nike benefited from reduced logistics expenses, leading to improved profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon's cost of sales structure was pressured by rising shipping costs, which contributed to higher fulfillment expenses and negatively impacted gross margin expansion. In contrast, Nike reported a decrease in logistics costs (specifically lower ocean freight and logistics costs) that supported gross margin expansion through reduced product costs, partially offsetting other expense increases.

      "original_answer": "$1,724 million",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, the calculation is as follows:\n\n- HD's effective tax rate for 2021 is 24.7% (from page 33, \"Income Tax Provision\" section), applied to its operating income of $18,278 million (from page 33, \"Operating income\" row), resulting in an implied tax adjustment of $18,278 × 24.7% = $4,515 million.\n- LOW's \"Income tax adjustment\" for 2021 is explicitly stated as $3,024 million (from page 30, \"Return on Invested Capital\" table, row \"Income tax adjustment 1\").\n- The difference is $4,515 million (HD's implied tax) – $3,024 million (LOW's actual tax adjustment) = $1,491 million.\n\nThus, LOW's 2021 income tax adjustment was $1,491 million lower than HD's implied income tax adjustment based on operating income and effective tax rate. However, the question asks \"how much higher was LOW's... compared to HD's,\" which would be negative. The correct interpretation is that LOW's adjustment was $1,491 million *lower* than HD's implied adjustment, but the question likely expects the absolute difference magnitude. The answer is $1,491 million.\n\n**Answer:** LOW's 2021 income tax adjustment was $1,491 million lower than HD's implied income tax adjustment.  \n\n(Note: The question phrasing \"how much higher\" is inconsistent with the calculation; the data shows LOW's adjustment was *lower*.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors. The ground truth answer is $1,724 million, but the LLM calculates $1,491 million, a difference of $233 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect calculation of HD's implied income tax adjustment. The LLM uses HD's operating income of $18,278 million and applies a 24.7% tax rate, yielding $4,515 million. However, according to the knowledge graph, HD's correct implied tax adjustment must have been $4,748 million (since LOW's $3,024 million + $1,724 million = $4,748 million), implying either an incorrect effective tax rate or operating income was used. (2) The LLM correctly identifies LOW's income tax adjustment as $3,024 million, which matches the ground truth. However, the calculation for HD’s implied tax adjustment is inaccurate, suggesting either a misread of the operating income or tax rate, or a calculation error. $18,278 million × 24.7% is actually approximately $4,514.67 million, which the LLM rounds to $4,515 million—this arithmetic is correct, but the inputs may not be. (3) The reasoning process is logically sound: the LLM correctly interprets the need to compute HD's implied tax adjustment by applying its effective tax rate to operating income and compare it to LOW's actual adjustment. It also notes the semantic inconsistency in the question asking 'how much higher' when the result is lower, showing strong qualitative reasoning. (4) Despite good structure and correct identification of LOW's figure, the final numerical answer is incorrect due to flawed input data or misapplication of HD's financials, leading to a moderate correctness score. The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, but the core quantitative result does not match the ground truth.",

      "original_answer": "PayPal valued its minority interest acquisitions in 2021 at an acquisition-date fair value of $64 million, derived using the value paid less a control premium based on market analysis by a third party. This approach reflects a market-based methodology that adjusts for the absence of control. In contrast, JPMorgan estimated the fair value of indemnification assets based on the timing of forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses, using a forward-looking discounted cash flow approach that incorporated expected credit loss estimates. These differences reflect the distinct nature of the assets being valued — PayPal's minority equity investments versus JPMorgan's contractual indemnification rights tied to credit risk.",
      "llm_answer": "The valuation methodologies for acquisition-date fair value estimates differed significantly between the two transactions. For the First Republic Bank acquisition, JPMorgan used market-based assumptions about expected future cash flows, discount rates, and other valuation inputs to estimate fair values of assets and liabilities, particularly for core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, indemnification assets, and the Purchase Money Note, which were valued using discounted cash flow methodologies incorporating observed market rates. In contrast, PayPal's minority interest acquisitions in 2021 relied on a different approach where the acquisition-date fair value was derived using the value paid less a control premium based on market analysis performed by a third party, resulting in a $36 million gain recognized from remeasurement of minority investments. Specific factors influencing each approach included JPMorgan's need to estimate bargain purchase gain through detailed fair value adjustments to assets like loans and deposits, while PayPal's valuation was driven by the specific transaction consideration, including cash payments and assumed equity awards, with fair value inputs focused on identifiable intangible assets and net tangible assets acquired.",

The ground truth states that PayPal's minority interest acquisitions in 2021 had an acquisition-date fair value of $64 million, but the LLM incorrectly states a $36 million gain from remeasurement, which is not mentioned in the original answer and conflates valuation with accounting gain. There is no mention of a $36 million figure in the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly frames JPMorgan's valuation in the context of the First Republic Bank acquisition, which is not referenced in the original answer and introduces a fact not present in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the $64 million figure from the original is replaced with a $36 million gain (incorrect), and no correct dollar amount for PayPal’s valuation is provided. The original does not mention any gain, only the $64 million fair value estimate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The original contrasts PayPal’s market-based approach (value paid less control premium) with JPMorgan’s forward-looking discounted cash flow based on credit loss forecasts. The LLM correctly identifies that PayPal used a value-paid-less-control-premium method but incorrectly characterizes JPMorgan’s approach as part of a broader acquisition (First Republic) not mentioned in the question or answer. The original specifies JPMorgan’s indemnification asset valuation was based on forecasted losses tied to allowance for credit losses — a credit-risk-driven DCF — but the LLM overgeneralizes to other intangibles like core deposits, which are irrelevant to the question. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses valuation methodologies and attempts to contrast the two firms, but introduces extraneous and incorrect context (First Republic, bargain purchase gain, remeasurement gain). While it captures the general idea of differing methodologies, the specific factors influencing each approach are misaligned, especially for JPMorgan.

It incorrectly states that both UNP and UPS paid $2,604 million in Gross Benefits in 2024, when in fact, according to the ground truth, UNP paid $336 million and UPS paid $2,604 million. Similarly, for 2023, it claims both paid $2,437 million (total $2,437M), but the correct figures are $230M (UNP) and $2,437M (UPS), totaling $2,667M. The LLM thus reports a 2024 total of $2,604M instead of the correct $2,940M, and a 2023 total of $2,437M instead of $2,667M. The calculated difference is $167M, but the correct difference is $273M. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs: the LLM appears to have misread the data, possibly confusing UNP’s 2024 gross benefits ($2,604M) as being from UPS, and then duplicated it for both companies. It also fails to include UNP’s actual contributions in either year. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the question requires summing values across two companies and two years, but the model only uses one company’s data (UNP) and incorrectly assumes symmetry. It acknowledges that UPS data is missing but still fabricates or assumes identical values without justification. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because it attempts to address the question and cites document locations, but the qualitative reasoning is weak due to incorrect entity attribution and failure to synthesize across sources. The model also confuses UNP (Union Pacific) with UPS (United Parcel Service), which is a critical entity error. Despite noting data limitations, it does not qualify the answer sufficiently and presents incorrect totals as factual.

Specifically, the North America operating income improvement and the reduced International operating loss were attributed to increased unit sales. In contrast, Nike reported a 12% decrease in combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels during its fiscal year 2023, which contributed to revenue declines and a 30% drop in EBIT.

The question asks about how changes in unit sales affected operating performance and the specific percentage changes in unit sales for each company, but the source material for Nike (NKE_10k_2023.pdf) only discusses revenue changes (e.g., \"revenues decreased 15% on a currency-neutral basis\") and does not break down unit sales or provide percentage changes for unit sales.

      "question": "How does the impact of net sales growth on cost management efficiency differ between Procter & Gamble's SG&A expenses and Walmart's Sam's Club segment performance, and what specific factors contribute to these differences?",
      "original_answer": "Procter & Gamble experienced a 10% increase in SG&A expenses to $23.3 billion, with SG&A as a percentage of net sales rising 200 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to increased marketing spending. Although marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased by 170 basis points, this was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. In contrast, Walmart’s Sam’s Club segment saw net sales increase by $1.8 billion or 2.2% for fiscal 2024, with comparable sales growth benefiting from increases in transactions and average ticket, particularly in grocery and health and wellness. The Sam’s Club segment also experienced a positive contribution from e-commerce sales, which helped offset declines in fuel sales due to deflation. While P&G’s cost management was challenged by higher SG&A relative to sales growth, Walmart’s segment performance reflected more direct alignment between sales growth and operational efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of net sales growth on cost management efficiency differs significantly between Procter & Gamble (PG) and Walmart’s Sam’s Club segment. At PG, net sales growth (driven by pricing and volume increases) improved gross margins through productivity savings and higher pricing, but SG&A expenses rose as a percentage of sales due to increased marketing and overhead costs, offsetting some margin gains. In contrast, Sam’s Club’s net sales growth (primarily from comparable sales and fuel) led to a 55-basis-point increase in gross profit rate, but operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased 46 basis points due to lower fuel sales and elevated technology spending, resulting in a smaller net earnings margin improvement despite higher operating income. Thus, PG’s cost management efficiency is constrained by rising SG&A as a percentage of sales, while Sam’s Club’s efficiency gains are tempered by higher operating expense ratios from non-fuel-related cost pressures.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in quantitative details. According to the ground truth, Procter & Gamble's SG&A expenses increased by 10% to $23.3 billion, with SG&A as a percentage of net sales rising 200 basis points to 27.7%, driven by a 170 basis point increase in marketing spend. However, the LLM answer incorrectly states that marketing and overhead costs rose without citing these specific figures and misrepresents the scale of the increase. More critically, the LLM introduces a '55-basis-point increase in gross profit rate' and a '46 basis point increase in operating expenses' for Sam’s Club, which are not present in the original answer and contradict the ground truth, which does not mention gross profit rate changes or technology spending. The Sam’s Club sales increase was $1.8 billion (2.2%), driven by transactions, average ticket, grocery, health and wellness, and e-commerce offsetting fuel deflation—none of which are accurately reflected in the LLM answer. (2) The LLM invents metrics (e.g., 55 and 46 basis point changes) not found in the source, fails to report the correct SG&A percentage (27.7%) or the 200 basis point rise, and omits the $23.3 billion SG&A figure. It also incorrectly attributes Sam’s Club sales growth to 'fuel' when the ground truth states fuel sales declined due to deflation. (3) While the LLM attempts multi-hop reasoning by comparing cost management efficiency between P&G and Sam’s Club, it fails to correctly synthesize the actual data. It misidentifies the drivers of efficiency—e.g., claiming technology spending affected Sam’s Club when this is not in the original—and mischaracterizes the relationship between sales growth and expense ratios. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent align with the question, discussing both companies and their cost efficiency in relation to sales growth. However, due to major quantitative errors and incorrect causal factors, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the general direction of reasoning (P&G facing SG&A pressure, Sam’s Club benefiting from e-commerce) is partially aligned, but specifics are flawed.",

      "question": "Considering NVIDIA's change in asset depreciation policy and Oracle's approach to recognizing cloud services revenue, how do their respective financial reporting strategies reflect different operational approaches in managing cloud infrastructure costs and revenue recognition?",
      "original_answer": "NVIDIA extended the useful lives of its server, storage, and network equipment, resulting in a $135 million increase in operating income for fiscal year 2024 due to lower depreciation expenses. This indicates a cost management strategy focused on optimizing asset utilization over time. In contrast, Oracle recognizes cloud services revenue ratably or based on customer usage, which reflects a revenue recognition strategy tied directly to service delivery patterns. Comparing these approaches reveals that NVIDIA focuses on spreading infrastructure costs over a longer period to improve profitability metrics, while Oracle aligns revenue recognition closely with actual service consumption, highlighting different financial reporting strategies in managing cloud operations.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s depreciation policy change—extending server, storage and network equipment lives from three to four or five years and assembly/test equipment from five to seven years—reduces depreciation expense, boosting reported operating income and net income (e.g., $135 million increase in operating income, $114 million increase in net income for fiscal 2024). Oracle, by contrast, recognizes cloud‑services revenue ratably over the contract period and records deferred cloud‑services revenue (over $8 billion) as customer prepayments, reflecting a revenue‑recognition approach that spreads earnings evenly as services are delivered rather than accelerating recognition. Thus, NVIDIA’s accounting adjustment lowers expense to improve profitability, while Oracle’s cloud‑revenue model aligns revenue recognition with service delivery, illustrating divergent operational focuses on cost management versus subscription‑based revenue timing.",

Oracle's ratable revenue recognition and deferred revenue over $8 billion are accurately stated.

(3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes NVIDIA’s cost-focused asset management with Oracle’s revenue recognition tied to service delivery, drawing a valid contrast in operational and financial reporting strategies. The conclusion about divergent focuses on cost management vs. subscription revenue timing mirrors the original answer’s logic.

      "original_answer": "JPMorgan Chase reported an allowance for loan losses of $5,005 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting its large and diversified loan portfolio. PayPal's outstanding balance in its merchant loan portfolio was $1.2 billion as of the same date, significantly smaller in scale. The allowance for loan losses at JPM is designed to cover potential credit losses across a broad range of loans, while PayPal's credit risk is concentrated in its merchant finance products like PPWC and PPBL, where repayment depends on merchants' payment processing volumes. The difference in scale indicates that JPM has a much larger and systemically important lending operation, while PayPal’s lending is more specialized and tied to its digital payments ecosystem.",
      "llm_answer": "The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of outstanding balances reveals a stark contrast in risk exposure between JPMorgan Chase and PayPal. JPMorgan's allowance for loan losses was $5,005 million against $278,208 million in total retained loans (1.80% ratio), reflecting its large-scale, diversified lending portfolio with established credit risk models. In contrast, PayPal's allowance for merchant receivables was $160 million against $1,193 million in total outstanding merchant loans and advances (13.4% ratio), indicating significantly higher credit risk relative to its smaller, newer merchant finance portfolio. This disparity underscores that JPMorgan's lending operations, while larger in scale, benefit from more mature risk management and lower relative credit risk, whereas PayPal's merchant finance exposure carries a substantially higher allowance requirement relative to its asset base, reflecting its newer, less seasoned portfolio and greater vulnerability to merchant default.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer introduces specific quantitative figures not present in the original answer, such as JPMorgan's total retained loans ($278,208 million) and PayPal's allowance ($160 million) and outstanding loans ($1,193 million), which are not provided in the ground truth. While these numbers may be factually accurate, they go beyond the information in the original answer and introduce potential inaccuracies since they cannot be verified against the provided ground truth. The original answer states JPMorgan's allowance as $5,005 million (correctly cited) and PayPal's outstanding balance as $1.2 billion (close to LLM's $1.193 billion, acceptable). However, the $160 million allowance for PayPal is not mentioned in the original, making it an unsupported addition. (2) The calculation of percentages (1.80% for JPM, 13.4% for PayPal) is mathematically sound if the inputs are correct, but since the denominator and allowance for PayPal are not confirmed in the ground truth, the derived ratios cannot be validated and may misrepresent risk exposure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly contrasts scale and risk, infers that JPMorgan has a diversified portfolio with mature risk models, and links PayPal's higher relative allowance to its concentrated, newer merchant finance business tied to payment volumes. This aligns with and expands upon the original answer’s qualitative insights. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer directly addresses the question about scale and risk exposure, synthesizing differences in allowance, portfolio size, and business models. However, the unsupported numbers reduce quantitative accuracy. The original answer focuses on scale and concentration without providing ratios or PayPal's allowance, so while the LLM adds analytical depth, it introduces unverified data.

However, both components are accurately presented, and the individual amounts are correct. (2) All numeric values are accurate: $5.0 billion for BMY’s share repurchase and $5 billion for JNJ’s opioid settlement are correctly reported, with acceptable format variation ($5.0 billion vs $5 billion). The mention of specific state payments ($263 million to New York, $297 million to Texas) adds contextual detail but does not contradict the total. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different companies (BMY and JNJ) and two distinct financial obligations (share repurchase vs. legal settlement) is correctly synthesized. The LLM acknowledges both commitments as part of 2022 financial obligations, aligning with the question's scope. (4) While the LLM does not explicitly compute the total $10.0 billion, it provides both inputs needed for the sum and clearly conveys that each company committed $5 billion, making the total semantically inferable.

      "original_answer": "Elevated consumer debt levels are causing discretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers for Altria, influencing their purchasing behaviors, including brand mix and adoption of smoke-free products. This directly affects Altria's strategy to maintain a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% through 2028 while investing in innovative smoke-free products. Similarly, Walmart notes that consumer debt levels impact buying patterns and disposable income, prompting them to absorb cost increases, reduce prices in certain categories, and focus on opening-price points to maintain customer spending. Both companies are adapting to the same macroeconomic constraint—elevated consumer debt—by adjusting their product and pricing strategies to retain consumers and maintain financial performance.",

Meanwhile, Walmart explicitly links inflation and consumer debt to its pricing decisions, stating that \"merchandise costs continued to be impacted by inflation\" and that it employs strategies like \"absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers\" and \"focusing on opening price points\" to mitigate the impact of higher debt-driven cost pressures on consumer spending.",

Instead, Apple emphasizes general safety and security training as part of its workplace policies, with no explicit mention of a required annual cybersecurity‑training program.\n\nAdobe, by contrast, outlines a concrete cybersecurity‑risk‑management structure: it requires all employees to complete annual general security‑awareness training, adds role‑specific engineering and security training, maintains a cybersecurity steering committee, and ties training to its incident‑response and governance processes. This reflects a more formal, mandatory approach to security education across the organization.\n\nThe contrast suggests Apple relies on a general safety culture and ad‑hoc security practices, whereas Adobe adopts a structured, company‑wide program with defined training obligations and governance oversight to mitigate cyber risks.",

      "original_answer": "Altria, as a holding company, is primarily dependent on the capital resources of its subsidiaries to satisfy its liquidity requirements, receiving cash from dividends, distributions, and interest on intercompany loans. At the end of 2023, Altria had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and believed its liquidity position, including access to credit markets and future operating cash flows, was sufficient to meet its obligations and fund dividends, share repurchases, and debt repayments. Walmart, on the other hand, considers several factors when executing its $20.0 billion share repurchase program, including current cash needs, leverage capacity, and the cost of borrowings. As of January 31, 2024, $16.5 billion remained available under the program, which Walmart expects to fund primarily through free cash flow. Both companies factor the cost of borrowings into their capital allocation decisions, but Altria's reliance on subsidiary cash flows reflects a structural dependency, while Walmart's approach is more directly tied to its operational free cash flow generation.",

In contrast, Walmart’s $20 billion share‑repurchase program is funded primarily from its own operating cash flow and supplemented by its $3 billion credit agreement and commercial‑paper program, with its cost of borrowings (weighted‑average rates of 5.1 % for short‑term and ~4 % for long‑term debt) influencing the timing and scale of repurchases.

However, there are minor quantitative inaccuracies: Altria’s cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion (not mentioned in LLM answer), and Walmart had $16.5 billion remaining on its $20.0 billion repurchase program as of January 31, 2024—details omitted in the LLM response. The LLM states Altria has a $3 billion credit facility, which aligns with ground truth, but omits mention of its commercial paper use for short-term needs, which is present in the original. The 4.3% fixed-rate debt for Altria is plausible but not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth. For Walmart, the LLM cites short-term borrowing costs at 5.1% and long-term at ~4%, which are specific figures not present in the original answer—these may be accurate but are not supported by the provided ground truth, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The original answer emphasizes Altria’s structural dependency on subsidiary dividends and intercompany interest, while the LLM focuses more on credit facilities, slightly shifting emphasis.

      "original_answer": "A $50 million potential decrease in ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits suggests that some previously uncertain tax positions may be resolved within the next year. This would likely result in a corresponding adjustment to ADBE's tax provision, indicating that its prior reserves were potentially overstated, or that the resolution of audits has clarified the adequacy of its tax reserves. This directly supports ADBE's assertion that it regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Similarly, AAPL also evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, though AAPL does not specify a quantitative estimate of potential changes. Both companies thus use ongoing assessments of audit outcomes to guide the sufficiency of their tax reserves, but ADBE provides a specific dollar amount of potential change, while AAPL offers a more qualitative evaluation.",

In contrast, Apple evaluates the sufficiency of its tax reserves by regularly assessing audit outcomes and the likelihood of adverse adjustments; it notes that up to $50 million of unrecognized tax benefits could be resolved in the same period, and it maintains a valuation allowance and a robust reserve framework to ensure that any such reductions do not jeopardize the adequacy of its overall tax provision.",

The original answer states that AAPL does *not* provide a quantitative estimate of potential changes, whereas the LLM claims AAPL 'notes that up to $50 million of unrecognized tax benefits could be resolved'—this is false and misrepresents AAPL's disclosure. This error fundamentally undermines the comparison. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because while the $50 million figure is correctly applied to ADBE, it is wrongly repeated for AAPL, introducing a fabricated number. No such figure exists in the ground truth for Apple. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in that the LLM correctly interprets the implication of a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits for ADBE (i.e., reduced reserves, reassessment of adequacy). It also correctly notes that both companies assess audit outcomes to evaluate tax reserve sufficiency. However, the multi-hop synthesis fails because it incorrectly equates AAPL’s approach with ADBE’s by imposing a numerical estimate on AAPL that does not exist. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses the core question about tax provision adequacy and comparisons between ADBE and AAPL, but the inclusion of false quantitative data for AAPL distorts the conclusion. The qualitative accuracy is limited by this misattribution, though the general framework of ongoing assessment and reserve management is correctly described.",

Additionally, there was a $240 million impairment related to a Phase 3 study for the treatment of DMD reflecting unfavorable clinical trial results. However, Thermo Fisher Scientific’s 2024 10-K filing only includes a placeholder note about consolidated financial statements without disclosing any specific impairments, investments, or developments in the Biopharma segment.

This impairment reflected changes in development plans, updated commercial forecasts, and emerging competition, and it was recognized as part of the company’s restructuring and cost‑reduction initiatives.  \n\nThere is insufficient evidence to link these impairments to any financial disclosures by Thermo Fisher Scientific because the provided Thermo Fisher pages contain only general risk‑management disclosures about currency hedging, tax positions, and segment information, with no mention of Pfizer’s Biopharma impairments, development programs, or related financial impacts.

However, it incorrectly states the total Biopharma segment impairment as $3.3 billion, while the ground truth specifies $2.9 billion. This discrepancy suggests an error in summing or sourcing the total. Additionally, the LLM omits the $240 million impairment related to the Phase 3 DMD study, which is a significant omission affecting completeness and quantitative accuracy. (2) The individual impairments cited are accurate in amount and context, but the missing $240 million charge and incorrect total indicate flawed aggregation. The sum of the named impairments in the ground truth is $1.0B + $475M + $435M = $1.91B, with the remainder attributed to other items and the DMD study. The LLM’s $3.3B total is substantially higher and unsupported by the data. (3) The reasoning regarding Thermo Fisher is sound: the LLM correctly observes that Thermo Fisher’s disclosures contain only general risk-management content and no specific Biopharma impairments or links to Pfizer, which aligns with the ground truth. The multi-hop synthesis—connecting Pfizer’s specific impairments to the absence of corresponding disclosures at Thermo Fisher—is logically valid and well-articulated. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, addressing both parts of the question.

It states that Lowe's (LOW) had a net deferred income tax asset of $1,766.7 million in FY2024 and $1,769.8 million in FY2023, which is actually the data for Starbucks (SBUX), not LOW. Conversely, it incorrectly attributes SBUX's data to LOW and then repeats the same numbers for SBUX, implying both companies have identical figures, which contradicts the ground truth. The correct data per the original answer is: LOW decreased from $248M (FY2023) to $244M (FY2024), a $4M decline; SBUX decreased from $1,769.8M to $1,766.7M, a $3.1M decline. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM swaps the values between companies, misreports LOW’s assets by over $1.5 billion, and fails to reflect that LOW’s base value is much smaller than SBUX’s. The $3.1M decline is correctly calculated for SBUX but wrongly applied to LOW. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly associate each company with its respective financial data across years.

In contrast, Charles Schwab states that Principal Transactions Revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients' fixed income trading activity and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions.

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM claims Charles Schwab's Principal Transactions Revenue increased by 52% to $225 million in 2023; however, this specific figure and percentage are not present in the original answer (ground truth) and cannot be verified from the provided knowledge graph, making this a fabrication or unsupported addition. There are no numbers in the original answer, so introducing specific dollar amounts and growth rates reduces quantitative accuracy. (2) The original answer emphasizes that JPMorgan’s Principal Transactions Revenue consists primarily of valuation adjustments (CVA, FVA, other valuation adjustments) and is presented net of hedging and allocations to Fixed Income and Equity Markets—this compositional detail is entirely missing in the LLM response. Instead, the LLM vaguely references 'hedging adjustments' without identifying the core components. (3) For Charles Schwab, the original answer states that the revenue arises from accommodating client fixed income trading and includes fair value adjustments to securities positions—this link to client-driven trading activity is partially reflected in the LLM’s mention of 'volume-driven drivers' but is not explicitly tied to client trading as in the ground truth. (4) The LLM focuses on presentation format (e.g., stand-alone line item vs. integrated), which is relevant and adds contextual insight not in the original, but this does not compensate for missing compositional details. (5) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing how two firms report the same revenue line—but fails to synthesize the actual substance of what makes up the revenue in each case, which is central to the question. (6) While the LLM correctly identifies that JPMorgan nets against hedges and that Schwab isolates the item, it misses the fundamental contrast in composition: valuation adjustments vs. client trading activity.

This suggests that the marketing investment did not yield a positive return in terms of profitability in that region. In contrast, PG's marketing spending in Europe and North America supported innovation and market growth, contributing to a high single-digit sales increase in Europe and a low single-digit increase in North America. PG's marketing strategy led to global market share growth in Home Care (+0.8 points) and a 230 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin, despite increased SG&A expenses.

In contrast, PG’s marketing investments in Europe and North America generated modest volume gains and helped lift its overall net‑earnings margin by 20 bps, indicating a more effective conversion of marketing spend into margin improvement and market‑share gains in those regions.

This misattribution invalidates a core part of the response. Additionally, the LLM states KO had a '7% decline in net earnings' and a '170-basis-point drop in net-earnings margin,' but the ground truth reports a decline in *operating income* from $2,303M to $2,040M (a $263M drop), with no mention of net earnings decline or margin drop of that magnitude for KO. Conversely, for PG, the LLM claims a '20 bps' margin improvement, but the ground truth states a 230 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin—this is a major discrepancy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is poor: the $263M operating income decline for KO is omitted and replaced with incorrect net earnings figures; PG’s 230 bps margin gain is misrepresented as 20 bps. The 0.3-point market share gain is not mentioned in the ground truth (which reports +0.8 points in Home Care). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model conflates product categories across companies, misassigns financial metrics (net earnings vs. operating income), and fails to correctly synthesize regional financial impacts. It incorrectly implies KO competes in skin-and-personal-care, which undermines the comparison. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant—it attempts to compare marketing effectiveness across KO and PG in specified regions and discusses market share and margin trade-offs.

Since CVS provides Medicare Advantage coverage to beneficiaries under contracts with CMS, and Medicare contracts alone accounted for 73% of CVS's federal government revenues in 2023, this exclusion could directly affect CVS's ability to offer comprehensive respiratory care coverage.

      "original_answer": "At LOW, comparable sales increased by 6.9% in fiscal 2021, driven by an 11.1% increase in comparable average ticket, which was partially offset by a 4.2% decrease in comparable customer transactions. This aligns with HD's definition of comparable sales, which is based on sales from stores open at least one year and includes e-commerce sales, as outlined in the Results of Operations section of its MD&A. The interplay between ticket size and transaction frequency directly impacts the overall comparable sales metric, showing how shifts in customer purchasing behavior affect retail performance indicators.",
      "llm_answer": "The comparable sales growth at Lowe's in fiscal 2021 was driven primarily by an 11.1% rise in comparable average ticket, which more than offset a 4.2% decline in comparable customer transactions; this increase helped lift overall comparable sales by 6.9% and contributed to the broader sales expansion reported by Home Depot.  Home Depot’s 10‑K defines comparable sales as “sales in stores that have been open at least one year, including sales through the e‑commerce channel,” which is the same metric used to measure Lowe’s comparable‑sales performance.",

(2) Entity accuracy is strong: correctly references LOW (Lowe’s) and HD (Home Depot), fiscal 2021, and the relevant metric definitions. (3) The reasoning is sound: it correctly explains that the rise in average ticket drove comp sales growth despite falling transaction volume, and links this to HD’s definition of comparable sales, which includes stores open at least one year and e-commerce—consistent with the ground truth. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the phrase 'contributed to the broader sales expansion reported by Home Depot' introduces a potentially misleading implication that Lowe’s performance directly contributed to Home Depot’s sales, which is factually incorrect—these are separate companies.

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola's 2023 10-K filing reveals that marketing spending is a critical assumption used in impairment testing for equity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets. This indicates that projected marketing expenditures directly influence the valuation and recoverability assessment of these assets. On the other hand, Procter & Gamble's 2023 10-K filing shows that marketing spending is one of the key drivers of operational performance, affecting net sales and underlying unit volume by shaping consumer demand and supporting product initiatives. Together, these disclosures highlight that marketing spending plays a dual role: for Coca-Cola, it is a forward-looking assumption in asset valuation, while for Procter & Gamble, it is an active lever to influence current financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca-Cola's 2023 disclosures reveal that its impairment testing assumptions for indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., brand trademarks) explicitly incorporate macroeconomic factors such as weakening foreign currencies, higher discount rates, and market restructuring impacts—directly tying impairment risk to external financial volatility, as seen in its $1.3 billion Gillette intangible asset impairment charge driven by currency devaluation and discount rate increases. In contrast, Procter & Gamble's 2023 disclosures position marketing spending as a deliberate operational driver tied to volume growth, pricing strategy, and productivity gains, with its SG&A increase (200 basis points to 27.7% of net sales) explicitly linked to \"marketing spending as a percentage of net sales\" rising due to intentional investment in brand initiatives, while its segment results show marketing's role in driving volume and mix—evident in Beauty's 4% pricing impact offsetting foreign exchange headwinds—without referencing impairment testing.",

However, it misrepresents the specific role of marketing spending in Coca-Cola's disclosures by emphasizing macroeconomic factors (e.g., foreign currency, discount rates) rather than explicitly stating that marketing spending itself is a key assumption in impairment testing. The $1.3 billion Gillette impairment charge is factually accurate in P&G’s filing, but attributing it to Coca-Cola is a critical error—this charge belongs to Procter & Gamble, not Coca-Cola. This misattribution severely undermines quantitative and qualitative accuracy. (2) The percentage increase in SG&A (200 basis points to 27.7%) and its linkage to marketing spending is consistent with P&G’s 2023 10-K, and the Beauty segment’s 4% pricing impact is plausible context. However, the incorrect assignment of the $1.3B impairment to Coca-Cola is a major factual flaw. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing how two companies treat marketing across financial domains—but fails in synthesis because it conflates P&G’s impairment event with Coca-Cola’s assumptions. The model should have noted that Coca-Cola incorporates marketing spend projections in cash flow models for intangible assets, while P&G discusses marketing as a driver of volume, mix, and sales growth. (4) Despite strong contextual relevance and some correct qualitative insights, the significant entity and quantitative error—misassigning a key financial figure to the wrong company—reduces the correctness score to 6.

Additionally, the LLM claims CAT reaches the rate 3 years earlier (2025 vs 2028), but the ground truth states LMT expects to reach it in 2034, not 2028, making the correct difference 9 years, not 3. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the percentage assumption for LMT is wrong (5% vs actual 4.5%), and the year LMT reaches the ultimate rate is incorrect (2028 vs 2034), leading to a miscalculation of the time difference (3 years vs 9 years).

The dollar amounts are nearly correct (minor rounding aside), but the direction of change is wrong, leading to a false conclusion. For SBUX, the LLM claims a 4% drop in average ticket, which directly contradicts the ground truth: SBUX increased average ticket by 4%. It also misstates comparable transactions as a 4% decline in comparable store sales, while the truth is a 5% decrease in transactions.

(3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly contrasts LOW’s ticket trend with SBUX’s strategy, as it misrepresents both companies’ data.

This indicates that COF experienced some forfeiture of restricted stock units during the year, whereas Visa did not report any forfeited stock options, suggesting minimal or no option forfeitures for Visa during the same period.

The ground truth specifically refers to 'options forfeited,' not RSUs or performance-based shares.

This significant drop in average ticket at SBUX directly impacted international total net revenues, which decreased by $149 million overall, with foreign currency translation and lower product and equipment sales further compounding the decline.

Meanwhile, Lowe's (LOW) reported a 0.3% increase in comparable average ticket (from $103.51 to $103.37) alongside a 2.7% comparable sales decline, but the document does not quantify how this modest ticket growth offset or influenced revenue, focusing instead on the broader sales decline driven by transaction volume.

      "question": "How do Caterpillar and Lockheed Martin's accounting treatments of actuarial gains or losses differ in terms of timing and financial statement impact, given Caterpillar's mark-to-market approach and Lockheed Martin's amortization practices?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if triggering events occur. This results in full recognition of any valuation changes in the period they occur, directly impacting earnings volatility. In contrast, Lockheed Martin amortizes actuarial gains or losses over time, as shown by the changes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which includes both the actual return versus expected return on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. This amortization approach spreads the financial statement impact across multiple periods rather than recognizing it all at once, leading to smoother earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains and losses immediately in earnings through a mark‑to‑market approach upon annual remeasurement, whereas Lockheed Martin amortizes such gains and losses (along with prior‑service costs) on a straight‑line basis over the average remaining life of participants (or service period), subject to thresholds. Consequently, Caterpillar’s approach results in the full impact of actuarial gains/losses hitting earnings at once, while Lockheed Martin spreads the impact over many years, leading to a more gradual effect on its financial statements.",

(1) It correctly identifies Caterpillar's mark-to-market approach, with immediate recognition of actuarial gains/losses in earnings upon annual remeasurement, and contrasts it with Lockheed Martin's amortization practice, which spreads the impact over time. The qualitative descriptions of financial statement impact—immediate vs. gradual—are consistent with the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense; however, the absence of any incorrect figures or misstatements earns a perfect score by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes accounting treatments across two companies and explains how each affects earnings volatility. The only minor omission is that the original answer adds detail about Lockheed Martin's recognition in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), net of tax, and the inclusion of actual vs. expected return on plan assets—details not included in the LLM response. This slightly reduces completeness but does not undermine the correctness. (4) The LLM answer is fully relevant to the question, directly addressing both timing and financial statement impact. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent. Overall, this is a strong, factually correct response with only minor contextual omissions.",

(1) The question asks for the total rent expense combining General Motors' operating leases and McDonald's company-operated restaurants in 2021, which requires summing the two values. However, the LLM provided the individual figures but did not compute the total. More critically, the individual numbers are factually wrong. (2) According to the ground truth, the correct total is $363.2 million. The LLM states GM's expense as $294 million (plausible but unverifiable without source) and McDonald's as $1,560.3 million — which alone exceeds the correct combined total by over four times, making it clearly incorrect. Even if the intent was to list components, McDonald's rent expense cannot be $1.56 billion if the correct combined total is $363.2 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model should have retrieved correct values for both companies and summed them. Instead, it either used incorrect data or misattributed figures.

However, it incorrectly states Accenture's increase in deferred revenues as $148 million, calculated as the difference between $554.8 million in 2022 and $406.8 million in 2021. This calculation is factually wrong—the correct increase is $554.8M - $406.8M = $148M, but the ground truth states the actual increase was $648.5 million, meaning the input data used by the LLM is incorrect or misattributed. Therefore, the Accenture deferred revenue figures are not aligned with the ground truth. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because while Oracle’s number is correct, Accenture’s deferred revenue change is based on incorrect underlying values. The calculation itself (difference between two years) is logically sound, but the inputs are wrong, leading to an incorrect result. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is appropriate—comparing Oracle’s revenue recognition from prior deferrals to Accenture’s increase in deferred revenue—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Accenture. The model attempts the correct synthesis but uses invalid figures. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question and frames the comparison appropriately.

In contrast, LMT's fixed-price contracts require them to absorb cost fluctuations, as profits depend on meeting cost estimates—variations lead to higher or lower profits or even losses. This shows CAT used pricing power to mitigate cost pressures, while LMT managed risks through internal cost control under fixed-price terms.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar’s 2021 profit growth stemmed from higher sales volume and **favorable price realization** that offset rising manufacturing costs, while Lockheed Martin’s profit gains were driven by its **fixed‑price contract structure**, which locks in revenue and limits exposure to cost pressures and supply‑chain disruptions.",

The original answer states that LMT's fixed-price contracts require them to absorb cost fluctuations, meaning they do not limit exposure to cost pressures—rather, they increase risk if costs exceed estimates. The LLM incorrectly frames fixed-price contracts as drivers of 'profit gains' and as reducing exposure, which contradicts the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM omits CAT's actual profit increase of $3.491 billion and the specific figures from 2020 and 2021, failing quantitative completeness. (2) No numeric values are provided in the LLM answer, despite the ground truth including precise dollar amounts ($2.998B, $6.489B, and the $3.491B increase). This omission results in a low quantitative accuracy score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in contrasting CAT's pricing strategy with LMT's contract structure, but the interpretation of LMT's strategy is flawed. The model fails to correctly synthesize that fixed-price contracts expose LMT to cost overruns rather than protect against them, undermining the qualitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "AXP accounts for merchant relationships primarily through risk exposure, noting that spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7% of its worldwide billed business, which directly impacts revenue through discount rates and potential losses from non-delivery of services. COF, on the other hand, treats merchant relationships as part of its intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives, with no impairments recorded in 2024. This shows a fundamental difference in financial treatment: AXP reflects merchant relationship value through ongoing revenue risk and exposure, while COF capitalizes and amortizes the value as a balance sheet intangible.",
      "llm_answer": "AXP (American Express) discloses that merchant relationships represent 7 % of worldwide billed business and that it amortizes purchased credit‑card relationship intangibles (e.g., PCCR) over an estimated useful life of roughly 6–7 years, with amortization expense of about $65 million in 2024.  \n\nCOF (Capital One) records merchant‑relationship intangibles as part of its “Purchased credit‑card relationship (‘PCCR’) intangibles,” which are amortized on a straight‑line or accelerated basis over an estimated life of 6.1 years; the net carrying amount of these intangibles is $205 million and accumulated amortization is $164 million as of 2024, resulting in amortization expense of $77 million for 2024.  \n\nThus, both companies amortize merchant‑relationship intangibles, but AXP reports a relatively small, disclosed amortization expense tied directly to its 7 % exposure, whereas COF presents the intangible on its balance sheet with a net book value and accumulated amortization, reflecting a longer‑term amortization schedule and a larger absolute balance.",

The original answer states that COF amortizes merchant intangibles with no impairments in 2024 but does not specify amortization expense or carrying amounts. AXP’s 7% exposure is correctly cited, but the claim that AXP amortizes purchased credit-card relationship intangibles (PCCR) is unsupported in the original answer, which instead frames AXP’s treatment as risk exposure impacting revenue, not capitalization and amortization.

ACN reports a 0.8 percentage point increase from non-U.S. operations taxed at other rates. ORCL reports $536 million in tax impact from foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates, which, when normalized to its $1,606 million U.S. federal statutory tax provision, results in a 33.4% effective foreign tax differential (i.e., $536M / $1,606M), or approximately 2.1 percentage points below the U.S. federal statutory rate. These foreign operation effects must be interpreted in the context of other adjustments: ACN reports a 3.0 percentage point increase from other net activity in unrecognized tax benefits and a 3.0 percentage point reduction from excess tax benefits from share-based payments. ORCL reports a $263 million net benefit from settlements and releases and a $441 million expense from domestic tax contingencies, indicating contrasting directional adjustments of $704 million total in offsetting impacts.",

This is false; the ground truth confirms it can be derived from the data. The LLM incorrectly states that ACN's effective tax rate is not disclosed and that adjustments are not quantified, but the original answer shows specific percentage point impacts (0.8 pp increase from non-U.S. operations, 3.0 pp increase from unrecognized tax benefits, 3.0 pp reduction from share-based payments) — all missing from the LLM response. For ORCL, the LLM mentions a 12.2% effective tax rate and $263M net adjustments but omits the critical $536M foreign tax impact and mischaracterizes the adjustments by leaving out the $441M expense from domestic tax contingencies, thus failing to capture the offsetting nature of ORCL’s adjustments. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the LLM does not report the 0.8 pp (ACN) or 2.1 pp (ORCL) foreign operation impacts, nor does it compute the combined 2.9 pp total. It references ORCL’s $263M net benefit but ignores the $441M expense, leading to a severely incomplete and misleading picture. The calculation of ORCL’s 2.1 pp impact via $536M / $1,606M ≈ 33.4% of the U.S. statutory rate is entirely absent. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to synthesize data across ACN and ORCL, does not perform the necessary normalization of ORCL’s foreign tax impact to the U.S. statutory provision, and incorrectly asserts lack of data where the ground truth confirms availability. It treats the documents as incomplete when the knowledge graph confirms the answer is derivable. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the LLM attempts to address tax impacts and adjustments for both companies, but its incorrect assertions about missing data and omission of core figures severely undermine usefulness.

      "question": "How much more did MCD return to shareholders in 2021 compared to GM's completed stock repurchase amount under its $5.0 billion program through December 31, 2021?",
      "original_answer": "MCD returned $4,765 million to shareholders in 2021, while GM had completed $1,700 million of its $5.0 billion stock repurchase program through December 31, 2021. The difference is $4,765 million - $1,700 million = $3,065 million. Therefore, MCD returned $3,065 million more to shareholders than GM had completed in its stock repurchase program.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, MCD returned approximately $4.8 billion to shareholders in 2021 (primarily through dividends), while GM completed stock repurchases of $1.7 billion under its $5.0 billion program through December 31, 2021. Therefore, MCD returned about $3.1 billion more to shareholders than GM’s completed repurchase amount.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually correct in all key aspects. It correctly identifies that MCD returned $4.8 billion (equivalent to $4,765 million in the ground truth) to shareholders in 2021 and that GM completed $1.7 billion ($1,700 million) of its stock repurchase program by December 31, 2021. The difference is calculated as approximately $3.1 billion, which matches the ground truth difference of $3,065 million when rounded. (2) Numeric values are accurate within acceptable rounding: $4,765 million is reasonably reported as $4.8 billion, and $3,065 million as $3.1 billion. The calculation is correct: 4,765 - 1,700 = 3,065 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly synthesizes data from two different companies (MCD and GM), two different financial actions (total shareholder return vs. stock repurchase completion), and performs a valid comparison. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, directly addressing the comparative question. The only minor deviation is the use of rounded figures instead of exact values, but this does not affect factual correctness or interpretation. Thus, the answer earns a high score with only a small deduction in quantitative accuracy due to rounding, though still within acceptable tolerance.",

      "question": "How much would the combined Membership Rewards liability of AXP and the Customer Rewards Reserve of COF increase if both companies experienced a 25 basis point rise in their estimated ultimate redemption rates (URR for AXP and modeled redemption rates for COF)?",
      "original_answer": "The combined liability would increase by approximately $197 million for AXP and an estimated $185 million for COF, totaling $382 million.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined Membership Rewards liability of AXP and the Customer Rewards Reserve of COF would increase by approximately $197 million for AXP and $220 million for COF, for a total increase of about $417 million if both companies experienced a 25‑basis‑point rise in their estimated ultimate redemption rates.",

      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the structure of the question and the need to calculate the combined liability increase due to a 25 basis point rise in redemption rates for both AXP and COF. The AXP figure of $197 million matches the ground truth exactly, which is accurate. However, the COF estimate is incorrect: the LLM states $220 million, while the ground truth is $185 million. This leads to an incorrect total of $417 million instead of $382 million. (2) The quantitative discrepancy is significant: the COF number is off by $35 million (approximately 19% higher than actual), and the total is overstated by $35 million. While the AXP number is correct, the error in COF's liability impact undermines overall accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in approach—aggregating the two companies' liability increases—but fails in execution due to reliance on an incorrect value for COF. The model correctly identifies the relevant metrics (Membership Rewards liability for AXP, Customer Rewards Reserve for COF) and the effect of a change in redemption rates, indicating proper conceptual understanding. (4) Scores reflect that core elements are present and reasoning is logical (qualitative accuracy 7, contextual relevance 10), but the quantitative inaccuracy in COF's liability severely impacts the correctness score, which is primarily driven by factual precision in financial figures. A score of 6 reflects partial correctness with significant factual error.",

      "question": "What is the total amount of capitalized R&D reported by both MDT and MRK in 2023, and how does this combined figure compare to their respective deferred tax assets after valuation allowance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDT reported $1,255 million in capitalized R&D, while MRK reported $2,099 million, resulting in a combined total of $3,354 million. MDT’s total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance were $5,006 million, while MRK’s were $3,937 million. Therefore, the capitalized R&D of both companies represents a significant portion of their deferred tax assets, with MDT’s R&D capitalization accounting for approximately 25% of its deferred tax assets and MRK’s R&D capitalization accounting for approximately 53% of its deferred tax assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, the total capitalized R&D reported by Medtronic (MDT) for fiscal 2023 is $1,255 million (as disclosed in Note 13 of MDT_10k_2023.pdf, page 86, under \"Capitalization of research and development\"). Merck (MRK) does not report a separate \"capitalized R&D\" line item in its 10-K; its R&D expenses are presented as part of operating expenses, and no specific capitalized R&D amount is disclosed in the provided MRK_10k_2023.pdf pages (108-112). Consequently, a combined figure for both companies cannot be determined as Merck's capitalized R&D is not provided.\n\nRegarding deferred tax assets after valuation allowance, the combined net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance and jurisdictional netting) for Medtronic at April 26, 2024, are $3,972 million (MDT_10k_2023.pdf, page 86, \"Tax assets, net\"). Merck's deferred tax assets are not detailed in the provided pages, so a direct comparison cannot be made. However, the question asks for a comparison of the combined capitalized R&D figure to the deferred tax assets after valuation allowance. Since Merck's capitalized R&D is unavailable, the comparison is not feasible. The document only provides Medtronic's deferred tax assets ($3,972 million), which is unrelated to the capitalized R&D figure (which is $1,255 million for MDT alone). Thus, the combined figure does not align with any disclosed deferred tax asset value. \n\n**Answer**: The total capitalized R&D for Medtronic in 2023 is $1,255 million, but Merck's capitalized R&D is not disclosed in the provided documents. The combined figure cannot be determined, and no comparison to deferred tax assets (which total $3,972 million for Medtronic after valuation allowance) is possible due to Merck's lack of disclosed capitalized R&D.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in its core assertions. It claims that Merck (MRK) does not disclose capitalized R&D, but the ground truth confirms MRK reported $2,099 million in capitalized R&D in 2023. This is a major factual error. Similarly, the LLM incorrectly states that MRK’s deferred tax assets are not disclosed, while the ground truth includes MRK’s deferred tax assets after valuation allowance as $3,937 million. For MDT, the LLM correctly identifies the $1,255 million capitalized R&D but misreports MDT’s deferred tax assets after valuation allowance as $3,972 million (citing 'net tax assets'), whereas the ground truth is $5,006 million — a significant discrepancy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: only MDT’s capitalized R&D ($1,255M) is correct. MRK’s capitalized R&D ($2,099M) and both companies’ deferred tax assets are either missing or incorrect. The combined capitalized R&D of $3,354 million is not computed due to the missing MRK value. The percentages (25% for MDT, 53% for MRK) are not mentioned at all. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the LLM does not synthesize data across both companies, incorrectly concludes data is missing, and thus cannot perform the required comparison between combined capitalized R&D and deferred tax assets. It also confuses net deferred tax assets with total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate — the LLM attempts to address the question and cites document sections, but its conclusions are based on incorrect data interpretation, leading to a failure in answering the multi-hop financial comparison. The answer would be appropriate only if the data were truly missing, but it is not.",

      "original_answer": "PepsiCo recorded a pre-tax charge of $842 million in 2021 related to its cash tender offers, classified under net interest expense and other. Philip Morris recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million related to the OtiTopic, Inc. transaction, classified under research and development costs within marketing, administration and research costs.

Both charges were reported in “pre‑tax charges” within their respective income‑statement sections—PEP’s charge in “pre‑tax charges” (see Note 9) and PM’s charge in “pre‑tax charge” related to the OtiTopic transaction (see Note 6/12).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the individual pre-tax charges: $842 million for PepsiCo and $51 million for Philip Morris, which matches the ground truth. The combined total of $893 million is implied but not explicitly stated, which is a significant omission. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate—$842 million and $51 million are correct, and no calculation errors are present. However, the combined total is not mentioned, failing a key part of the question asking for the 'combined impact.' (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly attributes the charges to the right companies and events. However, it misrepresents the classification in financial statements. The ground truth states PepsiCo's charge was classified under 'net interest expense and other,' but the LLM claims it was in 'pre-tax charges' (citing Note 9), which is vague and not equivalent. Similarly, while Philip Morris's charge is correctly tied to R&D, the LLM says it was reported under a generic 'pre-tax charge' label rather than specifically under 'research and development costs within marketing, administration and research costs' as per the original. (4) The contextual relevance is high—response stays on topic and cites relevant notes. However, due to missing the combined total and misrepresenting the classification details, the qualitative accuracy is reduced.
