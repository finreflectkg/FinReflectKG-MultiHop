      "question": "How has the company's disclosure of insider stock ownership percentages for executive management evolved between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings?",
      "original_answer": "In both the 2023 and 2024 filings, the company indicated that information on stock ownership is incorporated by reference from the Proxy under the heading 'Additional Information.' However, neither filing provides specific stock ownership percentages for executives or directors directly in the 10-K document. The structure and referenced sections related to stock ownership remain unchanged between the two years, suggesting no evolution in how this information is disclosed. The lack of specific ownership percentages in both years prevents any substantive comparison of insider ownership changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2023 and 2024 Form 10‑K filings treat insider stock‑ownership data the same way – they do not list percentages for executive officers in the filing itself but instead note that the required information is provided in the company’s proxy statement (under “Equity Compensation Plans” and “Information on Stock Ownership”) and is incorporated by reference. The wording is essentially unchanged between the two years, with only the year reference updated for the newer filing.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is substantially correct and aligns well with the ground truth. Both answers correctly identify that: (1) insider stock ownership percentages are not provided directly in the 10-K filings themselves, (2) the information is incorporated by reference from the proxy statement, (3) there is no evolution or change in disclosure structure between 2023 and 2024, and (4) only year references are updated between filings. The LLM answer provides slightly more specific detail by mentioning the proxy sections ('Equity Compensation Plans' and 'Information on Stock Ownership'), which adds helpful context without contradicting the ground truth. The core conclusion that 'the structure and referenced sections related to stock ownership remain unchanged between the two years' is accurately conveyed. Minor differences in wording (e.g., LLM says 'essentially unchanged' vs. ground truth's 'remains unchanged') are semantically equivalent. No quantitative errors are present. The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the answer correctly synthesizes information across both years and identifies the lack of change as the key finding. The only minor limitation is that the LLM could have been slightly more explicit about the inability to compare actual ownership percentages due to their absence from the 10-K documents, though this is implied in the answer.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $633 million, with additions of $162 million and write-offs of $148 million. By 2024, the allowance decreased to $577 million, with additions of $122 million and write-offs of $199 million. This indicates a decreasing trend in the allowance balance, with a shift toward higher write-offs relative to additions in the later year.",
      "llm_answer": "The pages you provided do not include the Allowance for Inventory Losses balance sheet line, nor any discussion of the related additions or write‑offs for 2022‑2024.

The ground truth provides specific, verifiable financial data about IBM's Allowance for Inventory Losses across three years (2022-2024) with precise numbers: 2022 starting balance of $633M with $162M additions and $148M write-offs; 2024 balance of $577M with $122M additions and $199M write-offs. The LLM claims the information is not available in the provided documents, which directly contradicts the ground truth answer that contains this exact data. This represents a fundamental failure to retrieve or synthesize the required information. The LLM did not provide any of the requested quantitative data (the six specific dollar amounts), did not identify the trend (decreasing allowance balance, increasing write-offs relative to additions), and did not complete the multi-hop analysis comparing 2022 to 2024. The response suggests a document retrieval failure rather than a reasoning error, but regardless of cause, the answer is factually incorrect and completely non-responsive to the question's requirements. The only minor credit given is for the LLM's acknowledgment that it cannot answer rather than providing false information, but this does not excuse the failure to deliver the correct answer that exists in the source material.",

      "original_answer": "The carrying value of Cisco's long-term loan receivables decreased from $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2024. This indicates a reduction in the book value of these receivables, suggesting either collections exceeded new loan originations or increased write-downs or impairments during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco’s long‑term loan receivables were carried at about **$2.9 billion in fiscal 2023** and **$2.7 billion in fiscal 2024**, a decline of roughly **$130 million**. The decrease reflects a modest reduction in the outstanding long‑term loan portfolio, but Cisco still values these assets at an amount that closely approximates their fair value, indicating a stable and consistent asset valuation in this category.",

      "detailed_feedback": "STRENGTHS: The LLM correctly identified the carrying values ($2.9B in FY2023 and $2.7B in FY2024) and accurately calculated the decline of approximately $200M (the LLM stated $130M, which is slightly understated but in the ballpark). The company name, fiscal years, and metric (long-term loan receivables) are all correct. WEAKNESSES: (1) The calculation of the decline is imprecise - $2.9B minus $2.7B equals $200M, not $130M as stated. This is a material error in quantitative accuracy. (2) The qualitative interpretation diverges significantly from the ground truth. The LLM states the decrease 'reflects a modest reduction in the outstanding long-term loan portfolio' and emphasizes that 'Cisco still values these assets at an amount that closely approximates their fair value, indicating a stable and consistent asset valuation.' However, the ground truth explanation suggests the decrease indicates 'either collections exceeded new loan originations or increased write-downs or impairments during the period' - a more cautious interpretation. The LLM's assertion about fair value approximation and 'stable and consistent' valuation is not supported by the ground truth and represents an unsupported inference. (3) The LLM fails to adequately address what the change 'indicates about the company's asset valuation' - it provides speculation about fair value rather than the more neutral explanation of possible causes (collections vs. impairments). The answer is partially correct on facts but contains a calculation error and makes unsupported interpretive claims that diverge from the ground truth analysis.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Growth Markets revenue increased by 29% in local currency, driven by Japan, Australia, and Brazil. However, in 2023, the Growth Markets revenue decreased by 2% in U.S. dollars but increased by 7% in local currency.

More critically, the LLM answer completely fails to address the core question about local currency growth rates. The ground truth explicitly states: 2022 showed 29% local currency growth, while 2023 showed 7% local currency growth - a significant slowdown. The LLM answer mentions only that revenue 'fell' in U.S. dollars and that share 'slipped' in local currency terms, but provides no local currency growth percentages whatsoever. The question specifically asks 'what was the change in its contribution in local currency growth' - this is the primary focus, yet the LLM answer completely omits this critical metric. The LLM does correctly identify that there was a slowdown/decline between the two years, but without the actual local currency growth percentages (29% vs 7%), the answer is fundamentally incomplete. The dollar amounts and percentage point changes in revenue share may be accurate to Accenture's filings, but they do not answer the specific question asked about local currency growth evolution.

The percentage calculation of 21% is mathematically incorrect even for the LLM's own stated numbers ($944M / $4.42B = 21.4%, which would round to 21%, but this is based on wrong baseline figures). The LLM failed to provide the year-by-year breakdown (FY2023 intermediate value and individual year-over-year changes) that the ground truth includes. The multi-hop synthesis is incomplete - the answer only provides endpoints without the intermediate fiscal 2023 data point.

      "question": "How did the growth in Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar-converted basis evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's currency exposure during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased by 10.4%, while in 2024, the company reported GDV growth on a local currency basis of 11%. This indicates that the company's GDV growth in U.S. dollar terms slowed relative to local currency growth in 2023, suggesting a stronger U.S. dollar during that year. In 2024, the focus shifted to local currency growth without a reported U.S. dollar-converted figure, implying a potential strategic emphasis on underlying volume performance independent of currency fluctuations.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Mastercard said that GDV measured on a U.S.‑dollar‑converted basis rose 10.4% versus the prior year (page 55). For 2024 the company reports GDV growth of 11% on a local‑currency basis (page 6) but does not give a comparable U.S.‑dollar‑converted rate, implying that the dollar‑converted growth was below the 11% local‑currency increase and slower than the 10.4% seen in 2023. The gap between local‑currency and dollar‑converted growth shows that a stronger U.S. dollar in 2024 dampened the reported volume growth, highlighting the firm’s exposure to currency fluctuations.",

Quantitative verification: (1) 2023 GDV growth of 10.4% on U.S. dollar-converted basis is correct; (2) 2024 GDV growth of 11% on local currency basis is correct; (3) the absence of a reported U.S. dollar-converted figure for 2024 is accurately noted. The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes that the gap between local currency (11%) and dollar-converted growth (not reported) in 2024 indicates currency headwinds, and appropriately compares this to 2023's 10.4% dollar-converted growth to show relative slowdown. The inference that 'dollar-converted growth was below the 11% local-currency increase' is logically sound given the pattern established in 2023. The answer correctly identifies currency exposure as the key insight. Minor weakness: The original answer states the 2023 data 'indicates...a stronger U.S. dollar during that year,' while the LLM attributes currency dampening to 2024 specifically. However, the LLM's interpretation that the absence of 2024 dollar-converted figures combined with the 11% local currency growth suggests currency headwinds in 2024 is a reasonable inference. The LLM provides slightly more detailed reasoning about what the missing 2024 dollar-converted figure implies, which adds value. All page references appear reasonable for a 10-K filing.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon's Investment and Wealth Management segment was described as part of a two-segment structure before being disaggregated into Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Investment and Wealth Management segment remained unchanged during this reorganization. It managed $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the Investment and Wealth Management segment remained one of the three principal business segments, but assets under management decreased to $2.0 trillion as of December 31, 2023.

MINOR ISSUES: (1) The ground truth mentions the reorganization occurred in Q4 2021, while the LLM answer references it in the context of the 2022 filing without explicitly clarifying the timing - this is a minor temporal ambiguity but not factually incorrect; (2) The ground truth explicitly states the segment 'remained one of the three principal business segments' in 2023, which the LLM answer implies but doesn't explicitly state; (3) The LLM answer adds interpretive language ('sharper focus') that goes slightly beyond the ground truth's more neutral statement that 'the segment's structural role within the company remained consistent' - this is reasonable inference but represents a slight semantic shift. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All dollar amounts and years are correct. The comparison ($2.4T to $2.0T) is accurate.

      "question": "How has Capital One's treatment of revolving loans in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of loan conversion and delinquency trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One converted $223 million of revolving loans to term loans in the domestic credit card portfolio. By 2024, the company reported a total domestic credit card loan portfolio of $155.618 billion, with $7.053 billion in total delinquent loans. This indicates a shift from proactive loan conversion strategies in 2022 to a focus on delinquency management in 2024, suggesting evolving credit risk dynamics in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Capital One disclosed that it was actively converting revolving balances to term loans – $602 million in 2020 and $223 million in 2021, mainly from its domestic credit‑card portfolio【COF_10k_2022.pdf page 175】. The 2024 filing no longer reports any new revolving‑to‑term conversions, indicating the practice has largely ceased, while delinquency in the domestic credit‑card portfolio has risen modestly, with total delinquent balances increasing from $6.8 billion at year‑end 2023 to $7.1 billion at year‑end 2024 and the >90‑day bucket climbing from $3.37 billion to $3.58 billion【COF_10k_2024.pdf page 161】【COF_10k_2024.pdf page 163】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer provides relevant information about Capital One's revolving loan conversion practices and delinquency trends, but contains significant quantitative discrepancies with the ground truth. STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies that revolving-to-term conversions occurred in 2022 ($223 million mentioned), (2) Accurately notes the cessation of this practice by 2024, (3) Provides specific delinquency figures for 2024 ($7.1 billion total delinquent, $3.58 billion >90-day) that align with ground truth ($7.053 billion total), (4) Demonstrates sound multi-hop reasoning by synthesizing conversion strategy changes with delinquency trends across years, (5) Appropriately contextualizes the shift from conversion strategies to delinquency management. WEAKNESSES: (1) CRITICAL ERROR - Reports $223 million conversion in 2021, but ground truth states this occurred in 2022; the LLM conflates the year, (2) Includes $602 million figure for 2020 conversions which is not mentioned in ground truth and appears to be extraneous information, (3) Reports 2023 delinquent balances ($6.8 billion) not provided in ground truth, making verification impossible, (4) The ground truth specifies the 2024 domestic credit card portfolio total ($155.618 billion) which the LLM answer omits entirely, (5) Minor discrepancy in 2024 delinquent total: LLM states $7.1 billion vs. ground truth's $7.053 billion (acceptable rounding but worth noting). MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM successfully synthesizes information across 2022 and 2024 filings to show evolution of strategy, but the year attribution error for the $223 million conversion undermines the temporal accuracy of the analysis. The reasoning about strategic shift is sound, but built on partially incorrect temporal data.",

      "question": "How did the shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024 reflect changes in Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in the data center market?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Intel’s DCAI segment was under pressure – the filing notes that “our DCAI revenue, platform ASPs and market share were negatively impacted by the competitive environment and the shift of customer spend towards GPUs”【page_50】. By 2024 DCAI revenue had turned around, growing 1% versus the prior year “driven by higher server revenue primarily from high‑core‑count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume”【page_15】, a result of Intel’s data‑center strategy that emphasized new Xeon 6 processors with performance‑ and efficient‑core options, integrated AI engines (Intel AMX) and the launch of Gaudi 3 AI accelerators to better compete with GPU‑centric rivals【page_17】. This modest revenue gain signals that Intel’s refreshed product roadmap is beginning to improve its competitive positioning in the data‑center market after a period of erosion.",

QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The 1% DCAI revenue growth figure is correctly cited and matches the ground truth. The directional claims about ASPs increasing and volume decreasing are accurate. No calculation errors detected. ENTITY ACCURACY: All entities correctly identified - Intel, DCAI segment, 2023-2024 timeframe, Xeon 6 processors, Gaudi 3, GPU competition. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across multiple sources (pages 50, 15, 17 cited) to connect: (1) 2023 competitive pressures and GPU shift, (2) 2024 revenue recovery mechanism (high core count products, ASP improvement), and (3) strategic product initiatives (Xeon 6, AMX, Gaudi 3). The logical flow from problem identification to strategic response to outcome is sound. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both the 2023 decline context and 2024 recovery, explaining the underlying drivers (competitive environment, customer spending shifts, product strategy). It directly answers how the shift reflected changes in competitive positioning and product strategy. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The ground truth states revenue increased 1% driven by higher server revenue from high core count products increasing ASPs despite lower volume - the LLM captures this precisely. The characterization of the trend reversal and strategic positioning improvement matches the ground truth's assessment. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM provides additional strategic context (Xeon 6 details, AMX, Gaudi 3) that goes slightly beyond the ground truth but is factually accurate and enhances understanding without contradicting the source material.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves specifically for the year ended December 31, 2022. By 2024, IBM expanded its disclosure to include valuation reserves for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

CRITICAL ERROR: The LLM states that in the 2022 Form 10-K, Schedule S-1 presented data for \"years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,\" but the ground truth indicates that in 2022, IBM disclosed valuation reserves \"specifically for the year ended December 31, 2022.\" This is a significant factual error regarding what years were covered in the 2022 filing. The LLM appears to have confused the historical pattern (which may have shown 2021, 2020, 2019 in prior years) with what was actually disclosed in 2022. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY ISSUE: The years cited for the 2022 filing (2021, 2020, 2019) do not match the ground truth assertion that 2022 data was disclosed in 2022.

The LLM claims these figures are not present in the provided excerpts and states the information 'cannot be determined from the supplied pages.' This is a complete failure to synthesize the available information. The LLM should have identified the substantial decrease from $467M (2022 ending) to $254M (2024 ending), representing a decline of $213M or approximately 45.6%. The key contributing factors were: (1) significantly higher write-offs in 2024 ($146M vs $55M in 2022), (2) lower additions in 2024 ($13M vs $59M in 2022), and (3) a negative foreign currency adjustment in 2024 (-$20M vs positive $45M in 2022).

At that time, the company reported $2.4 trillion in assets under management. By 2024, BNY had stabilized its segmentation approach, maintaining three principal segments including Investment and Wealth Management, and reported $2.0 trillion in assets under management.

The answer correctly identifies the entities (Oracle, cloud services revenues, total revenues) and the time periods (fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023). The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the model successfully synthesized the proportion data across two fiscal years and calculated the change. The only minor difference from the ground truth is that the LLM answer is more concise and doesn't explicitly mention the 'strategic shift or market demand shift toward cloud-based offerings' interpretation that appears in the ground truth. However, this interpretive element is not strictly required to answer the factual question about how the proportion evolved. The LLM answer focuses on the core factual content (the percentages and the change) which is the essential information requested. The inclusion of a page reference adds credibility.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K NVIDIA disclosed that, after historically using roughly six‑month lead times, it began placing non‑cancellable orders at **12 months or longer** and paying premiums or deposits to lock in capacity—creating significant financial exposure from pre‑payments and the risk of excess inventory (2022 p. 24‑26). By the 2023 filing the company said it had **increased supply‑ and capacity‑purchases, entered prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements, and was seeing shortened lead times for certain components**, shifting risk from long‑lead‑time pre‑payments to execution risk tied to larger purchase volumes and a broader, more complex supplier base (2023 p. 34‑35).",

Page references (2022 p. 24-26, 2023 p. 34-35) are appropriately cited. QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The answer correctly identifies the evolution from a defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher financial risk from pre-payments and excess inventory risk) to a more dynamic strategy in 2023 (diversified sourcing, prepaid agreements, shortened lead times for certain components). The characterization of the shift from 'long-lead-time pre-payments to execution risk tied to larger purchase volumes' accurately captures the nuance in the ground truth. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses all key aspects of the question: (1) 2022 approach (non-cancellable orders, 12-month lead times, financial exposure), (2) 2023 approach (increased purchases, new vendors, prepaid agreements, shortened lead times), and (3) the evolution between the two years. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The synthesis across the two filing years is sound, correctly identifying both the specific changes and the underlying strategic shift.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing Wells Fargo noted that federal law limits “covered transactions” from its subsidiary banks to 10 % of a bank’s capital‑and‑surplus for a single affiliate (20 % in the aggregate) and that the 2017 Support Agreement could bar the intermediate holding company (IHC) from paying dividends to the Parent if certain liquidity‑ or capital‑metric triggers were breached【page_5†L1-L9】【page_6†L1-L9】.  \n\nThe 2024 filing repeats those same dividend‑distribution caps but adds that the IHC’s transferred assets are expressly pledged to supply capital and liquidity to the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, the clearing unit and other covered entities, and that if the defined triggers are hit the subordinated notes will be forgiven, the committed line of credit will end and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent will be restricted【page_4†L1-L9】【page_6†L1-L12】.  \n\nThus, while the regulatory dividend limits remain unchanged, the 2024 report makes the liquidity‑support arrangement more formal and trigger‑driven, outlining a clearer back‑stop that can be curtailed under stress conditions.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 10-K, AIG reported cumulative paid losses of $1,557 million for accident year 2021 as of December 31, 2021. In the 2023 10-K, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident year increased to $1,640 million as of December 31, 2022. This $83 million increase indicates that AIG's initial estimate of paid losses for accident year 2021 was lower than the actual paid losses observed a year later, suggesting that the company may have initially underestimated the severity of claims for that year.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 10‑K AIG listed cumulative paid losses for accident year 2021 at roughly **$1.08 billion** (page 277 shows $ 1,079 million)【page_277】. The 2023 10‑K shows the same accident year’s cumulative paid losses at about **$1.98 billion** (the 2023 column in the triangle on page 211 reads $ 1,983 million)【page_211】. The near‑$0.9 billion increase reflects a material adverse development, suggesting the company’s original 2021 loss reserves were understated and that reserving accuracy for that year was weaker than anticipated.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The 2022 10-K figure is stated as $1,079 million, but the ground truth shows $1,557 million for accident year 2021 as of December 31, 2021 - a difference of $478 million (31% error). The 2023 10-K figure is stated as $1,983 million, but the ground truth shows $1,640 million for accident year 2021 as of December 31, 2022 - a difference of $343 million (21% error). These are not minor formatting variations; they represent substantially different financial data. (2) CALCULATION ERROR: The LLM calculates a $0.9 billion increase ($1,983M - $1,079M = $904M), but the correct increase is only $83 million ($1,640M - $1,557M = $83M). This is a 10.8x overstatement of the actual development. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: While the LLM correctly identifies the structure of the question (comparing 2022 10-K to 2023 10-K for accident year 2021), it fails at the fundamental data extraction step. The conclusion about 'material adverse development' and 'understated reserves' is based on incorrect numbers and would be misleading to users. (4) ENTITY ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies AIG and the accident years, but the page references appear to be incorrect or the data was misread from those pages. (5) SEMANTIC ISSUE: While the LLM's reasoning structure (comparing two years, calculating the difference, drawing conclusions about reserve adequacy) is sound in principle, the execution is fatally flawed by incorrect data. The ground truth shows a modest $83 million increase suggesting minor underestimation, while the LLM's numbers suggest a massive $904 million adverse development - a completely different narrative.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that for GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates resulted in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees, and for GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates led to a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife said its withdrawal‑rate assumption for the guarantees ranged from 0 % to 20 % with a weighted‑average of about **3.7 %** (3.98 % for the prior year) 【page_266】, and footnote (11) notes that **higher withdrawal rates increase the fair‑value of GMWB guarantees but decrease the fair‑value of GMAB/GMIB guarantees** 【page_267】.  \n\nIn the 2024 filing the same 0 %‑20 % range is used but the weighted‑average assumption was raised to roughly **4.8 %** (4.47 % for 2023) 【page_249】, and the same footnote (11) reiterates that **higher withdrawals still lift GMWB fair‑value and cut GMAB/GMIB fair‑value** 【page_250】.  \n\nThus, MetLife increased its assumed withdrawal rate from about 3.7 % to about 4.8 % while the directional impact on the guarantees remained unchanged.",

(2) The ground truth indicates Braintree's impact was part of the 2023 increase context, not the primary driver of 2024 dynamics. (3) The LLM introduces 'third-party pricing incentives' as a factor, which is not mentioned in the ground truth. (4) The LLM's statement about Braintree's 'larger share of TPV that drove up absolute expense in 2024' is confusing and potentially inaccurate - the ground truth suggests the rate remained stable due to offsetting factors, not that Braintree drove it up. The LLM fails to properly synthesize the multi-hop reasoning about what caused the 2023 increase versus what stabilized the 2024 rate.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DCAI revenue decreased by 20% due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. In contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1% driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023. This reflects a shift from a significant decline to slight growth, indicating stabilization and a strategic focus on higher-value offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "DCAI revenue swung from a sharp decline in 2023 to a modest rebound in 2024. In 2023 the segment’s revenue fell about 20 percent, driven by weaker server volume as the CPU data‑center market softened (partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower‑mix, high‑core‑count product mix)【page_7】. In 2024 DCAI revenue grew roughly 1 percent versus the prior year, thanks to higher server revenue from high‑core‑count products that lifted ASPs even though volume remained lower【page_15】.",

ENTITY ACCURACY: DCAI (Data Center AI) segment correctly identified, years 2023 and 2024 properly referenced. MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two fiscal years, correctly identifying the contrasting trends (sharp decline to modest rebound) and the underlying drivers for each year. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the question - the trend evolution (20% decline to 1% growth) and the contributing factors (server volume softening in 2023, high core count product mix driving ASPs in both years). REASONING QUALITY: The logic is sound - correctly explains that 2023's decline was partially offset by higher ASPs, and 2024's modest growth was driven by higher-value products despite lower volumes. The characterization of this as a shift from decline to stabilization is accurate. WORDING: The phrasing differs slightly from ground truth (e.g., 'swung from a sharp decline' vs. 'shifted from significant decline') but conveys identical semantic meaning. The use of 'roughly 1 percent' and 'about 20 percent' represents appropriate flexibility in number presentation. MINOR OBSERVATION: The answer could have been marginally more explicit about the 'lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue' aspect mentioned in ground truth, though the focus on high core count products captures the essential strategic shift.

Quantitative verification: All percentages and phase-in schedule are correct - 25% scaling factor maintained throughout, with cumulative phase-in at 25% (2022), 50% (2023), 75% (2024), and 100% (2025). These match the ground truth exactly. The answer correctly identifies the constant 25% scaling factor and the progressive phase-in schedule. Multi-hop synthesis is sound: the answer synthesizes information about both the scaling factor (constant across years) and the phase-in progression (evolving from 25% to 75% by 2024). Entity accuracy is correct - CECL adoption, day-2 allowance, and the relevant years are all properly identified. The main minor difference from the ground truth is that the LLM answer focuses more on the year-by-year phase-in percentages (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) rather than explicitly stating the evolution from 'initial delayed implementation' to 'advanced phase-in stage,' but this is a matter of presentation emphasis rather than factual error. The LLM answer is actually more precise in breaking down the exact phase-in percentages for each year. The citation references provided add credibility. Overall, the answer demonstrates accurate understanding of the CECL transition mechanics and correctly addresses how the capital impact evolved from 2022 to 2024.",

The LLM claims the balance was $5,382 million at July 29, 2023 and $8,208 million at July 27, 2024 - numbers that are completely wrong and approximately 1,500x larger than the ground truth figures. The LLM also misidentifies the metric as 'goodwill balance' when the ground truth refers to 'financial position' or reported balances. The LLM's calculation of a $2.8 billion increase is incorrect; the actual increase was only $22. While the LLM correctly identifies that acquisitions (including Splunk) contributed to changes, it attributes $2,702 million to acquisitions when the ground truth shows only $16 from acquisitions in 2024. The LLM also incorrectly states the July 29, 2023 balance as $5,382 million when this was actually the FY2024 ending balance. The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM synthesized completely incorrect numbers from the source material.

By 2024, the segment's role had notably expanded, as it contributed approximately 16% of the company's total revenue. This shift suggests an increased strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing, particularly through products like microcontrollers, processors, and wireless connectivity solutions. The rise from a segment with modest goodwill to one generating a significant portion of revenue reflects a meaningful evolution in its importance to TXN's overall business model.",

The multi-hop reasoning correctly synthesizes: (a) 2023 goodwill data, (b) 2024 revenue contribution, (c) percentage calculation, and (d) strategic significance evolution.

By 2024, the company formalized its reporting methodology, emphasizing GDV as a key metric that includes both purchase and cash volume on a local currency and USD-converted basis, with cross-border growth also tracked separately. This reflects a shift from ad hoc quarterly reporting to a more structured and strategic approach in tracking GDV.",

In 2024 Mastercard reports GDV growth on both a U.S.‑dollar‑converted and a local‑currency basis and also provides currency‑neutral growth rates, whereas earlier filings (e.g., 2022) emphasized local‑currency growth to strip out currency effects【page_51】【page_46】.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE ERRORS: The LLM provides specific GDV growth percentages (12.2%, 10.6% for 2023 vs 2022; 10.5%, 8.1% for 2024 vs 2023) that are not mentioned in the ground truth answer. The ground truth explicitly states 2022 showed 'mixed quarterly performance with an 8% increase in March, a 10% decrease in June, and 1% increases in September and December, resulting in an overall flat annual change' - not the 12.2%/10.6% figures cited by the LLM. The LLM appears to be citing 2023-2024 comparisons rather than addressing the 2022 baseline mentioned in the question. (2) TEMPORAL MISALIGNMENT: The question asks about trends from 2022 to 2024, with emphasis on 2022 performance. The ground truth focuses on 2022's quarterly volatility and 2024's formalized methodology. The LLM instead emphasizes 2023-2024 comparisons, which is a different time period than requested. (3) METHODOLOGY REPORTING: The LLM correctly identifies that 2024 shows formalized reporting with both local-currency and USD-converted basis, which aligns with ground truth. However, the LLM's characterization of 2022 as 'emphasizing local-currency growth' contradicts the ground truth's description of 2022 as having 'mixed quarterly performance' with specific percentage changes. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM fails to synthesize the key insight from ground truth - that 2022 was characterized by volatility and inconsistency (8%, -10%, 1%, 1%), while 2024 represents a shift to structured, formalized reporting. Instead, the LLM presents a linear slowdown narrative (12.2% → 10.5%) that doesn't match the ground truth's characterization. (5) MISSING CONTEXT: The LLM omits the critical finding that 2022 showed 'overall flat annual change' despite quarterly fluctuations, which is central to understanding the trend change.

According to PayPal’s disclosures, TPV and payment transactions are used by management to measure the scale of the platform and the relevance of its products and services.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Accenture highlighted significant exposure to client spending delays, reductions, or terminations due to technological developments and short-term contract durations. Many contracts allowed clients to terminate with as little as 30 days’ notice, posing a direct risk to anticipated revenues. By 2024, the focus of client spending risk had shifted toward operational vulnerabilities tied to Accenture’s global delivery model. Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized risks from concentrating delivery capabilities in key locations like India and the Philippines, where geopolitical tensions and global disruptions could impact service continuity and, consequently, client spending. This evolution reflects a shift from contractual and client-driven risks to broader, systemic risks tied to global operations and delivery dependencies.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Accenture warned that a large share of its consulting work is tied to short‑term contracts that can be ended with as little as 30 days’ notice and that clients can defer or cut spending, and that its delivery model is heavily concentrated in India and the Philippines, exposing the firm to operational and geopolitical risk 【page_18】. By 2024 the company says the risk has intensified: many engagements now link fees to performance milestones and involve large, complex transformation projects that increase the impact of any client‑spending reductions, while the same India‑Philippines delivery concentration remains a key vulnerability, now highlighted as being especially sensitive to rising geopolitical tensions 【page_27】【page_29】.",

The ground truth focuses on the SHIFT in risk emphasis (from contractual/client-driven to operational/systemic), not on new fee structures. (2) INCOMPLETE SYNTHESIS - The LLM answer fails to capture the core evolution described in ground truth: the SHIFT in focus from 2022's emphasis on short-term contracts and termination risk to 2024's emphasis on operational vulnerabilities from global delivery concentration. Instead, the LLM presents both risks as co-existing in both years, missing the temporal evolution. (3) MISCHARACTERIZATION - The ground truth emphasizes that 2022 highlighted 'contractual and client-driven risks' while 2024 shifted to 'systemic risks tied to global operations.' The LLM answer doesn't clearly articulate this distinction. (4) CITATION ISSUES - The LLM provides page references (page_18, page_27, page_29) that cannot be verified against the ground truth and may be fabricated.

(3) MISSING ANALYSIS: The LLM explicitly states 'the change from 2023 to 2024 cannot be determined' and 'no conclusion about a shift in IBM's inventory risk-management stance can be drawn.' This directly contradicts the ground truth, which shows a $81 million reduction ($658M to $577M) and provides meaningful interpretation about improved inventory management or strategic reduction in holdings. (4) CONTEXTUAL FAILURE: The question specifically asks 'how did IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses evolve from 2023 to 2024' - the LLM provides no evolution analysis for 2024 whatsoever. The LLM's claim that data is not available appears to be a failure to properly extract or synthesize information from the SEC filings, rather than an actual data limitation. The answer demonstrates poor multi-hop reasoning and incomplete document analysis.",

      "question": "How did Adobe's disclosure approach to Digital Media Revenue evolve between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, particularly regarding the level of detail provided for its Creative and Document Cloud offerings?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Adobe provided detailed breakdowns of Digital Media revenue growth, specifically attributing a $2.29 billion increase to strong performance in Creative and Document Cloud subscription offerings, with explicit mentions of net new subscriptions and user acquisition. In fiscal 2023, however, Adobe only disclosed a table showing revenue by major offerings across three years without any qualitative explanation or specific growth drivers for Creative or Document Cloud. This represents a shift from a descriptive, narrative-based disclosure in 2022 to a more data-driven, summary format in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Adobe reported Digital Media only as a single segment (e.g., $12.84 billion in FY‑2022) and the only offering‑level numbers shown were for earlier years (Creative Cloud $9.55 billion, Document Cloud $1.97 billion for FY‑2021) – no FY‑2022 break‑out was provided【page_46†L31-L38】. By contrast, the 2023 filing includes a dedicated table that lists Creative Cloud revenue of $11.5 billion and Document Cloud revenue of $2.7 billion for FY‑2023 (and FY‑2022) and explicitly attributes the segment’s growth to those two offerings【page_41†L9-L16】【page_41†L18-L22】. Thus Adobe moved from an aggregate segment presentation in 2022 to a more granular, offering‑level disclosure in 2023.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer fundamentally contradicts the ground truth on the key evolution of Adobe's disclosure approach. CRITICAL ERRORS: (1) The LLM claims the 2022 filing showed NO FY-2022 offering-level breakdown and only aggregate segment data ($12.84B), while the ground truth explicitly states that FY-2022 included detailed narrative disclosure with a $2.29 billion increase attributed to Creative and Document Cloud offerings. (2) The LLM reverses the direction of change: it claims Adobe moved FROM aggregate (2022) TO granular offering-level (2023), but the ground truth indicates the opposite - from detailed narrative/qualitative (2022) to summary table format (2023). (3) The specific numbers cited are problematic: the LLM provides FY-2021 numbers ($9.55B Creative, $1.97B Document) and FY-2023 numbers ($11.5B Creative, $2.7B Document) but these don't align with the ground truth's focus on the $2.29B growth figure and the shift in disclosure methodology. (4) The LLM mischaracterizes the nature of the change - it's not about granularity increasing (more detail in 2023) but rather about the TYPE of disclosure changing from narrative-driven to table-driven while potentially losing qualitative context. The answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the question's core premise about how disclosure APPROACH evolved, not just what numbers were disclosed.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Short-Term Borrows contributed a net increase of $9 million to interest expense, with a breakdown showing $6 million from average volume and $3 million from average rate. By 2023, the company disclosed a significant increase in the total value of Short-Term Borrows, reporting $32,953 million in total, which included $26,400 million in FHLB borrowings and $6,553 million in other short-term borrowings. This indicates both a quantitative increase and a qualitative shift in the composition of borrowings, with the introduction of detailed categories not previously itemized.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022 Schwab’s short‑term borrowings were made up of $12.4 bn of Federal Home‑Loan Bank (FHLB) facilities, $4.7 bn of other short‑term borrowings, $250 m of commercial‑paper notes, $4.4 bn of repurchase‑agreement borrowings and no TDAC line; the FHLB and other‑borrowings portions carried weighted‑average rates of 4.88 % and 4.97 % respectively. By 2023 the mix shifted to $26.4 bn of FHLB borrowings, $6.6 bn of other short‑term borrowings, $0 of commercial paper, $4.9 bn of repos and a new $700 m TDAC line, raising total short‑term debt to roughly $38.6 bn (up from about $21.8 bn) and increasing the weighted‑average rates to 5.34 % (FHLB) and 5.57 % (other), while the elimination of commercial‑paper borrowings removed its interest‑expense contribution. These changes mean that the larger FHLB and other‑borrowings balances, together with higher rates, drove a higher share of overall interest expense in 2023.

      "detailed_feedback": "STRENGTHS: The LLM answer provides detailed 2022 and 2023 composition data with specific dollar amounts and percentages, correctly identifies the shift in borrowing mix (FHLB increase from $12.4bn to $26.4bn, other borrowings from $4.7bn to $6.6bn), notes the elimination of commercial paper, and identifies the new TDAC line. The reasoning about how larger balances and higher rates drove increased interest expense is sound. The answer demonstrates good multi-hop synthesis across composition and interest expense impacts.\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES: (1) The 2023 total of $38.6bn stated by LLM does not match the ground truth's $32,953 million ($32.953bn). The LLM's calculation appears to sum $26.4bn + $6.6bn + $4.9bn + $0.7bn = $38.6bn, but the ground truth explicitly states $32,953 million total with only $26,400 million FHLB + $6,553 million other = $32,953 million. This is a significant discrepancy ($5.6bn difference). (2) The 2022 total of $21.8bn stated by LLM ($12.4bn + $4.7bn + $0.25bn + $4.4bn = $21.75bn ≈ $21.8bn) cannot be verified against ground truth, which only mentions a net increase of $9 million to interest expense with $6 million from volume and $3 million from rate—not total balance figures. (3) The ground truth does not provide the detailed 2022 composition breakdown that the LLM presents, suggesting the LLM may be drawing from different sections or making inferences. (4) The ground truth emphasizes the 2023 figures of $32,953 million total with $26,400 million FHLB and $6,553 million other borrowings, which the LLM rounds to $26.4bn and $6.6bn (acceptable rounding) but then adds repos and TDAC to reach $38.6bn, which contradicts the stated total.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly synthesizes composition changes and interest expense impacts, but the quantitative foundation is flawed due to the total value discrepancy. The answer addresses both composition and interest expense contributions as requested, but the numbers don't align with ground truth.\n\nCONCLUSION: While the LLM demonstrates good understanding of the question structure and provides detailed analysis, the significant discrepancy in 2023 total short-term borrows ($38.6bn vs. $32.953bn) and the inability to verify 2022 figures against ground truth substantially undermines the answer's reliability.",

(2) The LLM answer references the 'HRC Committee report' incorporation, which is additional context not present in the ground truth. (3) The ground truth specifically notes the minor formatting change from 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis' to 'Compensation Discussion & Analysis' (ampersand vs. 'and'), which the LLM answer does not explicitly highlight as an evolution point.

(5) Both answers correctly identify that performance-based equity awards remained within existing proxy sections with no substantive change in compensation philosophy. The multi-hop reasoning is sound—the LLM correctly synthesized information across 2022 and 2024 filings to reach the conclusion of structural stability.

This is a massive discrepancy - the LLM's figure is 2.5x higher than the actual value. The ground truth also provides FY2024 revenue of $30,441 million, showing a $259 million increase (less than 1%), but the LLM claims it cannot find FY2024 data.

      "llm_answer": "The share of NVIDIA’s revenue that comes from U.S. customers rose sharply – outside‑U.S. sales fell from 69 % of total revenue in FY 2023 to 56 % in FY 2024, implying U.S. revenue grew from roughly 31 % to 44 % of the mix (page 40).  The company notes that the U.S. revenue increase in FY 2024 was “primarily due to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand” (page 79), indicating that demand for its data‑center and AI‑focused products is shifting increasingly toward domestic U.S. markets.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All numbers are correct - outside-U.S. revenue fell from 69% (FY2023) to 56% (FY2024), implying U.S. revenue rose from 31% to 44%. The calculation is accurate: 100% - 69% = 31% and 100% - 56% = 44%. (2) ENTITY ACCURACY: Correctly identifies NVIDIA, Compute & Networking segment, FY2023 and FY2024, and U.S. vs. outside-U.S. markets. (3) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The answer successfully synthesizes information across multiple sources - combining geographic revenue data with the company's explicit statement about the cause (higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking demand). The connection to data center expansion and AI initiatives is appropriately inferred from the context. (4) COMPLETENESS: Addresses all aspects of the question - the evolution of geographic concentration, the specific percentages, and what this suggests about shifting demand. The answer goes slightly beyond the ground truth by providing page references (40 and 79) and explicitly calculating the U.S. percentage shift, which adds credibility without introducing errors. (5) MINOR DIFFERENCES: The LLM answer is slightly more detailed and analytical than the ground truth, providing calculated percentages and direct quotes, but this enhances rather than detracts from accuracy.

(4) LONG-TERM PAY PROGRESSION - The ground truth mentions 3.15% long-term pay progression, which the LLM completely omits. (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS - While the LLM attempts to synthesize year-over-year changes, the fundamental discount rate numbers are wrong, undermining the entire analysis.

      "original_answer": "Document Cloud revenue showed a significant upward trend from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2021, Document Cloud revenue increased due to strong new user acquisition, contributing to the overall growth of Digital Media. By fiscal 2024, Document Cloud revenue had reached $3.18 billion, up from $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023, representing an 18% year-over-year growth. This indicates that Document Cloud has become a stronger contributor to the Digital Media segment, which itself grew 12% year-over-year in fiscal 2024, suggesting an increasing strategic importance of Document Cloud within Adobe’s Digital Media portfolio.",

In the same span Digital Media revenue grew from $11.52 billion to $15.86 billion (pages 46 and 41), so Document Cloud’s faster growth lifted its share of the segment from about 17 % to roughly 20 %, indicating it has become an increasingly important driver of Digital Media growth.",

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All key numbers are correct - Document Cloud revenue of $1.974B (FY2021), $2.70B (FY2023), and $3.18B (FY2024) match ground truth. The 61% three-year growth calculation is accurate ($1.974B to $3.18B = 60.9%, rounded to 61%). Digital Media segment figures of $11.52B (FY2021) and $15.86B (FY2024) are correct. The share calculations are accurate: FY2021 share = $1.974B/$11.52B = 17.1% (rounded to 17%), FY2024 share = $3.18B/$15.86B = 20.0% (rounded to 20%). MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes Document Cloud's growth trajectory with Digital Media segment growth, demonstrating that Document Cloud grew faster (61% over 3 years) than the overall segment (37.6% over 3 years), leading to increased strategic importance. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the question - the growth trajectory from FY2021-FY2024 and what this indicates about contribution to Digital Media segment growth. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The ground truth mentions FY2024 growth was 18% YoY and Digital Media grew 12% YoY, which the LLM answer doesn't explicitly state, but the LLM's focus on the three-year trend and share analysis provides equivalent insight into Document Cloud's increasing importance.

(1) LOAN MODIFICATIONS 2023: LLM correctly states $97 million, matching ground truth. However, the LLM adds unsupported detail about 'interest-rate reductions' and a '1.4%' ratio that are not in the ground truth and cannot be verified. (2) CRITICAL ERROR - REVOLVING LOANS 2024: LLM states '$497 million' in revolving-loan balance, but ground truth clearly indicates '$511 million in total revolving loans converted to term loans.' This is a $14 million discrepancy on a key metric. The LLM appears to have confused or misread the figure. (3) TERM LOAN CONVERSION: LLM mentions '$14 million of those loans converted to term,' which partially aligns with the difference between $511M and $497M, but this appears to be reverse-engineered rather than accurately sourced. Ground truth states $511 million were converted to term loans in 2024. (4) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS FAILURE: The LLM fails to properly synthesize the strategic shift described in ground truth. Ground truth emphasizes a shift FROM loan modifications (2023: $97M) TO converting revolving loans to term loans (2024: $511M). The LLM instead describes a 'shift toward a larger revolving-loan portfolio,' which contradicts the ground truth narrative of converting revolving to term loans. (5) MISSING CONTEXT: LLM omits the broader credit card segment context ($602M domestic + $97M international = $699M total in 2023) that provides important context for understanding the segment's composition. (6) UNSUPPORTED CLAIMS: The statement about 'marked drop in reported modification activity' is reasonable inference but not explicitly supported by ground truth data provided. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: 2/10 - Primary metric ($511M vs $497M) is incorrect; additional unsupported percentages added.

(1) QUANTITATIVE ERRORS: The LLM states that in 2023, VASS 'generated about 16% of Mastercard's net-revenue growth' and 'the segment itself grew roughly 18% year-over-year.' However, the ground truth clearly states the opposite: VASS contributed 18% to net revenue growth in 2023, while operational growth was 16%. The LLM has reversed these two metrics. For 2024, the LLM correctly states 17% contribution to net revenue growth and 17% segment growth, but this is only partially correct given the reversed baseline. (2) ENTITY IDENTIFICATION: While the LLM correctly identifies the company as Mastercard and the segment as Value-Added Services and Solutions (VASS), the metric attribution is fundamentally wrong. The LLM conflates 'contribution to net revenue growth' (18% in 2023) with 'segment operational growth' (16% in 2023), then inverts them. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM fails to properly synthesize the two distinct metrics: (a) the segment's contribution percentage to overall net revenue growth, and (b) the segment's own year-over-year growth rate. These are different measures and should not be confused. (4) SEMANTIC ACCURACY: The LLM's conclusion that VASS is 'an increasingly important growth engine' is somewhat supported by the data presented, but this conclusion is built on incorrect foundational numbers, making the reasoning unsound. The ground truth shows a slight decline in contribution (18% to 17%) paired with maintained operational growth (16% to 17%), which is a more nuanced picture than the LLM presents.

This is a material omission for understanding the evolution of disclosure.\n- The LLM does not address the valuation methodology or assumptions about market participant behavior mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n(3) ENTITY AND METRIC ACCURACY:\n- Correctly identifies JPMorgan Chase and the First Republic acquisition.\n- Correctly identifies the 7-year amortization period.\n- Correctly notes the shift in language from future tense to present tense.\n- Correctly references Note 33/34 and Note 34 with page numbers.\n\n(4) REASONING AND SYNTHESIS:\n- The multi-hop reasoning is sound in identifying the language shift and its implications (amortization has commenced).\n- The interpretation that 'the measurement period has been finalized' is a reasonable inference but goes slightly beyond what the ground truth explicitly states.\n- The answer correctly synthesizes the comparison between 2023 and 2024 filings.\n\n(5) CRITICAL GAPS:\n- The omission of the FDIC disputed amounts disclosure is a significant oversight that materially affects the completeness of the answer regarding how disclosure 'evolved.'\n- The quantitative discrepancy ($1.455 bn vs. the clear $1.3 bn + $180 mn breakdown) suggests either a calculation error or misreading of the source material.\n\nThe answer demonstrates good understanding of the linguistic evolution and amortization implications but fails on quantitative precision and omits a material new disclosure element that directly addresses the question about evolution between filings.",

      "question": "How did the financial performance and strategic reporting focus of NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment evolve from 2022 to 2024, based on the disclosed revenue figures and reporting emphasis?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Compute & Networking segment reported $11.046 billion in revenue, contributing significantly to NVIDIA's consolidated revenue of $26.914 billion. This indicates a clear quantitative emphasis on the segment in the financial reporting. By 2024, while no direct revenue figure was disclosed for the segment, the filing highlighted customer concentration, noting that certain direct customers represented 10% or more of total revenue and were primarily attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. This shift in reporting focus from explicit revenue breakdowns to customer concentration suggests a change in how the segment's performance is communicated, though the segment remains strategically significant. The absence of a direct revenue comparison limits definitive conclusions about growth, but the continued emphasis on the segment in financial disclosures shows its ongoing importance.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking segment was mentioned mainly in the context of the Mellanox acquisition – goodwill and intangible‑asset accounting were highlighted, but a separate revenue number for the segment was not disclosed. By the 2024 filing the segment generated $47.4 billion of revenue (≈ 36 % of total revenue) and the 10‑K now emphasizes a detailed segment‑level breakdown, noting strong data‑center demand and the contribution of direct‑customer sales. This reflects a shift from a focus on post‑acquisition integration in 2022 to a clear, high‑growth revenue story and granular reporting of the Compute & Networking business in 2024.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The LLM claims the 2024 Compute & Networking segment generated $47.4 billion in revenue, but the ground truth explicitly states 'no direct revenue figure was disclosed for the segment' in 2024. This is a major factual error - the LLM fabricated a specific number that does not exist in the filings. The LLM also incorrectly states that 2022 did not have a separate revenue number disclosed, when the ground truth clearly shows $11.046 billion was reported for 2022. (2) ENTITY/METRIC ERRORS: The LLM misidentifies what was actually disclosed - it claims a '36% of total revenue' figure exists, which is not supported by the ground truth. (3) REASONING FAILURES: The LLM's multi-hop synthesis is fundamentally flawed. It creates a false narrative of evolution from 'post-acquisition integration focus' in 2022 to 'high-growth revenue story' in 2024, when the actual evolution was from explicit revenue disclosure ($11.046B in 2022) to customer concentration emphasis (no direct segment revenue in 2024). (4) SEMANTIC MISALIGNMENT: The LLM's core narrative is inverted - it suggests more detailed reporting in 2024 when the ground truth indicates a shift away from explicit revenue breakdowns. The answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the question and provides demonstrably false financial figures that would mislead any reader. The only partially correct element is the acknowledgment that the segment remains important, but this is overshadowed by the fabricated numbers and incorrect characterization of the reporting evolution.",

However, the ground truth clearly indicates that in fiscal year 2023, Xbox content and services revenue increased by 50% WITH 44 percentage points of growth attributed to the net impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the multi-hop question. The LLM correctly identifies that in fiscal 2024 there was 50% growth with 44 percentage points from the acquisition, and correctly notes the October 13, 2023 closing date. However, the LLM fails to recognize that the acquisition's impact extended into FY2023 (likely due to partial-year consolidation or other accounting treatments). The question specifically asks about growth evolution 'between fiscal years 2023 and 2024' and the impact in 'each year' - the LLM only properly addresses FY2024 while providing incorrect information about FY2023. The LLM's reasoning about the acquisition not being completed in FY2023 is logically sound on its face, but factually incorrect according to the ground truth data.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MetLife experienced gross margin compression on its universal life insurance products due to interest rate sensitivity, and managed the risk through product design features and asset/liability management (ALM) strategies, including interest rate derivatives. However, lowering crediting rates could be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees. By 2024, MetLife significantly reduced its interest rate risk exposure for universal life products as a result of an external reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023, leaving minimal exposure from this block. This represents a major reduction in the risk profile of these products year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing MetLife said that gross‑margin compression on its universal‑life block was largely neutralized by an external re‑insurance transaction that closed in November 2023, leaving the company with only minimal exposure to that risk. By the 2024 filing the firm is managing the same exposure internally – using product‑design features and asset‑liability‑management (ALM) strategies, employing interest‑rate derivatives, and where possible lowering crediting rates on in‑force universal‑life policies (though any benefit can be offset by secondary guarantees).",

According to the ground truth: (1) In 2023, MetLife managed UL margin compression through internal strategies (product design, ALM, derivatives, crediting rate adjustments). (2) By 2024, the reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023 had significantly reduced exposure, leaving minimal risk. The LLM answer incorrectly states that the 2023 filing mentions the reinsurance transaction neutralizing the problem, then claims 2024 shows internal management of 'the same exposure' - this is backwards. The reinsurance transaction was a major risk reduction event that occurred between the two filing periods, not something already resolved in 2023. The LLM also creates logical confusion by suggesting 2024 involves managing 'the same exposure internally' when the ground truth indicates the reinsurance transaction substantially reduced the exposure profile. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The date 'November 2023' is correct, but the temporal placement and causal relationship are inverted. COMPLETENESS: The answer mentions the reinsurance transaction and internal management strategies, but fails to properly sequence the evolution between years or explain how the transaction represented a major reduction in risk profile. REASONING: The multi-hop synthesis is fundamentally flawed - the model failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year evolution and instead presented a contradictory narrative where both years involve managing the same risk through different means, missing the key insight that the reinsurance transaction was a transformative event reducing exposure.",

The LLM goes beyond the ground truth by providing the intermediate 2023 figure ($126M), which adds valuable context showing the progression was gradual rather than a single jump.

The LLM correctly identifies these as 'product-warranty provisions' and accurately interprets the implications: higher sales, broader coverage, and greater financial commitments/risk exposure. The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the model synthesized the data across three fiscal years and correctly connected the provision increases to their underlying causes. Minor deduction: The LLM specifies 'product-warranty provisions' while the ground truth uses the more general term 'provisions during the period.' While the LLM's specification is likely correct based on context, it adds a qualifier not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth statement. The citation references provided suggest proper sourcing.

STRENGTHS: (1) All partner names are correctly identified for both 2023 and 2024 - Adobe, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, Samsung Electronics, SAP in 2023, with Palo Alto Networks added in 2024. (2) The multi-hop synthesis is sound: the answer correctly identifies the evolution from 2023 to 2024 by comparing the two filing years and noting the addition of Palo Alto Networks. (3) The interpretation of strategic intent is accurate - correctly identifying that Palo Alto Networks' addition signals strengthening of security and cloud capabilities. (4) The answer properly cites source documents (2023 10-K p. 3 and 2024 10-K p. 3), adding credibility. (5) The reasoning about addressing client challenges and accelerating growth through comprehensive end-to-end solutions matches the ground truth interpretation. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM answer uses slightly more elaborate language ('widening its ecosystem,' 'increasingly diverse partner network') compared to the ground truth's more concise phrasing, but this represents semantic enhancement rather than factual deviation. The core message - that IBM expanded its partnership ecosystem by adding Palo Alto Networks to strengthen security and cloud capabilities - is identical to the ground truth. No numerical errors, calculation errors, or entity misidentifications present. The answer fully addresses both parts of the multi-part question: how the ecosystem evolved (addition of Palo Alto Networks) and what this indicates about IBM's approach (security focus, comprehensive solutions, growth acceleration).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG reported a prior year development of $92 million for unallocated loss adjustment expenses, indicating a net increase in estimated expenses from previous years. However, by 2024, this figure had shifted to a negative $28 million, meaning the company experienced a net reduction in unallocated loss adjustment expenses from prior years. This trend suggests that AIG's loss reserve estimates became more accurate over time, as the company reduced its need for additional expense adjustments. The reversal from a positive to a negative development reflects an improvement in the company's ability to estimate and manage these costs.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG’s unallocated loss‑adjustment‑expense prior‑year development was a negative $512 million in 2022, improved to a negative $462 million in 2023, and then worsened to a negative $534 million in 2024 (page 154). The swing from a modest improvement in 2023 to a larger adverse shortfall in 2024 indicates that the company’s reserve estimates have been inconsistent, with reserve accuracy deteriorating in the most recent year.",

The ground truth states 2022 was positive $92M and 2024 was negative $28M. These are not minor formatting differences - they represent entirely different values and even opposite signs (positive vs. negative). The magnitude differences are also substantial ($512M vs $92M for 2022). (2) TREND ANALYSIS ERROR - The LLM describes a trend of negative values improving then worsening, which is completely inconsistent with the actual trend of positive $92M in 2022 shifting to negative $28M in 2024. This is a fundamental mischaracterization of the data. (3) INTERPRETATION ERROR - The LLM concludes that reserve accuracy deteriorated, when the ground truth indicates improvement in accuracy (reversal from positive to negative development suggests better estimates). The LLM's reasoning about 'inconsistent' and 'deteriorating' accuracy is the opposite of what the actual data shows. (4) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS - The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the 2022-2024 trend data, providing entirely fabricated numbers. The page reference (154) may be correct, but the numbers extracted are wrong. (5) SEMANTIC MEANING - The LLM's conclusion that accuracy deteriorated directly contradicts the ground truth's conclusion that accuracy improved.

The answer correctly lists the sections incorporated: Director Compensation, Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Executive Compensation Tables and Other Compensation Disclosures, Board Meetings and Committee Information, and Report of the HRC Committee. However, there are significant issues with the answer's completeness and accuracy relative to the ground truth: (1) The LLM incorrectly attributes 'Director Compensation' to 'Item 1 – Election of Directors' when the ground truth indicates it should be under 'Item 2 Advisory Vote on Compensation' along with the other compensation sections. (2) The LLM states the structure 'remains unchanged' between 2022 and 2023, but the ground truth explicitly notes that 'the formatting of the headings was adjusted' and that there was 'a refinement in disclosure structure' with 'more granular sub-sections in 2023.' The LLM's characterization of the change as merely 'a minor formatting tweak' understates the structural evolution described in the ground truth. (3) The answer lacks the nuance that the ground truth provides about the evolution of presentation and the more detailed breakdown of committee information in 2023. (4) While the LLM correctly identifies that core content appears consistent, it fails to adequately address how the structure evolved beyond just the ampersand change.

      "question": "How did MetLife's treatment or risk exposure related to Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of the factors influencing these liabilities?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife emphasized the use of actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, and investment returns to calculate liabilities for future policy benefits, with a focus on establishing these liabilities based on expected future benefits and premiums. The company also noted that unfavorable experience relative to assumptions could result in additional liabilities. By 2023, the focus shifted to how external financial conditions, particularly low interest rates and declining risk asset returns, could negatively impact these liabilities. Specifically, the 2023 filing highlights that declining interest rates may necessitate increases in reserves, including those for future policy benefits, due to lower investment spreads and asset/liability mismatches. This indicates a shift from an internal actuarial focus in 2022 to a more market-risk oriented perspective in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife described its liabilities for future policy benefits as actuarial estimates that are set at policy issuance – mortality, morbidity, lapse, renewal, disability, investment‑return, inflation and expense assumptions – and, for its long‑duration contracts (about 70 % of the balance), those assumptions are “locked‑in” unless a premium‑deficiency reserve is required; risk is mitigated through dividend‑scale adjustments, capital buffers and interest‑rate scenario testing (see 2022 p. 64‑66). By the 2023 filing the company’s discussion shifted to the fact that those same liabilities are now viewed as highly sensitive to macro‑economic factors – especially low or falling interest rates, changes in market credit spreads and investment‑return assumptions – which can raise the discount rate, increase reserves and create volatility in the liability balance (see 2023 p. 31 and 30).",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2022 focus on actuarial assumptions (mortality, morbidity, lapse, renewal, disability, investment-return, inflation, expense) and the 'locked-in' nature of assumptions for long-duration contracts (~70% of balance). (2) Accurately captures the 2023 shift toward macro-economic sensitivity, specifically citing low/falling interest rates, market credit spreads, and investment-return assumptions. (3) Provides specific page references (2022 p. 64-66, 2023 p. 30-31) that add credibility and demonstrate source verification. (4) The multi-hop synthesis is sound: clearly contrasts the internal actuarial focus of 2022 with the market-risk oriented perspective of 2023, matching the ground truth's characterization. (5) Includes relevant risk mitigation details (dividend-scale adjustments, capital buffers, interest-rate scenario testing) that enhance understanding without detracting from the core answer. (6) The quantitative reference to '70%' for long-duration contracts is specific and verifiable. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The LLM answer is more detailed and specific than the ground truth, providing additional context about risk mitigation mechanisms and specific page citations. This is not an error but rather an enhancement. (2) The phrasing differs from ground truth (e.g., 'raise the discount rate' vs. 'necessitate increases in reserves') but the semantic meaning is equivalent and accurate. (3) All factual claims align with the ground truth's core message about the evolution from internal actuarial focus to external market-risk focus.

In 2023, the filing no longer provided a specific growth percentage but instead focused on refining the definition and methodology of measuring Switched Transactions, including normalization for switching and carryover days, and noting the impact of data exclusions from sanctioned Russian banks starting in Q1 2022.

By the 2023 filing the company introduced a dedicated “Switched Transactions” metric, defined it as the number of transactions initiated and switched through its network, explained that the data come from customer‑provided, verified sources, disclosed that Russian‑bank data were excluded after Q1‑2022, and reported growth both in USD and local‑currency terms with normalization for switching and carry‑over days and a Russia‑adjusted rate (14 %/12 % and 16 % adjusted) [see definition and growth tables on pages 54‑55].

COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (1) the change in noncurrent income taxes receivable amounts, and (2) what this indicates about Qualcomm's tax refund claims in Korea. ENTITY ACCURACY: Qualcomm is correctly identified, the metric (noncurrent income taxes receivable) is correctly named, and the fiscal years are properly referenced. REASONING & SYNTHESIS: The LLM correctly synthesizes information across two fiscal years and draws a logical conclusion that the increase reflects an expansion of the Korean tax refund claim. The interpretation that this shows the company 'continues to seek refunds of Korean withholding tax' aligns with the ground truth's statement about the company's position strengthening or evolving. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's phrasing 'Korean tax-refund claim has expanded' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth's 'position on its partial refund claim...has strengthened or evolved.' Both convey that the receivable balance has grown and reflects progression through the refund application process. MINOR OBSERVATION: The LLM uses slightly different language ('claim has expanded') versus ground truth ('position...has strengthened or evolved'), but both interpretations are reasonable and factually supported by the data.

The ground truth clearly states AMD recognized $12 million in licensing gain from the THATIC JV in 2022. The LLM incorrectly claims '2022 filing does not show any licensing-gain line for the THATIC JV' and states the amount was 'essentially zero in 2022.' This is directly contradicted by the original answer which explicitly cites $12 million for 2022. The 2024 figure of $48 million is correct, and the 2023 figure of $34 million mentioned by the LLM is not contradicted by the ground truth (which doesn't specify 2023). However, the core comparison is broken: the ground truth indicates a fourfold increase from $12M (2022) to $48M (2024), while the LLM's narrative of 'essentially zero in 2022 to $48 million in 2024' misrepresents the actual evolution. The LLM also introduces unverified intermediate data (2023: $34 million, 2019: $60 million, 2021: $12 million) that may or may not be accurate but creates confusion about the primary 2022-2024 comparison. The reasoning about 'strengthening financial relationship' is qualitatively sound, but it's based on incorrect premises about the 2022 baseline. The answer fails to correctly synthesize the multi-hop information: it should show a clear $12M→$48M progression, not a near-zero→$48M progression.",

Ground truth states FY2022: $2,852 million and FY2024: $7,568 million. The LLM reports FY2022: $5.2 billion ($5,200 million) and FY2024: $7.6 billion ($7,600 million). The FY2022 figure is off by approximately $2,348 million (82% error), and the FY2024 figure is off by $32 million (0.4% error). The LLM's calculated difference of $2.4 billion is also incorrect - the actual difference should be $4,716 million ($7,568M - $2,852M). The LLM appears to have confused or misreported the FY2022 baseline figure, possibly conflating it with a different metric or year. QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT: The reasoning about capital expenditure strategy and AI/data-center scaling is sound and aligns with the ground truth interpretation. The company identification (NVDA) and fiscal years (2022-2024) are correct. The characterization of the strategy shift as 'aggressive' is appropriate. However, the fundamental quantitative errors severely undermine the answer's credibility. MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The answer does synthesize the evolution across years and connects it to strategic implications, which is appropriate for the question.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment was linked to a high concentration of revenue from a limited number of customers, with one customer (Customer A) representing 13% of total revenue. Additionally, an indirect customer purchasing through system integrators and distributors, including Customer A, was estimated to represent approximately 19% of total revenue. By fiscal year 2024, the Compute & Networking segment played a central role in the increase in U.S.-based revenue, which accounted for a growing share of NVIDIA's total revenue. This indicates a shift where the segment not only remained a key revenue driver but also became more integral to growth in a major geographic market. The evolution shows NVIDIA deepened its strategic reliance on the Compute & Networking segment, especially as it became more critical to satisfying growing U.S. demand.",

By contrast, in FY 2023 no customer contributed 10 % or more of total revenue (page 80), showing that NVIDIA’s reliance on a limited set of large customers in the Compute & Networking segment has increased between the two years.",

Instead, the LLM focuses narrowly on customer concentration without addressing the geographic/strategic shift to U.S. market dependency. (3) MISSING CONTEXT: The ground truth emphasizes a strategic deepening of reliance on Compute & Networking for U.S. demand satisfaction, which the LLM completely omits. (4) CONTRADICTORY FRAMING: The LLM states the customer base moved from 'broadly-distributed' in FY 2023 to 'more concentrated' in FY 2024, but the ground truth indicates concentration already existed in FY 2023 (13% + 19% = 32% from limited sources).

In 2024, the valuation and qualifying accounts section was given a standalone heading on page 29, accompanied by a clear temporal label specifying the years ended December 31, with an explicit mention of financial units in millions.

By 2024, these variable rebates and incentives had grown in importance, representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue. Additionally, the 2024 filing highlights that the estimation of variable rebates involves significant management judgment based on forecasted transactions, card issuance, and conversion volumes, leading to increased auditor scrutiny and classification as a critical audit matter. This indicates a transformation in both the scale and complexity of how variable rebates and incentives are managed and reported.",

However, it fails to fully synthesize the complete temporal evolution by omitting 2020 and 2023 data points that are essential to understanding the full trend.\n\nJUSTIFICATION: While the LLM provides accurate numbers for the endpoints and correct calculations, it significantly underperforms on completeness by omitting critical intermediate data (2023: $9.2B) and the prior baseline (2020: $10.6B). This results in an incomplete and somewhat misleading characterization of the trend. The answer would score higher if it acknowledged the 2023 decline and provided the fuller historical context.",

      "original_answer": "Document Cloud revenue grew by 32% in fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2020 to $1.97 billion, indicating strong early adoption and integration within Adobe's Digital Media offerings. By fiscal 2024, the year-over-year growth rate had slowed to 18%, with revenue increasing from $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023 to $3.18 billion in fiscal 2024. This suggests that while Document Cloud remains a growing contributor, its pace of expansion has moderated as it matures within the Digital Media segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Document Cloud’s revenue surged 32% year‑over‑year in fiscal 2021, reaching $1.97 billion, but its growth slowed to 18% year‑over‑year in fiscal 2024, climbing to $3.18 billion【page_43】【page_40】. Although the growth rate has decelerated, the segment’s revenue more than doubled, raising Document Cloud’s share of Digital Media from roughly 17% of $11.5 billion in FY 2021 to about 20% of $15.9 billion in FY 2024, indicating an increasingly important contribution to Adobe’s Digital Media segment【page_43】【page_40】.",

VERIFICATION OF KEY NUMBERS: (1) FY2021 growth rate of 32% - CORRECT; (2) FY2021 revenue of $1.97 billion - CORRECT; (3) FY2024 growth rate of 18% - CORRECT; (4) FY2024 revenue of $3.18 billion - CORRECT; (5) FY2023 revenue of $2.70 billion (implied in ground truth) - CORRECT. ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS PROVIDED: The LLM answer includes segment share calculations not in the ground truth: Document Cloud as ~17% of $11.5 billion Digital Media in FY2021 and ~20% of $15.9 billion in FY2024. These calculations are mathematically sound ($1.97B/$11.5B ≈ 17.1% and $3.18B/$15.9B ≈ 20.0%). MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes revenue growth rates across fiscal years, identifies the deceleration trend (32% to 18%), and connects this to Document Cloud's increasing strategic importance within the Digital Media segment. The conclusion that Document Cloud 'remains a growing contributor' with 'moderated pace' aligns with ground truth while adding quantitative evidence of growing segment share. COMPLETENESS: Addresses both parts of the question - revenue growth evolution and contribution to Digital Media segment. The additional segment share analysis strengthens the answer without contradicting ground truth.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Embedded segment was identified as one of AMD's four reportable segments, including products such as embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. However, in 2024, the Embedded segment experienced a 33% decline in net revenue, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion. This decline was attributed to customers normalizing their inventory levels. Therefore, the Embedded segment's financial performance significantly decreased between 2023 and 2024 due to inventory adjustments by customers.",
      "llm_answer": "AMD’s Embedded segment saw a sharp contraction – net revenue fell from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion in 2024, a 33 % drop, and the segment’s operating income, which was $2.6 billion in 2023, fell as revenue slipped 【page_70】.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle described its Services Business as one of three operating segments, but the strategic positioning focused primarily on general enterprise IT environments with a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies. The Services Business was not explicitly tied to cloud adoption but rather positioned as a flexible offering across deployment models. By fiscal 2023, Oracle significantly evolved its strategic positioning of the Services Business, explicitly linking it to cloud adoption and customer support. The 2023 filing emphasized that customers could 'continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments.' This included integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and AI-enhanced offerings like Oracle Autonomous Database, which used machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions. The Services Business in 2023 was framed as a key enabler of cloud migration and customer retention, with a focus on supporting Oracle Cloud Services contracts and product enhancements.",

By FY 2023 the company repositioned the Services Business as professional services that “assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services” and explicitly tied those services to cloud adoption—supporting deployments of Oracle Cloud applications and aligning with its cloud‑and‑license and license‑support contracts (page_6, page_8).",

These negative values for 2022 are implausible and appear to be fabricated or severely misread. The ground truth does not provide these specific interest component breakdowns, but the LLM's presentation of negative interest income/expense in 2022 is highly suspect and inconsistent with typical financial reporting. The LLM appears to have invented detailed component data not present in the ground truth. (2) CORRECT ELEMENTS: The LLM correctly identifies the overall decline from $1,166M (2022) to $226M (2024), correctly calculates the $940M difference, and accurately reports the 'Other, net' decline from $1,073M to $15M. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING: While the LLM attempts to synthesize component changes, it does so with unverified and likely incorrect data. The ground truth explicitly states the shift was driven by 'Other, net' changes but does NOT provide the detailed interest income/expense breakdowns the LLM claims.

This interpretation aligns with and extends the ground truth's observation about 'declining trend' and 'reduced reliance.' The reasoning is sound and contextually appropriate. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM provides slightly more interpretive context (mentioning the broader shift toward cloud-service and subscription revenue) compared to the ground truth's more straightforward statement.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Express disclosed that modifications to Card Member Loans did not reduce the principal balance and that there were no payment term extensions, indicating a stable and consistent internal policy regarding loan modifications. By 2023, external economic pressures such as geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters in key states like California and Florida, and increased competition from alternative financing products began to negatively impact the credit performance and spending behavior of Card Members. These external factors introduced new risks that could affect repayment trends and loan performance, marking a shift from internal policy consistency to external vulnerability.",

The semantic understanding of the shift is sound, and the answer appropriately synthesizes the multi-hop comparison across years. The identification of specific external factors (geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, inflation) aligns with the ground truth. The answer demonstrates good qualitative reasoning about the transition in risk narratives.\n\nWEAKNESSES: (1) FACTUAL ERRORS: The LLM introduces the 'Customer Pandemic Relief program' and TDR treatment as 2022 credit risk factors, but the ground truth specifically states that in 2022, modifications 'did not reduce the principal balance' and there were 'no payment term extensions' - suggesting pandemic relief was NOT a primary 2022 factor. This is a significant factual discrepancy. (2) MISSING KEY DETAIL: The ground truth emphasizes that 2022 modifications were characterized by stability and consistency (no principal reduction, no term extensions), which the LLM fails to capture. Instead, the LLM focuses on TDR accounting treatment, which is a different dimension. (3) PAGE REFERENCES: The LLM cites specific pages (113, 26, 28) without verification against the ground truth source material - these cannot be confirmed as accurate.

(5) QUANTITATIVE GAPS: No specific metrics, percentages, or dollar amounts are provided in either answer, but the LLM's introduction of pandemic-era modifications as a 2022 focus contradicts the ground truth's characterization of 2022 as a period of policy stability.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly synthesizes the comparison across two years and identifies the shift in emphasis. However, the specific characterization of 2022 factors is materially incorrect, undermining the validity of the comparison.\n\nSCORE JUSTIFICATION: The answer captures the directional shift (internal to external) and demonstrates reasonable qualitative reasoning, but contains a significant factual error regarding what constituted the 2022 internal policy focus. The introduction of pandemic relief programs as a primary 2022 factor contradicts the ground truth's emphasis on policy consistency and stability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring 'significant fees or fines' if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including increased transaction costs or loss of payment processing ability. In 2023, the language evolved to place greater emphasis on the potential liability, using the phrase 'can also incur significant fees or fines' following 'associated investigatory expenses,' suggesting an increased likelihood or severity of financial penalties. This indicates an evolution in the perceived risk, with Apple signaling a potentially more severe consequence structure tied to payment card compliance failures.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2022 and 2023 Form 10‑K risk disclosures contain the same statement that Apple could be liable for investigatory expenses and “significant fees or fines” if it fails to follow payment‑card industry data‑security standards (see the “Payment card data” paragraph on page 18 of each filing). Because the language is essentially unchanged, Apple’s exposure to such penalties has not increased or decreased, indicating that compliance with payment‑card security rules remains a steady, ongoing risk rather than a newly emerging one.",

The LLM answer directly contradicts this by claiming 'the language is essentially unchanged' and concluding that 'Apple's exposure to such penalties has not increased or decreased.' This is a critical factual error in the core analysis. The LLM correctly identifies the general topic (payment card data security standards, investigatory expenses, fees/fines) and correctly notes that both years contain similar risk disclosures, but it fails to detect the subtle but important linguistic evolution that the ground truth identifies. The ground truth's key insight—that the 2023 language places greater emphasis on liability by restructuring the sentence to emphasize 'can also incur significant fees or fines' after investigatory expenses—is completely missed. The LLM's conclusion that this represents 'a steady, ongoing risk rather than a newly emerging one' contradicts the ground truth's assessment that the language change indicates 'an evolution in the perceived risk' with 'potentially more severe consequence structure.' The quantitative accuracy is reasonable (dates and entities are correct), but the qualitative reasoning and semantic understanding of the linguistic changes are severely deficient.

The same amount is shown at the end of 2024, with the table for Q4 2024 also listing **$2.0 billion** still available for purchase【page_14】. Thus, the remaining repurchase capacity has stayed essentially unchanged at about $2 billion, indicating that IBM has maintained a stable pool of funds for stock buybacks over this period.",

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: The specific dollar amount of $2,007,611,768 is correctly cited and matches the ground truth exactly. The rounded representation of '$2.0 billion' is an appropriate format variation that maintains accuracy. The dates (end of 2021 and end of 2024) are correctly identified. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question: (1) the dollar value at end of 2021, (2) the dollar value at end of 2024, (3) the evolution/change between these periods, and (4) what this indicates about repurchase capacity. MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The LLM correctly synthesized information from two different 10-K filings (2022 and 2024) to compare the values across the three-year period. REASONING QUALITY: The conclusion that 'IBM has maintained a stable pool of funds for stock buybacks' is logically sound and appropriately reflects the unchanged amount. The interpretation that the stable amount 'indicates...stable repurchase capacity' is reasonable, though the ground truth more explicitly notes this represents 'unused repurchase capacity' (no utilization over the period). MINOR OBSERVATION: The LLM's phrasing 'maintained a stable pool of funds for stock buybacks' could be slightly more precise by noting these funds were not actually utilized, as the ground truth emphasizes. However, this is a subtle distinction and the core message is semantically equivalent. The citation references (page_24, page_14) add credibility though they cannot be independently verified in this evaluation.

By fiscal year 2024, the U.S. revenue increased significantly due to higher demand in the Compute & Networking segment, and one customer alone accounted for 13% of total revenue, indicating a notable shift in both geographic revenue mix and customer concentration driven by this segment.",

(2) U.S. revenue percentage: 31% to 44% - correctly calculated and presented, showing the shift in geographic mix. (3) International revenue: 69% to 56% - correctly stated as the inverse of U.S. percentages, accurately reflecting the decline in international revenue proportion. (4) Customer concentration: Correctly identifies that in FY2023 no customer accounted for 10%+ of revenue, while in FY2024 one customer represented 13% of total revenue. (5) Multi-hop synthesis: The answer successfully synthesizes information across multiple dimensions - geographic revenue mix, absolute dollar amounts, percentages, and customer concentration metrics - all tied to the Compute & Networking segment's impact. The reasoning is sound: the segment's growth drove both the U.S. revenue increase and the customer concentration shift. Minor note: The answer provides specific dollar amounts ($26.97B, $8.29B) that go slightly beyond the ground truth's qualitative description, but these appear to be accurate supporting details from the source material (page 79 citations provided). The answer directly addresses both parts of the question (U.S. revenue evolution and customer concentration evolution) with clear before/after comparisons.

However, the LLM completely fails to provide the 2024 data despite the ground truth showing clear 2024 figures: beginning balance of $658M, a $122M decrease, and ending balance of $577M.

(3) ENTITY ACCURACY: IBM and the Allowance for Inventory Losses metric are correctly identified. (4) REASONING: The LLM's reasoning about 2023 showing 'proactive strengthening' is sound, but the failure to provide 2024 data prevents the critical comparison that would show the shift from risk accumulation to risk reduction.

By 2023, the description remained largely the same, with installed base growth still being a key driver. However, the 2023 filing added emphasis on AI and productivity categories such as communication, collaboration, analytics, security, and compliance as part of the growth strategy.

(2) WRONG PERCENTAGE: LLM calculates 22% growth, but ground truth shows 23% growth. While close, this is still incorrect. (3) FLAWED REASONING: The LLM's backward calculation logic is fundamentally flawed. It attempts to derive FY2023 from FY2024 data ($137.4B ÷ 1.23 ≈ $111.7B), but this is incorrect because $137.4B IS the FY2023 figure according to ground truth, not FY2024.

(4) CALCULATION VERIFICATION: If FY2022 = $91.2B and FY2023 = $137.4B, then growth = ($137.4B - $91.2B) / $91.2B = $46.2B / $91.2B = 50.66%, which rounds to approximately 51% growth, not 23%. The correct 23% calculation: $91.2B × 1.23 = $112.176B ≈ $112.2B would give ~$112B, but ground truth explicitly states $137.4B for FY2023.

      "question": "How has Texas Instruments' capital expenditure allocation evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what strategic role does this play in supporting free cash flow per share growth?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments allocated just over $15 billion to capital expenditures over a 10-year period ending that year, while in 2024, the company allocated about $20 billion to capital expenditures over the 10-year period ending in 2024. This represents an increase in capital expenditure allocation of approximately $5 billion. The company emphasized that increased capital expenditures are intended to support future revenue growth, which is described as becoming a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward. This indicates a strategic shift toward greater investment in manufacturing capacity and infrastructure to underpin long-term free cash flow per share growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Texas Instruments’ 10‑year capital‑expenditure budget rose from “just over $15 billion” for the 2014‑2023 period to “about $20 billion” for the 2015‑2024 period【TXN_10k_2023.pdf page_2】【TXN_10k_2024.pdf page_2】.  The company says the larger capex spend is intended to expand manufacturing capacity and other capabilities to drive future revenue growth, making those investments a bigger engine for long‑term free‑cash‑flow‑per‑share growth.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer demonstrates strong accuracy and completeness. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: The key numbers are correct - $15 billion for the earlier 10-year period and $20 billion for the later 10-year period, representing a $5 billion increase. The LLM correctly identifies these as 10-year capital expenditure budgets. ENTITY ACCURACY: Texas Instruments is correctly identified, and the fiscal periods are accurately referenced (2014-2023 and 2015-2024 periods, which align with the ground truth's reference to periods 'ending' in 2023 and 2024 respectively). MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across multiple documents (TXN_10k_2023.pdf and TXN_10k_2024.pdf) to show the evolution of capex allocation and connects this to strategic objectives. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's phrasing 'expand manufacturing capacity and other capabilities to drive future revenue growth' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth's 'greater investment in manufacturing capacity and infrastructure to underpin long-term free cash flow per share growth.' Both convey the same strategic intent. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question: (1) how capex evolved (from $15B to $20B), (2) the magnitude of change ($5B increase), and (3) the strategic role in supporting free cash flow per share growth. MINOR OBSERVATION: The LLM provides slightly more specific period notation (2014-2023 vs 2015-2024) compared to the ground truth's more general 'ending that year' language, which adds helpful clarity without introducing inaccuracy. The citation format with document references enhances credibility. No calculation errors detected, and all factual claims align with the ground truth.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software segment was primarily a recipient of internal capital allocation through business acquisitions, with $110 million allocated to intangible assets from acquisitions completed during that year. By fiscal year 2024, the relationship had transformed significantly, with the segment being explicitly positioned as a strategic pillar of the company's broader infrastructure technology offerings. The 2024 report highlights the segment's expanded role in supporting hybrid cloud environments, cybersecurity, and AI networking, indicating a shift from a focus on acquisition-driven growth to strategic integration and market leadership emphasis.",
      "llm_answer": "In FY 2022 Broadcom treated its infrastructure‑software business as a growth‑adjacent platform, pursuing modest add‑on deals – four acquisitions totalling $245 million (primarily goodwill and intangible assets) that were “allocated … primarily within our infrastructure software segment” (AVGO 2022 p.99) – and was still working toward a pending VMware merger (AVGO 2022 p.97). By FY 2024 the segment had become a central pillar of the company’s strategy, explicitly highlighted in its “technology‑leadership and category‑leading semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions” (AVGO 2024 p.37) and backed by a massive $30.8 billion cash‑and‑stock acquisition of VMware (AVGO 2024 p.38) together with a renewed focus on deepening enterprise‑customer relationships and expanding software adoption (AVGO 2024 p.39).",

This is a significant numerical discrepancy (122% overstatement). The LLM also introduces the $30.8 billion VMware acquisition as a FY2024 event, but this appears to conflate timing - VMware was a pending merger in FY2022 and completed later, not necessarily in FY2024 reporting period. (2) FACTUAL ACCURACY - The ground truth emphasizes a shift from 'acquisition-driven growth' to 'strategic integration and market leadership emphasis,' but the LLM's narrative actually emphasizes the opposite trajectory by highlighting the massive $30.8B VMware acquisition as the defining FY2024 characteristic, which contradicts the ground truth's emphasis on integration over acquisition. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING - The LLM correctly identifies the evolution from FY2022 to FY2024 and attempts to synthesize strategic positioning, but the quantitative foundation is flawed. The ground truth's key insight about shifting from acquisition-focused to integration-focused strategy is partially obscured by the LLM's emphasis on the VMware deal size. (4) SEMANTIC ISSUES - The LLM's characterization of FY2022 as 'growth-adjacent platform' with 'modest add-on deals' contradicts the ground truth's simpler characterization of 'recipient of internal capital allocation.' The LLM adds interpretive language not supported by the ground truth. (5) POSITIVE ASPECTS - The LLM correctly identifies the strategic pillar positioning in FY2024, correctly cites page references, and appropriately notes the shift in strategic emphasis toward hybrid cloud, cybersecurity, and AI networking (though not explicitly stated in ground truth, it's consistent with the integration narrative).",

This quantitative disclosure highlighted growth momentum and provided insight into the company's expanding transactional scale. However, in 2024, the company shifted its GDV reporting approach by focusing on qualitative aspects, such as a chart detailing GDV and number of cards for select programs and solutions, without disclosing the total GDV figure. This change indicates a strategic pivot from broad volume reporting to a more targeted view of GDV performance by program, suggesting a refined reporting focus aligned with specific business initiatives.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURE: The LLM claims 2024 GDV was $9.8 trillion with 11% YoY growth. However, the ground truth explicitly states that in 2024, the company 'shifted its GDV reporting approach' and 'without disclosing the total GDV figure.' The LLM fabricated a 2024 GDV number ($9.8 trillion) that does not exist in the actual filing. This is a major factual error. (2) MISUNDERSTANDING OF REPORTING SHIFT: The ground truth indicates a strategic pivot FROM quantitative disclosure (2023: $9.0T) TO qualitative reporting (2024: no total GDV disclosed, only program-level charts). The LLM incorrectly suggests both years had comparable quantitative disclosures and misses the key insight about the reporting methodology change. (3) CALCULATION ERROR: The LLM states '$0.8 trillion increase (≈ 9-11% growth)' but this calculation is based on the fabricated 2024 figure. The actual comparison should note the absence of 2024 total GDV disclosure. (4) INCOMPLETE SYNTHESIS: The question asks what the evolution 'indicates about the company's transactional scale and reporting focus.' The ground truth correctly identifies this as a 'strategic pivot from broad volume reporting to a more targeted view.' The LLM misses this critical insight entirely, instead suggesting continued focus on 'network-wide growth' metrics. (5) ENTITY/METRIC ACCURACY: While the 2023 figure ($9.0T, 12% growth) is correct, the entire 2024 narrative is fabricated.

The LLM's 2023 figure ($4.3B) doesn't match either year in the ground truth. The LLM's 2024 figure ($5.2B) is actually the correct 2023 figure. This represents a complete inversion/misalignment of the data. (2) CALCULATION ERROR: The LLM calculates a $0.9B increase (20%), but using the correct ground truth numbers ($5.2B to $7.568B), the actual increase is $2.368B (≈45.5%), not $0.9B. (3) MAGNITUDE MISREPRESENTATION: The ground truth shows a 45.5% increase in equipment/compute hardware/software, indicating aggressive capital expenditure scaling. The LLM's reported 20% increase significantly understates the actual capital intensity of NVIDIA's strategy. (4) PARTIAL CREDIT FOR REASONING: The LLM correctly identifies that this represents acceleration in capex for AI/data-center strategy, which is qualitatively sound reasoning, but this cannot overcome the fundamental numerical errors.

By 2023, Schwab continued to update Estimated Current LTV ratios monthly using the same methodology, but expanded its disclosure to include detailed credit quality indicators that incorporated this metric, indicating a more comprehensive integration into credit reporting processes.

However, there are notable gaps in addressing the question's specific focus on 'evolution' and 'transformation': The ground truth emphasizes a meaningful evolution from 2022 to 2023, describing a shift from 'a monitored metric to a disclosed and detailed credit quality component' with 'expanded disclosure' and 'more comprehensive integration.' The LLM answer characterizes the change as merely a 'refinement' in presentation (splitting HELOC columns, clearer footnotes) while 'retaining the same monthly-update frequency and continued integration.' This framing misses the substantive evolution the ground truth identifies. The LLM correctly notes that the metric was used in credit quality stratification in both years, but understates the significance of the expanded disclosure and more detailed integration in 2023. The answer is factually sound on what remained constant (monthly updates, integration into credit reporting) but inadequately captures the qualitative evolution in how the metric was disclosed and utilized.

By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent had decreased to $19 million, down from $27 million at the start of the year, primarily due to a $7 million deduction with no write-offs and a $1 million reduction from foreign currency and other adjustments. This represents a significant decline in the noncurrent allowance over the two-year period, suggesting a reduced expectation of long-term credit losses or a strategic decision to tighten credit exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM’s non‑current allowance for credit losses was roughly $2.0 billion at the end of 2022 and remained essentially unchanged at about $2.0 billion at the end of 2024. The flat trend indicates that IBM’s exposure to long‑term credit risk has been stable over the period, with no material increase in expected losses on its longer‑dated receivables.",

      "detailed_feedback": "CRITICAL ERRORS - This answer is fundamentally incorrect on all quantitative dimensions. (1) WRONG NUMBERS: The LLM states the allowance was '$2.0 billion' in both 2022 and 2024, when the ground truth clearly shows $28 million in 2022 and $19 million in 2024. This is a massive error - off by a factor of approximately 70-100x. The LLM's numbers are completely fabricated and bear no relation to the actual data. (2) WRONG TREND: The LLM claims the allowance 'remained essentially unchanged' when the ground truth shows a significant decline from $28M to $19M (a 32% decrease). This is the opposite of what actually occurred. (3) MISSING DETAIL: The ground truth provides specific transaction details (additions of $6M in 2022, deductions of $7M in 2024, foreign currency adjustments, etc.) that the LLM completely omits. (4) INCORRECT INTERPRETATION: The LLM's conclusion that exposure is 'stable' contradicts the ground truth's assessment that the decline 'suggests a reduced expectation of long-term credit losses or a strategic decision to tighten credit exposure.' (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS FAILURE: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year evolution of this metric. The answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding or hallucination of the financial data.

      "question": "How did the presentation and disclosure of processed transactions evolve between Visa's 2022 and 2023 filings, particularly in terms of how they relate to revenue recognition and volume reporting?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Visa explicitly stated that net revenues were positively impacted by growth in processed transactions, along with payments volume and cross-border activity. The filing directly tied revenue changes to transaction metrics. In contrast, the 2023 filing shifted focus toward service revenue recognition based on prior-quarter nominal payments volume and included more granular details on how volume categories (e.g., consumer prepaid, Interlink, and cash volume) fed into reporting. The 2023 disclosure also introduced a lagged relationship between volume and revenue, and provided a more structured breakdown of the components of total nominal volume. This evolution indicates a more detailed and methodical approach to explaining how processed transactions influence revenue over time.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 10‑K Visa disclosed processed transactions in a three‑year table (2020‑2022) and explicitly noted that “the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues” while payments volume drives service revenue 【page_40】. The 2023 filing expands that disclosure by adding a 2024 column and a %‑change column, presenting the processed‑transactions table alongside the payments‑volume tables, and reiterating that “service revenue … is primarily assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter” and that processed transactions remain the key metric for data‑processing revenue 【page_44】.",

WEAKNESSES: (1) The answer focuses heavily on table formatting changes (adding 2024 column, %-change column) which are structural/presentational details but misses the substantive evolution in disclosure methodology; (2) Fails to adequately capture the shift from direct revenue impact statements in 2022 to the more 'granular details on how volume categories fed into reporting' mentioned in ground truth; (3) Does not address the 'more structured breakdown of components of total nominal volume' that the ground truth emphasizes as key to the evolution; (4) The answer reads more as a description of what changed in table presentation rather than explaining the conceptual evolution in how Visa disclosed the relationship between transactions and revenue recognition; (5) Missing discussion of the 'more detailed and methodical approach' that ground truth identifies as the key evolution. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer attempts to synthesize 2022 vs 2023 information but does so at a surface level (table format changes) rather than the deeper methodological evolution in disclosure practices. The ground truth emphasizes a shift toward more granular categorization and structured breakdown, which the LLM answer largely overlooks.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal provided a detailed breakdown of the components influencing transaction revenues, including variable and fixed fee structures, refund provisions, and specific additional fees for services like currency conversion and cross-border transactions. In 2023, the company shifted focus by emphasizing the disaggregation of revenue by geographical markets and revenue categories, offering less granular detail on the mechanics of transaction revenues. This indicates a shift in disclosure strategy from operational specifics to broader revenue segmentation.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 10‑K (Note 2, p. 80) PayPal described transaction revenue mainly as fees—fixed and variable—tied to total payment volume (TPV) and supplemented by ancillary fees for currency conversion, cross‑border, crypto and other services, with a brief note that incentives reduce revenue. By the 2023 10‑K (Notes 2‑77‑81 and the revenue‑disaggregation table on p. 78) the company kept the same gross‑basis, principal‑agent recognition but added extensive detail on contract characteristics (open‑ended, tiered/volume‑based pricing), the estimation of fee refunds, and the classification of incentives and protection‑program costs as revenue reductions, and it provided a geographic breakdown of transaction revenue, giving a much richer view of the factors driving that revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Payment Network contributed 11% to Mastercard's net revenue growth, reflecting its strong operational performance and a key role in driving revenue. By 2024, the Payment Network was fully integrated into the newly defined 'Payment Solutions' segment, which Mastercard now treats as its sole reportable operating segment. This shift indicates a strategic move toward unifying its payment network with value-added services under a single framework, emphasizing holistic payment solutions rather than distinguishing between core network operations and supplementary services. The consolidation of reporting and the repositioning of the Payment Network within a broader segment reflect a significant transformation in how Mastercard organizes and evaluates its core business performance.",

(1) PAYMENT NETWORK CONTRIBUTION TO GROWTH: The ground truth states the Payment Network contributed 11% to net revenue growth in 2023, but the LLM claims it was 'about 10%' - while close, this is presented as a different metric (contribution to growth vs. percentage of total revenue). More problematically, the LLM introduces unsupported data about 2022 (20%) and 2023 (10%) that is not mentioned in the ground truth. (2) REVENUE FIGURES: The LLM provides specific dollar amounts ($15.8bn, $25.1bn, $28.2bn) that are NOT present in the ground truth answer. These appear to be fabricated or from different sources not validated against the knowledge graph. The ground truth makes no mention of these specific revenue figures. (3) PERCENTAGE CALCULATION: The LLM claims $15.8bn represents '≈63% of the company's earnings' - this calculation is mathematically correct ($15.8/$25.1 ≈ 63%), but the ground truth does not provide these underlying numbers, suggesting the LLM is introducing unverified data. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM does correctly identify the 2024 integration into the Payment Solutions segment as the sole reportable operating segment, which aligns with the ground truth. However, this correct element is undermined by the numerous quantitative errors. (5) SEMANTIC ISSUES: The LLM's framing of 'relative contribution to growth has moderated' contradicts the ground truth's emphasis on the strategic shift toward integration and unification, not moderation of contribution. The ground truth emphasizes transformation in organizational structure, while the LLM emphasizes performance moderation - these are different narratives. STRENGTHS: The LLM correctly identifies the 2024 Payment Solutions segment consolidation and the CODM evaluation framework.

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All financial figures are correct - Document Cloud revenue of $1.97B (FY2021), $2.38B (FY2022), and $2.70B (FY2023) match ground truth exactly. Growth rates are accurate: 32% YoY for FY2021, approximately 21% for FY2022 (calculated as ($2.38B-$1.97B)/$1.97B = 20.8%, reasonably approximated as ≈21%), and 13% for FY2023 (($2.70B-$2.38B)/$2.38B = 13.4%, correctly stated as 13%). COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (1) how growth rate evolved (showing deceleration from 32% to 21% to 13%), and (2) what this indicates about contribution to overall revenue expansion (meaningful but gradually maturing contributor). MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly synthesized information across multiple fiscal years and drew appropriate conclusions about the trajectory and implications. ENTITY ACCURACY: All entities correctly identified (Document Cloud, Adobe, fiscal years 2021-2023).

QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY (3/10): The LLM provides specific numbers ($489M to $480M ABO decline, $90M to $62M AOCI loss) that are not present in the ground truth answer. While these numbers may be factually correct from the filing, they don't match the ground truth's focus on projected cash outflows ($70M in 2024 declining to $56M in 2028, cumulative $207M for 2029-2033). The LLM's numbers cannot be verified against the provided ground truth. COMPLETENESS (4/10): The question asks about how funding obligations 'evolved' and what this indicates about 'long-term pension liability management.' The ground truth provides a clear evolution narrative (asset allocation targets in 2022, projected cash outflows in 2023 showing decreasing trend) and explicitly states what this indicates (strategic reduction in near-term liabilities, improved funding status). The LLM provides accumulated benefit obligation and AOCI changes but doesn't address the asset allocation targets or projected cash outflow trends that form the core of the ground truth answer. ENTITY/METRIC ACCURACY (5/10): The LLM correctly identifies the U.S. Defined Benefit plan and Texas Instruments. However, it focuses on accumulated benefit obligations (ABO) and AOCI losses rather than the projected cash outflows and asset allocation targets that are central to the ground truth. These are different metrics measuring different aspects of pension liability. REASONING QUALITY (5/10): The LLM's reasoning about pension management (contributions, investment performance, actuarial adjustments improving funded status) is logically sound, but it doesn't synthesize the specific multi-hop information required: the evolution from 2022 asset allocation targets to 2023 projected cash flows. The conclusion about 'improved funded status' is reasonable but not directly supported by the specific data points in the ground truth. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE (4/10): While both answers discuss pension liability management, they address fundamentally different metrics and time horizons. The ground truth focuses on projected future cash flows (2024-2033) and asset allocation strategy, while the LLM focuses on historical ABO and AOCI changes.

In 2024, the filing explicitly outlined the roles of The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, National Association, specifying that the former houses Securities Services businesses including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services, and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, while the latter focuses on Wealth Management and certain Pershing business activities. This represents a shift from a general listing of subsidiaries in 2023 to a more detailed segmentation of responsibilities and strategic focus areas in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 Form 10‑K the company only referenced its two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries in an exhibit list (see Exhibit 21.1 on page 20) and did not provide a narrative on how their businesses were divided. By the 2024 filing, BNY explicitly split the functions: the New York‑state‑chartered Bank of New York Mellon now houses securities‑services businesses (asset servicing, issuer services) and certain market‑and‑wealth services such as treasury, clearance and collateral management and bank‑advised investment management, while BNY Mellon, N.A., a national bank, is dedicated to the wealth‑management business and Pershing activities (page 7). This reflects a shift toward a clearer, function‑specific structure for the two subsidiaries in 2024.",

Strengths: (1) Correctly identifies the 2023 filing approach (Exhibit 21.1 reference without detailed narrative) and contrasts it with 2024's explicit functional breakdown. (2) Accurately names both subsidiaries: The Bank of New York Mellon (state-chartered) and BNY Mellon, National Association (national bank). (3) Correctly specifies the business divisions: Securities Services (Asset Servicing, Issuer Services) and Market and Wealth Services for the former; Wealth Management and Pershing for the latter. (4) Provides additional operational details (treasury, clearance, collateral management, bank-advised investment management) that enhance understanding while remaining consistent with ground truth. (5) Correctly identifies the structural shift from general listing to function-specific segmentation. (6) Properly cites page references (page 20 for 2023 exhibit, page 7 for 2024 details). Minor observation: The LLM provides slightly more granular operational details than the ground truth (e.g., specific treasury and clearance functions), but these are consistent with and supportive of the core finding.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GDV was reported with a focus on the impact of currency translation and transactional currency, specifically highlighting that GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4% compared to 11.9% on a local currency basis versus 2022. In 2024, the presentation of GDV became more standardized, with an explicit statement that U.S. dollar-converted GDV figures are calculated using quarterly average exchange rates, and the emphasis shifted to reporting period-over-period growth rates based on local currency data to eliminate currency fluctuation effects. The 2024 disclosure formalized the methodology and removed specific comparative growth figures, suggesting a more methodological and consistent approach to GDV reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 filing still calculates GDV by converting each local‑currency spend amount to U.S. dollars (and euros) using the average exchange rate for the quarter, the same methodology disclosed in the 2023 filing 【page_55†L31-L38】【page_53†L31-L38】.  However, the 2024 filing now presents GDV growth side‑by‑side on both a U.S.‑dollar‑converted basis and a local‑currency basis: GDV grew 8.1% on the USD‑converted basis and 10.5% on the local‑currency basis versus 2023, whereas in 2023 it had risen 10.6% on the USD‑converted basis and 12.2% on the local‑currency basis versus 2022 【page_53†L43-L48】.

The LLM claims the company had TWO separate references in 2022 (one under 'Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports' and another under 'Additional Information') and then CONSOLIDATED to one reference in 2024. This directly contradicts the ground truth's assertion of consistent structural reference across both years.

(2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: No numeric values are involved in this question, so this dimension is not applicable, but the answer correctly references the exhibit number (21.1) and the filing method descriptor ('Filed herewith'). (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: The answer correctly identifies The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (implied through context), the correct exhibit number (21.1), the correct years (2022 and 2024), and the correct metric (filing method/disclosure approach).

The 2023 filing repeats the same language, again positioning disciplined capital allocation as a core element of the free‑cash‑flow‑per‑share strategy and noting continued investment and shareholder returns【page_20】. Thus, the emphasis on capital‑allocation discipline has remained consistent from 2022 to 2023, continuing to be a central driver of free cash flow per share.",

INCOMPLETE FISCAL 2023 ANALYSIS: The ground truth states that by fiscal 2023, the Core Routing portfolio 'continued to grow, contributing to an overall 18% increase in the Networking product category.' The LLM answer stops at fiscal 2022 analysis and does not adequately describe the fiscal 2023 performance or the 18% growth metric.\n\n2.

The LLM answer only mentions the Cisco 8000 Series and does not mention SD-WAN or IoT routing offerings at all.\n\n3. INCOMPLETE EVOLUTION NARRATIVE: The ground truth explicitly states the portfolio evolved 'from maintaining stability in revenue during fiscal 2022 to actively driving growth in fiscal 2023.' The LLM answer focuses primarily on fiscal 2022 stability and does not adequately characterize the transition to active growth in fiscal 2023.\n\n4.

Ground truth states equipment, compute hardware, and software increased from $4,303 million (2023) to $7,568 million (2024). The LLM reports $4.303 billion to $5.200 billion - the 2024 figure is dramatically incorrect ($5.2B vs. $7.568B, a difference of $2.368 billion or 31% understatement). The LLM also provides a total gross property-and-equipment figure ($6.5B to $7.4B) that wasn't requested and appears to conflate different line items. CALCULATION ERROR: The LLM calculates the increase as $0.9 billion, but even using their own incorrect numbers ($5.2B - $4.303B = $0.897B ≈ $0.9B), this is mathematically consistent with their stated figures. However, the actual increase should be $7,568M - $4,303M = $3,265 million, which the LLM completely misses. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly identifies the strategic implication (capital spending acceleration for AI/data-center businesses) and attempts to synthesize the information, but this reasoning is undermined by the fundamental numerical errors. The qualitative assessment of capital expenditure strategy is reasonable but built on incorrect data.

(2) Percentage decline calculation is accurate: ($5.3B - $3.6B) / $5.3B = 33.96%, correctly rounded to 33%. (3) Revenue contribution percentages (23% in 2023, 14% in 2024) are reasonable estimates and demonstrate understanding of relative segment importance. Multi-hop reasoning: The answer successfully synthesizes information across multiple sources (page_70 for revenue figures, page_46-47 for causal factors), correctly identifying customer inventory normalization as the primary driver of the decline. Entity accuracy is perfect - correctly identifies AMD, the Embedded segment, and the correct fiscal years (2023 vs 2024). The answer goes beyond the ground truth by providing additional context (percentage of total revenue) and explicitly citing source pages, which adds credibility. The explanation of 'less favorable revenue mix' demonstrates deeper understanding of the business impact. Minor note: The ground truth states 'exact figures are not provided in the excerpt' for 2023, but the LLM correctly identifies the $5.3B figure, suggesting the LLM had access to more complete source material. This is not an error but rather more complete information. The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: (1) how the segment evolved (revenue decline from $5.3B to $3.6B, percentage contribution drop from ~23% to ~14%), and (2) what factors contributed (customer inventory normalization).

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2023 net periodic benefit credit of $7 million; (2) Accurately reports all projected future benefit payment amounts ($25M in 2025, $24M in 2026, $23M in 2027, $21M in 2028-2029, $92M for 2030-2034); (3) Properly identifies the company as Texas Instruments; (4) Appropriately notes the shift from 2023 credit to future obligations; (5) Provides additional context about AOCI balance changes. WEAKNESSES: (1) The ground truth states 2024 projected liabilities of $25M for 2025 decreasing to $21M by 2029, but the LLM provides more granular year-by-year breakdown ($25M, $24M, $23M, $21M each in 2028-2029). While these numbers are consistent with a declining trajectory, the ground truth's phrasing suggests a simpler characterization; (2) The LLM notes 'the 2024 filing does not give a new net-periodic-benefit-cost figure' which is accurate but represents a slight deviation from the ground truth's framing of 'the company projected future liabilities for U.S. Retiree Health Care to be $25 million for 2025.' The LLM correctly interprets these as projected benefit payments rather than new net periodic costs; (3) The AOCI discussion, while contextually relevant and accurate, goes slightly beyond what the ground truth emphasizes. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All dollar amounts match ground truth values. The year-by-year breakdown provided by LLM is more detailed than ground truth but not contradictory.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BNY Mellon reported $47.8 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration, with the Market and Wealth Services segment operating through BNY Mellon SA/NV in continental Europe, covering branches in major European financial centers. By 2024, total assets under custody and/or administration increased to $52.1 trillion, indicating growth in the scale of the Market and Wealth Services segment. The international presence remained consistent, with BNY SA/NV continuing to operate in the same European locations, focusing on global custody, asset servicing, and collateral management. This represents a quantitative increase in asset scale without structural or geographic changes, suggesting organic growth within the existing international framework.",
      "llm_answer": "By 2024 BNY Mellon’s Market and Wealth Services segment had sharpened its global focus: the European subsidiary BNY Mellon SA/NV continued to operate a broad branch network across Europe, and the share of staff outside the United States rose to roughly 60 % (up from about 55 % in 2023) (page 9, 2024 vs. 2023).  At the same time, the segment’s custody platform expanded from $47.8 trillion of assets under custody in 2023 to $52.1 trillion in 2024, reflecting a larger international scale (page 7, 2023 vs. 2024).",

The company name (BNY Mellon SA/NV) and geographic focus (Europe) are correct. The answer appropriately addresses both international presence and asset custody scale as requested. WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM introduces new information about staff percentages (60% outside US in 2024, up from 55% in 2023) that is NOT present in the ground truth answer. While this may be factually accurate from the filings, it represents information beyond what the knowledge graph provided and creates potential verification issues. (2) The LLM characterizes the evolution as a 'sharpened global focus' and mentions 'larger international scale,' which are interpretive framings not explicitly stated in the ground truth. The ground truth specifically notes 'organic growth within the existing international framework' with 'no structural or geographic changes,' suggesting stability rather than sharpening of focus. (3) The answer lacks the ground truth's explicit statement that 'international presence remained consistent' and that geographic/structural changes did NOT occur - instead implying more dynamic evolution. CALCULATION VERIFICATION: The asset custody figures are correct ($47.8T to $52.1T represents approximately 9% growth), and the percentage increase in international staff (55% to 60%) is mathematically plausible. However, these staff metrics are not validated against the ground truth source. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information about both international presence (BNY SA/NV operations) and asset scale (custody figures), but the interpretation diverges from the ground truth's emphasis on consistency and organic growth. The answer reads as more dynamic/strategic shift than the ground truth suggests.",

The numbers match the ground truth exactly with proper percentage formatting. (2) COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question: it identifies the performance factors for both periods, compares them, and explains what the change indicates about equity award outcomes.

(4) REASONING: The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the model correctly connects the numerical change (110.8% to 147.5%) to the business implication (improved performance relative to targets leading to larger multipliers and more generous outcomes). The logic that a higher performance factor indicates better company performance is correct. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM answer conveys the same information as the ground truth, using slightly different but equivalent phrasing ('larger multiplier on vested Performance Shares' vs 'improvement in equity award outcomes').

The LLM claims FY2023 was ~$114 million loss and FY2024 was ~$12 million gain - these are entirely different figures with different magnitudes and signs. (2) WRONG INTERPRETATION: The ground truth clearly shows NEGATIVE values in both years ($(595)M and $(583)M), indicating losses/adverse impacts in both periods. The LLM incorrectly characterizes FY2024 as a 'gain' when the ground truth shows it remained negative. (3) INCORRECT ANALYSIS: The LLM's conclusion that pension items 'became far less volatile and less of a drag' is contradicted by the ground truth, which shows a marginal improvement from $(595)M to $(583)M - a reduction in negative impact, not a shift from loss to gain. (4) WRONG METHODOLOGY: The LLM appears to be breaking down OCI activity and reclassifications into separate components ($96M, $18M, $8M, $20M) rather than reporting the consolidated 'Pension and Other' OCI line item values. This suggests the LLM is looking at different data or misinterpreting the structure of the OCI statement.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company allocated just over $15 billion to capital expenditures over a 10-year period from 2014 to 2023. By 2024, this allocation had increased to about $20 billion over the 10-year period from 2015 to 2024, indicating a strategic increase in investment to support future revenue growth as a component of free cash flow per share growth.",

The calculated difference of $5 billion is accurate ($20B - $15B = $5B). The company is correctly identified as Texas Instruments. The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer synthesizes information from two separate filings (2023 and 2024) and correctly compares the evolution of capital expenditure allocation across the two time periods. The answer properly contextualizes the capex allocation as supporting 'future revenue growth' and 'free-cash-flow-per-share growth,' which aligns with the ground truth's characterization of this as 'a strategic increase in investment to support future revenue growth as a component of free cash flow per share growth.' The inclusion of page references adds credibility. Minor note: The LLM uses slightly more detailed phrasing ('roughly a $5 billion increase') compared to ground truth's simpler statement of 'increase,' but this is a semantic enhancement rather than an error.

By year‑end 2024 those losses had risen to about **$10.1 billion** (Table 3.1, page 158).

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURE: The LLM states 2023 gross unrealized losses were 'roughly $9.2 billion' when the actual figure is $9,156 million ($9.156 billion) - this is approximately correct in rounding. However, the 2024 figure is stated as '$10.1 billion' when the ground truth shows $9,152 million ($9.152 billion). This is a massive error of approximately $950 million or 10.4% overstatement. The LLM incorrectly claims losses 'had risen' when they actually slightly decreased from $9,156M to $9,152M. (2) DIRECTIONAL ERROR: The LLM's core conclusion is inverted - it states losses 'had risen' and increased exposure to market declines, when the ground truth explicitly states the figure 'slightly increased' numerically but actually decreased (9,156 to 9,152). The LLM misread the direction of change. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING: While the LLM attempted to synthesize information across years and draw conclusions about market exposure, the synthesis is based on incorrect numbers, making the entire logical chain invalid. (4) SEMANTIC ISSUES: The LLM's interpretation that rising losses indicate 'greater sensitivity to adverse interest-rate and credit-market movements' is reasonable analysis, but it's built on false premises. The ground truth indicates losses remained 'largely significant' but essentially flat year-over-year. (5) TABLE REFERENCES: The LLM cites specific tables and pages (Table 2.1 page 149, Table 3.1 page 158) which cannot be verified but appear to be fabricated or misread given the incorrect numbers.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Accenture highlighted that many of its consulting contracts were less than 12 months in duration and could be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, posing a risk to revenue predictability. Additionally, the company noted that delays or reductions in client spending—especially under existing contracts—could materially affect results, particularly in geographic markets or service lines where a small number of clients contributed significantly to revenue. By 2024, the focus of client spending risk had evolved to emphasize broader operational vulnerabilities, including global disruptions such as geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, and infrastructure failures. These risks, combined with Accenture's global delivery model's concentration in India and the Philippines, introduced new layers of unpredictability in maintaining consistent client spending and service delivery. While contract flexibility remained a concern, the 2024 filing expanded the risk profile to include external macro-operational factors, indicating a shift in how client spending volatility could impact the company.",
      "llm_answer": "In its 2022 filing Accenture warned that most consulting contracts are short‑term (often < 12 months) and can be ended with as little as 30 days’ notice, and that clients can delay, reduce or cancel spend, leaving revenue highly sensitive to client‑driven timing decisions【page_18】. By the 2024 filing the company says it is shifting to larger, longer‑term, performance‑linked engagements—often with early‑termination charges and milestone‑based fees—so client flexibility is reduced but revenue becomes more dependent on meeting performance targets and the successful execution of complex projects【page_27】.",

This directly contradicts the ground truth, which states that while contract flexibility remained a concern, the 2024 filing expanded risk focus to external macro-operational factors (geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, infrastructure failures, concentration in India/Philippines). The ground truth does NOT indicate a shift toward longer-term contracts or reduced flexibility. (2) MISSING KEY ELEMENTS: The LLM completely omits the critical 2024 evolution regarding global disruptions, geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, and infrastructure failures as new layers of unpredictability. It also fails to mention the concentration risk in India and Philippines delivery model. (3) MISCHARACTERIZATION: The LLM presents a narrative of improvement/risk reduction ('client flexibility is reduced') that is not supported by the ground truth. The ground truth indicates risks evolved and expanded, not diminished. (4) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The 2022 facts about <12 months contracts and 30 days' notice are correct, but the 2024 characterization is fundamentally wrong. (5) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: The LLM failed to properly synthesize the evolution of risk disclosure across the two years. It created a false narrative of contract structure changes rather than identifying the actual shift from contract-specific risks to broader operational/macro risks.

This is a massive discrepancy - the LLM's numbers are approximately 3.8x to 7.9x higher than actual values. The $400 million increase claimed by the LLM is also completely wrong; the actual change was a $164 million DECREASE (from $418M to $254M). (2) DIRECTIONAL ERROR - The LLM concludes credit risk exposure GREW, when the ground truth explicitly states it DECREASED consistently over the period.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Express described Discount Revenue as being internally allocated using a transfer pricing methodology across business segments, with specific breakdowns for issuer, network, and acquirer components. This treatment emphasized internal financial structuring and did not highlight external risks to Discount Revenue. By 2024, the focus had transformed significantly, with Discount Revenue now being described in the context of external risks, including exposure to the airline industry, which accounted for 7% of worldwide billed business. The filing explicitly stated that financial distress or operational failures in such industries could negatively impact Discount Revenue and overall financial performance. This marks a shift from purely internal allocation to a broader concern over external risk exposure affecting revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K the company explained that discount revenue is not a “raw” line‑item but is allocated to its reportable segments through a transfer‑pricing methodology – the issuer component is assigned to the Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG) and Global Consumer Services (GCS) segments, while the network/acquirer component is assigned to the Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS) segment. By the 2024 filing the discussion of discount revenue still focuses on it as a core revenue source, but the emphasis has shifted to an external concentration risk: airline merchants now represent roughly 7 % of worldwide billed business, meaning that discount‑revenue earnings are materially exposed to the performance of the airline industry.

In 2024, however, the total revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased to $17,766 million from $15,563 million in 2023.

The calculated increase of ~$2.2 billion is accurate ($17.766B - $15.563B = $2.203B). The asset management fee increase is correctly stated as ~$1.9 billion ($13.875B - $12.002B = $1.873B). The brokerage fee increase is correctly stated as ~$0.33 billion ($3.891B - $3.561B = $0.330B). WEAKNESSES: The LLM answer is INCOMPLETE regarding the multi-part nature of the question. The original question asks about evolution 'between 2023 and 2024' (implying both years) and 'key components driving this change.' The ground truth explicitly mentions that 2023 saw a DECLINE of $338 million, which is a critical contextual component. The LLM only addresses 2024 growth and completely omits the 2023 decline and its drivers (lower transactional revenue, asset management fees, AUM declines, pricing pressures, and lower market valuations). This represents a significant gap in addressing the full scope of the question about how revenue 'evolved' across both years. The answer provides accurate forward-looking data but fails to capture the complete narrative of the segment's performance trajectory. The multi-hop synthesis is therefore incomplete - it should have connected both years' performance to show the full evolution from decline to recovery.",

This indicates a significant decrease in revenue from licensing arrangements over the two-year period. The decline suggests that AMD may have experienced a reduction in royalty income or milestone payments from its intellectual property agreements, such as those with the THATIC JV, which were previously a source of licensing gain.",

This is a critical factual error that reverses the meaning entirely. (2) INCORRECT 2023 DATA - The LLM introduces a 2023 figure of $34 million loss, which is not mentioned in the ground truth or the original question. The question specifically asks about 2022 to 2024 evolution, and the ground truth only provides 2022 ($102M gain) and 2024 ($48M gain) data. (3) INCORRECT 2024 FIGURE - The LLM correctly states $48 million for 2024, but incorrectly labels it as a 'loss' when it should be a 'gain' based on the ground truth. (4) FLAWED REASONING - The LLM's interpretation that 'shrinking loss indicates improvement' is logically sound IF the numbers were losses, but since these are gains (not losses), the reasoning is built on a false premise. The correct interpretation is that licensing gains decreased from $102M to $48M, indicating a decline in IP licensing revenue. (5) MISSING CONTEXT - The LLM fails to mention the THATIC JV reference provided in the ground truth, which gives important context about the source of these licensing arrangements. The answer fundamentally mischaracterizes the financial data by inverting gains to losses, introduces unsupported 2023 data, and reaches incorrect conclusions about the company's IP licensing performance.",

This calculation error compounds the initial data errors. (3) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: While the LLM correctly identifies that this involves comparing 2023 and 2024 10-K filings and synthesizes the information appropriately in structure, the underlying data is wrong, making the synthesis fundamentally flawed. (4) QUALITATIVE REASONING: The interpretation that the change indicates 'a more responsive and refined loss-reserve estimation process' is reasonable and aligns with the ground truth's assessment that it reflects 'improved claims resolution or a change in actuarial assumptions,' but this correct reasoning cannot overcome the factual errors in the numbers.

Management emphasized TPV growth and the number of payment transactions as key indicators of platform strength and customer engagement. In 2023, PayPal provided a more detailed geographic breakdown of revenues, categorizing transaction revenues by primary geographical markets, although specific dollar amounts or percentages by region were not disclosed in the provided excerpt.

The citations to page numbers and filing years (2022 and 2023 10-Ks) appear reasonable. INCORRECT ELEMENTS: The LLM's interpretation that the 2023 filing 'no longer calls out installed-base growth' and that this represents a reduction in emphasis contradicts the ground truth, which explicitly states installed base growth 'remained a key factor' in 2023. The ground truth indicates an EVOLUTION THROUGH ADDITION (AI added to existing factors), not a REPLACEMENT (installed base removed). The LLM fundamentally misread the evolution as a de-emphasis rather than an augmentation. This represents a major reasoning error in synthesizing the multi-hop comparison between 2022 and 2023 descriptions.

      "question": "How did PayPal's Right-of-Use (ROU) lease assets evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's leasing strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that ROU lease assets were being measured at fair value due to impairment charges that occurred in 2020, with impairment losses calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data. By 2024, PayPal's ROU lease assets had increased significantly to $599 million for operating leases and $73 million for finance leases as of December 31, 2024, up from $390 million for operating leases in 2023 (no finance leases reported then). This indicates a notable expansion in PayPal's leasing activities, particularly in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term commitments and potentially more capital-intensive operations.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal’s right‑of‑use (ROU) lease portfolio expanded markedly. After adding $131 million of operating‑lease ROU assets in 2022 (netting a $79 million increase after a $52 million offset), the company held $390 million of ROU assets at year‑end 2023, and by year‑end 2024 that rose to $672 million (operating $599 million + finance $73 million) driven by $343 million of new operating‑lease assets and $82 million of new finance‑lease assets (page 79). The jump, especially the new finance‑lease component, shows PayPal is increasingly using both operating and finance leases to fund office, data‑center and equipment needs, preserving cash and adding flexibility to its asset base.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer demonstrates strong factual accuracy with correct identification of key financial metrics and years. Quantitative verification: (1) 2024 ROU assets of $599M operating + $73M finance = $672M total is correct; (2) 2023 operating lease of $390M is correct; (3) The increases cited ($343M new operating-lease assets, $82M new finance-lease assets) appear reasonable and internally consistent with the year-over-year changes. The answer correctly identifies the multi-hop synthesis: comparing 2022→2023→2024 progression and noting the strategic shift toward finance leases. The LLM provides additional context about 2022 ($131M addition with $79M net increase after $52M offset) that goes beyond the ground truth but appears consistent with filing data. Minor differences from ground truth: (1) The ground truth emphasizes 2022 impairment measurement methodology and fair value accounting, which the LLM omits—this is a contextual detail about accounting treatment rather than a factual error; (2) The ground truth notes 'no finance leases reported' in 2023, while the LLM focuses on the 2024 emergence of finance leases, which is semantically equivalent. The LLM's interpretation of the strategic shift (cash preservation, flexibility, funding office/data-center/equipment needs) is reasonable and well-reasoned, though slightly more speculative than the ground truth's more measured 'strategic shift toward longer-term commitments.' All core numbers are accurate, calculations check out, and the multi-hop reasoning across years is sound. The answer is comprehensive and directly addresses the question about evolution and strategic implications.",

      "question": "How has the valuation methodology and disclosure around Texas Instruments' nonmarketable investments evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of measurement basis and risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, measured at cost with no changes mentioned during the year. The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2023 and 2024 Form 10‑K describe non‑marketable investments as “other investments” that are **measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments** – they are not carried at fair value and are reported under the “Other measurement basis” line (the amount fell from $5 million in 2023 to $4 million in 2024). The risk‑concentration discussion continues to focus on credit risk for cash, cash equivalents, short‑term investments and accounts receivable, with **no specific risk‑exposure disclosure added for non‑marketable securities**, so the risk‑exposure narrative remains essentially unchanged.",

      "detailed_feedback": "STRENGTHS: The LLM correctly identifies the measurement basis (cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments) for both years, which matches the ground truth. The answer appropriately notes that these are not carried at fair value. The observation about risk-exposure disclosure remaining essentially unchanged is reasonable and supported by the ground truth statement that 2024 included 'a broader discussion of counterparty risk' but the LLM's claim of 'no specific risk-exposure disclosure added for non-marketable securities' is a valid interpretation.\n\nWEAKNESSES: (1) QUANTITATIVE ERROR - The LLM states the amount 'fell from $5 million in 2023 to $4 million in 2024,' but the ground truth explicitly states 2023 was $5 million with no mention of a 2024 value change. The LLM introduces a $4 million figure for 2024 that is not confirmed in the ground truth, representing a potential factual error. (2) INCOMPLETE DISCLOSURE EVOLUTION - The ground truth emphasizes that 2024 'expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments...include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities.' The LLM fails to capture this important evolution in disclosure scope and detail about the composition of these investments. (3) MISSING CONTEXT - The ground truth notes the 2023 disclosure was 'limited to a brief mention within a table,' while 2024 provided more comprehensive explanation. The LLM doesn't adequately convey this evolution in disclosure comprehensiveness. (4) RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSPARENCY - The ground truth mentions 'a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency,' but the LLM's statement that risk-exposure narrative 'remains essentially unchanged' contradicts the ground truth's emphasis on expanded counterparty risk discussion in 2024.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM attempts to synthesize information across two years but fails to fully capture the evolution narrative that is central to the question. The comparison between years is incomplete and potentially inaccurate regarding the $4 million 2024 figure.\n\nCALCULATION/NUMERIC VERIFICATION: The $5 million 2023 figure is correct. The $4 million 2024 figure cannot be verified from the ground truth and appears to be an error or unsupported claim. This is a critical quantitative accuracy issue.",

      "question": "How has the nature of the risks associated with Qualcomm's investments in new product areas evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of potential financial impact and strategic challenges?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm highlighted that investments in new product areas might not generate expected operating income or contribute to future results of operations as anticipated, emphasizing the risk of underperformance of R&D and other investments. By 2024, the risk evolved to include more specific concerns about financial exposure, such as the potential for significant costs and asset impairments if new technologies fail to succeed in the market in the anticipated time frames. Additionally, 2024 introduced heightened strategic challenges, including the need to meet customer ESG-related targets (e.g., 2040 net-zero global GHG emissions commitment) and the necessity to transition to new business models to support expansion beyond mobile handsets. These changes indicate a broader and more financially impactful risk profile compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Qualcomm’s “new‑initiatives” risk was framed broadly – the company warned that its research, development and other investments in new product areas “may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations” (2022‑4). By the 2024 filing the risk narrative has become far more detailed, highlighting concrete strategic challenges such as competitors’ superior or cheaper technologies, long automotive design‑in cycles and stringent ESG‑related customer requirements, the need to adopt new business models, and the possibility of costly acquisition failures or asset‑impairment charges that could depress revenue, margins, cash flow and the stock price (2024‑20, 2024‑21, 2024‑22).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer demonstrates strong overall accuracy and effectively addresses the multi-hop question about how Qualcomm's investment risks evolved from 2022 to 2024. STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2022 risk framing focused on R&D investments potentially not generating expected operating income or contributing to future results - this matches the ground truth characterization. (2) Accurately captures the 2024 evolution toward more specific and detailed risk concerns, including asset impairments, acquisition failures, and financial impacts on revenue, margins, and cash flow. (3) Properly synthesizes the strategic challenges introduced in 2024, including ESG requirements (customer ESG targets), new business models, and competitive/automotive design-in challenges. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound - comparing 2022 vs 2024 across multiple dimensions (financial impact, strategic challenges, specificity of risks). (5) Uses appropriate citations (2022-4, 2024-20, 2024-21, 2024-22) suggesting proper source documentation. MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM answer doesn't explicitly mention the 2040 net-zero global GHG emissions commitment that appears in the ground truth, though it does reference 'ESG-related customer requirements' which captures the essence. (2) The phrasing 'new-initiatives' risk is slightly different from how the ground truth frames it, though semantically equivalent. (3) The answer could have been slightly more explicit about the 'broader and more financially impactful risk profile' characterization mentioned in ground truth, though this is implied. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: No specific numbers or calculations are required for this qualitative question, so this dimension is less critical. The dates (2022, 2024) are correct. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM answer conveys the same essential information as the ground truth - that risks evolved from general underperformance concerns to more specific financial and strategic challenges.

By 2024, the company continued to disclose GDV but shifted its presentation to focus on a chart of GDV and number of cards for select programs and solutions, without explicitly stating the new growth percentage. The change in reporting format suggests an evolution in how the company communicates GDV performance, though the exact quantitative growth figure for 2024 is not provided.

(1) FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The ground truth explicitly states that 'the exact quantitative growth figure for 2024 is not provided' and that MA 'shifted its presentation to focus on a chart of GDV and number of cards for select programs and solutions, without explicitly stating the new growth percentage.' The LLM claims a specific 11% figure for 2024, which is not supported by the ground truth. (2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURE: The LLM provides a precise 11% growth rate for 2024 that does not exist in the source material according to the ground truth. The calculation of a 10 percentage point decline (21% to 11%) is mathematically correct IF both numbers were valid, but the 11% figure is fabricated. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: The LLM failed to recognize the key insight from the ground truth - that there was a CHANGE IN REPORTING FORMAT, not a simple numerical comparison. The ground truth emphasizes that 2024 reporting shifted away from explicit growth percentages. (4) SEMANTIC MISMATCH: The ground truth describes 'a transformation in the way GDV is disclosed, rather than a clear increase or decrease,' but the LLM presents this as a straightforward numerical decline.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Visa did not disclose any specific charge related to Lease Consolidation Costs. However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2024 filing Visa added a separate line for “Lease consolidation costs” – a $57 million charge recorded in general‑and‑administrative expense and excluded from its non‑GAAP results. The 2023 filing did not show a distinct lease‑consolidation line, treating any related expense as part of broader categories. This shift to isolate and disclose the one‑time lease‑consolidation charge demonstrates Visa’s move toward more granular, transparent GAAP reporting so that non‑recurring items can be clearly identified and excluded from performance metrics.",

MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The LLM adds interpretive language about 'more granular, transparent GAAP reporting' which goes slightly beyond the ground truth statement of 'shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses' - this is reasonable inference but adds interpretation not explicitly in ground truth; (2) The phrase 'so that non-recurring items can be clearly identified and excluded from performance metrics' is accurate and well-reasoned, though the ground truth uses simpler language ('explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics'). QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: The $57 million figure is specific and appears accurate based on the LLM's citation. The fiscal year references (2023 vs 2024) are correct.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan had a broad equity investment range of 0% to 40%, indicating a potentially conservative investment strategy. By 2024, the company projected increasing annual benefit payments starting at $85 million in 2025, rising to $92 million in 2029, with a total of $476 million expected from 2030 to 2034. This reflects a shift toward greater financial commitment and confidence in the plan's funding, contrasting with the earlier cautious investment posture.",

By year‑end 2024 the obligations had fallen to $1.47 billion while assets were $1.708 billion, and the net actuarial loss narrowed to $113 million 【page_46】—a reduction in both the liability and the actuarial shortfall that signals an improved funded position. The company also increased the discount rate applied to the plan to 3.76% (from 3.28% in 2023) and raised the assumed long‑term return on plan assets to 4.28% (from 3.50%), further supporting a more positive funding outlook 【page_47】【page_46】.",

CRITICAL ISSUES: (1) The LLM focuses on accumulated benefit obligations, plan assets, actuarial losses, and discount rate changes—none of which appear in the ground truth answer. (2) The ground truth specifically mentions: equity investment range of 0-40% in 2023, projected annual benefit payments starting at $85M in 2025, rising to $92M in 2029, and $476M total from 2030-2034. The LLM answer completely omits these key metrics. (3) The LLM's numbers ($1.67B obligations, $1.866B assets, $169M loss in 2023; $1.47B obligations, $1.708B assets, $113M loss in 2024) cannot be verified against the ground truth and appear to be from different disclosure sections. (4) The LLM correctly identifies a shift toward improved funding outlook (both answers suggest positive evolution), but the supporting evidence is entirely different. (5) The ground truth emphasizes a shift from 'cautious investment posture' to 'greater financial commitment and confidence' based on projected benefit payment schedules. The LLM emphasizes improved funded position based on liability reduction and assumption changes. These represent different analytical perspectives on the same plan. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM failed to synthesize the specific forward-looking benefit payment projections that are central to the ground truth answer. Instead, it provided backward-looking balance sheet analysis.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.'

By 2024, the language evolved to emphasize not only the continuation of these risks but also the broader financial implications, such as materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. While the core risk remained consistent, the framing in 2024 suggests a heightened awareness and potential escalation in the severity of consequences, indicating an increased exposure or at least a more explicitly communicated risk posture.",

The 2024 Form 10‑K repeats the same language, showing that the exposure to such fees or fines has remained essentially unchanged【page_18】.

Ground truth states that language 'evolved' from 2022 to 2024 with 'heightened awareness and potential escalation in severity,' while the LLM claims the exposure 'remained essentially unchanged' and 'repeats the same language.' This is a major factual error on the central question about how exposure evolved. The LLM explicitly states 'the filings do not indicate a heightened or reduced exposure,' which directly contradicts the ground truth's conclusion about heightened awareness and escalation. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies the 2022 and 2024 timeframes and accurately describes the 2022 risks (fees, fines, transaction costs, loss of card processing ability). However, it fails to capture the 2024 evolution that includes 'materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition' - these broader implications are missing from the LLM answer. QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The LLM failed to synthesize the key difference between the two years: while the core risk remained, the 2024 framing explicitly broadened the scope of potential consequences. The LLM's conclusion that language 'repeats the same' misses the semantic evolution in how Apple communicated the risk's implications. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses the basic structure of the question but fails to properly answer the core inquiry about how exposure 'evolved' - it incorrectly concludes no evolution occurred. The implications for financial risk profile are mentioned but understate the significance of the broader consequences articulated in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, while in fiscal 2024, this proportion increased to 37%. This indicates a continued upward trend in Oracle's cloud adoption and a strategic shift toward cloud-based offerings as a core revenue driver.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle’s cloud‑services share of total revenue grew from ≈ 32 % in fiscal 2023 to ≈ 37 % in fiscal 2024—a 5‑percentage‑point increase【page_8】. This rise shows that a larger portion of Oracle’s earnings is now coming from cloud offerings, indicating accelerating customer adoption of its cloud services.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer demonstrates strong accuracy and completeness. (1) QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All numbers are correct - cloud services revenues were 32% of total revenues in fiscal 2023 and 37% in fiscal 2024, with the calculated 5-percentage-point increase being accurate. The use of the ≈ symbol is appropriate given potential rounding in source data. (2) ENTITY ACCURACY: Oracle is correctly identified, fiscal years 2023 and 2024 are correct, and cloud services revenues metric is properly specified. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes the comparison across two fiscal years and correctly interprets the trend as indicating accelerating cloud adoption. The logic is sound - a growing proportion of revenues from cloud services does indicate strategic shift and customer adoption trends. (4) COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (a) how the proportion evolved (32% to 37%), and (b) what this indicates about cloud adoption trends (accelerating adoption, larger earnings share from cloud). (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's phrasing 'larger portion of Oracle's earnings is now coming from cloud offerings' and 'accelerating customer adoption' conveys the same meaning as the ground truth's 'continued upward trend' and 'strategic shift toward cloud-based offerings as a core revenue driver.' Minor difference: LLM uses 'accelerating' while ground truth says 'continued upward trend' - both are semantically equivalent interpretations of the data. The citation reference [page_8] adds credibility. No calculation errors detected. The answer is concise, accurate, and directly responsive to the question.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, the Health & Public Service segment contributed $12,560 million in revenue, while in fiscal year 2024, this figure increased to $13,841 million, representing a 10% increase. This growth indicates a strengthening position for Accenture in the Health & Public Service sector, contrasting with declines observed in other industry groups like Communications, Media & Technology, suggesting a strategic emphasis or improved market demand in this segment.",

The calculated growth of approximately $1.3 billion and 10% increase are both accurate. The answer correctly identifies the segment and fiscal years. However, there are notable differences from the ground truth: (1) The LLM answer focuses on Accenture's strategic positioning in terms of 'deepening focus' and 'capturing expanding demand for digital transformation,' which is reasonable inference but differs from the ground truth's comparative analysis that explicitly contrasts this growth with declines in other segments like Communications, Media & Technology. (2) The ground truth emphasizes the comparative context—that this growth is notable precisely because other segments declined—which provides important strategic context that the LLM answer omits. (3) The LLM answer's interpretation about 'deepening focus' and 'expanding demand' is plausible but represents inference rather than direct statement of what the data indicates about strategic positioning. The quantitative core is solid, but the qualitative analysis lacks the comparative framework that gives the growth its full strategic significance. The answer is fundamentally correct but incomplete in addressing the full strategic positioning question.",

      "question": "How has NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of lead time and financial risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing NVIDIA disclosed that, because of industry shortages, it shifted from the usual six‑month ordering horizon to placing non‑cancellable orders at least twelve months in advance and began paying premiums or deposits to lock in capacity—raising its financial‑risk exposure (2022 p. 24). By the 2023 filing the company said it had broadened supply‑and‑capacity purchases, added new vendors and entered prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements, which have let it shorten lead times for some components even as it still flags the financial risk of prepaid commitments and added supply‑chain complexity (2023 p. 34).",

Strengths: (1) Correctly identifies the shift from six-month to twelve-month advance ordering in 2022 due to supply shortages; (2) Accurately captures the 2023 evolution including broadened supply-and-capacity purchases, addition of new vendors, and prepaid manufacturing agreements; (3) Properly synthesizes the multi-hop comparison across 2022 and 2023 filings; (4) Correctly identifies the dual nature of the evolution—both risk reduction (shortened lead times) and risk increase (prepaid commitments, complexity); (5) Appropriately cites page numbers (2022 p. 24, 2023 p. 34) suggesting source verification. Minor considerations: (1) The LLM mentions 'premiums or deposits' in 2022 which aligns with the ground truth's reference to increased product costs and risk of excess inventory; (2) The answer uses slightly different phrasing than ground truth ('broadened' vs 'increased,' 'flags the financial risk' vs 'faced risks') but these are semantically equivalent and actually enhance clarity; (3) The characterization of the shift as 'reactive long-term commitments to more expansive and strategic investment' is implicitly captured in the LLM's description of the evolution, though not explicitly stated. The LLM answer successfully addresses all components of the multi-part question: the 2022 approach (twelve-month advance orders, financial risk), the 2023 approach (expanded suppliers, prepaid agreements, shortened lead times), and the evolution between them (shift from reactive to strategic, increased complexity).

      "original_answer": "Cisco's Short-term RPO increased from $16,936 million in fiscal year 2022 to $20,882 million in fiscal year 2024, representing a growth of $3,946 million. This indicates an improvement in the company's near-term revenue visibility as more customer orders are positioned to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months.",

Because Cisco expects about half of its total RPO to be recognized as revenue within the next 12 months (≈54% in FY‑2022 and ≈51% in FY‑2024), the larger short‑term RPO pool signals stronger near‑term revenue visibility and a bigger pipeline of contracts slated for near‑term fulfillment.",

Entity accuracy: All entities correctly identified (Cisco, short-term RPO, fiscal years 2022 and 2024). Multi-hop reasoning: The answer correctly synthesizes the evolution of short-term RPO across two fiscal years and properly interprets what this indicates about revenue visibility. The additional context about the proportion of total RPO recognized within 12 months (54% in FY2022, 51% in FY2024) adds valuable insight and demonstrates deeper understanding of the metric's significance. The conclusion that larger short-term RPO signals stronger near-term revenue visibility is logically sound and aligns with the ground truth interpretation. Minor note: The LLM provides slightly more analytical depth than the ground truth by contextualizing the short-term RPO as a percentage of total RPO, which enhances understanding without introducing inaccuracy.

The 2023 figure of $15.8 billion matches the ground truth of $15,824 million (format variation accepted). The 2024 figure of $17.3 billion matches $17,335 million. The percentage increase of 10% is accurate (calculation: ($17,335 - $15,824) / $15,824 = 1,511 / 15,824 = 9.54%, which rounds to 10%). (2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: All numbers are correct with appropriate format variations (billions vs. millions). The percentage calculation is sound and correctly stated as 'roughly a 10%' which appropriately reflects the rounding. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: Mastercard is correctly identified, the metric 'Payment Network Revenue' is correctly named, and both fiscal years (2023 and 2024) are correct.

By 2024, the disclosures became more strategic, explicitly tying capital ratios to 'capital plans including dividends and repurchases' and broader 'strategic priorities and initiatives' such as the transition to a platforms operating model and efficiency savings.

      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 Form 10‑K, BNY Mellon’s forward‑looking language on capital ratios was limited to a broad disclaimer – the filing simply notes that “forward‑looking statements … include statements about … capital ratios” and lists capital‑ratio risk factors without tying them to any specific plan (2023 10‑K p. 3). By the 2024 Form 10‑K, the company added concrete context, explicitly referencing the “well‑capitalized” and “well‑managed” regulatory status, capital‑planning requirements, and the Board’s discretion to return capital to shareholders, thereby framing capital‑ratio expectations as part of its strategic capital‑return and transformation agenda (2024 10‑K p. 3; risk‑factor discussion on p. 5).",

MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM answer provides slightly more granular detail about specific page references and regulatory language ('well-capitalized,' 'well-managed') than the ground truth, which is not incorrect but represents a different level of specificity; (2) The ground truth explicitly mentions 'platforms operating model' and 'efficiency savings' as strategic priorities, while the LLM answer uses more general language about 'transformation agenda' - this is a minor semantic difference but represents slightly less specificity on the strategic initiatives; (3) The LLM characterizes 2023 statements as 'limited to a broad disclaimer' which is accurate but slightly more negative in tone than the ground truth's neutral 'general sense' framing. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: No numerical data is involved in this qualitative question, so this dimension is not directly applicable, but the answer correctly identifies years (2023, 2024) and document types (Form 10-K).

The LLM claims obligations INCREASED from $530M to $565M, which is the opposite direction. (2) WRONG NUMBERS: The LLM cites $80M, $76M, $67M, $60M, $54M, and $193M for 2022, which sum to $530M. However, the ground truth indicates the 2022 projection for 2025-2031 was $391 total, not $530M. (3) MISMATCHED PERIODS: The LLM compares 2025-2034 ($530M in 2022) to 2025-2031 ($565M in 2024), which are different time horizons and therefore not directly comparable. The ground truth compares the same conceptual obligation across years: $391 (2022) vs $193 (2024). (4) CALCULATION ERROR: Even accepting the LLM's numbers, the comparison between different time periods (2025-2034 vs 2025-2031) is methodologically flawed. (5) MAGNITUDE REVERSAL: The ground truth shows a 50.6% DECREASE; the LLM shows a 6.6% INCREASE. These are opposite conclusions. The LLM appears to have either reversed the year-to-year comparison or confused which year's data corresponds to which projection period. The answer fails on the primary metric of factual accuracy regarding the direction and magnitude of change.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, iPhone net sales showed an increase compared to 2021, primarily driven by the launch of new iPhone models since the fourth quarter of 2021. However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth in 2022 to stagnation in 2024 suggests a decline in the momentum of iPhone sales performance over time, potentially indicating market saturation or reduced consumer demand for new model releases during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s iPhone sales grew 7 % in fiscal 2022, reaching $205.5 billion (page 24). The next year they slipped about 2 % to $200.6 billion, and fiscal 2024 sales were essentially unchanged at $201.2 billion, with the filing noting iPhone net sales were “relatively flat” versus 2023 (page 26). This shift from solid growth in 2022 to a modest decline and then a plateau suggests the flagship product’s sales momentum has slowed and is now stabilizing rather than expanding.",

By 2024, the company reiterated this risk but placed additional emphasis on broader strategic transformation efforts, including the use of automation and AI to drive productivity and growth. This suggests that while the core risk of impairment remained, it became more closely tied to transformational initiatives and their success in delivering expected value.

CRITICAL WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM concludes that exposure 'has remained consistent' with 'no indication of a material increase or decrease,' which directly contradicts the ground truth answer. The ground truth explicitly identifies an evolution in how the risk is framed - from 'general acquisition risk' to 'more strategic and operational context' tied to 'transformational initiatives' including automation and AI. (2) The LLM completely misses the key distinction that by 2024, IBM placed 'additional emphasis on broader strategic transformation efforts, including the use of automation and AI to drive productivity and growth.' This is a material change in how the risk is contextualized, not merely a repetition of identical language. (3) The LLM's reasoning that 'essentially identical language' means 'no material increase or decrease' fails to capture the multi-hop synthesis required - the question asks about how exposure has 'changed based on the specific risk factors described in each year's filing,' which requires analyzing the contextual framing, not just the literal language. (4) The answer misses the semantic shift from acquisition-focused risk to transformation-focused risk, which represents a meaningful evolution in IBM's disclosure of intangible asset impairment exposure. The LLM provides a surface-level comparison rather than the deeper contextual analysis the ground truth demonstrates.

However, the ground truth clearly states it rose from 20% in fiscal 2022 to 21% in fiscal 2023. The LLM has the fiscal 2023 percentage correct (20% vs 21% is close enough for rounding), but incorrectly states the prior year was 18% when it should be 20%.

MISSING INFORMATION: The LLM appropriately notes that the FY2023 health-vs-public-service split isn't detailed, which is honest. However, it fails to mention the important detail from the ground truth about 35% of the group's revenue coming from U.S. federal government through Accenture Federal Services in FY2022. REASONING QUALITY: The multi-hop synthesis is generally sound - the model correctly identifies the segment's growth trajectory and increasing importance.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains multiple critical factual errors that contradict the ground truth:\n\n1. FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTION ON INTEREST RATE REDUCTION PROGRAMS: The ground truth explicitly states that by 2024, American Express 'does not offer interest rate reduction programs for Card Member receivables, as these are non-interest bearing.' The LLM answer claims the opposite - that 2024 disclosures 'added a new modification program that can temporarily cut rates to zero percent.' This is a direct contradiction of the ground truth and represents a major factual error.\n\n2. MISCHARACTERIZATION OF LOAN TYPE: The ground truth clarifies that Card Member receivables are 'non-interest bearing' by 2024. The LLM's discussion of interest rate reductions (18% vs 16%) and non-accrual status during modifications is inconsistent with non-interest bearing loans and appears to confuse Card Member Loans with other loan products.\n\n3. UNVERIFIED NUMERICAL CLAIMS: The LLM provides specific dollar amounts for modified Card Member Loans that defaulted ($53M, $20M, $88M, $40M) and page references (pages 115, 117) that cannot be verified against the ground truth. These numbers are presented with high confidence but lack corroboration.\n\n4. INCORRECT EVOLUTION NARRATIVE: The ground truth describes an evolution toward 'more specific disclosure around loan modifications and default behaviors, while maintaining the same general policy on interest accrual cessation.' The LLM describes a completely different evolution involving new modification programs with rate reductions, which contradicts the ground truth's characterization.\n\n5. MISSING KEY GROUND TRUTH ELEMENTS: The LLM fails to mention that Card Member loans are recorded at point-of-sale and include principal, accrued interest, and fees - core elements of the ground truth answer.\n\n6. SEMANTIC MISALIGNMENT: The ground truth emphasizes that the 2024 evolution involved clarification that Card Member receivables are non-interest bearing (implying they were previously treated differently or the distinction wasn't clear). The LLM's narrative about new zero-percent modification programs is fundamentally incompatible with this characterization.\n\nThe answer demonstrates poor multi-hop reasoning by failing to synthesize the key distinction between interest-bearing and non-interest bearing loans, and appears to have fabricated or misattributed specific financial metrics and page references.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, there were no customers representing 10% or more of total revenue for NVDA. However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue and was specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also tied to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting a more pronounced dependency on major customers for this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compute & Networking segment has shifted from a broadly diversified customer base in FY 2023—when no single customer contributed ≥ 10 % of total revenue—to a more concentrated profile in FY 2024, where one direct customer accounted for 13 % of total revenue and an indirect customer (through system integrators) represented roughly 19 % of total revenue, both tied to this segment (page_40). At the same time, the share of revenue from non‑U.S. customers fell from 69 % to 56 %, underscoring a modest geographic rebalancing while the company acknowledges that demand in Compute & Networking remains concentrated (page_40).",

STRENGTHS: (1) All key quantitative data is correct - FY2023 had no customers ≥10% of revenue, FY2024 had Customer A at 13% and an indirect customer at ~19%, both tied to Compute & Networking. (2) The multi-hop synthesis is sound, correctly comparing the two fiscal years and identifying the shift toward concentration. (3) The answer properly identifies the segment and correctly attributes both customers to it. (4) Semantic equivalence is maintained - 'broadly diversified' vs 'no customers ≥10%' and 'more concentrated profile' vs 'significant shift toward greater customer concentration' convey the same meaning. MINOR ISSUES: (1) The LLM introduces additional information about geographic rebalancing (non-U.S. customers falling from 69% to 56%) that, while potentially accurate, is not part of the ground truth answer and represents scope expansion beyond the core question about market concentration and customer dependency in the Compute & Networking segment specifically. This additional context, while relevant to understanding strategic positioning, dilutes focus from the primary question. (2) The citation references (page_40) cannot be verified against the ground truth but appear reasonable. The core answer directly addresses the question's requirements: comparing FY2023 vs FY2024, identifying the shift in customer concentration, and noting the dependency on major customers in the Compute & Networking segment.

The original answer includes the percentage increase (approximately 77.6%), which provides important context about the magnitude of the change ('substantial rise'). The LLM answer describes the increase as 'sharp' but omits the specific percentage calculation, which is a material omission for a comprehensive financial analysis. The answer correctly identifies Cisco as the company and uses proper fiscal year terminology. The citation reference [page_45] adds credibility but doesn't affect accuracy scoring.

By 2023, free cash flow dropped significantly to $1,349 million, which equates to only 7.7% of revenue ($17,519 million).

By 2023 free cash flow had fallen to $1.35 billion, or only 7.7 % of its $17.5 billion revenue【page_21】. The steep decline in free‑cash‑flow‑to‑sales indicates that cash generation from operations was largely consumed by higher capital expenditures and weaker operating cash flow, tightening liquidity and shifting the company’s financial dynamics toward a more investment‑intensive, lower‑cash‑generation profile.",

MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes the evolution of the relationship between FCF and revenue across two years, properly calculating the ratios and comparing them. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS: The LLM provides enhanced interpretation beyond the ground truth by specifically attributing the decline to 'higher capital expenditures and weaker operating cash flow,' which is a reasonable inference from the data pattern and adds valuable context.

(2) INCORRECT DATE INTERPRETATION: The LLM states the balance rose 'from $9,777 million at September 25 2022 to $9,909 million at September 24 2023' - this is misleading.

(3) MISSING 2023 DATA: The ground truth shows 2023 had a $156M increase with $126M from acquisitions (80.8%) and $30M from FX adjustments (19.2%). The LLM provides none of this. (4) PERCENTAGE CALCULATIONS: While the LLM's percentages for 2022 are approximately correct (57.6% vs 57.7% for acquisitions, 42.4% vs 42.3% for FX), these represent only half the required analysis.

The reasoning about LinkedIn's upward trajectory is sound and well-articulated. CRITICAL ERRORS: (1) The LLM states the 9% growth is 'steady double-digit growth,' which is factually incorrect—9% is single-digit growth, not double-digit. This is a significant mathematical/analytical error that contradicts the ground truth's characterization of 'steady upward trend' without the double-digit qualifier. (2) The LLM does not explicitly calculate or state LinkedIn's FY2024 revenue figure. The ground truth implies FY2024 revenue would be approximately $15.06B ($13.816B × 1.09), but the LLM only references the 9% increase without deriving the actual FY2024 number.

The logic is sound—a 50% decline in fees from these programs does indeed suggest reduced reliance. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the question: (1) how revenue evolved (specific numbers and percentage change) and (2) what this shift suggests about the relationship with sweep programs (reduced reliance/weaker relationship). SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's characterization of the decline as signaling \"reduced reliance on, and a weaker relationship with, those sweep-program arrangements\" is semantically equivalent to the ground truth's \"reduced reliance on or a strategic shift away from off-balance sheet sweep programs.\" The LLM's phrasing is slightly more specific about the relationship aspect. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM provides additional context (page references, explanation of how sweep programs work) that enhances clarity without introducing errors.

(3) QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The reasoning is sound and clearly explains the evolution - the model correctly synthesizes that the presentation maintained a three-year comparative structure while rolling forward by one year, dropping 2021 and adding 2024. The explanation of 'moving the three-year window forward by one year' demonstrates proper multi-hop understanding. (4) CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE: The answer is directly relevant and comprehensive, addressing the core question about how the presentation evolved. The inclusion of page references adds credibility. Minor note: The LLM uses slightly more detailed language ('effectively moving the three-year window forward by one year and replacing the 2021 figures with the new 2024 year') compared to the ground truth's more concise phrasing, but this is semantically equivalent and actually enhances clarity.

This indicates a meaningful shift in the company's cost management, as adjusted operating expenses rose more slowly than adjusted net revenue—growing from $15,251 million in 2022 to $16,574 million in 2024, while adjusted net revenue increased from $34,250 million to $39,139 million over the same period. This trend suggests improved operational efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenue generation.",

At the same time, total net revenue grew from $34.3 billion in 2022 to $39.1 billion in 2024【page_118】, meaning operating expenses rose more slowly than revenue and the company’s cost management improved relative to its top‑line growth.",

The LLM answer goes beyond the ground truth by providing additional context: it includes GAAP basis ratios (44.22% in 2022, 44.33% in 2023, 43.27% in 2024) and explicitly mentions the three-year span with intermediate year data. Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer correctly synthesizes that operating expenses rose more slowly than revenue, leading to improved cost management. The conclusion about improved operational efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenue generation is logically sound and well-supported. The only minor deviation is that the ground truth specifically mentions adjusted operating expenses ($15,251M to $16,574M), which the LLM answer does not explicitly state, though it correctly implies this relationship.

(2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The specific dollar amount is precisely correct and matches the ground truth exactly. No calculation errors present.

These are not minor rounding differences - they represent a 12.2 percentage point overstatement in 2022 and a 12.0 percentage point overstatement in 2023. The calculated decline of 8.8 percentage points in the LLM answer is also incorrect; the actual decline is 8.5 percentage points (38.4% - 29.9%). (2) CALCULATION ERRORS: Even if the LLM's percentages were correct, the math is inconsistent (50.6% - 41.8% = 8.8%, which is arithmetically correct for those numbers, but the underlying percentages are wrong). (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING: While the LLM correctly identifies that the decline indicates cost management challenges and weakened profitability trends (which aligns with the ground truth's interpretation), this qualitative reasoning cannot compensate for the severe quantitative errors. (4) ENTITY AND METRIC ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies the metric (operating profit margin) and years (2022 vs 2023), but the actual values are completely wrong.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average loans held for investment decreased by $605 million to $252.7 billion, largely due to declines in the credit card portfolio from higher customer payments and the transfer of a $2.6 billion international card partnership portfolio to held for sale. In contrast, by 2023, average loans held for investment increased by $1.0 billion to $92.5 billion, driven by growth across the loan portfolio, including credit cards. This shift indicates a strategic adjustment in Capital One's credit card lending, moving from a period of contraction and portfolio divestiture in 2022 to renewed growth in 2023, suggesting a recalibration of credit risk appetite and market positioning.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The LLM states average loans held for investment reached '$92.5 billion in 2023 versus roughly $91.5 billion in 2022,' implying a $1 billion increase. However, the ground truth shows 2023 was $92.5 billion (correct) but 2022 was $252.7 billion (NOT $91.5 billion). This is a massive discrepancy of $161.2 billion—the LLM has the 2022 figure completely wrong. The LLM's calculation of a $1 billion increase is mathematically correct for the numbers it cites, but those numbers are factually incorrect. (2) MISSING CRITICAL CONTEXT: The ground truth explicitly states that in 2022, average loans held for investment DECREASED by $605 million to $252.7 billion, and mentions a $2.6 billion international card partnership portfolio transfer to held for sale. The LLM completely omits the 2022 contraction and the portfolio divestiture, which are essential to understanding the strategic shift. (3) INCOMPLETE MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The question asks about the shift BETWEEN 2022 and 2023. The ground truth provides a complete narrative: 2022 showed contraction/divestiture, 2023 showed growth. The LLM only addresses 2023 growth and fails to capture the 2022 decline, missing the critical contrast that demonstrates the strategic recalibration. (4) REASONING QUALITY: While the LLM's logic about credit card lending strategy is reasonable, it's based on incomplete and incorrect data. The ground truth's interpretation—that the shift from contraction to growth indicates a 'recalibration of credit risk appetite'—is more nuanced and accurate than the LLM's simpler 'continued push' narrative.

LLM reports: 2021: $11.5B ($11,500M - INCORRECT, off by ~$452M or 4%), 2022: $12.8B (INCORRECT, should be ~$12.2B), 2023: $14.2B (approximately correct at $14,216M). The 2021 figure is notably wrong. CALCULATION VERIFICATION: LLM claims ~11% YoY growth for both 2022 and 2023. Ground truth confirms 11% for 2023 ($14,216M vs prior year). However, the 2022 growth calculation is questionable given the incorrect baseline numbers provided. MISSING CRITICAL CONTEXT: The LLM answer omits the ground truth's important finding that Digital Media maintained a stable 73% contribution to total revenue, which is a key indicator of market position and strategic importance. This is a material omission for answering what the trajectory 'suggests about market position.' MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly synthesizes that consistent growth indicates market dominance and leadership, which is sound reasoning. However, this conclusion is weakened by the numerical errors and missing context about revenue contribution percentage. SEMANTIC ISSUES: The LLM characterizes growth as 'double-digit expansion' but the actual YoY percentages cited are ~11%, which is technically double-digit but the phrasing could be misleading. STRENGTHS: The answer correctly identifies the segments driving growth (Creative Cloud and Document Cloud) and appropriately concludes about market position. The overall narrative structure is sound.

      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K the company mentioned GDV only as a growth driver – a 21 % increase on a local‑currency basis (page 48) and a table of quarterly % changes for “gross dollar volume (local currency basis)” (page 46) – without giving the actual dollar amount. By the 2024 filing the disclosure had become far more detailed: the MD&A lists total GDV of $9.8 trillion, up 11 % (page 6), and a separate chart breaks the $9.8 T into program‑level figures (e.g., $3.634 T consumer‑credit, $4.865 T consumer‑debit/prepaid, $1.258 T commercial) with each segment’s share of total GDV and year‑over‑year growth (page 7).

(1) DIRECTIONAL ERROR: The ground truth states that disclosure DECREASED in detail from 2022 to 2024 (moving from quarterly/annual percentage metrics to chart format without detailed breakdowns). The LLM claims the opposite - that disclosure became 'far more detailed' by 2024 with dollar amounts and segment breakdowns. This is a critical reversal of the actual evolution. (2) NUMERIC ISSUES: The LLM provides specific dollar figures ($9.8T total, $3.634T consumer-credit, $4.865T consumer-debit/prepaid, $1.258T commercial) that are not mentioned in the ground truth. These numbers cannot be verified against the original answer and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. The ground truth makes no mention of these specific dollar amounts. (3) MISSING KEY POINT: The ground truth explicitly states the shift was from 'detailed, time-based quantitative reporting to a more generalized, program-focused presentation' - a reduction in quantitative detail. The LLM completely misses this core finding. (4) PAGE REFERENCES: The LLM cites specific pages (48, 46, 6, 7) which cannot be verified against the ground truth provided, and the content described doesn't align with what the ground truth indicates. (5) MULTI-HOP REASONING: While the LLM attempts to synthesize information across years, it does so incorrectly by reversing the direction of change. The answer demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how GDV disclosure evolved. The only partially correct element is identifying that 2022 had percentage increases (21% mentioned in both), but this is overshadowed by the major directional error about 2024 disclosure becoming more detailed rather than less detailed.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Windows revenue was reported at $24,761 million, showing a steady but moderate growth compared to prior years. By fiscal year 2024, Windows revenue had increased by 8%, with Windows OEM revenue growing 7% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growing 11%. This indicates a stronger and more diversified growth pattern in 2024, especially in the Commercial segment, compared to the more uniform growth seen in 2022.",

All quantitative data is correct: Windows revenue of $24.8 billion (formatted as $24,761 million in ground truth, equivalent to $24.8 billion) in fiscal 2022, 8% overall growth to fiscal 2024, 7% OEM growth, and 11% Commercial products and cloud services growth. The fiscal year 2022 date reference (year ended June 30, 2022) is accurate. The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the answer correctly identifies and compares the two segments (OEM vs Commercial) across the fiscal years, drawing the logical conclusion that Commercial offerings are outpacing OEM licensing. The reasoning about 'stronger and more diversified growth pattern' is well-supported by the differential growth rates (11% vs 7%). The answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question: (1) growth trajectory evolution, (2) OEM performance, and (3) Commercial performance. Minor note: The LLM uses slightly different phrasing than ground truth (e.g., 'Windows OEM licensing' vs 'Windows OEM revenue') but this is semantically equivalent and represents the same metric.

By the 2023 filing, the language had been pared back to “climate‑change concerns could adversely affect our business, affect client activity levels and damage our reputation,” dropping the broader ESG label and the reference to additional regulation, indicating a narrower, less explicit emphasis on ESG‑related risks in its financial‑condition discussion.",

This is a complete reversal of the actual evolution. The LLM also incorrectly attributes specific language to 2022 ('ESG concerns, including climate change') when the ground truth indicates climate change was the primary focus in 2022, with ESG being the broader framing added in 2023. The LLM's characterization of the 2023 filing as showing 'less explicit emphasis' directly contradicts the ground truth's statement that 2023 showed 'expanded' and 'more comprehensive framing' of ESG risks. While the LLM correctly identifies the years (2022, 2023) and company (BK), the core factual claim about the direction and nature of the evolution is inverted.

However, in the 2023 filing, GDV was elevated to a more prominent position as a defined and discussed key metric, with a detailed explanation of its components (purchase volume and cash volume), how it is calculated, and its role in strategic decision-making.

By the 2023 filing, Mastercard elevated GDV to a distinct “Key Driver” – it is explicitly defined on page 53, shown in dedicated tables of USD‑ and local‑currency GDV growth (including Russia‑adjusted figures) on page 54, and its impact on other performance metrics is discussed in the foreign‑currency impact section on page 55, treating GDV as a primary, standalone metric.",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2022 presentation as appearing in narrative and MD&A tables without formal definition; (2) Accurately describes 2023 elevation to 'Key Driver' status with explicit definition and dedicated tables; (3) Mentions specific page numbers (47, 48, 53, 54, 55) showing detailed filing knowledge; (4) Captures the shift from purely quantitative to more strategic/qualitative framing; (5) References Russia-adjusted figures and foreign-currency impact discussion, adding specificity. WEAKNESSES: (1) The ground truth mentions specific 2020 quarterly growth rates (8% for March 31, (10)% for June 30) which the LLM does not reference - these appear to be from 2022 filing tables; (2) The LLM cites a 21% GDV growth figure but doesn't verify this matches ground truth context; (3) The ground truth emphasizes 'components (purchase volume and cash volume)' and 'how it is calculated' - the LLM mentions definition and tables but doesn't explicitly detail these components; (4) Minor: The LLM uses 'Key Driver' terminology while ground truth uses 'key metric' - semantically similar but slightly different framing. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM successfully synthesizes information across two years and multiple sections of filings (narrative, MD&A, definitions, tables), correctly identifying the progression.

QUANTITATIVE ELEMENTS: The 21% figure is mentioned but not verified against ground truth; page numbers are specific but cannot be independently verified from the provided context.

The quantitative/technical details about the methodology are accurate. WHAT WAS INCORRECT: The LLM failed to identify the semantic and procedural evolution that occurred between years. The ground truth emphasizes that while the core methodology remained consistent, the LANGUAGE SHIFT from 'discloses' to 'determines' represents a meaningful change in how the company characterizes its role - from passive disclosure to active determination. This is a qualitative but important distinction that the LLM completely missed.

This is a material error. If FY2023 was $2,826B with 6% growth, the prior year should be ~$2,667B, not $2,622B. The LLM's stated prior year of $2,622B would actually represent a 7.8% growth rate, closer to 8% but still not matching the ground truth's 6%. (3) The dollar amounts for FY2022 and FY2023 are correct ($2,617B and $2,826B respectively), but the year-over-year comparisons and resulting growth percentages are inaccurate.

The 2023 cost figure of $5.8B is INCORRECT. (3) GROSS PROFIT CALCULATIONS: LLM states $23.2B for 2023 and $26.4B for 2024. Ground truth shows $22,992M and $26,316M respectively. The 2023 figure is off by ~$200M. (4) MARGIN CALCULATIONS - CRITICAL ERROR: LLM calculates margins as 80% (2023) and 81% (2024). Ground truth shows 73% and 75% respectively. This is a massive discrepancy of 7 percentage points. Verification: 22,992 ÷ 29,021 = 0.7920 = 79.2% ≈ 79%, NOT 80%. And 26,316 ÷ 32,537 = 0.8086 = 80.9% ≈ 81%. Wait - the LLM's calculations appear mathematically consistent with their stated numbers, but the ground truth margins are 73% and 75%. This suggests the LLM used DIFFERENT underlying data than the ground truth. The ground truth explicitly states: 2023 margin = 73% from $22,992/$29,021; 2024 margin = 75% from $26,316/$32,537. Rechecking: 22,992/29,021 = 0.7920 = 79.2%, NOT 73%. There is an inconsistency in the ground truth itself, OR the ground truth's stated percentages (73% and 75%) are incorrect. However, the LLM's percentages (80% and 81%) are mathematically correct for the numbers provided. (5) TREND DIRECTION: Both answers correctly identify an improvement in margin (LLM: +1 percentage point; Ground truth: +2 percentage points). (6) INTERPRETATION: The LLM correctly interprets the trend as indicating improved operational efficiency, which aligns with the ground truth's conclusion. SUMMARY: The LLM answer contains significant numerical discrepancies with the ground truth, particularly in the absolute margin percentages (80-81% vs 73-75%). The reasoning and interpretation are sound, but the foundational numbers appear to come from different source data than the ground truth knowledge graph.",

The LLM states 2024 growth was ~5% YoY, but ground truth shows 6% YoY. While these are close, they are factually incorrect. (2) DOLLAR AMOUNT OMISSIONS: The ground truth provides specific dollar values ($1,641B to $2,047B in 2022; $2,230B to $2,355B in 2024), which are critical to understanding the magnitude of credit volume. The LLM completely omits these dollar amounts, failing to provide complete quantitative context. (3) METRIC SPECIFICATION: The ground truth specifically identifies 'U.S. Consumer Credit Volume' while the LLM uses the vaguer term 'consumer-credit payments volume' - these may not be identical metrics. (4) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: While the LLM correctly identifies the trend (slowdown from double-digit to low-single-digit growth), it fails to synthesize the complete picture by omitting the actual dollar volumes that demonstrate the scale of the business. (5) REASONING QUALITY: The conclusion about 'marked slowdown' is correct directionally, but the analysis is incomplete without the dollar amounts.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple highlighted that potential noncompliance with data protection laws could result in 'associated investigatory expenses' and 'significant fees or fines,' particularly in areas involving health, financial, and biometric data. By 2024, Apple's language evolved to reflect a more immediate exposure, stating it 'can be liable for associated investigatory expenses' if sensitive data is mishandled or if payment card data is compromised. This shift indicates that the risk moved from a general potential liability to a more concrete operational exposure, especially around data breach scenarios.",

The ground truth explicitly states that Apple's language EVOLVED from 2023 to 2024, shifting from 'potential' liability ('could result in') to 'concrete operational exposure' ('can be liable for'). This represents a meaningful change in how Apple characterizes its exposure to investigatory expenses. The LLM answer directly contradicts this by claiming 'the language and the categories of exposure are essentially unchanged.' This is a critical factual error that misses the entire point of the question. While the LLM correctly identifies that both years mention 'associated investigatory expenses' and the same data categories (health, financial, biometric, payment-card data), it fails to recognize the semantic and substantive shift in liability characterization. The ground truth emphasizes this evolution as moving from 'general potential liability' to 'more concrete operational exposure, especially around data breach scenarios.' The LLM's assertion that 'no new or increased investigatory-expense liability was added' contradicts the ground truth's finding of a meaningful shift in how the liability is framed and characterized. The quantitative accuracy score is relatively high because the LLM correctly identifies the page references and data categories, but the qualitative accuracy and overall correctness are severely compromised by the failure to recognize and articulate the key change in liability characterization that the question specifically asks about.",

      "question": "How did the financial contribution of the Analog segment to Texas Instruments' overall operating profit evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about its strategic importance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Analog segment contributed $5,821 million to Texas Instruments' operating profit, which was the majority of the company's $7,331 million total operating profit in 2024. This indicates that the Analog segment remained strategically significant, maintaining a dominant share of the company's profitability despite no change in its operating profit figure year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "The Analog segment’s operating profit fell from $5.8 billion in 2023 (≈ $5,821 million) to $4.6 billion in 2024 (≈ $4,608 million) – a decline of about $1.2 billion【page_31】. Even with the drop, Analog still generated roughly 80‑85 % of TI’s total operating profit (≈ 79 % in 2023 and ≈ 84 % in 2024)【page_30】, underscoring that it remains the company’s primary profit engine and a key strategic focus.",

      "detailed_feedback": "CRITICAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED: The LLM answer contains fundamental factual inaccuracies that contradict the ground truth. (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The LLM claims Analog segment operating profit DECLINED from $5.8B in 2023 to $4.6B in 2024 (a $1.2B drop). However, the ground truth explicitly states there was 'no change in its operating profit figure year-over-year' - meaning the 2023 figure of $5,821 million remained the same in 2024. The LLM's $4.6B figure for 2024 is incorrect. (2) PERCENTAGE CALCULATIONS: The LLM states Analog was '79% in 2023 and 84% in 2024' of total operating profit. The ground truth indicates $5,821M was 'the majority' of $7,331M total in 2024, which equals approximately 79.4% - consistent with the 2023 figure if unchanged. The 84% figure for 2024 is mathematically inconsistent with the ground truth data. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year comparison. The question asks how the contribution 'evolved from 2023 to 2024,' and the correct answer is that it remained stable/unchanged, not that it declined significantly. (4) SEMANTIC MISALIGNMENT: The LLM's narrative of a 'decline' and 'drop' directly contradicts the ground truth's assertion of 'no change.' This is not a wording difference but a fundamental factual error. (5) STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE: While the LLM correctly identifies Analog as strategically important, this conclusion is based on incorrect financial data. The ground truth's point about strategic importance is that despite no change in absolute profit, Analog maintained dominance - a different narrative than the LLM's declining-but-still-dominant story. The LLM answer demonstrates poor data verification and incorrect synthesis of multi-year financial comparisons.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Professional Visualization revenue doubled compared to the prior year, driven by the ramp of NVIDIA Ampere architecture products and strong demand for workstations in hybrid work environments. By fiscal year 2024, the revenue for this segment had grown from $1,544 million in 2022 to $1,878 million in 2024, indicating a continued but more moderate growth trend. This suggests that while the segment is still expanding, the explosive growth seen in 2022 has slowed, potentially signaling market saturation or a shift in enterprise spending priorities.",
      "llm_answer": "NVDA’s Professional Visualization line generated roughly **$1.72 billion in FY 2022**, a figure that had **doubled (up ≈ 100 %) from FY 2021**【page 45】【page 47】. By **FY 2024 the segment’s revenue was $1.55 billion**【page 80】—about $170 million (≈ 10 %) lower than in FY 2022.

The LLM states FY2024 revenue was $1.55 billion, but ground truth shows $1,878 million ($1.878B). These are not minor rounding differences—they represent significant misstatements of actual financial data. (2) DIRECTIONAL ERROR: The LLM claims revenue DECLINED from FY2022 to FY2024 (down ~$170M), but ground truth shows GROWTH from $1,544M to $1,878M (up $334M or ~21.6%).

This indicates a continued upward growth trajectory, as the segment had also grown by 14% (or $80 million) from 2022 to 2023.

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All numbers are correct - $661 million (2023), $837 million (2024), $176 million increase, and 27% growth rate all match the ground truth exactly. The calculation is accurate: ($837M - $661M) / $661M = 0.266 or ~26.6%, which rounds to 27%. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses the core question about revenue evolution between 2023 and 2024 and provides insight into growth trajectory. However, it does not mention the 2022 baseline ($581 million implied from the 14% growth mentioned in ground truth), which would have provided fuller context about the consistent growth pattern. ENTITY ACCURACY: Correctly identifies Cisco, Observability segment, fiscal years 2023-2024, and relevant products (ThousandEyes, Splunk-based Observability Suite). REASONING QUALITY: The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the answer correctly combines revenue figures across years and calculates the growth rate. The interpretation that this represents a 'robust upward trajectory' and 'key growth engine' is well-supported by the data. The additional context about overall product revenue decline makes the Observability growth even more significant. MINOR GAPS: The answer could have been slightly more complete by referencing the prior year growth (2022-2023) to fully demonstrate the 'consistent growth' pattern mentioned in the ground truth, though this is a minor omission. The answer provides appropriate citations to source pages. Overall, this is a strong, factually accurate response with sound reasoning.",

The answer appropriately addresses the question about trajectory and provides sound reasoning about growth. However, there are significant issues with the additional data provided: (1) The LLM introduces information about '$112 billion of net inflows in 2023' and '$898 billion of ETF AUM at year-end' that are NOT present in the ground truth answer and cannot be verified against it. These appear to be unsourced claims that may or may not be accurate. (2) The ground truth answer focuses specifically on the 2023-to-2024 evolution, while the LLM answer mixes 2023 data with what appears to be year-end positioning, creating temporal ambiguity. (3) The LLM answer cites 'page_105' and 'page_8' but these citations cannot be verified against the ground truth. The core answer about revenue growth from $1,230M to $1,367M is correct, and the interpretation about growth trajectory is sound and semantically equivalent to the ground truth.

      "question": "How did IBM's characterization of its relationship with client spending budgets evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this suggest about its perception of dependency on external economic conditions?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM described its relationship with client spending budgets as one of dependency, indicating that a downturn in economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns could directly impact its business. By 2024, the language shifted to describe client spending budgets as something that 'impacts' the business, rather than a dependency. This subtle shift suggests that while IBM still acknowledges sensitivity to client spending, it may be framing its exposure as more external and less core to its strategic control, potentially signaling a repositioning of how it communicates risk related to economic conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2023 and 2024 Form 10‑K risk‑factor sections contain the identical language: “Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company’s Business…If overall demand for IBM’s products and solutions decreases, whether due to general economic conditions or a shift in client buying patterns, the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted.” The lack of any change in wording shows IBM still sees its revenue as tightly linked to clients’ budget decisions and broader macro‑economic conditions, underscoring a continued perception of strong dependency on external economic factors.",

The ground truth explicitly states that IBM's language CHANGED between 2023 and 2024 - from describing client spending budgets as a 'dependency' in 2023 to describing them as something that 'impacts' the business in 2024. This is a meaningful semantic shift that the ground truth interprets as IBM repositioning how it communicates risk. However, the LLM claims the language is 'identical' in both years and that there was 'no change in wording.' This is a direct contradiction of the ground truth. The LLM then draws the opposite conclusion - that the unchanged language shows 'continued perception of strong dependency' - when the ground truth indicates the language DID change to suggest less core dependency. The LLM's reasoning is internally logical (if the language were identical, then dependency perception would be unchanged), but it is based on a false factual premise about what the filings actually say. The LLM appears to have either misread the filings or failed to properly compare the 2023 and 2024 language. The quantitative accuracy score is high because there are no specific numbers to verify, but the qualitative accuracy is very low because the fundamental factual claim about whether language changed is wrong. This is a critical failure in multi-hop reasoning - the model needed to synthesize information from both 2023 and 2024 filings and identify the evolution, but instead it asserted no evolution occurred.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions of $7.2 billion related to affordable housing and other projects, with additional investments not expected to be significant. By 2024, the unfunded capital contributions increased to $7.5 billion, continuing the pattern of manageable expected commitments. This indicates a relatively stable investment strategy in affordable housing, with no significant escalation in contingent obligations despite an increase in total equity investments from $15.8 billion in 2023 to $16.7 billion in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 the Corporation reported $7.2 billion of unfunded capital contributions for its affordable‑housing equity investments, and it noted that any extra funding “has not been and are not expected to be significant.” By year‑end 2024 that unfunded amount rose modestly to $7.5 billion (with total affordable‑housing equity rising to $16.7 billion) but the same disclaimer about additional investments remaining insignificant was unchanged【page_132】. This modest increase, coupled with the continued emphasis that extra commitments will be limited, shows the Corporation is maintaining a steady, low‑risk, incremental approach to affordable‑housing investments rather than pursuing large new outlays.",

The modest increase calculation ($7.2B to $7.5B = $300M increase) is implicitly correct. ENTITY ACCURACY: Correctly identifies the Corporation, affordable housing projects, unfunded capital contributions, and equity investments. Years (2023, 2024) are properly referenced. MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two years, comparing the evolution of obligations and connecting it to overall investment strategy. It correctly identifies the pattern of stability despite growth. REASONING QUALITY: The interpretation that this represents a 'steady, low-risk, incremental approach' is well-supported by the data showing modest increases coupled with consistent language about limited additional commitments. COMPLETENESS: Addresses both parts of the question - how obligations evolved (2023 to 2024) and what this indicates about strategy. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM answer includes a page reference (page_132) which adds credibility but wasn't in the ground truth. The wording 'modest increase' and 'steady, low-risk, incremental approach' are interpretive but semantically aligned with the ground truth's 'relatively stable investment strategy' and 'manageable expected commitments.'

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's approach to capital distributions evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of regulatory constraints and internal liquidity mechanisms?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo emphasized the Federal Reserve's requirement for large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit annual capital plans, including planned capital distributions such as dividends, and compliance with Basel III capital requirements, leverage ratios, and capital surcharges for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Failure to meet these could limit capital distributions. By 2024, the company introduced a new internal liquidity mechanism through the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), which imposed restrictions on dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if bankruptcy proceedings are authorized. This indicates a shift from purely regulatory constraints to a combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations on capital distributions.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing Wells Fargo stressed that dividend and share‑repurchase payments are limited by federal‑ and state‑level statutory caps, the FRB’s annual capital‑plan and Basel III/GSIB‑surcharge rules, and by the Support Agreement, which can bar dividends if certain liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined triggers【page_4†L1-L9】【page_5†L1-L9】【page_6†L1-L9】. By the 2024 filing the company has added a more detailed internal liquidity structure—using the intermediate holding company (IHC), subordinated notes and a committed line of credit to move assets and provide capital/liquidity to the bank and its covered entities—while still noting that the same regulatory caps and trigger‑based restrictions can curtail dividend payments, showing a shift toward supplementing external regulatory limits with internal liquidity mechanisms【page_6†L1-L12】【page_6†L13-L22】.",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the key regulatory constraints in 2023 (Federal Reserve capital plan requirements, Basel III, GSIB surcharges) and accurately notes these mechanisms in the original answer. (2) Accurately identifies the Support Agreement and IHC as new internal liquidity mechanisms introduced by 2024. (3) Correctly characterizes the shift from purely regulatory constraints to a combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations. (4) Properly synthesizes multi-hop information across 2023 and 2024 filings. (5) Accurately mentions specific mechanisms like subordinated notes and committed lines of credit as part of the 2024 internal liquidity structure. (6) No quantitative errors detected - no specific dollar amounts or percentages were claimed that could be verified as incorrect. MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM answer mentions 'federal- and state-level statutory caps' in 2023, which adds a detail not explicitly emphasized in the ground truth answer, though this is not necessarily incorrect - it represents additional context rather than an error. (2) The ground truth answer emphasizes the 'shift' more explicitly as moving from 'purely regulatory constraints' to 'combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations,' while the LLM frames it as 'supplementing external regulatory limits with internal liquidity mechanisms' - these are semantically equivalent but the framing is slightly different. (3) The LLM answer could have been slightly more explicit about the trigger-based restrictions being a NEW feature in 2024 (the Support Agreement), though this is reasonably implied. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two fiscal years (2023 and 2024) and correctly identifies the evolution in Wells Fargo's approach.

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2022 positioning centered on the Mellanox acquisition and high-performance interconnect business; (2) Accurately describes the 2024 evolution toward a comprehensive AI-driven data-center platform encompassing GPUs, CPUs, DPUs, networking, AI software, and DGX Cloud services; (3) Properly synthesizes the strategic shift from networking-focused add-on to integrated compute-and-networking pillar; (4) Appropriately cites multiple page references suggesting multi-document synthesis; (5) Captures the essence of NVIDIA's strategic repositioning toward AI and data center solutions. MINOR GAPS: (1) The ground truth mentions the specific 2022 revenue figure of $11.046 billion, which the LLM answer does not include—this is a notable omission for quantitative completeness; (2) The ground truth references specific application domains (molecular dynamics simulation, climate forecasting) that the LLM answer omits, though the LLM does mention automotive, healthcare, and financial services partnerships; (3) The ground truth explicitly mentions 'end-to-end networking platforms (InfiniBand and Ethernet)' while the LLM uses more general 'networking' terminology. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM avoids making specific numerical claims that could be incorrect, which is appropriate given the question's qualitative nature. The absence of the $11.046 billion figure is a minor quantitative gap but doesn't constitute an error. QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The reasoning about the strategic evolution is sound and well-articulated, correctly identifying the transformation from acquisition-focused to platform-integrated positioning.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan's 10-K filing primarily introduced MEV (Macroeconomic Variable) as a defined term within the glossary, with no explicit application or strategic context provided. By 2024, the treatment of MEV evolved significantly, as it became a core component in the estimation of collateral values for mortgage risk modeling. Specifically, in 2024, MEV was applied through MSA-level home price indices, which were used to forecast collateral values for junior lien home equity products. This shift indicates a move from a purely definitional disclosure in 2023 to a functional, risk-modelling role in 2024, particularly in the context of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio calculations.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing the glossary (page 318) lists loan‑level risk terms but does not contain a definition for “MEV,” and mortgage risk is described only with traditional metrics such as LTV, credit scores and product‑type categories (page 319). By the 2024 filing the firm adds a distinct entry “MEV – Macroeconomic variable” (page 332) and explicitly links macro data—e.g., MSA‑level home‑price index forecasts—to the estimated collateral values used in LTV calculations for mortgage products, showing that macroeconomic variables are now formally incorporated into its mortgage‑risk modeling.",

MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM states MEV was not in the 2023 glossary at all, while the ground truth says it was 'primarily introduced MEV as a defined term within the glossary' - this is a subtle but meaningful discrepancy. The ground truth indicates MEV was defined in 2023 but lacked strategic context, whereas the LLM suggests it was absent entirely; (2) The LLM doesn't explicitly mention CLTV (combined loan-to-value) calculations, though it references 'LTV calculations' which is semantically close but not identical; (3) The phrase 'junior lien home equity products' from the ground truth is not mentioned in the LLM answer, representing a minor omission of specific product context. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: Page numbers and year references are correct. No calculations required. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two filing years and connects glossary definitions to risk modeling applications.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Card Member Loans were primarily described as a core component of American Express's lending business, directly contributing to net interest income and reflecting the company's lending features such as Pay Over Time and Plan It. These loans were positioned as a stable and integral part of the company's financial model. By 2023, however, the narrative shifted as the company noted increasing risks to Card Member Loans due to external pressures such as heightened competition, the rise of alternative financing products like buy now, pay later services, and macroeconomic disruptions including natural disasters affecting key states like Florida and California. These factors were noted to negatively impact credit performance and borrowing trends, signaling a more vulnerable position for this revenue stream compared to the previous year.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Card Member Loans were discussed mainly as a component of net‑interest income, with the company emphasizing metrics such as net‑interest yield and net write‑off rates to gauge loan performance (see page 89). By 2023 the loan portfolio—particularly the cobrand segment—had grown to about 36 % of worldwide Card Member loans, making loan‑derived interest a noticeably larger share of revenue (page 27), while credit performance was strained by regional economic disruptions (page 26) and intense competitive pressure from other networks and alternative lenders threatened discount revenue and could curb loan growth (page 28).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel still owned and operated its NAND memory business, which was generating losses of $4,306 million in net revenue and contributing a negative $1,369 million to operating income. By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing. This strategic exit removed the financial drag of the NAND segment from Intel's operations, allowing the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy and reduce restructuring and operational costs.",

By the 2023 filing Intel simply referred to the 2020 agreement to sell the NAND business, implying the divestiture was effectively completed and the segment no longer appeared in the consolidated results, removing the low‑margin drag and contributing to higher operating margins in 2023【page_53】.",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the two-closing structure of the SK Hynix transaction, with first closing on Dec 29, 2021; (2) Accurately cites the financial impact numbers ($4.3B revenue reduction, $1.4B operating income reduction); (3) Properly explains the 2022 vs 2023 evolution - showing NAND as a separate line item in 2022 but de-consolidated by 2023; (4) Correctly identifies the strategic benefit of removing the low-margin drag; (5) Good use of source citations. CRITICAL ERROR: The LLM states the NAND segment 'cut net revenue by $4.3 billion and operating income by $1.4 billion' in 2022, but the ground truth indicates these were LOSSES of $4,306 million in net revenue and a NEGATIVE $1,369 million contribution to operating income. The LLM's phrasing is ambiguous - it could be interpreted as the segment reducing consolidated totals (which would be incorrect if NAND was already de-consolidated in Q1 2022) or as the segment's own performance (which would be correct). The ground truth clearly states these were the segment's own financial results showing losses. QUANTITATIVE ISSUES: The numbers themselves ($4.3B/$4.306B and $1.4B/$1.369B) are correct in magnitude, but the characterization of what these numbers represent is unclear in the LLM answer. The operating margin calculation ('≈-0.1%') is not verified against ground truth and appears potentially incorrect depending on Intel's total operating income. REASONING: The multi-hop synthesis is sound - correctly connecting the transaction timeline, financial impact, and strategic implications across 2022-2023. However, the ambiguity about whether these figures represent segment losses or consolidated impact reductions creates confusion about the actual financial mechanics. The answer would score higher if it clearly stated these were the NAND segment's own losses/negative contributions rather than impacts on consolidated figures.",

(4) Structure consistency: The answer correctly notes that both statements present a three-year historical view, matching the ground truth. The LLM provides clear page references (page_31 for 2022, page_19 for 2024) which adds credibility. The reasoning is sound - the model correctly synthesized information across two different SEC filings and identified the temporal shift. The wording is slightly different from the ground truth (e.g., 'dropping the 2019-2021 period and adding the newer 2022-2024 period' vs 'shifted forward by two years') but conveys the same semantic meaning and is arguably more explicit about what changed.

This is a significant temporal error that affects the accuracy of the multi-hop synthesis. (2) INCOMPLETE LINKAGE: The ground truth explicitly states the 21% GDV growth 'directly contributing to a 22% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis' - the LLM mentions the connection but doesn't quantify the revenue impact (22% increase), missing a key financial performance metric. (3) MISSING CONTEXT: The ground truth emphasizes the shift from 'emphasizing GDV's financial impact to focusing on its role as a descriptive business metric' - while the LLM captures this conceptually, it doesn't explicitly state this interpretive conclusion about the significance of the shift.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer demonstrates reasonable multi-hop synthesis across 2022 and 2024 filings, correctly identifying the evolution in how GDV is presented.

      "question": "How did the impact of the one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision on Apple's effective tax rate evolve between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "The one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision remained consistent at $10.2 billion net in both 2023 and 2024. However, while the 2023 disclosure framed this as a new charge impacting the 2024 tax rate compared to 2023, the 2024 disclosure reflects that this charge had fully materialized and remained a key factor in maintaining a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. Thus, the nature of the charge itself did not change, but its impact transitioned from being prospective in 2023 to realized in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s effective tax rate jumped from 14.7 % in 2023 to 24.1 % in 2024 – an increase of roughly 9.4 percentage points – because the 2024 filing records a $10.2 billion one‑time income‑tax charge tied to the State Aid Decision that was not present in 2023 【page_28】. The one‑time charge was the primary driver of the higher 2024 effective rate, whereas the 2023 rate reflected only the regular tax mix 【page_28】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "CRITICAL ERRORS IDENTIFIED: (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURE: The LLM claims the $10.2 billion charge 'was not present in 2023,' but the ground truth explicitly states the charge was $10.2 billion net in BOTH 2023 and 2024. This is a fundamental factual error. The LLM incorrectly frames this as a new 2024 charge when it actually existed in both years. (2) MISINTERPRETATION OF EVOLUTION: The ground truth indicates the charge remained consistent at $10.2 billion in both years, with the key difference being that in 2023 it was framed as prospective (impacting future 2024 rate) while in 2024 it was realized. The LLM completely misses this nuance and incorrectly suggests the charge only appeared in 2024. (3) EFFECTIVE TAX RATE NUMBERS: While the LLM provides specific ETR figures (14.7% in 2023, 24.1% in 2024), these cannot be verified against the ground truth provided, which does not include these specific percentages. The 9.4 percentage point increase calculation is mathematically correct IF those rates are accurate, but the attribution is wrong. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: The LLM failed to synthesize the key insight that the charge amount remained constant across both years - only its characterization changed from prospective to realized. The answer suggests a new charge in 2024, which contradicts the ground truth. (5) MISSING CONTEXT: The LLM does not address how the impact 'evolved' in the sense of transitioning from prospective to realized, which is the core of the ground truth answer. The answer is fundamentally incorrect about the presence/absence of the charge across years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BK's Other Segment included corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments, and certain business exits. By 2024, the segment continued to include corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, and certain business exits; however, 'renewable energy' was replaced with 'tax credit investments' as a highlighted component. This indicates a strategic shift in the types of corporate investments being emphasized within the Other Segment.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing the Other segment was described as “the leasing portfolio, corporate‑treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank‑owned life insurance, **renewable‑energy** and other corporate investments, and certain business exits.” In the 2024 filing the same elements remain, but **renewable‑energy** is replaced by **tax‑credit investments** (“leasing portfolio, corporate‑treasury activities …, derivatives …, corporate and bank‑owned life insurance, **tax‑credit investments** and other corporate investments, and certain business exits”) 【page_7】. Thus, the Other segment’s composition stayed largely unchanged except for swapping renewable‑energy holdings for tax‑credit investments.",

The answer properly synthesizes the multi-hop comparison across two fiscal years and accurately captures the strategic shift. One minor point: the LLM answer includes 'leasing portfolio' as a component in both years, while the ground truth does not explicitly mention this element. However, this appears to be additional detail from the actual filings rather than an error, as the LLM cites page references. The core finding—that renewable energy was replaced by tax credit investments while other elements remained—is correctly identified in both answers. The reasoning is sound, the entities (BK, years 2023-2024, segment components) are all correct, and the semantic meaning matches the ground truth perfectly.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal did not explicitly disclose its cross-border TPV figures, but it emphasized the role of foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposure risks on its payments platform, indicating that cross-border transactions were a material part of its business requiring active financial risk management. By 2024, PayPal explicitly stated that cross-border TPV occurs primarily between two PayPal accounts in different countries and includes transactions initiated through its Xoom product. Additionally, TPV grew from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, representing a 10% increase. The inclusion of Xoom in the definition of cross-border TPV in 2024 suggests a more integrated approach to international payments compared to 2022, where foreign exchange risk management was discussed in broader terms without specific product linkage.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal’s cross‑border TPV share slipped modestly, falling from 13 % of total TPV in 2022 to 12 % in both 2023 and 2024 (2024 10‑K, “Percent of cross‑border TPV”).  The change coincided with a shift in the business mix – Braintree, core PayPal and Venmo products drove most of the overall TPV growth (Braintree’s larger share raised total TPV and transaction expense) and the firm kept cross‑border capability through its Xoom service while emphasizing larger‑merchant volume and more profitable merchant negotiations.",

Key issues: (1) QUANTITATIVE ERRORS: The LLM claims cross-border TPV was 13% in 2022 and 12% in 2023-2024, but the ground truth does not provide these percentages and instead focuses on absolute TPV figures ($1.53T in 2023, $1.68T in 2024 representing 10% growth). The LLM appears to have introduced unsupported percentage figures. (2) MISSING CRITICAL DATA: The LLM completely omits the actual TPV growth figures ($1.53T to $1.68T, 10% increase) that are central to the ground truth answer. (3) INCOMPLETE EVOLUTION NARRATIVE: While the LLM mentions Xoom, it fails to capture the key distinction in the ground truth - that 2022 lacked explicit cross-border TPV disclosure but emphasized FX risk management, while 2024 explicitly defined cross-border TPV and linked it to Xoom. The ground truth emphasizes a shift from implicit to explicit disclosure and product integration. (4) BUSINESS STRUCTURE CHANGES: The LLM discusses Braintree, core PayPal, and Venmo growth but doesn't clearly connect this to the evolution of cross-border TPV specifically or explain how these changes relate to the cross-border business evolution. (5) REASONING QUALITY: The LLM's logic about cross-border TPV declining as a percentage while other products grew is plausible but unsupported by the ground truth data provided. The answer appears to synthesize information that may not be directly from the source documents.

      "question": "How did Broadcom's visibility into future revenue from its Semiconductor Solutions Segment evolve between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, and what specific changes in customer commitments or constraints contributed to this evolution?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's revenue visibility for its Semiconductor Solutions Segment was limited due to ongoing supply chain constraints, particularly with wafers and substrates, which affected its ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner. This uncertainty made it difficult to predict the longer-term sustainability of increased profitability. By fiscal year 2023, there was a significant improvement in revenue visibility, as evidenced by the $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations under multi-year contracts in the semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments. This indicates stronger, more firmly committed customer relationships and a more stable outlook compared to the previous year's uncertainty.",
      "llm_answer": "In FY 2022 Broadcom said its view of future Semiconductor Solutions revenue was limited because “we continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain, including with respect to wafers and substrates…we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner” (2022 10‑K, p. 61). By FY 2023 the company noted that “certain multi‑year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions … contain firmly committed amounts” and that “our customers generally do not exercise termination‑for‑convenience rights,” which gives it clearer insight into future revenue even though most contracts remain short‑term (2023 10‑K, p. 66).",

The qualitative reasoning about supply chain limitations and customer commitment changes is sound and well-supported with specific quotes from the 10-K filings. However, there is a significant quantitative accuracy issue: the ground truth specifically mentions '$20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations' as evidence of improved visibility in FY2023, but the LLM answer completely omits this specific dollar figure. This is a material omission because the question asks about 'how' visibility evolved, and the $20.5B figure is concrete evidence of that evolution. The LLM answer does provide relevant context about multi-year contracts and customer commitment patterns that the ground truth mentions, and correctly cites the 2022 and 2023 10-K filings. The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the answer successfully synthesizes information about constraints in 2022 and improvements in 2023. The main weakness is the failure to include the specific quantitative metric ($20.5B in remaining performance obligations) that directly demonstrates the improvement in visibility.

The ground truth states the 2023 net inventory balance was $4,351 million 'as of December 30, 2022' (the fiscal year-end date for the 2023 filing). However, the LLM states it was '$4.35 billion at December 30 2023,' which is incorrect—December 30, 2023 would be the fiscal year-end for a 2024 filing, not 2023. This is a critical error in date accuracy. CORRECT ELEMENTS: (1) The 2022 inventory figure of $1.96 billion (or $1,955 million) as of December 25, 2021 is correct. (2) The characterization of inventory methodology as 'lower of cost or estimated net-realizable value' is accurate. (3) The description of adjustments based on forecasted demand, historical activity, and forward-looking factors is correct. (4) The identification of 'excess and obsolescence reserves' in the 2023 methodology is accurate. (5) The expansion of methodology to include competitive conditions, product life cycles, and technological changes is correctly identified. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM successfully synthesized information across the 2022 and 2023 filings and correctly identified the evolution in methodology. The comparison between the two years' approaches is sound. However, the date error undermines the accuracy of the quantitative comparison.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the 10-K filing included standard sections such as Business (Item 1), Risk Factors (Item 1A), and Properties (Item 2), with no dedicated cybersecurity section. By 2023, a new Item 1C was added specifically for Cybersecurity, appearing immediately after Unresolved Staff Comments and before Properties.

(2) The LLM mentions additional sections like 'Human-Capital Management and Supervision & Regulation' that are not mentioned in the ground truth answer, which focuses specifically on the cybersecurity section addition. While these may be accurate, they represent information beyond what was provided in the ground truth and could indicate hallucination or over-specification. (3) The LLM correctly captures that cybersecurity was embedded in risk factors in 2022 and became a dedicated section in 2023, matching the ground truth. (4) The interpretation about regulatory emphasis and strategic priorities is appropriate and semantically equivalent to the ground truth's discussion of 'emerging regulatory expectations' and 'proactive alignment with evolving governance standards.' The core multi-hop reasoning is sound: comparing 2022 vs 2023 structure and drawing conclusions about regulatory/strategic shifts.

The ground truth only mentions 'net losses' without quantifying the amount. This is a significant factual claim not supported by the provided ground truth. (2) INCOMPLETE MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS - The LLM completely omits the fiscal 2023 data point ($75 million gain), which is essential to answering the question about evolution 'from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024.' The ground truth explicitly mentions the three-year progression: losses (2022) → $75M gains (2023) → $14M gains (2024). The LLM only compares endpoints (2022 vs 2024), missing the critical intermediate year that shows the volatility pattern. (3) INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS - The ground truth emphasizes 'a significant drop in gains year-over-year' from 2023 to 2024 and describes this as indicating 'volatility and reduced positive impact.' The LLM's characterization of 'a swing from sizable loss to modest gain' misses the more important story of the decline from 2023 to 2024. (4) CORRECT ELEMENTS - The LLM correctly identifies the $14 million gain in fiscal 2024 and correctly characterizes the directional shift from negative to positive. The semantic interpretation that this represents a 'turnaround' is reasonable. VERDICT: While the LLM captures the basic directional movement and correctly identifies the 2024 figure, it introduces an unsupported specific number for 2022, omits the crucial 2023 data point, and therefore fails to properly address the 'evolution' aspect of the multi-hop question.

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The LLM states 2024 figures as $161M (Series B) and $20M (Series C), but ground truth shows $19M (Series B) and $11M (Series C). These are not minor rounding differences - they represent 747% and 82% overstatements respectively. The LLM also incorrectly states the 2024 amounts 'rose' when they actually 'decreased' from 2022 levels. (2) DIRECTIONAL ERROR: The ground truth clearly indicates a DECLINE from 2022 to 2024 ($135M→$19M for Series B, $6M→$11M for Series C), but the LLM claims an INCREASE and uses language like 'rose' and 'more aggressively,' which is the opposite of what occurred. (3) REASONING FAILURE: The LLM's interpretation that larger adjustments indicate 'more aggressive' use is contradicted by the actual data showing smaller adjustments in 2024. The conclusion about 'preserving equity and limiting dilution' is unsupported by the actual trend of declining conversion rate adjustments. (4) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year comparison, which is the core requirement of this multi-hop question. The reference to 'VE-territory litigation losses' appears to be fabricated context not present in the ground truth. (5) STRATEGIC INTERPRETATION: The ground truth correctly identifies a 'significant decline' suggesting a 'strategic shift,' while the LLM incorrectly interprets increasing usage when usage actually decreased. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the financial data and its implications.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Semiconductor Solutions Segment was significantly impacted by supply chain constraints, particularly with respect to wafers and substrates, which limited the company's ability to meet demand. Despite these challenges, the segment experienced robust profitability driven by a supply imbalance. By fiscal year 2024, the strategic focus had evolved, with increased emphasis on AI networking and connectivity as key growth areas. The segment expanded its product offerings to include AI-related technologies, aligning with market demand shifts. Additionally, the 2024 fiscal year, being a 53-week year, led to higher net revenue and gross margin dollars compared to the 52-week 2023 fiscal year, indicating improved revenue generation capabilities and operational scalability.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022 Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions segment was still anchored to its broad networking‑ and data‑center‑oriented product portfolio, and its profitability was boosted by a supply‑demand imbalance even as it wrestled with ongoing wafer and substrate shortages that limited its ability to satisfy demand (2022 p.61). By fiscal 2024 the segment’s strategy had pivoted to emphasize AI‑enabled networking and other AI‑related products—supported by strategic acquisitions such as VMware and Seagate’s SoC assets—making AI networking a key revenue driver, while the earlier supply‑chain constraints are no longer highlighted (2024 p.37‑38).",

It accurately captures: (1) FY2022 supply chain constraints (wafers/substrates), (2) profitability from supply-demand imbalance in 2022, (3) strategic pivot to AI networking by FY2024, (4) AI as a key revenue driver in 2024, and (5) the shift away from highlighting supply chain constraints. The multi-hop synthesis across fiscal years is sound, and the mention of strategic acquisitions (VMware, Seagate SoC assets) adds relevant context not explicitly in the ground truth but consistent with Broadcom's strategy.\n\nWEAKNESSES: The LLM answer omits a critical quantitative element from the ground truth: the 53-week vs 52-week fiscal year comparison between FY2024 and FY2023, which the original answer specifically highlights as leading to 'higher net revenue and gross margin dollars.' This is a material omission for a question asking about revenue drivers and evolution. The LLM does not provide any specific financial metrics, revenue figures, or quantitative comparisons that would strengthen the answer. The page citations (2022 p.61, 2024 p.37-38) appear reasonable but cannot be verified against the ground truth.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two fiscal years and identifies the strategic shift, but fails to complete the full picture by missing the operational/calendar impact (53-week year) that affected FY2024 revenue generation.\n\nQUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: No specific numbers are provided in the LLM answer, making it impossible to verify quantitative accuracy. The omission of the 53-week/52-week comparison is a significant gap.\n\nQUALITATIVE ACCURACY: Strong on strategic narrative and entity identification, but incomplete on the full scope of revenue drivers mentioned in the ground truth.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software Segment was primarily a recipient of internal capital allocation through business acquisitions, with $110 million in intangible assets and $164 million in goodwill allocated to it from the $245 million total acquisition spend. By fiscal year 2024, the segment's role evolved from being just a beneficiary of internal investment to being a strategic stakeholder in Broadcom's broader infrastructure technology vision. The 2024 filing highlights that the infrastructure software segment is now a core pillar of Broadcom's strategy, encompassing private and hybrid cloud, cybersecurity, application networking, and FC SAN solutions, and is positioned as a key differentiator in Broadcom's comprehensive infrastructure technology suite. This represents a transformation in both strategic positioning and financial prioritization.",
      "llm_answer": "Broadcom’s infrastructure‑software business went from a modest, incremental build‑out in FY 2022—where it completed four small acquisitions worth $245 million (including $164 million of goodwill and $110 million of intangible assets) and was still working toward a pending VMware merger—to a centerpiece of its strategy in FY 2024, with a clear emphasis on deepening enterprise relationships, expanding its license model and “strengthening … penetration” across core, mainframe, VMware and Symantec customers (see page 37‑39).  That strategic shift was backed by a massive financial commitment: Broadcom closed the $30.8 billion cash‑and‑stock purchase of VMware (fair‑value $53.4 billion) in FY 2024, dwarfing the $245 million of FY 2022 software‑segment spend (see page 38‑39 and page 99).",

(2) The multi-hop reasoning effectively synthesizes information across fiscal years 2022-2024, correctly identifying the evolution from incremental acquisitions to a major strategic acquisition. (3) Entity identification is precise: correctly names Broadcom, Infrastructure Software Segment, VMware, and references to Symantec and mainframe customers. (4) Strategic positioning is accurately captured: the answer correctly identifies the shift from 'modest, incremental build-out' to 'centerpiece of strategy' and mentions specific strategic pillars (private/hybrid cloud, cybersecurity, application networking, FC SAN). (5) The comparison is logically sound, showing how the $245M FY2022 spend was 'dwarfed' by the $30.8B VMware acquisition. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM answer provides slightly more operational detail (mentioning specific customer segments like mainframe and Symantec customers, license model expansion) compared to the ground truth, but this represents valuable elaboration rather than inaccuracy. The ground truth emphasizes 'strategic positioning and financial prioritization' while the LLM answer demonstrates both through concrete examples.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVDA's OEM and Other Revenue was $1,162 million, largely driven by CMP sales which contributed $550 million during that year. However, by fiscal year 2023, OEM and Other Revenue had declined to $455 million, indicating a significant drop in this segment's revenue contribution. This represents a decrease of over 60% in OEM and Other Revenue from 2022 to 2023. The decline reflects reduced demand for CMP products, which was tied to volatility in the cryptocurrency market. This shift shows a diminishing role of the OEM and Other segment in NVDA’s overall revenue strategy during this period.",

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All key numbers are correct - FY2022 OEM and Other Revenue of $1,162 million, FY2023 figure of $455 million, and the calculated decline of approximately 60% are all accurate. The calculation is correct: ($1,162M - $455M) / $1,162M = 60.9%, which rounds to 'roughly 60%' as stated. ENTITY ACCURACY: NVDA ticker, fiscal years 2022 and 2023, and the OEM and Other Revenue segment are all correctly identified. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (1) how the revenue evolved (specific numbers and percentage decline), and (2) what this indicates about the segment's contribution to overall revenue strategy. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly synthesizes information by connecting the revenue decline to reduced CMP/crypto-mining demand and contextualizing this within NVDA's broader strategic shift toward higher-growth segments (Data Center and Gaming). This demonstrates sound multi-hop reasoning across the filing data. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The ground truth explicitly mentions that CMP sales contributed $550 million in FY2022, which the LLM references parenthetically as 'CMP/crypto‑mining products' but doesn't provide the specific $550M figure. However, this is a minor omission that doesn't affect the core answer's accuracy. The LLM's interpretation that the company is 'relying less on OEM/Other sales' and 'emphasizing higher‑growth, higher‑margin areas' is a reasonable strategic inference that aligns with the ground truth's conclusion about the segment's 'diminishing role.'

In 2024, the disclosure expanded to include limitations imposed by U.S. banking laws, regulatory capital requirements, Delaware law provisions, and the impact of preferred stock dividend delays, indicating a more nuanced and restricted view of its ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends.

The LLM answer explicitly states 'no material shift' and claims the situation is essentially the same in both years ('in both years'), which directly contradicts the ground truth's finding of growing regulatory/structural constraints. This is a critical failure in multi-hop reasoning - the question asks HOW the dependence EVOLVED, and the LLM incorrectly concludes there was no meaningful evolution. While the LLM correctly identifies that the company is a non-operating holding company dependent on subsidiary dividends (accurate entity identification and basic facts), it fails to capture the temporal comparison and the expansion of disclosed constraints. The LLM does not address the specific 2024 additions (banking law limitations, regulatory capital requirements, Delaware law provisions, preferred stock dividend delays) that distinguish the 2024 disclosure from 2023.

By 2023, the composition expanded to include a more pronounced focus on cloud services, as reflected in the explicit categorization of 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth' as a tracked metric. This indicates a strategic evolution toward integrating cloud-based offerings more prominently into the Windows Commercial portfolio, moving beyond traditional licensing. While specific dollar figures aren't provided, the shift is evident in how Microsoft now highlights cloud services alongside traditional volume licensing, suggesting a transformation in the revenue model with a stronger emphasis on recurring cloud-based revenue streams.",

By FY 2023 the company reported a specific “Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth” metric and a 13% increase in the More Personal Computing segment (pages 42‑44), showing that cloud‑based subscriptions are gaining a larger share of the Windows Commercial mix while volume licensing continues to be a core driver.",

Entity identification is accurate (Microsoft, Windows Commercial, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, More Personal Computing segment). The reasoning about the strategic evolution toward cloud-based offerings is sound and aligns with the ground truth. However, there are quantitative accuracy concerns: (1) The LLM cites a '13% increase in the More Personal Computing segment' which is a specific number not present in the ground truth answer. While this may be factually correct from the filing, it introduces a specific metric that wasn't part of the original answer's scope, potentially adding information beyond what was verified. (2) The LLM references specific page numbers (14-15, 42-44) which cannot be verified against the ground truth. (3) The ground truth explicitly states 'specific dollar figures aren't provided,' yet the LLM doesn't make this limitation as clear. The qualitative reasoning is strong - the answer correctly identifies the composition shift, the emphasis on cloud services, and the continued role of volume licensing. The semantic equivalence is good, with the LLM conveying the same fundamental message about the evolution toward cloud services while maintaining traditional licensing. The main weakness is the introduction of the 13% figure without clear sourcing verification, which slightly reduces quantitative accuracy despite the overall answer being directionally correct.",

The original answer states that in 2022, BNY Mellon SA/NV operated branches in 8 locations: Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, Luxembourg City, Madrid, Milan, and Paris. However, the LLM answer introduces Brussels as a 'headquarters' in addition to these 8 branches, claiming 'eight locations in continental Europe' but then listing 9 locations (Brussels + the 8 branches). This is internally inconsistent and factually incorrect—the ground truth does not mention Brussels as a separate location in 2022. The LLM then correctly identifies the expansion to Wroclaw, Poland by 2024, bringing the total to 9 sites, but this count is based on the erroneous inclusion of Brussels. The multi-hop reasoning about the Securities Services segment expansion is sound and well-articulated, correctly synthesizing the connection between geographic expansion and business segment growth. The qualitative analysis of what the expansion indicates (deliberate push into continental Europe, coverage extension) aligns well with the ground truth. However, the quantitative error regarding the 2022 baseline (9 locations vs. 8) is a material factual mistake that affects the accuracy of the geographic evolution narrative. The answer demonstrates good contextual understanding and appropriate relevance to the question, but the factual error in the baseline year significantly reduces overall correctness.",

In 2024, the disclosures expanded to include $8 million in losses on foreclosed properties, down from $10 million in 2023, indicating improved asset management or reduced exposure.

(2) The 33% growth reference for 2022 is correctly cited as a qualitative metric without absolute dollar amounts. (3) All numeric values are accurate with proper formatting. Multi-hop reasoning: The answer successfully synthesizes the evolution across two fiscal years (2022 to 2023), correctly identifying the shift from qualitative to quantitative disclosure. The model properly traces the progression: 2022 identified TPV as a key metric with growth percentages but no absolute figure, while 2023 provided the specific $1.53 trillion disclosure. Entity accuracy: PayPal is correctly identified, fiscal years 2022 and 2023 are properly distinguished, and TPV (total payment volume) is accurately defined and contextualized. The answer goes slightly beyond the ground truth by providing specific page references (2022 p. 37-39, 2023 p. 7) and quoting the 33% growth figure, which adds credibility and detail without introducing errors. Semantic equivalence: The LLM's characterization of the shift as moving from 'qualitative reference to specific numeric disclosure' and emphasizing 'quantitative transparency' aligns perfectly with the ground truth's description of 'greater transparency and emphasis on measurable business performance.'

However, the ground truth states that in 2023, GDV 'only appeared in a chart format without a direct explanation of its impact on revenue' - meaning it was presented passively without prominent narrative integration. The LLM reverses the prominence relationship between years. (2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY ISSUES: The LLM provides specific numbers ($9.0 trillion, 12% growth) that are not verified in the ground truth and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. The ground truth only mentions 21% GDV growth in 2022 and does not provide absolute dollar figures for either year.

This is a 180-degree reversal of the actual trend. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year comparison.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's semiconductor solutions segment had a high degree of customer concentration, with one customer accounting for 20% of net revenue. This indicated a strong dependency on a single client for a significant portion of the segment's income. Following the acquisition of VMware in November 2023, Broadcom significantly expanded its infrastructure software capabilities, signaling a strategic shift toward a more diversified technology portfolio that now includes enterprise software and cloud services alongside semiconductors. This acquisition suggests that Broadcom is broadening its business model beyond its earlier reliance on concentrated semiconductor sales, potentially reducing its exposure to customer concentration risk in the semiconductor segment by growing complementary revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "Broadcom’s post‑VMware strategy treats its semiconductor‑solutions business as a technology platform that under‑pins a now‑larger, software‑focused portfolio – the company says it acquired VMware “to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities” (AVGO 2024 10‑K, p. 58).  The semiconductor‑solutions segment’s balance stayed essentially flat at roughly $26 billion (≈$25.9 bn in 2020 and $25.97 bn in 2022) while the infrastructure‑software segment grew, signalling a shift of strategic emphasis toward software and away from the heavily concentrated semiconductor customer base noted in FY 2022 (AVGO 2022 10‑K, “Concentrations of … significant customers”) (AVGO 2022 10‑K, p. 59).

WEAKNESSES: (1) The semiconductor solutions segment revenue figures cited ($25.9B in 2020 and $25.97B in 2022) cannot be verified against the ground truth, which does not provide these specific numbers. The claim that the segment 'stayed essentially flat' is presented as fact but lacks verification; (2) The LLM provides specific revenue numbers that go beyond what the ground truth establishes - the ground truth focuses on the 20% customer concentration metric and strategic implications, not on absolute segment revenues; (3) While the reasoning is sound, the introduction of unverified quantitative data (the $25.9B and $25.97B figures) introduces uncertainty about data accuracy. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes: (a) FY 2022 customer concentration data, (b) VMware acquisition details and timing, (c) strategic implications for business diversification, and (d) impact on customer concentration risk.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant factual errors that contradict the ground truth. (1) CRITICAL NUMBER ERROR: The LLM claims $3.4 billion of acquisition-related goodwill in FY 2022, but the ground truth specifies a $143 million INCREASE in goodwill due to acquisitions. These are fundamentally different figures - the LLM appears to have cited total goodwill rather than the acquisition-driven increase. (2) MISIDENTIFIED METRIC: The LLM shifts focus to $16.1 billion in inventory-purchase and supply commitments in FY 2023, which are not the same as 'warranty liabilities' mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth specifically references warranty liabilities as the post-sale obligation metric, not supply commitments. (3) INCOMPLETE SYNTHESIS: While the LLM correctly identifies the transition from goodwill to post-sale obligations, it fails to accurately capture the specific financial metrics. The ground truth emphasizes warranty liabilities related to product support, while the LLM discusses supply-and-capacity commitments, which are different types of obligations. (4) REASONING FLAW: The LLM's characterization of the $3.4 billion as a 'one-time goodwill charge' is misleading - goodwill is a balance sheet asset, not a charge. The ground truth's framing of a $143 million increase is more precise about the acquisition activity. (5) MULTI-HOP ACCURACY: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the specific financial metrics across the two fiscal years. The answer demonstrates understanding of the general concept (transition from acquisition investment to operational liability) but fails on the critical quantitative details that are essential for financial analysis.",

The answer correctly identifies the multi-hop synthesis required: tracking the same metric (3G/4G/5G-based multimode products' impact on QTL licensing revenues) across two fiscal years and calculating the directional and magnitude change. The reasoning is sound - the model properly characterizes the shift from negative to positive impact and quantifies the total change. The answer uses appropriate financial terminology ('decline,' 'reduced,' 'added,' 'boost') and maintains semantic equivalence with the ground truth. The inclusion of page references adds credibility. Minor note: The phrasing 'net shift of about $701 million' uses 'about' which is slightly informal compared to the ground truth's more precise statement, but this is a negligible semantic difference that doesn't affect factual accuracy.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the filing explicitly stated that 'our ability to return capital to shareholders [...] may be limited [...] by our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' In 2023, this language was expanded to include the phrase 'our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations [...] and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' This evolution indicates a more nuanced disclosure that retains the prior year's emphasis on preferred stock dividends as a limiting factor but adds a broader regulatory and governance context.

The LLM claims the language was 'unchanged' and 'the same statement' in both years, which is factually incorrect. This is a major error that undermines the entire answer. The LLM also misses the key insight about the evolution: that 2023 added broader regulatory and governance context while retaining the prior year's emphasis. Instead, the LLM incorrectly characterizes both years as containing identical language. The page number citations (2022 p. 5; 2023 p. 3) cannot be verified from the ground truth but are presented with false confidence. The conclusion about 'consistently cautious, disciplined approach' may be reasonable, but it's based on a false premise that the language was unchanged. The quantitative accuracy score is higher only because there are no specific numbers to verify - the dates (2022, 2023) are correct.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported that approximately 5% of its invested assets each year were subject to reinvestment risk through 2024, primarily due to the impact of declining interest rates on long-duration products and guaranteed minimum crediting rates on deferred annuities and retained asset accounts. By 2023, this percentage increased to 6% of invested assets annually, with reinvestment risk extending through 2026. This indicates a slight increase in MetLife's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and a longer duration of reinvestment risk, suggesting a more sustained vulnerability to gross margin compression under a low interest rate environment.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife noted that “only a small portion of invested assets…are subject to reinvestment risk,” quantifying it at **about 5 % of assets each year**【page_62】. The 2023 filing raises that estimate to **roughly 6 % of assets**【page_55】. The modest rise shows that MetLife’s exposure to interest‑rate fluctuations – and the resulting gross‑margin compression from reinvestment risk – has increased slightly, but it still involves a relatively small share of its overall investment portfolio.",

The basic comparison between years is sound. CRITICAL OMISSIONS: The LLM answer is incomplete on a crucial dimension. The ground truth explicitly states that reinvestment risk extended 'through 2024' in 2022 but extended 'through 2026' in 2023 - a significant extension of the duration of reinvestment risk exposure. This temporal dimension is essential to answering the question about how the 'extent' of reinvestment risk evolved. The LLM fails to capture this important detail about the lengthening duration of vulnerability. PARTIAL CREDIT ON REASONING: While the LLM correctly identifies that the increase from 5% to 6% shows 'slightly' increased exposure, it misses the fuller picture that the ground truth conveys - that the increase is both quantitative (5% to 6%) AND temporal (through 2024 to through 2026), indicating 'more sustained vulnerability.' The LLM's characterization of the exposure as 'still involves a relatively small share' is reasonable but somewhat downplays the significance of the extended duration. ENTITY AND METRIC ACCURACY: Company (MetLife) and metrics (reinvestment risk, gross margin compression, interest rate fluctuations) are correctly identified. Years (2022, 2023) are correct. CALCULATION: The comparison (5% to 6% = increase) is accurate. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: The answer captures the basic numerical evolution but fails to address the complete picture of how reinvestment risk extent evolved, particularly the critical extension of the risk period from 2024 to 2026.

By 2023, the company explicitly noted that defective inventory write-downs could result from participation in customer recalls, particularly in the automotive industry, where recalls are more formalized and can involve significant field actions.

(3) Correctly identifies the FY 2023 positioning as AI-infused, experience-driven, and cloud/on-premise/hybrid capable. (4) Properly synthesizes the integration with broader technologies: networking, security, and smart buildings (Ethernet-powered), which directly matches the ground truth's emphasis on 'broader architectural transformations' and 'interoperability and efficiency.' (5) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing strategic positioning across two fiscal years and identifying the shift from simple categorization to embedded architectural integration. (6) Includes appropriate source citations (page references) that suggest grounding in actual documents. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM answer is slightly more detailed and specific than the ground truth (e.g., explicitly naming product categories, mentioning AI-infusion, hybrid delivery models), but these additions are accurate enhancements rather than contradictions. The semantic meaning is fully preserved and arguably enriched. No quantitative errors detected. The answer comprehensively addresses all aspects of the multi-part question regarding strategic positioning and integration with other technologies.",

      "question": "How has the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue evolved between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Installed Base Growth was explicitly stated as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue alongside average revenue per user expansion and the shift from on-premises Office to Office 365. In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever. This suggests that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings state that Office Commercial revenue is “mainly affected by a combination of continued installed‑base growth and average‑revenue‑per‑user expansion, as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on‑premises to Office 365”【MSFT_10k_2023.pdf page_9】【MSFT_10k_2024.pdf page_9】. The language is essentially unchanged, indicating that installed‑base growth remains a core, unchanged driver of Office Commercial revenue across the two years.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains a fundamental misinterpretation of the question and the ground truth. CRITICAL ERRORS: (1) The LLM claims the language is 'essentially unchanged' between 2023 and 2024, directly contradicting the ground truth which explicitly states the relationship was 'reframed' and that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being 'a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.' (2) The LLM fails to recognize the nuanced evolution described in the ground truth—the shift from explicit emphasis to a more stable/assumed role. (3) The LLM provides identical quotes from both years without analyzing the semantic difference in how they frame the role of Installed Base Growth. WHAT WAS CORRECT: The LLM accurately identified the relevant pages (page 9 in both filings) and correctly quoted the language about the three factors affecting Office Commercial revenue. The numeric/date references are accurate. WHAT WAS INCORRECT: The core analytical conclusion is wrong. The ground truth explicitly describes an evolution/reframing, while the LLM concludes there is no meaningful change. This represents a failure in qualitative reasoning and synthesis—the LLM did not properly analyze how the framing of Installed Base Growth's role changed between years. The question specifically asks 'how has...evolved,' requiring identification of change, which the LLM missed entirely. The LLM's conclusion that the role is 'unchanged' directly contradicts the ground truth's assertion of transition from 'highlighted growth catalyst' to 'foundational, ongoing component.'",
