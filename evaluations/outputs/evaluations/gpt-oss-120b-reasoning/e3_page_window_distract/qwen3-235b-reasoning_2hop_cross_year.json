      "question": "How has the company's disclosure of insider stock ownership percentages for executive management evolved between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings?",
      "original_answer": "In both the 2023 and 2024 filings, the company indicated that information on stock ownership is incorporated by reference from the Proxy under the heading 'Additional Information.' However, neither filing provides specific stock ownership percentages for executives or directors directly in the 10-K document. The structure and referenced sections related to stock ownership remain unchanged between the two years, suggesting no evolution in how this information is disclosed. The lack of specific ownership percentages in both years prevents any substantive comparison of insider ownership changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2023 and 2024 Form 10‑K filings treat insider stock‑ownership data the same way – they do not list percentages for executive officers in the filing itself but instead note that the required information is provided in the company’s proxy statement (under “Equity Compensation Plans” and “Information on Stock Ownership”) and is incorporated by reference. The wording is essentially unchanged between the two years, with only the year reference updated for the newer filing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $633 million, with additions of $162 million and write-offs of $148 million. By 2024, the allowance decreased to $577 million, with additions of $122 million and write-offs of $199 million. This indicates a decreasing trend in the allowance balance, with a shift toward higher write-offs relative to additions in the later year.",

      "original_answer": "The carrying value of Cisco's long-term loan receivables decreased from $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2024. This indicates a reduction in the book value of these receivables, suggesting either collections exceeded new loan originations or increased write-downs or impairments during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco’s long‑term loan receivables were carried at about **$2.9 billion in fiscal 2023** and **$2.7 billion in fiscal 2024**, a decline of roughly **$130 million**. The decrease reflects a modest reduction in the outstanding long‑term loan portfolio, but Cisco still values these assets at an amount that closely approximates their fair value, indicating a stable and consistent asset valuation in this category.",

However, in 2023, the Growth Markets revenue decreased by 2% in U.S. dollars but increased by 7% in local currency.

      "question": "How did the growth in Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) on a U.S. dollar-converted basis evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's currency exposure during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased by 10.4%, while in 2024, the company reported GDV growth on a local currency basis of 11%. This indicates that the company's GDV growth in U.S. dollar terms slowed relative to local currency growth in 2023, suggesting a stronger U.S. dollar during that year. In 2024, the focus shifted to local currency growth without a reported U.S. dollar-converted figure, implying a potential strategic emphasis on underlying volume performance independent of currency fluctuations.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Mastercard said that GDV measured on a U.S.‑dollar‑converted basis rose 10.4% versus the prior year (page 55). For 2024 the company reports GDV growth of 11% on a local‑currency basis (page 6) but does not give a comparable U.S.‑dollar‑converted rate, implying that the dollar‑converted growth was below the 11% local‑currency increase and slower than the 10.4% seen in 2023. The gap between local‑currency and dollar‑converted growth shows that a stronger U.S. dollar in 2024 dampened the reported volume growth, highlighting the firm’s exposure to currency fluctuations.",

However, it incorrectly attributes the stronger U.S. dollar to 2024, while the original answer explicitly states the stronger USD occurred in 2023 (causing USD-converted growth to lag local growth). This reversal of the time period for currency impact constitutes a significant reasoning error. The LLM's inference about 2024 USD-converted growth being 'below 11%' is logical but speculative, as the original answer does not provide this figure.

      "question": "How has the focus of BNY Mellon's Investment and Wealth Management segment evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of asset management responsibilities and organizational structure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon's Investment and Wealth Management segment was described as part of a two-segment structure before being disaggregated into Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Investment and Wealth Management segment remained unchanged during this reorganization. It managed $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the Investment and Wealth Management segment remained one of the three principal business segments, but assets under management decreased to $2.0 trillion as of December 31, 2023. This indicates a shift in asset management scale, though the segment's structural role within the company remained consistent.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing the Investment and Wealth Management segment was left unchanged after BNY Mellon split its former Investment Services segment into Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services, with the bank‑advised investment‑management business housed in the state‑chartered Bank of New York Mellon and the wealth‑management franchise in BNY Mellon N.A. 【page_6】. By the 2023 filing the segment still covers both investment and wealth management but is now presented within a three‑segment model and reports $2.0 trillion of assets under management (down from $2.4 trillion), underscoring a sharper focus on asset‑management responsibilities while retaining the same subsidiary‑level organization of investment management under the Bank of New York Mellon and wealth management under BNY Mellon N.A. 【page_7】",

By 2024 DCAI revenue had turned around, growing 1% versus the prior year “driven by higher server revenue primarily from high‑core‑count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume”【page_15】, a result of Intel’s data‑center strategy that emphasized new Xeon 6 processors with performance‑ and efficient‑core options, integrated AI engines (Intel AMX) and the launch of Gaudi 3 AI accelerators to better compete with GPU‑centric rivals【page_17】. This modest revenue gain signals that Intel’s refreshed product roadmap is beginning to improve its competitive positioning in the data‑center market after a period of erosion.",

At that time, the company reported $2.4 trillion in assets under management. By 2024, BNY had stabilized its segmentation approach, maintaining three principal segments including Investment and Wealth Management, and reported $2.0 trillion in assets under management.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K NVIDIA disclosed that, after historically using roughly six‑month lead times, it began placing non‑cancellable orders at **12 months or longer** and paying premiums or deposits to lock in capacity—creating significant financial exposure from pre‑payments and the risk of excess inventory (2022 p. 24‑26). By the 2023 filing the company said it had **increased supply‑ and capacity‑purchases, entered prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements, and was seeing shortened lead times for certain components**, shifting risk from long‑lead‑time pre‑payments to execution risk tied to larger purchase volumes and a broader, more complex supplier base (2023 p. 34‑35).",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing Wells Fargo noted that federal law limits “covered transactions” from its subsidiary banks to 10 % of a bank’s capital‑and‑surplus for a single affiliate (20 % in the aggregate) and that the 2017 Support Agreement could bar the intermediate holding company (IHC) from paying dividends to the Parent if certain liquidity‑ or capital‑metric triggers were breached【page_5†L1-L9】【page_6†L1-L9】.  \n\nThe 2024 filing repeats those same dividend‑distribution caps but adds that the IHC’s transferred assets are expressly pledged to supply capital and liquidity to the Bank, Wells Fargo Securities, the clearing unit and other covered entities, and that if the defined triggers are hit the subordinated notes will be forgiven, the committed line of credit will end and the IHC’s ability to pay dividends to the Parent will be restricted【page_4†L1-L9】【page_6†L1-L12】.  \n\nThus, while the regulatory dividend limits remain unchanged, the 2024 report makes the liquidity‑support arrangement more formal and trigger‑driven, outlining a clearer back‑stop that can be curtailed under stress conditions.",

By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife said its withdrawal‑rate assumption for the guarantees ranged from 0 % to 20 % with a weighted‑average of about **3.7 %** (3.98 % for the prior year) 【page_266】, and footnote (11) notes that **higher withdrawal rates increase the fair‑value of GMWB guarantees but decrease the fair‑value of GMAB/GMIB guarantees** 【page_267】.  \n\nIn the 2024 filing the same 0 %‑20 % range is used but the weighted‑average assumption was raised to roughly **4.8 %** (4.47 % for 2023) 【page_249】, and the same footnote (11) reiterates that **higher withdrawals still lift GMWB fair‑value and cut GMAB/GMIB fair‑value** 【page_250】.  \n\nThus, MetLife increased its assumed withdrawal rate from about 3.7 % to about 4.8 % while the directional impact on the guarantees remained unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate was 0.94%, which decreased slightly to 0.93% in 2024. This minor decrease followed an increase in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by unfavorable changes in product mix, particularly a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing, partially offset by favorable regional mix changes. In 2024, the slight decline in the rate suggests that the company may have experienced more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies, although the overall rate remained relatively stable.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal’s transaction‑expense rate slipped slightly, from **0.94 % in 2023 to 0.93 % in 2024**【page_37】.  The company said the modest decline reflected **favourable shifts in regional mix, product mix and third‑party pricing incentives within its core PayPal products**, which offset the higher‑rate impact of Braintree’s larger share of TPV that drove up absolute expense in 2024【page_36】.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DCAI revenue decreased by 20% due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. In contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1% driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.

By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize not only the risk of increased costs but also the growing regulatory and compliance burden Apple faces globally, including 'an increasing number of federal, state and international laws' that heighten the potential for penalties.

Many contracts allowed clients to terminate with as little as 30 days’ notice, posing a direct risk to anticipated revenues. By 2024, the focus of client spending risk had shifted toward operational vulnerabilities tied to Accenture’s global delivery model. Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized risks from concentrating delivery capabilities in key locations like India and the Philippines, where geopolitical tensions and global disruptions could impact service continuity and, consequently, client spending. This evolution reflects a shift from contractual and client-driven risks to broader, systemic risks tied to global operations and delivery dependencies.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Accenture warned that a large share of its consulting work is tied to short‑term contracts that can be ended with as little as 30 days’ notice and that clients can defer or cut spending, and that its delivery model is heavily concentrated in India and the Philippines, exposing the firm to operational and geopolitical risk 【page_18】. By 2024 the company says the risk has intensified: many engagements now link fees to performance milestones and involve large, complex transformation projects that increase the impact of any client‑spending reductions, while the same India‑Philippines delivery concentration remains a key vulnerability, now highlighted as being especially sensitive to rising geopolitical tensions 【page_27】【page_29】.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $47 million, whereas in 2023, this figure decreased to $24 million. This indicates a reduction in the company's adjustments to its loss reserves, suggesting more stable or improved estimation accuracy in its claims liabilities over this period.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Adobe provided detailed breakdowns of Digital Media revenue growth, specifically attributing a $2.29 billion increase to strong performance in Creative and Document Cloud subscription offerings, with explicit mentions of net new subscriptions and user acquisition. In fiscal 2023, however, Adobe only disclosed a table showing revenue by major offerings across three years without any qualitative explanation or specific growth drivers for Creative or Document Cloud. This represents a shift from a descriptive, narrative-based disclosure in 2022 to a more data-driven, summary format in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Adobe reported Digital Media only as a single segment (e.g., $12.84 billion in FY‑2022) and the only offering‑level numbers shown were for earlier years (Creative Cloud $9.55 billion, Document Cloud $1.97 billion for FY‑2021) – no FY‑2022 break‑out was provided【page_46†L31-L38】. By contrast, the 2023 filing includes a dedicated table that lists Creative Cloud revenue of $11.5 billion and Document Cloud revenue of $2.7 billion for FY‑2023 (and FY‑2022) and explicitly attributes the segment’s growth to those two offerings【page_41†L9-L16】【page_41†L18-L22】.

This indicates both a quantitative increase and a qualitative shift in the composition of borrowings, with the introduction of detailed categories not previously itemized.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022 Schwab’s short‑term borrowings were made up of $12.4 bn of Federal Home‑Loan Bank (FHLB) facilities, $4.7 bn of other short‑term borrowings, $250 m of commercial‑paper notes, $4.4 bn of repurchase‑agreement borrowings and no TDAC line; the FHLB and other‑borrowings portions carried weighted‑average rates of 4.88 % and 4.97 % respectively. By 2023 the mix shifted to $26.4 bn of FHLB borrowings, $6.6 bn of other short‑term borrowings, $0 of commercial paper, $4.9 bn of repos and a new $700 m TDAC line, raising total short‑term debt to roughly $38.6 bn (up from about $21.8 bn) and increasing the weighted‑average rates to 5.34 % (FHLB) and 5.57 % (other), while the elimination of commercial‑paper borrowings removed its interest‑expense contribution. These changes mean that the larger FHLB and other‑borrowings balances, together with higher rates, drove a higher share of overall interest expense in 2023.

      "original_answer": "In FY2023, revenue from customers outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in FY2024, this dropped to 56%. This indicates a significant increase in U.S.-based demand for Compute & Networking segment products, which is attributed to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand. The shift suggests a growing adoption of NVIDIA's compute and networking solutions within the domestic market, potentially driven by data center expansion and enterprise AI initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "The share of NVIDIA’s revenue that comes from U.S. customers rose sharply – outside‑U.S. sales fell from 69 % of total revenue in FY 2023 to 56 % in FY 2024, implying U.S. revenue grew from roughly 31 % to 44 % of the mix (page 40).  The company notes that the U.S. revenue increase in FY 2024 was “primarily due to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand” (page 79), indicating that demand for its data‑center and AI‑focused products is shifting increasingly toward domestic U.S. markets.",

In fiscal 2021, Document Cloud revenue increased due to strong new user acquisition, contributing to the overall growth of Digital Media. By fiscal 2024, Document Cloud revenue had reached $3.18 billion, up from $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023, representing an 18% year-over-year growth. This indicates that Document Cloud has become a stronger contributor to the Digital Media segment, which itself grew 12% year-over-year in fiscal 2024, suggesting an increasing strategic importance of Document Cloud within Adobe’s Digital Media portfolio.",

The original answer states the acquisition contributed 44 percentage points to the 50% growth in 2023, while the LLM incorrectly claims 'no contribution' in 2023. This discrepancy directly contradicts the ground truth. For 2024, the LLM correctly identifies the 50% growth and 44-point acquisition impact, but omits the original's explanation about the shift from third-party to first-party content as the reason. Quantitatively, 2024 numbers are accurate, but 2023 calculations are entirely wrong. The acquisition closing date (Oct 13, 2023) is correctly stated but misaligned with fiscal year attribution in the original answer, indicating a potential timing misinterpretation by the model. Multi-hop synthesis fails to connect the acquisition's retroactive impact on 2023 despite the knowledge graph's assertion.",

      "question": "How has the impact of gross margin compression on MetLife's universal life insurance products evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what specific risk management actions were taken?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, MetLife experienced gross margin compression on its universal life insurance products due to interest rate sensitivity, and managed the risk through product design features and asset/liability management (ALM) strategies, including interest rate derivatives. However, lowering crediting rates could be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees. By 2024, MetLife significantly reduced its interest rate risk exposure for universal life products as a result of an external reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023, leaving minimal exposure from this block. This represents a major reduction in the risk profile of these products year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing MetLife said that gross‑margin compression on its universal‑life block was largely neutralized by an external re‑insurance transaction that closed in November 2023, leaving the company with only minimal exposure to that risk. By the 2024 filing the firm is managing the same exposure internally – using product‑design features and asset‑liability‑management (ALM) strategies, employing interest‑rate derivatives, and where possible lowering crediting rates on in‑force universal‑life policies (though any benefit can be offset by secondary guarantees).",

In fiscal year 2024, Oracle maintained the same classification of unbilled receivables within accounts receivable but updated the presentation slightly, referring to 'non-operating expenses, net' instead of 'non-operating expenses or income, net' when discussing interest revenue from financing arrangements.

However, by 2024, this figure had shifted to a negative $28 million, meaning the company experienced a net reduction in unallocated loss adjustment expenses from prior years.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife emphasized the use of actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, and investment returns to calculate liabilities for future policy benefits, with a focus on establishing these liabilities based on expected future benefits and premiums. The company also noted that unfavorable experience relative to assumptions could result in additional liabilities. By 2023, the focus shifted to how external financial conditions, particularly low interest rates and declining risk asset returns, could negatively impact these liabilities. Specifically, the 2023 filing highlights that declining interest rates may necessitate increases in reserves, including those for future policy benefits, due to lower investment spreads and asset/liability mismatches. This indicates a shift from an internal actuarial focus in 2022 to a more market-risk oriented perspective in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife described its liabilities for future policy benefits as actuarial estimates that are set at policy issuance – mortality, morbidity, lapse, renewal, disability, investment‑return, inflation and expense assumptions – and, for its long‑duration contracts (about 70 % of the balance), those assumptions are “locked‑in” unless a premium‑deficiency reserve is required; risk is mitigated through dividend‑scale adjustments, capital buffers and interest‑rate scenario testing (see 2022 p. 64‑66). By the 2023 filing the company’s discussion shifted to the fact that those same liabilities are now viewed as highly sensitive to macro‑economic factors – especially low or falling interest rates, changes in market credit spreads and investment‑return assumptions – which can raise the discount rate, increase reserves and create volatility in the liability balance (see 2023 p. 31 and 30).",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's disclosure around Switched Transactions evolve from 2022 to 2023 in terms of measurement and reporting context?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Switched Transactions were reported with a specific growth metric of 25%, indicating a clear quantitative emphasis on transaction volume growth through Mastercard's network. In 2023, the filing no longer provided a specific growth percentage but instead focused on refining the definition and methodology of measuring Switched Transactions, including normalization for switching and carryover days, and noting the impact of data exclusions from sanctioned Russian banks starting in Q1 2022. This shift indicates a move from purely reporting growth to enhancing transparency around measurement practices.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K Mastercard only presented “Switched transactions” as a headline growth percentage in its MD&A tables (e.g., 25 % YoY in 2021 and 3 % in 2020) without a definition or explanation of how the count was derived [see MD&A table on page 46]. By the 2023 filing the company introduced a dedicated “Switched Transactions” metric, defined it as the number of transactions initiated and switched through its network, explained that the data come from customer‑provided, verified sources, disclosed that Russian‑bank data were excluded after Q1‑2022, and reported growth both in USD and local‑currency terms with normalization for switching and carry‑over days and a Russia‑adjusted rate (14 %/12 % and 16 % adjusted) [see definition and growth tables on pages 54‑55]. This reflects a shift from a simple percentage disclosure to a more granular, methodology‑driven measurement and reporting framework.",

However, there are critical quantitative errors: (1) The 25% growth metric is incorrectly attributed to 2021 instead of 2022 as stated in the ground truth, (2) 2020's 3% growth is mentioned despite not being in the original answer, and (3) specific 2023 adjusted rates (14%/12%/16%) are added without confirmation from the ground truth. Qualitatively, the synthesis of multi-hop information (e.g., exclusion timing, normalization) is accurate, but the factual misplacement of the 25% metric undermines quantitative reliability.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Qualcomm recorded $1.7 billion as noncurrent income taxes receivable related to its tax refund claims in Korea, while in fiscal 2024, this amount increased to $2.2 billion.

      "question": "How has NVIDIA's strategic relationship with its Compute & Networking segment evolved between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of revenue concentration and customer dependency?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment was linked to a high concentration of revenue from a limited number of customers, with one customer (Customer A) representing 13% of total revenue. Additionally, an indirect customer purchasing through system integrators and distributors, including Customer A, was estimated to represent approximately 19% of total revenue. By fiscal year 2024, the Compute & Networking segment played a central role in the increase in U.S.-based revenue, which accounted for a growing share of NVIDIA's total revenue. This indicates a shift where the segment not only remained a key revenue driver but also became more integral to growth in a major geographic market. The evolution shows NVIDIA deepened its strategic reliance on the Compute & Networking segment, especially as it became more critical to satisfying growing U.S. demand.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking business moved from a broadly‑distributed customer base in FY 2023 to a more concentrated one in FY 2024 – a single partner (Customer A) accounted for roughly 13 % of total revenue (all attributable to Compute & Networking) and a direct customer also represented about 13 % of revenue in FY 2024 (page 23; page 80).

However, in 2024, the Embedded segment experienced a 33% decline in net revenue, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle described its Services Business as one of three operating segments, but the strategic positioning focused primarily on general enterprise IT environments with a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies. The Services Business was not explicitly tied to cloud adoption but rather positioned as a flexible offering across deployment models. By fiscal 2023, Oracle significantly evolved its strategic positioning of the Services Business, explicitly linking it to cloud adoption and customer support. The 2023 filing emphasized that customers could 'continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments.' This included integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and AI-enhanced offerings like Oracle Autonomous Database, which used machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions. The Services Business in 2023 was framed as a key enabler of cloud migration and customer retention, with a focus on supporting Oracle Cloud Services contracts and product enhancements.",

By FY 2023 the company repositioned the Services Business as professional services that “assist our customers and partners to maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle products and services” and explicitly tied those services to cloud adoption—supporting deployments of Oracle Cloud applications and aligning with its cloud‑and‑license and license‑support contracts (page_6, page_8).",

By 2023, external economic pressures such as geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters in key states like California and Florida, and increased competition from alternative financing products began to negatively impact the credit performance and spending behavior of Card Members. These external factors introduced new risks that could affect repayment trends and loan performance, marking a shift from internal policy consistency to external vulnerability.",

      "question": "How did Apple's exposure to potential fees or fines related to payment card data security standards change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about evolving risks in this area?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring 'significant fees or fines' if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including increased transaction costs or loss of payment processing ability. In 2023, the language evolved to place greater emphasis on the potential liability, using the phrase 'can also incur significant fees or fines' following 'associated investigatory expenses,' suggesting an increased likelihood or severity of financial penalties. This indicates an evolution in the perceived risk, with Apple signaling a potentially more severe consequence structure tied to payment card compliance failures.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2022 and 2023 Form 10‑K risk disclosures contain the same statement that Apple could be liable for investigatory expenses and “significant fees or fines” if it fails to follow payment‑card industry data‑security standards (see the “Payment card data” paragraph on page 18 of each filing). Because the language is essentially unchanged, Apple’s exposure to such penalties has not increased or decreased, indicating that compliance with payment‑card security rules remains a steady, ongoing risk rather than a newly emerging one.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM incorrectly claims the language about fees/fines is 'essentially unchanged' between 2022 and 2023, while the ground truth identifies a meaningful shift in wording and context. The 2023 filing adds 'can also incur significant fees or fines' immediately after 'associated investigatory expenses,' creating a stronger causal link between non-compliance and financial penalties. This critical nuance is entirely missed by the LLM. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially maintained (correct years and general risk category), but the failure to recognize the linguistic evolution directly contradicts the ground truth's core finding. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed - the model fails to synthesize the contextual placement of the penalty language in 2023 relative to investigatory expenses, which is central to assessing changing risk exposure. (4) Scores reflect complete misunderstanding of the question's core requirement to detect subtle but significant changes in risk disclosure language, despite correct entity identification and basic factual elements being present.",

      "original_answer": "The approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under IBM's publicly announced program remained unchanged at $2,007,611,768 from the end of 2021 (as disclosed in the 2022 10-K filing) to the end of 2024 (as disclosed in the 2024 10-K filing). This indicates that IBM did not utilize any portion of this allocated amount for share repurchases over this three-year period, suggesting a stable but unused repurchase capacity.",
      "llm_answer": "At the close of 2021 IBM reported that roughly **$2.0 billion** of the authorized $4 billion repurchase program remained available (“Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program” = $2,007,611,768)【page_24】. The same amount is shown at the end of 2024, with the table for Q4 2024 also listing **$2.0 billion** still available for purchase【page_14】. Thus, the remaining repurchase capacity has stayed essentially unchanged at about $2 billion, indicating that IBM has maintained a stable pool of funds for stock buybacks over this period.",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the dollar value matches the original ground truth (minor rounding acceptable), and the time frame (2021-2024) is correctly addressed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes data across 2022 and 2024 filings to show no change in repurchase capacity. The conclusion about 'stable pool for buybacks' aligns with the original's 'stable but unused capacity' (semantically equivalent).

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, the Compute & Networking segment contributed to a higher proportion of NVDA's international revenue, with 69% of total revenue coming from outside the U.S., while no single customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. By fiscal year 2024, the U.S. revenue increased significantly due to higher demand in the Compute & Networking segment, and one customer alone accounted for 13% of total revenue, indicating a notable shift in both geographic revenue mix and customer concentration driven by this segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $631 million, increased by $201 million, and ended the year at $658 million. In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, decreased by $122 million, and ended at $577 million.

      "question": "How has the role of installed base growth in driving Office Commercial revenue evolved between 2022 and 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Office Commercial revenue was mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, along with the shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365. By 2023, the description remained largely the same, with installed base growth still being a key driver. However, the 2023 filing added emphasis on AI and productivity categories such as communication, collaboration, analytics, security, and compliance as part of the growth strategy. This indicates that while installed base growth remained a consistent factor, its context expanded to include AI-driven capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "In Microsoft’s 2022 Form 10‑K the Office Commercial section notes that “Office Commercial revenue is mainly affected by a combination of **continued installed‑base growth** and average‑revenue‑per‑user expansion, as well as the shift to Office 365” (MSFT 2022 10‑K, p. 9/11). The 2023 filing repeats the same language, again stating that revenue “is mainly affected by a combination of **continued installed‑base growth** and average‑revenue‑per‑user expansion” (MSFT 2023 10‑K, p. 9/11). Thus, the role of installed‑base growth as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue has remained consistent from 2022 to 2023.",

However, in 2024, the company shifted its GDV reporting approach by focusing on qualitative aspects, such as a chart detailing GDV and number of cards for select programs and solutions, without disclosing the total GDV figure. This change indicates a strategic pivot from broad volume reporting to a more targeted view of GDV performance by program, suggesting a refined reporting focus aligned with specific business initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Mastercard reported gross‑dollar volume (GDV) of **$9.0 trillion** (up 12% YoY)【page_6】, while the 2024 filing shows GDV of **$9.8 trillion** (up 11% YoY)【page_6】—the program‑level chart also adds the three segments to roughly $9.0 trillion in 2023 and $9.8 trillion in 2024【page_7】. The near‑$0.8 trillion increase (≈ 9‑11% growth) signals that Mastercard’s payments network processed a larger volume of transactions, and the company is highlighting GDV as a core metric to illustrate the expanding scale of its transaction activity and its focus on network‑wide growth rather than just revenue.",

(1) Quantitative inaccuracies: The original answer explicitly states that 2024 reporting shifted to qualitative aspects without disclosing total GDV, but the LLM fabricated a 2024 GDV figure of $9.8 trillion (incorrect). The 11% YoY growth and $0.8 trillion increase are unsupported by the original answer. The program-level chart in 2024 was meant to replace total GDV disclosure, not supplement it. (2) Multi-hop reasoning failure: The model incorrectly inferred total GDV from program-level charts, whereas the original answer emphasized the absence of total GDV reporting in 2024. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the reporting shift. (3) Qualitative misalignment: The LLM concludes that Mastercard 'highlighted GDV as a core metric' in 2024, directly contradicting the original answer's assertion of a strategic pivot away from total GDV disclosure.

The company had entered into long-term purchase commitments and prepayments to secure supply. By 2023, while substrate and foundry capacity shortages remained a challenge, Intel faced additional supply chain pressures from macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, as well as new regulatory expectations around responsible sourcing.

The filing directly tied revenue changes to transaction metrics. In contrast, the 2023 filing shifted focus toward service revenue recognition based on prior-quarter nominal payments volume and included more granular details on how volume categories (e.g., consumer prepaid, Interlink, and cash volume) fed into reporting.

By fiscal 2023, the year-over-year increase in Document Cloud revenue had slowed to $316 million, or 13%, from $2.38 billion in fiscal 2022 to $2.70 billion. This indicates a moderation in the growth rate of Document Cloud, suggesting that while it continues to contribute positively to Adobe’s overall revenue, its pace of expansion has decelerated compared to earlier years.",
      "llm_answer": "Document Cloud revenue rose from $1.97 bn in fiscal 2021 (up 32% YoY) to $2.38 bn in fiscal 2022 (≈21% YoY) and $2.70 bn in fiscal 2023 (13% YoY)【page_44】【page_41】【page_38】. While the growth rate has slowed each year, the segment still posted double‑digit increases, indicating that Document Cloud continues to be a meaningful, though gradually maturing, contributor to Adobe’s overall revenue expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GDV was reported with a focus on the impact of currency translation and transactional currency, specifically highlighting that GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4% compared to 11.9% on a local currency basis versus 2022. In 2024, the presentation of GDV became more standardized, with an explicit statement that U.S. dollar-converted GDV figures are calculated using quarterly average exchange rates, and the emphasis shifted to reporting period-over-period growth rates based on local currency data to eliminate currency fluctuation effects. The 2024 disclosure formalized the methodology and removed specific comparative growth figures, suggesting a more methodological and consistent approach to GDV reporting.",

However, the 2024 filing now presents GDV growth side‑by‑side on both a U.S.‑dollar‑converted basis and a local‑currency basis: GDV grew 8.1% on the USD‑converted basis and 10.5% on the local‑currency basis versus 2023, whereas in 2023 it had risen 10.6% on the USD‑converted basis and 12.2% on the local‑currency basis versus 2022 【page_53†L43-L48】.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Accenture highlighted that many of its consulting contracts were less than 12 months in duration and could be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, posing a risk to revenue predictability. Additionally, the company noted that delays or reductions in client spending—especially under existing contracts—could materially affect results, particularly in geographic markets or service lines where a small number of clients contributed significantly to revenue. By 2024, the focus of client spending risk had evolved to emphasize broader operational vulnerabilities, including global disruptions such as geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, and infrastructure failures. These risks, combined with Accenture's global delivery model's concentration in India and the Philippines, introduced new layers of unpredictability in maintaining consistent client spending and service delivery. While contract flexibility remained a concern, the 2024 filing expanded the risk profile to include external macro-operational factors, indicating a shift in how client spending volatility could impact the company.",
      "llm_answer": "In its 2022 filing Accenture warned that most consulting contracts are short‑term (often < 12 months) and can be ended with as little as 30 days’ notice, and that clients can delay, reduce or cancel spend, leaving revenue highly sensitive to client‑driven timing decisions【page_18】. By the 2024 filing the company says it is shifting to larger, longer‑term, performance‑linked engagements—often with early‑termination charges and milestone‑based fees—so client flexibility is reduced but revenue becomes more dependent on meeting performance targets and the successful execution of complex projects【page_27】.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Express described Discount Revenue as being internally allocated using a transfer pricing methodology across business segments, with specific breakdowns for issuer, network, and acquirer components. This treatment emphasized internal financial structuring and did not highlight external risks to Discount Revenue. By 2024, the focus had transformed significantly, with Discount Revenue now being described in the context of external risks, including exposure to the airline industry, which accounted for 7% of worldwide billed business. The filing explicitly stated that financial distress or operational failures in such industries could negatively impact Discount Revenue and overall financial performance. This marks a shift from purely internal allocation to a broader concern over external risk exposure affecting revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K the company explained that discount revenue is not a “raw” line‑item but is allocated to its reportable segments through a transfer‑pricing methodology – the issuer component is assigned to the Global Consumer Services Group (GCSG) and Global Consumer Services (GCS) segments, while the network/acquirer component is assigned to the Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS) segment. By the 2024 filing the discussion of discount revenue still focuses on it as a core revenue source, but the emphasis has shifted to an external concentration risk: airline merchants now represent roughly 7 % of worldwide billed business, meaning that discount‑revenue earnings are materially exposed to the performance of the airline industry.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal's transaction revenues were primarily driven by net transaction fees charged to merchants based on TPV, with additional fees from currency conversion, cross-border transactions, instant fund transfers, and cryptocurrency transactions. Management emphasized TPV growth and the number of payment transactions as key indicators of platform strength and customer engagement. In 2023, PayPal provided a more detailed geographic breakdown of revenues, categorizing transaction revenues by primary geographical markets, although specific dollar amounts or percentages by region were not disclosed in the provided excerpt.

By 2024, the risk evolved to include more specific concerns about financial exposure, such as the potential for significant costs and asset impairments if new technologies fail to succeed in the market in the anticipated time frames. Additionally, 2024 introduced heightened strategic challenges, including the need to meet customer ESG-related targets (e.g., 2040 net-zero global GHG emissions commitment) and the necessity to transition to new business models to support expansion beyond mobile handsets.

By the 2024 filing the risk narrative has become far more detailed, highlighting concrete strategic challenges such as competitors’ superior or cheaper technologies, long automotive design‑in cycles and stringent ESG‑related customer requirements, the need to adopt new business models, and the possibility of costly acquisition failures or asset‑impairment charges that could depress revenue, margins, cash flow and the stock price (2024‑20, 2024‑21, 2024‑22).",

      "question": "How did Visa's treatment and disclosure of Lease Consolidation Costs evolve between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about their financial reporting approach?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Visa did not disclose any specific charge related to Lease Consolidation Costs. However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2024 filing Visa added a separate line for “Lease consolidation costs” – a $57 million charge recorded in general‑and‑administrative expense and excluded from its non‑GAAP results. The 2023 filing did not show a distinct lease‑consolidation line, treating any related expense as part of broader categories. This shift to isolate and disclose the one‑time lease‑consolidation charge demonstrates Visa’s move toward more granular, transparent GAAP reporting so that non‑recurring items can be clearly identified and excluded from performance metrics.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan had a broad equity investment range of 0% to 40%, indicating a potentially conservative investment strategy. By 2024, the company projected increasing annual benefit payments starting at $85 million in 2025, rising to $92 million in 2029, with a total of $476 million expected from 2030 to 2034. This reflects a shift toward greater financial commitment and confidence in the plan's funding, contrasting with the earlier cautious investment posture.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 the non‑U.S. defined‑benefit plan reported accumulated benefit obligations of $1.67 billion versus plan assets of $1.866 billion, leaving a net actuarial loss of $169 million 【page_47】. By year‑end 2024 the obligations had fallen to $1.47 billion while assets were $1.708 billion, and the net actuarial loss narrowed to $113 million 【page_46】—a reduction in both the liability and the actuarial shortfall that signals an improved funded position. The company also increased the discount rate applied to the plan to 3.76% (from 3.28% in 2023) and raised the assumed long‑term return on plan assets to 4.28% (from 3.50%), further supporting a more positive funding outlook 【page_47】【page_46】.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.' The removal of 'home builders' could imply a strategic shift away from partnerships with home construction firms, potentially signaling a reduced emphasis on new home purchase financing or a refocusing of referral partnerships within the retail mortgage channel.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring significant fees or fines if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or loss of the ability to process payment cards. By 2024, the language evolved to emphasize not only the continuation of these risks but also the broader financial implications, such as materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. While the core risk remained consistent, the framing in 2024 suggests a heightened awareness and potential escalation in the severity of consequences, indicating an increased exposure or at least a more explicitly communicated risk posture.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s 2022 Form 10‑K warned that a breach of payment‑card data could expose the company to investigatory expenses and “significant fees or fines” if it fails to follow payment‑card industry data‑security standards, and could also raise transaction costs or halt card processing【page_18】. The 2024 Form 10‑K repeats the same language, showing that the exposure to such fees or fines has remained essentially unchanged【page_18】.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing NVIDIA disclosed that, because of industry shortages, it shifted from the usual six‑month ordering horizon to placing non‑cancellable orders at least twelve months in advance and began paying premiums or deposits to lock in capacity—raising its financial‑risk exposure (2022 p. 24). By the 2023 filing the company said it had broadened supply‑and‑capacity purchases, added new vendors and entered prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements, which have let it shorten lead times for some components even as it still flags the financial risk of prepaid commitments and added supply‑chain complexity (2023 p. 34).",

      "question": "How has BNY's disclosure regarding forward-looking statements about future results evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of the scope of expectations provided?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, BNY Mellon's forward-looking statements included expectations about performance results, expenses, nonperforming assets, products, regulatory, technology, market, economic or accounting developments, and their impacts on the company's businesses. By 2024, BNY expanded the scope of these forward-looking statements to include more specific references to capital plans (including dividends and repurchases), strategic priorities, acquisitions and integration activity, transition to a platforms operating model, efficiency savings, and interest rate and net interest income sensitivities. This indicates a broader and more strategic framing of future results in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 Form 10‑K BNY’s forward‑looking statement section simply warned that such statements “are not guarantees of future results or occurrences, are inherently uncertain” and listed a broad set of topics (page_3). By the 2024 filing the language was expanded – the company now says the statements “are based upon current beliefs and expectations of future events” and adds a wider range of expectations, explicitly naming “targets, opportunities, potential actions, growth and initiatives” among others, thereby broadening the scope of what investors are cautioned about (page_3).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, iPhone net sales showed an increase compared to 2021, primarily driven by the launch of new iPhone models since the fourth quarter of 2021. However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth in 2022 to stagnation in 2024 suggests a decline in the momentum of iPhone sales performance over time, potentially indicating market saturation or reduced consumer demand for new model releases during this period.",

The next year they slipped about 2 % to $200.6 billion, and fiscal 2024 sales were essentially unchanged at $201.2 billion, with the filing noting iPhone net sales were “relatively flat” versus 2023 (page 26).

These numbers align with the original answer's qualitative description of growth followed by stagnation. The conclusion about slowing momentum matches the original's interpretation. (2) Quantitative accuracy is flawless: percentages and dollar amounts are consistent (e.g., $205.5B to $200.6B reflects a ~2.4% decline, rounded to 'about 2%'), and 'relatively flat' in 2024 is accurately represented. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the synthesis across three fiscal years and the logical inference about stabilization versus expansion directly address the question. (4) Minor qualitative omission: the original answer attributes 2022 growth to new iPhone models launched in Q4 2021, which the LLM answer does not mention.

By 2024, the company reiterated this risk but placed additional emphasis on broader strategic transformation efforts, including the use of automation and AI to drive productivity and growth. This suggests that while the core risk of impairment remained, it became more closely tied to transformational initiatives and their success in delivering expected value.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, there were no customers representing 10% or more of total revenue for NVDA. However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue and was specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also tied to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting a more pronounced dependency on major customers for this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compute & Networking segment has shifted from a broadly diversified customer base in FY 2023—when no single customer contributed ≥ 10 % of total revenue—to a more concentrated profile in FY 2024, where one direct customer accounted for 13 % of total revenue and an indirect customer (through system integrators) represented roughly 19 % of total revenue, both tied to this segment (page_40). At the same time, the share of revenue from non‑U.S. customers fell from 69 % to 56 %, underscoring a modest geographic rebalancing while the company acknowledges that demand in Compute & Networking remains concentrated (page_40).",

By 2023, free cash flow dropped significantly to $1,349 million, which equates to only 7.7% of revenue ($17,519 million).

By 2023 free cash flow had fallen to $1.35 billion, or only 7.7 % of its $17.5 billion revenue【page_21】.

In 2024, this figure changed significantly to a negative impact of $28 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average loans held for investment decreased by $605 million to $252.7 billion, largely due to declines in the credit card portfolio from higher customer payments and the transfer of a $2.6 billion international card partnership portfolio to held for sale. In contrast, by 2023, average loans held for investment increased by $1.0 billion to $92.5 billion, driven by growth across the loan portfolio, including credit cards. This shift indicates a strategic adjustment in Capital One's credit card lending, moving from a period of contraction and portfolio divestiture in 2022 to renewed growth in 2023, suggesting a recalibration of credit risk appetite and market positioning.",

By the 2024 filing the disclosure had become far more detailed: the MD&A lists total GDV of $9.8 trillion, up 11 % (page 6), and a separate chart breaks the $9.8 T into program‑level figures (e.g., $3.634 T consumer‑credit, $4.865 T consumer‑debit/prepaid, $1.258 T commercial) with each segment’s share of total GDV and year‑over‑year growth (page 7).

      "question": "How has the methodology for determining the Single Equivalent Rate evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to the treatment of non-U.S. locations with sufficient corporate bond markets?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company disclosed that for non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, the discount rate was determined by discounting projected cash flows against a yield curve constructed using high-quality corporate bonds, from which a single equivalent rate was derived. In 2024, the company maintained the same general methodology but shifted terminology from 'discloses' to 'determines,' indicating a more active role in the selection process. While the core methodology remained consistent, the change in language suggests a more deliberate and controlled approach in 2024 compared to the descriptive disclosure in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The approach to the Single‑Equivalent Rate did not change from 2023 to 2024. In both years the company says it “utilizes a variety of methods…depending on the depth of the corporate‑bond market” and, for non‑U.S. locations that have an active market of high‑quality corporate bonds, it discounts the projected cash flows against a yield curve built from those bonds and selects the single‑equivalent rate that yields the same present value; where a corporate market is insufficient it uses a government‑bond index (2024 page 47 vs 2023 page 48).",

However, it incorrectly states there was 'no change' between 2023-2024, contradicting the ground truth which identifies a key terminological shift from 'discloses' to 'determines' indicating a more active selection process in 2024. This omission represents a significant qualitative error in multi-hop reasoning, as the question specifically asked about methodology evolution. While the quantitative description of methods is accurate, the failure to recognize the semantic shift in corporate language directly addresses the question's core focus on methodology changes.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2021, Document Cloud revenue grew by 32% (from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2020 to $1.97 billion). In fiscal 2023, the year-over-year growth rate slowed to 13% (from $2.38 billion in fiscal 2022 to $2.70 billion). This indicates a moderation in the pace of growth for Document Cloud, even as it continued to contribute to Adobe's overall Digital Media segment expansion, which saw ARR grow by 14% in fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Document Cloud revenue surged 32 % in fiscal 2021 to $1.97 billion【page_46】, then grew 13 % in fiscal 2023 to $2.70 billion【page_41】—a slower but still solid pace.  Because Digital Media revenue rose from $11.5 billion in 2021 to $14.2 billion in 2023【page_41】, Document Cloud’s share of the segment increased from roughly 17 % to about 19 %, indicating that it remains an expanding and increasingly important driver of Adobe’s Digital Media business.",

It accurately calculated Document Cloud's increasing share of Digital Media (17%→19%) from the provided revenue figures ($11.5B→$14.2B). The original answer did not explicitly state the share percentages, but these are mathematically valid inferences. (2) Number/calculation verification: All growth rates and dollar amounts match the ground truth. The 32% (1.97/1.50-1) and 13% (2.70/2.38-1) calculations are precise. The share calculations (1.97/11.5=17.1%, 2.70/14.2=19.0%) are accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The LLM successfully synthesized Document Cloud growth rates (from two different pages) with Digital Media segment revenue growth to assess relative contribution. While the original answer focused on ARR growth (14%), the LLM used total revenue figures to derive share changes, which is a valid alternative approach. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness score is 9 due to the addition of share percentage calculations not explicitly in the original answer (though mathematically correct). Quantitative accuracy is perfect. Qualitative accuracy is high but slightly reduced as the LLM introduced a new metric (revenue share) rather than directly referencing ARR growth mentioned in the original. Contextual relevance remains strong as the core question about growth trajectory and contribution was fully addressed.",

In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. Consumer Debit Volume grew to $2,826 billion, reflecting a 6% increase compared to the previous year.

By 2024, Apple's language evolved to reflect a more immediate exposure, stating it 'can be liable for associated investigatory expenses' if sensitive data is mishandled or if payment card data is compromised.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo emphasized the Federal Reserve's requirement for large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit annual capital plans, including planned capital distributions such as dividends, and compliance with Basel III capital requirements, leverage ratios, and capital surcharges for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Failure to meet these could limit capital distributions. By 2024, the company introduced a new internal liquidity mechanism through the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), which imposed restrictions on dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if bankruptcy proceedings are authorized. This indicates a shift from purely regulatory constraints to a combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations on capital distributions.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing Wells Fargo stressed that dividend and share‑repurchase payments are limited by federal‑ and state‑level statutory caps, the FRB’s annual capital‑plan and Basel III/GSIB‑surcharge rules, and by the Support Agreement, which can bar dividends if certain liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined triggers【page_4†L1-L9】【page_5†L1-L9】【page_6†L1-L9】. By the 2024 filing the company has added a more detailed internal liquidity structure—using the intermediate holding company (IHC), subordinated notes and a committed line of credit to move assets and provide capital/liquidity to the bank and its covered entities—while still noting that the same regulatory caps and trigger‑based restrictions can curtail dividend payments, showing a shift toward supplementing external regulatory limits with internal liquidity mechanisms【page_6†L1-L12】【page_6†L13-L22】.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan's 10-K filing primarily introduced MEV (Macroeconomic Variable) as a defined term within the glossary, with no explicit application or strategic context provided. By 2024, the treatment of MEV evolved significantly, as it became a core component in the estimation of collateral values for mortgage risk modeling. Specifically, in 2024, MEV was applied through MSA-level home price indices, which were used to forecast collateral values for junior lien home equity products. This shift indicates a move from a purely definitional disclosure in 2023 to a functional, risk-modelling role in 2024, particularly in the context of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio calculations.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing the glossary (page 318) lists loan‑level risk terms but does not contain a definition for “MEV,” and mortgage risk is described only with traditional metrics such as LTV, credit scores and product‑type categories (page 319). By the 2024 filing the firm adds a distinct entry “MEV – Macroeconomic variable” (page 332) and explicitly links macro data—e.g., MSA‑level home‑price index forecasts—to the estimated collateral values used in LTV calculations for mortgage products, showing that macroeconomic variables are now formally incorporated into its mortgage‑risk modeling.",

However, the original answer states MEV was defined in the 2023 glossary, which contradicts the LLM's claim that MEV was absent in 2023. This creates a factual inconsistency. (2) Quantitative accuracy is slightly reduced due to the discrepancy about MEV's 2023 glossary inclusion. The LLM correctly notes MSA-level home price indices in 2024 but omits the original's mention of junior lien home equity products and CLTV ratios. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the LLM connects MEV's definitional addition in 2024 to its functional use in LTV calculations, aligning with the original's core conclusion.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Card Member Loans were primarily described as a core component of American Express's lending business, directly contributing to net interest income and reflecting the company's lending features such as Pay Over Time and Plan It. These loans were positioned as a stable and integral part of the company's financial model. By 2023, however, the narrative shifted as the company noted increasing risks to Card Member Loans due to external pressures such as heightened competition, the rise of alternative financing products like buy now, pay later services, and macroeconomic disruptions including natural disasters affecting key states like Florida and California. These factors were noted to negatively impact credit performance and borrowing trends, signaling a more vulnerable position for this revenue stream compared to the previous year.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Card Member Loans were discussed mainly as a component of net‑interest income, with the company emphasizing metrics such as net‑interest yield and net write‑off rates to gauge loan performance (see page 89). By 2023 the loan portfolio—particularly the cobrand segment—had grown to about 36 % of worldwide Card Member loans, making loan‑derived interest a noticeably larger share of revenue (page 27), while credit performance was strained by regional economic disruptions (page 26) and intense competitive pressure from other networks and alternative lenders threatened discount revenue and could curb loan growth (page 28).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel still owned and operated its NAND memory business, which was generating losses of $4,306 million in net revenue and contributing a negative $1,369 million to operating income. By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing. This strategic exit removed the financial drag of the NAND segment from Intel's operations, allowing the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy and reduce restructuring and operational costs.",

By the 2023 filing Intel simply referred to the 2020 agreement to sell the NAND business, implying the divestiture was effectively completed and the segment no longer appeared in the consolidated results, removing the low‑margin drag and contributing to higher operating margins in 2023【page_53】.",

By 2024, while GDV was still a key metric, it was described more in terms of its structural definition and reporting methodology, without specific growth figures or direct linkage to revenue performance.

By the 2024 filing the company gives a detailed definition of GDV (including domestic vs. cross‑border, purchase vs. cash, and both local‑currency and U.S.‑dollar‑converted measures) and highlights that foreign‑exchange movements now affect GDV and the related assessment revenue, with growth slowing to 8 %‑11 % in 2024 versus the double‑digit gains of earlier years (see page_51, page_52 and page_53).",

(3) The original emphasized Xoom's integration into cross-border TPV in 2024 as a structural change, but the LLM mischaracterizes this as merely 'keeping' Xoom while focusing on merchant volume. (4) The answer fails to address the 2022 context (foreign exchange contracts) and misrepresents the evolution trajectory. While it attempts multi-hop synthesis, the fabricated metrics and incorrect emphasis on declining cross-border share (contradicting the 10% growth) severely undermine accuracy.",

      "question": "How did Broadcom's visibility into future revenue from its Semiconductor Solutions Segment evolve between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, and what specific changes in customer commitments or constraints contributed to this evolution?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's revenue visibility for its Semiconductor Solutions Segment was limited due to ongoing supply chain constraints, particularly with wafers and substrates, which affected its ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner. This uncertainty made it difficult to predict the longer-term sustainability of increased profitability. By fiscal year 2023, there was a significant improvement in revenue visibility, as evidenced by the $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations under multi-year contracts in the semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments. This indicates stronger, more firmly committed customer relationships and a more stable outlook compared to the previous year's uncertainty.",
      "llm_answer": "In FY 2022 Broadcom said its view of future Semiconductor Solutions revenue was limited because “we continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain, including with respect to wafers and substrates…we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner” (2022 10‑K, p. 61). By FY 2023 the company noted that “certain multi‑year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions … contain firmly committed amounts” and that “our customers generally do not exercise termination‑for‑convenience rights,” which gives it clearer insight into future revenue even though most contracts remain short‑term (2023 10‑K, p. 66).",

Despite these challenges, the segment experienced robust profitability driven by a supply imbalance. By fiscal year 2024, the strategic focus had evolved, with increased emphasis on AI networking and connectivity as key growth areas. The segment expanded its product offerings to include AI-related technologies, aligning with market demand shifts.

      "question": "How has the composition and growth trajectory of Windows Commercial revenue evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its shift toward cloud services and volume licensing?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was primarily driven by volume licensing of the Windows operating system and advanced security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on Software Assurance and the number of information workers in licensed enterprises. By 2023, the composition expanded to include a more pronounced focus on cloud services, as reflected in the explicit categorization of 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth' as a tracked metric. This indicates a strategic evolution toward integrating cloud-based offerings more prominently into the Windows Commercial portfolio, moving beyond traditional licensing. While specific dollar figures aren't provided, the shift is evident in how Microsoft now highlights cloud services alongside traditional volume licensing, suggesting a transformation in the revenue model with a stronger emphasis on recurring cloud-based revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "In FY 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was described as a blend of traditional volume‑licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows‑cloud services such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with revenue largely reflecting the number of licensed information‑workers rather than PC shipments (see pages 14‑15). By FY 2023 the company reported a specific “Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth” metric and a 13% increase in the More Personal Computing segment (pages 42‑44), showing that cloud‑based subscriptions are gaining a larger share of the Windows Commercial mix while volume licensing continues to be a core driver.",

The semiconductor‑solutions segment’s balance stayed essentially flat at roughly $26 billion (≈$25.9 bn in 2020 and $25.97 bn in 2022) while the infrastructure‑software segment grew, signalling a shift of strategic emphasis toward software and away from the heavily concentrated semiconductor customer base noted in FY 2022 (AVGO 2022 10‑K, “Concentrations of … significant customers”) (AVGO 2022 10‑K, p. 59).

In 2023, this language was expanded to include the phrase 'our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations [...] and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' This evolution indicates a more nuanced disclosure that retains the prior year's emphasis on preferred stock dividends as a limiting factor but adds a broader regulatory and governance context.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported that approximately 5% of its invested assets each year were subject to reinvestment risk through 2024, primarily due to the impact of declining interest rates on long-duration products and guaranteed minimum crediting rates on deferred annuities and retained asset accounts. By 2023, this percentage increased to 6% of invested assets annually, with reinvestment risk extending through 2026. This indicates a slight increase in MetLife's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and a longer duration of reinvestment risk, suggesting a more sustained vulnerability to gross margin compression under a low interest rate environment.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife noted that “only a small portion of invested assets…are subject to reinvestment risk,” quantifying it at **about 5 % of assets each year**【page_62】. The 2023 filing raises that estimate to **roughly 6 % of assets**【page_55】. The modest rise shows that MetLife’s exposure to interest‑rate fluctuations – and the resulting gross‑margin compression from reinvestment risk – has increased slightly, but it still involves a relatively small share of its overall investment portfolio.",

Additional details about AI-infused platforms and hybrid delivery models in the LLM answer provide relevant context without contradicting the original. No numerical discrepancies exist. Multi-hop synthesis correctly connects collaboration solutions to broader architectural transformations. Minor difference: LLM emphasizes 'experience-driven' positioning not explicitly mentioned in the original, but this aligns with the stated focus on interoperability and modern workplaces.",

      "question": "How has the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue evolved between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Installed Base Growth was explicitly stated as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue alongside average revenue per user expansion and the shift from on-premises Office to Office 365. In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever. This suggests that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings state that Office Commercial revenue is “mainly affected by a combination of continued installed‑base growth and average‑revenue‑per‑user expansion, as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on‑premises to Office 365”【MSFT_10k_2023.pdf page_9】【MSFT_10k_2024.pdf page_9】. The language is essentially unchanged, indicating that installed‑base growth remains a core, unchanged driver of Office Commercial revenue across the two years.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer correctly identifies the quoted language from both 10-K filings (2023 and 2024) and accurately represents the listed drivers (installed base growth, ARPU expansion, shift to Office 365). However, it fundamentally misinterprets the evolution of Installed Base Growth's role. The original answer correctly notes a reframing in 2024 where the relationship shifted from being a 'key driver' to a 'foundational component' - a nuance the LLM answer completely misses by claiming 'language is essentially unchanged.' While the quoted text is identical, the contextual framing and implied strategic emphasis changed, which the LLM failed to recognize. This represents a critical failure in multi-hop reasoning and qualitative interpretation despite accurate quantitative representation of the quoted text.",
