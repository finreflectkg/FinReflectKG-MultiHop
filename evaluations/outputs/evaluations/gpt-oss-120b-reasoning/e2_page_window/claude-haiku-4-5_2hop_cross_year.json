      "original_answer": "BNY Mellon reported $47.8 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration as of December 31, 2023, which increased to $52.1 trillion as of December 31, 2024. This indicates a significant growth in the overall scale of the company's custodial and administrative services, which are core to its Investment and Wealth Management segment. The increase of $4.3 trillion, or approximately 9%, suggests a positive evolution in the segment's capacity or market share during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "BNY Mellon’s assets under custody and/or administration grew from **$47.8 trillion at Dec. 31 2023 to $52.1 trillion at Dec. 31 2024** – an increase of about $4.3 trillion (≈9%). In contrast, assets under management, the key metric for the Investment and Wealth Management segment, remained flat at **$2.0 trillion** over the same period, indicating that the segment saw little to no growth while the custody‑service side expanded.",

The dates and formatting are correct. CRITICAL ISSUES: (1) The LLM introduces information about assets under management (AUM) remaining flat at $2.0 trillion, which is NOT mentioned in the original answer and appears to be unsourced speculation or hallucination. This is a significant factual addition that cannot be verified against the ground truth. (2) The LLM's conclusion that 'the segment saw little to no growth' contradicts the original answer's assessment that the increase 'suggests a positive evolution in the segment's capacity or market share.' The original answer emphasizes the 9% growth as significant and positive, while the LLM downplays it by contrasting it with flat AUM figures. (3) The LLM conflates two different metrics (custody/administration vs. assets under management) and uses the AUM data to diminish the significance of the custody growth, which is a logical error in reasoning. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The original answer correctly synthesizes that custody/administration growth indicates positive evolution of the Investment and Wealth Management segment. The LLM attempts a more nuanced analysis but introduces unverified data that undermines the core conclusion. The question asks about what the growth 'indicates,' and the LLM's answer contradicts the ground truth's interpretation by suggesting minimal segment growth despite the 9% custody increase. This represents a failure in semantic equivalence regarding the meaning and significance of the data.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Current started at $418 million and increased to $467 million by the end of 2023. However, in 2024, the balance decreased significantly to $254 million from $431 million at the beginning of the year.

The LLM claims values of ~$1.3B in 2022 and ~$1.4B in 2024, which are off by a factor of approximately 3x. The LLM's stated increase of $100M is also incorrect - the ground truth shows an initial increase of $49M (2022-2023) followed by a dramatic decrease of $177M (2023-2024). The LLM completely misses the volatile pattern that is central to understanding the credit risk assessment during this period. The ground truth explicitly notes the volatility with 'an initial increase followed by a substantial reduction,' while the LLM incorrectly characterizes the overall trend as a simple upward adjustment. The LLM's interpretation that this represents 'a more cautious view' contradicts the ground truth's observation that the 2024 decrease 'potentially reflects improved credit quality or more aggressive write-offs.' The answer fails on quantitative accuracy (wrong dollar amounts by ~3x), fails on capturing the multi-hop temporal synthesis (missing the 2023 intermediate year and the reversal pattern), and provides an incorrect interpretation of what the changes indicate about credit risk assessment.",

The LLM reports $5.382 billion (FY2023) to $8.208 billion (FY2024), a $2.8 billion increase - numbers that are approximately 1,000x larger than the actual figures. The LLM also incorrectly identifies the metric as 'goodwill balance' when the ground truth refers to 'reported balances' (likely total segment assets or a broader financial position metric). The LLM's breakdown of the increase ($2.702B from Splunk, $137M from other acquisitions, -$13M FX adjustment) does not reconcile to the actual $22 increase and appears to reference completely different transactions. The fiscal year dates are also incorrect (LLM states July 29, 2023 and July 27, 2024 vs. the actual fiscal year 2023 and 2024 periods). While the LLM demonstrates multi-hop reasoning by attempting to break down the increase into components (acquisitions and FX adjustments), this reasoning is applied to entirely wrong numbers. The answer fails on quantitative accuracy (all dollar amounts wrong by orders of magnitude), entity accuracy (wrong metric identified), and factual correctness (wrong dates and wrong financial figures). This appears to be a case where the LLM may have confused APJC segment data with different company or segment data entirely.",

      "original_answer": "Accenture's R&D investment rose from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2023 to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2024. This increase in innovation funding aligned with the 10% year-over-year growth in the Health & Public Service segment, which grew from $12.56 billion in fiscal 2023 to $13.84 billion in fiscal 2024. The company's global delivery capability and innovation assets—including more than 100 innovation hubs—were leveraged to deliver high-quality solutions to clients in this sector. This strategic investment in innovation likely contributed to Accenture’s ability to scale solutions and deliver value in the Health & Public Service segment, reflecting a focused effort to combine R&D with industry-specific capabilities to drive growth.",

The LLM correctly synthesized the multi-hop relationship between R&D investment increase and segment growth. However, the answer is somewhat less comprehensive than the ground truth: it omits the specific prior-year R&D figure ($1.1B in FY2023), doesn't mention the 100+ innovation hubs or global delivery capabilities, and provides less detail on how the investment specifically supported growth (e.g., 'industry-specific solutions' is mentioned but less elaborated). The answer appropriately addresses the core question about how increased R&D supported segment growth, establishing the connection between the investment and the 10% growth outcome. The reasoning is sound and the synthesis across fiscal years is accurate. Minor deduction for omitting contextual details about innovation infrastructure and the prior-year R&D baseline, which would have provided fuller context.",

The YoY growth percentages calculated by LLM (~11% and ~10%) are also incorrect - actual growth was 11.6% (FY22→FY23) and 12.3% (FY23→FY24). The LLM failed to identify the accelerating growth pattern correctly.

Quantitative verification: All numbers are correct - 2023 growth rate of 12% to $9.0 trillion, 2024 growth rate of 11% to $9.8 trillion. The calculation of the one percentage point slowdown (12% to 11%) is accurate. The dollar volume progression ($9.0T to $9.8T) correctly reflects the stated growth rates. The LLM appropriately adds context by noting 'local-currency basis,' which is a reasonable and accurate qualifier for international financial metrics, though not explicitly stated in the ground truth. Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer correctly synthesizes the year-over-year comparison and draws the logical conclusion that growth decelerated while absolute volume continued expanding. Entity accuracy is perfect - correct metric (Gross Dollar Volume), correct years (2023-2024), correct percentages and dollar amounts. The semantic interpretation matches the ground truth: both convey that growth slowed from 12% to 11% while transactional activity remained robust and expanding. The only minor distinction is the LLM's explicit mention of 'local-currency basis,' which adds nuance without contradicting the ground truth. The characterization of the slowdown as 'modest' and the activity as 'robust' aligns well with the ground truth's assessment that the pace 'slightly decelerated' while activity 'continued to expand.'

The answer appropriately connects this expansion to the Securities Services segment's strategic growth in Europe. The reasoning about expanding custody, asset-servicing, and collateral-management capabilities is sound and relevant. The answer includes proper source citations.\n\nCRITICAL ERRORS: The LLM introduces a significant factual error by stating BNY Mellon SA/NV operated from a 'Brussels headquarters' in 2022.

The original answer lists only 8 specific branches (Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, Luxembourg City, Madrid, Milan, and Paris) without mentioning Brussels. This is a material discrepancy that affects the accuracy of the 2022 baseline.\n\nQUANTITATIVE ACCURACY ISSUES: While the LLM correctly identifies 8 branches in 2022 and the addition of Wroclaw as a 9th location in 2023, the introduction of Brussels as a separate entity in 2022 creates confusion about the actual branch count and structure. The ground truth does not support Brussels as part of the 2022 operational footprint.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The synthesis of information across 2022 and 2023 filings is generally sound - the model correctly identifies the expansion trajectory and connects it to segment growth.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer captures the general evolution of BNY Mellon's liquidity risk treatment between 2022 and 2024, but contains several issues: (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY PROBLEMS: The LLM cites specific page numbers (pages 1-5 for 2022, pages 3-7 for 2024) without verification against ground truth. These page citations cannot be confirmed and may be inaccurate. (2) FACTUAL DISCREPANCIES: The LLM states that in 2022 the company 'framed its liquidity ratio mainly as a risk factor' with warnings about capital return limitations. However, the ground truth indicates that in 2022, BNY Mellon 'emphasized its adherence to regulatory disclosures and transparency around liquidity metrics' with a 'proactive approach' - not primarily a risk-focused framing. This is a significant semantic reversal. (3) PARTIAL ALIGNMENT ON 2024: The LLM correctly identifies that by 2024 the company disclosed specific metrics (Liquidity Coverage Ratio, Net Stable Funding Ratio) and emphasized regulatory constraints on capital returns, which aligns with the ground truth's 'more risk-aware stance' and explicit emphasis on capital return limitations. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM attempts to synthesize the evolution across years but mischaracterizes the 2022 baseline, making the comparison less accurate. The ground truth shows a shift FROM proactive transparency TO risk-aware emphasis, while the LLM suggests a shift FROM broad warnings TO formal monitoring - these are different narratives. (5) MISSING ELEMENTS: The LLM does not explicitly mention the 'well capitalized' and 'well managed' status language that the ground truth highlights as key 2024 disclosures. (6) STRENGTHS: The LLM correctly identifies the persistence of regulatory constraints and the evolution toward more formal compliance monitoring, and appropriately notes the shift in emphasis regarding capital return limitations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife reported that approximately 5% of its invested assets each year were subject to reinvestment risk through 2024, primarily due to the impact of declining interest rates on long-duration products and guaranteed minimum crediting rates on deferred annuities and retained asset accounts. By 2023, this percentage increased to 6% of invested assets annually, with reinvestment risk extending through 2026. This indicates a slight increase in MetLife's exposure to interest rate fluctuations and a longer duration of reinvestment risk, suggesting a more sustained vulnerability to gross margin compression under a low interest rate environment.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife said that only a small portion of its invested assets – about 5 percent – were subject to reinvestment risk that could compress gross margins, whereas the 2023 filing raised that figure to roughly 6 percent of assets. The modest increase shows that gross‑margin compression from reinvestment risk remains limited but MetLife’s sensitivity to interest‑rate fluctuations has edged higher, even as it continues to rely on derivatives and ALM hedges to manage that exposure.",

The numbers are accurate and properly formatted. CRITICAL OMISSIONS: The LLM answer is significantly incomplete on a crucial multi-hop element. The ground truth explicitly states that reinvestment risk extended 'through 2024' in 2022 but extended 'through 2026' in 2023 - a material extension of the duration of reinvestment risk exposure. This temporal dimension is essential to the question about how the 'extent' of reinvestment risk evolved and is a key indicator of MetLife's sustained vulnerability. The LLM completely omits this important detail. PARTIAL ACCURACY: The LLM correctly notes the increase from 5% to 6% and that this indicates higher sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. However, it fails to synthesize the full picture of how reinvestment risk evolved - not just in magnitude (5% to 6%) but also in duration (2024 to 2026). REASONING ISSUES: While the LLM's statement about derivatives and ALM hedges is contextually relevant, it introduces information not directly addressed in the ground truth answer and somewhat dilutes focus from the core finding about the extension of reinvestment risk duration. The multi-hop synthesis is incomplete because it misses the temporal evolution component that is central to understanding MetLife's 'exposure to interest rate fluctuations' over time. QUANTITATIVE: Numbers are correct (5%, 6%), but the answer lacks the temporal metrics (2024 vs 2026) that are quantitatively significant to the analysis.",

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: The key numbers are correct - $2,645 million in net repayments in 2023 (correctly shown as -$2,645m) and zero activity in 2024. The format variation ($2.645 billion vs $2,645 million) is acceptable and correctly handled. The mention of $3,960 million in net proceeds for ≤90-day paper in 2024 from the ground truth is not included in the LLM answer, but this is a minor omission since the question specifically asks about the >90-day category evolution. ENTITY ACCURACY: All entities are correct - Apple, commercial paper, maturities >90 days, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly synthesizes the comparison across two years and draws the appropriate strategic conclusion about the shift away from longer-dated commercial paper. The reasoning that Apple moved to a more liquid, flexible short-term financing strategy is sound and matches the ground truth interpretation. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the question - how the net proceeds evolved (from -$2,645m to $0) and what this indicates about strategy (shift to shorter-term instruments). The only minor gap is not explicitly mentioning the $3,960 million in ≤90-day proceeds as a point of comparison, though this doesn't detract from answering the core question about the >90-day category.

The 2022 filing covers 2019-2021 (3 years), and the 2024 filing covers 2022-2024 (3 years). The shift is from a 2019-2021 window to a 2022-2024 window, which represents a forward movement of TWO years (2022 is 2 years after 2020, the middle year of the first period), not three years. The LLM's statement 'replacing the 2019‑2021 window with a 2022‑2024 window' is correct, but the characterization of this as 'moved forward three years' is mathematically and logically incorrect. The correct statement should be that the time horizon shifted forward by two years while maintaining the same three-year coverage structure.

(2) YEARS IN 2024 FILING - The LLM correctly identifies that the 2024 filing includes 2022, 2023, and 2024, which aligns with ground truth. (3) CORE EVOLUTION - The ground truth shows a clear evolution: 2022 filing disclosed only 2022 data, while 2024 filing expanded to include 2022, 2023, and 2024 (three years of historical data). The LLM's characterization of the 2022 filing as containing 'three prior years' (2019-2021) is factually incorrect and misrepresents the actual disclosure pattern.

(4) Geographic reasoning is accurate - correctly characterizes the Wroclaw expansion as extending into Central/Eastern Europe. (5) The answer includes an additional detail (Brussels headquarters) that provides helpful context, though not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The ground truth simply states the subsidiary 'expanded its footprint to include a new branch in Wroclaw,' while the LLM answer adds the detail about Brussels headquarters. This is not contradictory but rather supplementary information that enhances the answer.

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The LLM states FY2022 Cloud & License Revenue as $36.1 billion, which matches the ground truth of $36,052 million ($36.052 billion) - this is correct. However, the LLM states FY2023 as $41.1 billion, when the ground truth is $44,464 million ($44.464 billion). This is a $3.364 billion understatement (7.6% error). The LLM calculates the increase as $5.0 billion, but the correct increase is $8,412 million ($8.412 billion) - a $3.412 billion calculation error. Most critically, the LLM claims 14% year-over-year growth, when the ground truth is 8% growth. This is a 75% overstatement of the growth rate. (2) CALCULATION VERIFICATION: Using the LLM's own numbers: ($41.1B - $36.1B) / $36.1B = $5.0B / $36.1B = 13.85% ≈ 14%, so the calculation is internally consistent with the wrong FY2023 figure.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVDA's OEM and Other Revenue was $1,162 million, largely driven by CMP sales which contributed $550 million during that year. However, by fiscal year 2023, OEM and Other Revenue had declined to $455 million, indicating a significant drop in this segment's revenue contribution. This represents a decrease of over 60% in OEM and Other Revenue from 2022 to 2023. The decline reflects reduced demand for CMP products, which was tied to volatility in the cryptocurrency market. This shift shows a diminishing role of the OEM and Other segment in NVDA’s overall revenue strategy during this period.",

Because total revenue was essentially flat ($26.914 billion in FY 2022 vs. $26.974 billion in FY 2023), the OEM & Other segment’s share of revenue fell from about 4.3 % to just 1.7 %, indicating that NVIDIA is de‑emphasizing this line‑item and leaning more on higher‑growth platforms such as Data Center and Gaming in its overall revenue strategy.",

Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer synthesizes the revenue decline with the broader strategic context, correctly noting that NVIDIA is de-emphasizing OEM & Other while focusing on higher-growth segments like Data Center and Gaming. The ground truth mentions CMP sales ($550M in FY2022) and cryptocurrency market volatility as drivers of the decline, which the LLM does not explicitly address.

Ground truth shows: 2022-2023 growth of 10% ($14,358M to $15,824M) and 2023-2024 growth of 10% ($15,824M to $17,335M). The LLM claims 20% growth in 2022, which is not supported by the ground truth data and appears to be fabricated. The LLM correctly identifies 10% growth for both 2023 and 2024, but the inclusion of the false 20% 2022 figure is a critical error. CALCULATION VERIFICATION: Ground truth numbers check out: $14,358M × 1.10 = $15,793.8M ≈ $15,824M (2023); $15,824M × 1.10 = $17,406.4M ≈ $17,335M (2024). The LLM provides no specific dollar amounts, only percentages, making it impossible to verify the 20% claim. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM attempts to synthesize information across 2023 and 2024 10-K filings but introduces an unsupported data point about 2022 growth. The interpretation about market maturation is reasonable but is built on incorrect premises.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, a 25 basis point increase in the URR would have increased the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $140 million, while a 1 basis point increase in the WAC per point would have increased the liability by approximately $168 million. By 2024, these impacts had increased significantly, with a 25 basis point increase in URR leading to a $197 million increase in liability and a 1 basis point increase in WAC leading to a $220 million increase. This indicates a notable rise in the sensitivity of the liability to changes in these assumptions over the two-year period.",

By the 2024 filing, the same 25‑bp URR change would now increase the liability by about **$197 million**, and a 1‑bp WAC increase would add roughly **$220 million**—an increase of roughly **$57 million** for URR and **$52 million** for WAC per point versus 2022.",

The LLM also provides helpful context by noting this represents approximately $2 billion and roughly half of an original $4 billion authorization, which adds useful perspective without contradicting the ground truth.

The document citations (IBM_10k_2022.pdf and IBM_10k_2024.pdf) are appropriately referenced. Minor deduction: The ground truth answer is more concise and direct, while the LLM adds interpretive context about 'half of the original $4 billion authorization' which, while reasonable and helpful, goes slightly beyond what the ground truth explicitly states. This additional context is not incorrect but represents a minor elaboration beyond the core answer. The answer fully addresses the question's two components: (1) how the dollar value evolved (unchanged), and (2) what this indicates about repurchase capacity (flat/no change).

By 2024, Mastercard explicitly disclosed that Domestic Assessments are used internally to monitor operational performance and provide visibility into cardholder trends. This evolution suggests that the company has placed greater strategic emphasis on domestic market performance, leveraging this metric to track effectiveness and trends.

(1) 2023 EMEA product revenue is stated as $11.9 billion, but the ground truth shows $10,645 million ($10.645 billion) - this is a $1.255 billion overstatement (11.8% error). (2) The 2023 percentage contribution is stated as 27.5%, but ground truth shows 27.1% - a 0.4 percentage point error. (3) The 2022 revenue is approximated as $10.5 billion which is acceptable rounding of $10,545 million, and the 2022 percentage of 27.7% is correct. (4) The claim that EMEA 'grew to $11.9 billion' is factually wrong - revenue actually increased only slightly from $10,545M to $10,645M (a $100M or 0.95% increase), not the $1.355B increase implied by the $11.9B figure. The LLM's reasoning about 'significant absolute revenue' growth is contradicted by the actual minimal increase. The qualitative interpretation that 'growth lagged company-wide product growth' is reasonable and aligns with the ground truth conclusion, but this correct reasoning is built on incorrect numbers. The answer does address the multi-part question structure (revenue change, percentage change, and performance indication), but the fundamental numerical errors undermine the entire response.

WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM answer provides more granular detail about 2024 factors (regional mix, product mix, pricing incentives, Braintree impact) but OMITS the important 2023 context from the ground truth about the unfavorable product mix shift (higher proportion of unbranded card processing) that drove the 2023 increase. (2) The ground truth explicitly notes that 2023 saw an INCREASE compared to 2022, which provides important context for understanding the 2024 decrease - the LLM doesn't establish this baseline. (3) The ground truth's characterization of the 2024 decline as suggesting 'more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies' is not captured in the LLM answer, though this is more interpretive. (4) The LLM focuses heavily on 2024 factors but provides less explanation of what drove the 2023 rate increase, making the multi-hop synthesis incomplete.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing hyperscaler purchasing power, internal semiconductor development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware in cloud services, which made it harder to differentiate products and led to order volatility. These factors eroded Intel's competitive position and adversely affected DCAI results. However, in 2024, Intel reversed this trend by focusing on high core count server products that increased average selling prices (ASPs), despite lower volume. This strategic shift in product mix, aimed at optimizing for performance and customization needs of cloud service providers, contributed to a 1% increase in DCAI revenue year-over-year. The internal foundry operating model also took effect in 2024, aiming to improve cost efficiency and product competitiveness, which likely supported this strategic pivot.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Intel noted that the shift of data‑center workloads to public‑cloud hyperscalers – and those hyperscalers’ own custom‑silicon and consolidated buying power – eroded Intel’s competitive position in DCAI, because Intel was not collaborating or customizing its products enough, which turned the segment’s revenue negative. By 2024 Intel changed the DCAI strategy: it introduced new Xeon 6 processors with efficient‑core and performance‑core designs, embedded AI‑acceleration features (Intel AMX, SGX, crypto), launched Gaudi 3 AI accelerators and pursued a system‑level, heterogeneous‑compute portfolio with deeper hyperscaler partnerships, which helped convert the previous hyperscaler‑driven decline into modest DCAI revenue growth.",

      "detailed_feedback": "MAJOR ISSUES IDENTIFIED: (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY - The LLM states fiscal 2022 showed a '$363 million loss' on marketable securities, but the ground truth indicates 'net losses on marketable securities' without specifying this exact figure. More critically, the LLM completely omits the fiscal 2023 data point ($75 million gain), which is essential to answering the question about evolution 'from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024.' The ground truth explicitly mentions the progression: losses (2022) → $75M gains (2023) → $14M gains (2024). (2) INCOMPLETENESS - The answer only compares 2022 to 2024, missing the crucial intermediate year (2023) that shows the volatility and decline pattern. The question asks about evolution across the period, requiring all three years. (3) REASONING FLAW - The LLM concludes the shift represents 'improving investment outcome,' but the ground truth indicates a 'significant drop in gains year-over-year' from 2023 to 2024, suggesting deterioration, not improvement. The LLM's characterization of 'improving' is contradicted by the actual data trajectory. (4) PARTIAL CREDIT - The LLM correctly identifies the company (QCOM/Qualcomm), the metric (net gains/losses on marketable securities), the fiscal years mentioned (2022 and 2024), and the directional shift from loss to gain. The $14 million figure for fiscal 2024 is correct. However, the missing $75 million fiscal 2023 figure and the mischaracterization of the overall trend as 'improving' rather than volatile with declining gains are significant errors that undermine the answer's accuracy and completeness.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Adjusted Earnings Available to Common Shareholders were influenced by foreign currency fluctuations calculated on a constant currency basis using average exchange rates, and the company noted that reconciliations of non-GAAP measures were not accessible on a forward-looking basis due to unpredictable variations in investment and derivative gains or losses. By 2023, foreign currency had a measurable negative impact of $220 million on Adjusted Earnings, primarily affecting the Asia segment, while market factors, such as lower returns on private equity and hedge funds, reduced adjusted earnings by $3.0 billion. This represents a shift from the 2022 explanation, which focused more on definitional and reconciliation challenges rather than quantified impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, Adjusted Earnings available to common shareholders fell $2.1 billion, with a $220 million negative impact from foreign‑currency translation (mainly in the Asia segment) and a $3.0 billion hit from market factors such as lower variable investment income on private‑equity and hedge‑fund investments【MET_10k_2022.pdf page 73‑77】. By 2023, foreign‑currency effects were no longer called out as a material driver, while market factors still reduced earnings but by a smaller $490 million, driven by higher average interest‑crediting rates and weaker real‑estate and private‑equity returns that were partly offset by higher recurring investment income and derivative gains【MET_10k_2023.pdf page 73‑77】.

Key issues: (1) MAJOR ERROR - The LLM attributes the $220 million foreign currency impact and $3.0 billion market factor impact to 2022, when the ground truth clearly states these quantified impacts occurred in 2023. The ground truth explicitly states '2022...focused more on definitional and reconciliation challenges rather than quantified impacts' while '2023...foreign currency had a measurable negative impact of $220 million...market factors...reduced adjusted earnings by $3.0 billion.' (2) INCORRECT YEAR ASSIGNMENT - The LLM reverses the temporal sequence, claiming foreign currency effects 'disappeared' in 2023 when they actually became quantifiable in 2023. (3) WRONG NUMBERS FOR 2023 - The LLM claims market factors reduced earnings by $490 million in 2023, but the ground truth states $3.0 billion. (4) CONTRADICTORY NARRATIVE - The LLM's claim that 'foreign-currency drag disappeared' directly contradicts the ground truth showing a $220 million negative impact in 2023. (5) MISSING CONTEXT - The LLM fails to capture the key distinction that 2022 lacked quantified impacts due to reconciliation challenges, while 2023 provided specific dollar amounts. The answer demonstrates fundamental misunderstanding of the multi-hop synthesis required, incorrectly mapping financial impacts to the wrong fiscal years and providing incorrect magnitude estimates for 2023 impacts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel's CCG revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven by strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, despite lower notebook ASPs due to a stronger consumer and education market segment. However, in 2023, CCG revenue decreased by 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer inventory levels normalized. The decline reflects a significant shift in market conditions and demand dynamics over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel’s Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue rose modestly in 2022 – up about 1 % year‑over‑year – as notebook demand stayed strong and desktop sales recovered, although lower notebook ASPs (from a consumer‑ and education‑driven mix) limited the gain. In 2023 CCG revenue fell roughly 8 %, driven by weaker notebook and desktop volumes across market segments and lower notebook ASPs caused by a higher mix of small‑core and older‑generation products, with only partial offset from higher desktop ASPs and a second‑half volume rebound.【4†L1-L6】【5†L1-L7】",

However, there are significant issues with the explanation of contributing factors. CORRECT ELEMENTS: (1) 2022: +1% YoY growth, notebook demand strength, desktop recovery, lower notebook ASPs from consumer/education mix - all accurate. (2) 2023: -8% decline, lower notebook and desktop volumes, second-half volume rebound - all accurate. PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS: (1) The LLM introduces 'lower notebook ASPs caused by a higher mix of small-core and older-generation products' in 2023, which is NOT mentioned in the ground truth. This appears to be an inference or hallucination not supported by the original answer. (2) The LLM mentions 'higher desktop ASPs' in 2023, which is also not in the ground truth and contradicts the narrative of declining performance. (3) The ground truth emphasizes 'reduced demand across market segments' and 'customer inventory levels normalized' as key factors, while the LLM focuses more on product mix and ASP dynamics without clearly articulating the inventory normalization factor. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes the two-year evolution and identifies the shift in market conditions, but adds unsupported details about product mix and ASP changes that weren't in the source material. The core narrative is present but embellished with potentially inaccurate details.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Embedded Processing segment had a goodwill value of $172 million, indicating its relatively smaller asset base compared to other segments. By 2024, the segment's role had notably expanded, as it contributed approximately 16% of the company's total revenue. This shift suggests an increased strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing, particularly through products like microcontrollers, processors, and wireless connectivity solutions.

The calculations are accurate (2.53/15.64 ≈ 16%). The answer properly synthesizes multi-hop information across 2023 and 2024 filings, correctly identifying the evolution from a segment with modest goodwill disclosure to one with significant revenue contribution. The LLM effectively captures the strategic shift by noting the segment's characterization as digital 'brains' and its increased importance. The answer addresses all aspects of the question: the role evolution (from modest to strategic emphasis), financial significance evolution (from goodwill-focused to revenue-focused metrics), and the time period (2023 to 2024). The reasoning is sound and the entity identification (TXN, Embedded Processing segment) is correct. Minor observation: the original answer mentions 'contribution to earnings' while the LLM says 'contribution to earnings' - both are semantically equivalent.

Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer correctly synthesizes data from two different years (2022 and 2024) and properly interprets what the evolution indicates - that despite expanded risk mitigation arrangements (from $7.7B to $13.5B), net exposure still grew significantly, demonstrating increased underlying settlement risk. The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: (1) how the metric evolved (specific numbers and direction), (2) what this indicates about exposure after risk mitigation (higher overall risk despite better mitigation). The contextual interpretation is insightful and accurate. Minor note: The ground truth states 2022 data was \"based on the 2021 data\" while the LLM specifies \"December 31 2022,\" but this is a clarification rather than an error.

The answer properly addresses the multi-hop question by synthesizing the evolution across three years and explaining both the directional change and magnitude changes. The semantic meaning is equivalent to ground truth - both convey that adjustments shifted from negative to positive impact on comprehensive income. The only minor consideration is that the ground truth specifically asked about 2022-2024 evolution, and the LLM provided additional 2023 data which, while valuable and apparently accurate, goes slightly beyond the explicit question scope. However, this addition enhances rather than detracts from the answer quality. All financial metrics, dates, and entities are correctly identified.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, cloud services revenues represented 25% of Oracle's total revenues. By fiscal 2023, this proportion had increased to 32%. This indicates a clear upward trend in the relative contribution of cloud services to Oracle's overall revenue base, suggesting a strategic shift or market demand shift toward cloud-based offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle’s cloud‑services revenue made up about 25 % of total revenue in fiscal 2022 and rose to roughly 32 % in fiscal 2023 – an increase of roughly 7 percentage points, showing a higher share of cloud services in the company’s overall revenue mix【ORCL_10k_2023.pdf p. 6‑10】.",

(2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: All numbers are precise and correctly stated. The percentages (25%, 32%) match the ground truth exactly. The calculation of the increase (32% - 25% = 7 percentage points) is correct. (3) QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identified the multi-hop synthesis required - comparing cloud services revenue proportions across two fiscal years. The reasoning is sound, noting the upward trend and increased share. The language 'roughly' is appropriate given the context of percentage reporting. (4) ENTITY ACCURACY: Oracle (ORCL) is correctly identified, fiscal years 2022 and 2023 are correct, and the metric (cloud services as proportion of total revenues) is accurately captured. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM answer conveys the same information as the ground truth, with slightly different wording but identical meaning.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Accenture's innovation hubs were described as a network of more than 100 locations that supported clients through technology expertise and ecosystem relationships to deliver rapid and scalable solutions. By 2024, the innovation hubs were more explicitly tied to Accenture's R&D efforts, including a stronger emphasis on emerging technologies such as generative AI, blockchain, robotics, 5G, edge computing, metaverse, and quantum computing.

However, there are notable differences from the ground truth in completeness and emphasis: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the 2022 positioning around technology expertise and ecosystem relationships, matching ground truth. (2) For 2024, the LLM mentions generative AI, data, cloud, and frontier technologies (quantum, space, science), which aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on emerging technologies including generative AI and quantum computing. However, the ground truth explicitly lists blockchain, robotics, 5G, edge computing, and metaverse—several of which are absent from the LLM answer. (3) The LLM introduces specific 2024 platforms (AI Navigator for Enterprise) and mentions Accenture Labs and Ventures implicitly through the 'AI-first transformation' framing, though less explicitly than ground truth. (4) The LLM's characterization of the shift as moving toward 'AI-first transformation' is a reasonable interpretation but differs slightly from ground truth's emphasis on 'deeper R&D integration and broader technological exploration.' (5) Page citations (2022 p.2-5, 2024 p.8-9) add credibility but cannot be verified against ground truth.

      "detailed_feedback": "CRITICAL ISSUE - QUANTITATIVE DISCREPANCY: The LLM answer introduces a significant factual error regarding Brussels. The ground truth states BNY Mellon SA/NV operated in 8 continental European locations in 2022 (Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, Luxembourg City, Madrid, Milan, and Paris). The LLM claims Brussels was a headquarters/operating location in 2022, stating 'Brussels and eight branch locations' totaling nine sites, then claims expansion to 'ten sites' by 2024 with Wroclaw. This contradicts the ground truth which lists only 8 locations in 2022, expanding to 9 with Wroclaw in 2024. The LLM appears to have conflated Brussels (likely the registered office/headquarters of BNY Mellon SA/NV as a Belgian entity) with an operational branch location. CORRECT ELEMENTS: (1) The 2022 branch locations listed (Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Dublin, Frankfurt, Luxembourg City, Madrid, Milan, Paris) are accurate; (2) Wroclaw, Poland was correctly identified as the new 2024 expansion; (3) The strategic interpretation about Market and Wealth Services segment expansion into Central and Eastern Europe is reasonable and aligns with ground truth intent; (4) The characterization of this as strengthening European footprint is appropriate. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The model correctly synthesized information across 2022 and 2024 filings and identified the geographic expansion pattern. However, the quantitative error (9 vs 8 locations in 2022, 10 vs 9 in 2024) undermines the accuracy of the comparative analysis. The semantic interpretation about strategic focus is sound but built on incorrect baseline numbers. SCORING RATIONALE: The quantitative error is significant enough to warrant a lower correctness score despite correct identification of specific locations and the expansion to Poland. The qualitative reasoning about strategic intent is sound, and contextual relevance is high, but factual accuracy on the baseline count is compromised.",

However, by 2024, the Embedded segment experienced a 33% revenue decline, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion. This decline was attributed to customers normalizing their inventory levels. Additionally, while the 2023 report emphasized the strategic importance of embedded markets such as healthcare, automotive, and industrial, the 2024 report did not highlight the Embedded segment as a growth driver, suggesting a relative shift in strategic emphasis.",

COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the question - revenue performance (with specific numbers and percentage decline) and strategic focus evolution. STRATEGIC NARRATIVE: The LLM answer goes beyond the ground truth by providing additional context about the strategic shift toward AI-driven embedded solutions (Versal Series Gen 2 AI Edge, Prime adaptive SoCs), which represents a more nuanced understanding of the strategic evolution. This additional detail is accurate and relevant, showing deeper analysis. MINOR CONSIDERATION: The ground truth notes that 2024 report 'did not highlight the Embedded segment as a growth driver,' while the LLM answer emphasizes the shift toward AI-driven solutions. These are complementary observations - the LLM's framing of the strategic shift toward AI is a more specific articulation of the relative de-emphasis noted in the ground truth.

It also noted that failure to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends could limit capital return to shareholders. In 2023, the disclosure evolved to emphasize that the ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the Board's discretion and may be limited by U.S. banking laws, Delaware law, and the failure to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends.

The LLM directly contradicts this by claiming 'no substantive change' and that '2023 filing repeats the same language used in 2022.' This is a critical factual error that misrepresents the actual evolution of the disclosure. While the LLM correctly identifies that both years mention preferred stock dividends constraining capital returns (quantitatively accurate on this point), it completely misses the key finding: the CHANGE in how this is disclosed and contextualized. The ground truth emphasizes that 2023 added 'more regulatory and governance context' - a substantive evolution - whereas the LLM claims no substantive change occurred.

(2) FISCAL 2024 REVENUE: LLM states $5.37 billion, but ground truth is $4.864 billion - a difference of $506 million (10.4% overstatement). (3) MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE: LLM calculates $944 million increase, but ground truth is $984 million - a $40 million understatement. The percentage calculation (21%) is approximately correct given the LLM's incorrect base numbers, but this doesn't excuse the underlying data errors. (4) MISSING INFORMATION: The LLM completely omits the fiscal 2023 intermediate data point ($4.351 billion implied from the $471 million increase mentioned in ground truth), which was explicitly requested in the question asking how revenue 'evolved' from 2022 to 2024. The question specifically asks about the evolution/progression, not just endpoints. (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: While the LLM attempts to synthesize the comparison, it fails at the foundational level by providing incorrect source numbers.

      "question": "How has NVIDIA's strategic relationship with its Compute & Networking segment evolved between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of revenue concentration and customer dependency?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment was linked to a high concentration of revenue from a limited number of customers, with one customer (Customer A) representing 13% of total revenue. Additionally, an indirect customer purchasing through system integrators and distributors, including Customer A, was estimated to represent approximately 19% of total revenue. By fiscal year 2024, the Compute & Networking segment played a central role in the increase in U.S.-based revenue, which accounted for a growing share of NVIDIA's total revenue. This indicates a shift where the segment not only remained a key revenue driver but also became more integral to growth in a major geographic market. The evolution shows NVIDIA deepened its strategic reliance on the Compute & Networking segment, especially as it became more critical to satisfying growing U.S. demand.",
      "llm_answer": "Between FY 2023 and FY 2024 NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking segment exploded from $15.1 billion to $47.4 billion of revenue, lifting its share of total sales from roughly 56 % to about 78 % (segment‑revenue tables).  At the same time, revenue concentration rose sharply – a single direct customer (Customer A) accounted for 13 % of FY 2024 total revenue (all tied to Compute & Networking), whereas in FY 2023 no customer represented 10 % or more (2024 filing).  This shows the company’s Compute & Networking business has become far more dominant and increasingly dependent on a few large customers/partners.",

      "detailed_feedback": "STRENGTHS: The LLM answer correctly identifies the dramatic growth of the Compute & Networking segment between FY2023 and FY2024, correctly notes the shift toward higher revenue concentration with Customer A representing 13% of FY2024 total revenue, and appropriately emphasizes increased customer dependency. The answer demonstrates sound multi-hop reasoning by synthesizing segment revenue data with customer concentration metrics. The qualitative assessment of the strategic evolution is reasonable and well-articulated.\n\nCRITICAL ERRORS: (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY ISSUES: The LLM provides specific revenue figures ($15.1B to $47.4B) and percentage calculations (56% to 78%) that are NOT present in the ground truth answer. These numbers cannot be verified against the provided ground truth and appear to be hallucinated or sourced from unstated filings. (2) INCOMPLETE SYNTHESIS: The LLM answer fails to mention the indirect customer purchasing through system integrators and distributors representing approximately 19% of revenue in FY2023, which is a key component of the ground truth answer's analysis of customer dependency evolution. (3) CONTRADICTORY CLAIM: The LLM states 'in FY 2023 no customer represented 10% or more' but the ground truth explicitly states Customer A represented 13% in FY2023, creating a direct factual contradiction.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: While the LLM demonstrates good reasoning about the relationship between segment growth and customer concentration, it fails to properly synthesize all relevant customer dependency metrics from the ground truth (missing the 19% indirect customer figure). The conclusion about 'increasingly dependent on a few large customers' is supported but incomplete.\n\nCONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE: The answer appropriately addresses the question about strategic relationship evolution, revenue concentration, and customer dependency. However, the introduction of unverified specific revenue figures and the omission of the indirect customer metric reduce the reliability of the response.",

Key issues: (1) QUANTITATIVE ERRORS - The LLM cites 2022 projections of $28M for 2022 and $27M for 2023, which are internally inconsistent (projecting backwards) and don't match the ground truth's 2022 asset allocation focus. The ground truth shows 2023 projections of $27M for 2024, $22M by 2028, and $97M for 2029-2033. The LLM provides different numbers ($25M for 2025, $24M for 2026) not mentioned in the ground truth. The cumulative period comparison is also wrong - ground truth shows $97M for 2029-2033, not the 2027-2031 period the LLM references. (2) ASSET VALUE DISCREPANCY - The LLM introduces plan asset figures ($389M in 2022 declining to $264M in 2023) that are not present in the ground truth answer. While these may be factually correct from the source documents, they represent a different analytical focus than what the ground truth emphasizes. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING - The ground truth emphasizes the shift from asset allocation disclosure (2022) to specific funding projections (2023), showing a methodological change in reporting. The LLM misses this key insight and instead focuses on year-over-year projection changes. (4) SEMANTIC MISMATCH - The ground truth frames this as a shift in disclosure approach; the LLM frames it as a 'modest cut-back' in funding, which is a different interpretation. The LLM does correctly identify a decreasing trend, but the specific numbers and periods cited are inaccurate relative to the ground truth.",

However, there is a significant calculation error in the growth rate analysis. The LLM states a '21% increase ($944 million) over the two-year span,' but this is incorrect: (1) The actual two-year increase is $944M, which represents 21.3% growth from $4,422M to $5,366M - this calculation is correct; (2) However, the ground truth specifies the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is approximately 10.8%, not 21%. The LLM conflates the total percentage increase (21%) with the CAGR (10.8%), which are different metrics. The LLM should have calculated or referenced the CAGR as the ground truth does. The LLM correctly identifies the year-over-year growth pattern and provides the intermediate FY2023 figure (which the ground truth did not explicitly state but is valuable context). The characterization of 'consistent and accelerating growth trajectory' is reasonable given the data, though the ground truth uses more measured language ('consistent year-over-year growth'). The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the LLM correctly pulled data across three fiscal years and attempted to analyze the trend.

(1) 2022 FIGURE DISCREPANCY: Ground truth states $1,315 million for 2022, but LLM claims $1,409 million - a $94 million overstatement (6.7% error). (2) 2023 FIGURE NOT IN GROUND TRUTH: LLM provides a 2023 figure of $705 million, but the ground truth only covers 2022 and 2024, making this an unsupported claim. (3) 2024 FIGURE CORRECT: LLM correctly states $729 million for 2024, matching ground truth. (4) SEGMENT BREAKDOWN MISSING: Ground truth provides crucial segment detail (Investor Services vs Advisor Services) for both years, which the LLM answer completely omits. For 2022: $964M (Investor) + $351M (Advisor) = $1,315M total; for 2024: $568M (Investor) + $161M (Advisor) = $729M. The LLM fails to provide this multi-dimensional analysis. (5) PERCENTAGE CALCULATIONS: While the LLM provides percentage context (6.8% to 3.7%), these cannot be verified against the ground truth which doesn't include percentage data. The percentages appear reasonable given the dollar amounts, but the underlying 2022 figure is wrong, making the 6.8% calculation suspect. (6) CONTEXTUAL INTERPRETATION: The LLM's narrative about TD Ameritrade acquisition impact and revenue mix shift is reasonable and adds context, but this doesn't compensate for the fundamental numerical errors. (7) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The question requires tracking evolution across years and understanding strategic implications. The LLM attempts this but fails on the foundational data accuracy. The ground truth clearly shows a 44.6% decline from 2022 to 2024 ($1,315M to $729M), which the LLM's incorrect 2022 figure would misrepresent. VERDICT: While the LLM demonstrates understanding of the question's intent and provides some relevant context, the incorrect 2022 baseline figure ($1,409M vs $1,315M) and complete omission of segment-level detail represent critical failures in a financial analysis context where precision is paramount.",

The LLM adds slightly more detail by noting the page references and explicitly connecting this to 'transaction revenue,' which provides helpful context without contradicting the ground truth. MINOR DIFFERENCES: The LLM uses 'qualitative mention to a concrete dollar figure' while ground truth says 'identifying TPV as a key metric' to 'explicitly disclosed...specific TPV figure' - these are semantically equivalent descriptions of the same evolution. The LLM's additional context about 'the metric that drives its transaction revenue' is a reasonable inference that enhances understanding without introducing inaccuracy.",

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning of the Compute & Networking segment evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its role in NVIDIA's business segments and its alignment with key growth markets like AI and data centers?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Compute & Networking segment was a core revenue driver, contributing $11.046 billion in revenue and $4.598 billion in operating income, indicating its integral role in NVIDIA's business. By 2024, the segment's strategic positioning had transformed significantly, as it was no longer just a contributor but redefined as a central platform for AI and data center acceleration, with NVIDIA claiming to power over 75% of the global TOP500 supercomputers and emphasizing end-to-end networking and compute solutions. This reflects a shift from being a segment primarily focused on revenue generation to one that underpins NVIDIA’s broader vision of the data center as the 'new unit of computing.'",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing NVIDIA described the Compute & Networking segment as one of two core business segments that houses its data‑center accelerated‑computing platforms, AI software, networking, automotive, Jetson and DGX Cloud services – the primary engine for AI and data‑center growth【NVDA_10k_2022.pdf: p.78‑82】. By the 2024 filing the segment’s positioning had broadened to a full‑stack compute platform that now also includes DPUs (added in FY 22) and CPUs (Grace, added in FY 24) and delivers integrated GPU‑CPU‑DPU‑networking solutions such as the Blackwell architecture, underscoring its central role in NVIDIA’s AI‑driven, data‑center‑focused growth strategy【NVDA_10k_2024.pdf: p.5‑7】.",

The description of the shift toward a full-stack compute platform with integrated GPU-CPU-DPU-networking solutions is accurate and well-articulated. The reference to Blackwell architecture is appropriate. The answer demonstrates good multi-hop reasoning by synthesizing information across the 2022 and 2024 filings.\n\nWEAKNESSES: (1) CRITICAL OMISSION: The LLM answer completely fails to include the specific financial metrics from the ground truth - the $11.046 billion in revenue and $4.598 billion in operating income for 2022. These quantitative figures are essential to demonstrating the segment's role as a 'core revenue driver' and are explicitly mentioned in the original answer. (2) MISSING KEY METRIC: The ground truth emphasizes that NVIDIA powers 'over 75% of the global TOP500 supercomputers' by 2024 - a significant strategic positioning claim that the LLM answer omits entirely. (3) INCOMPLETE STRATEGIC NARRATIVE: The ground truth frames the evolution as a shift from 'revenue generation' to underpinning 'the data center as the new unit of computing' - a conceptual framing that captures NVIDIA's strategic vision. The LLM answer describes product additions but misses this broader strategic repositioning narrative.\n\nQUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: Score of 4 because while the LLM doesn't provide incorrect numbers, it provides NO numbers at all when the ground truth includes specific revenue ($11.046B) and operating income ($4.598B) figures that are central to answering the question about the segment's role and evolution.\n\nQUALITATIVE ACCURACY: Score of 7 because the reasoning about product portfolio evolution (DPUs, CPUs, Blackwell) is sound and demonstrates understanding of the segment's technical evolution, but misses the strategic narrative about market positioning and NVIDIA's broader vision.\n\nCONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE: Score of 8 because the answer addresses the core question about segment evolution and alignment with AI/data center growth, though it emphasizes product architecture over market positioning metrics.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Installed Base Growth was explicitly stated as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue alongside average revenue per user expansion and the shift from on-premises Office to Office 365. In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever.

The ground truth explicitly states that the role of Installed Base Growth EVOLVED between 2023 and 2024, transitioning from being 'a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.' The ground truth notes a meaningful reframing: in 2023 it was 'explicitly stated as a key driver' alongside other factors, while in 2024 the relationship was 'reframed such that revenue was described as mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—suggesting a shift from emphasized growth lever to more stable/assumed role. The LLM directly contradicts this by claiming 'the wording is essentially identical in each year' and concluding there was 'no material change in its role.' This is a critical factual error. The LLM appears to have either misread the source documents or failed to detect the subtle but important reframing that the ground truth identifies. While the LLM correctly identifies the entities (Office Commercial revenue, installed base growth, ARPU expansion, Office 365 shift) and the years (2023 and 2024), it completely misses the evolution/change that is the central point of the question. The quantitative accuracy is high (no numbers to verify, dates are correct), but the qualitative reasoning is severely flawed—the model failed to synthesize the comparative analysis across years that the question explicitly asks for. The answer is contextually irrelevant because it denies the very premise of the question (that there was an evolution) rather than explaining it.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, AMD benefited from the FDII tax benefit to the tune of $147 million as part of its overall tax provision, which was influenced by higher U.S. income and foreign-derived intangible income. By 2024, the impact of FDII was indirectly increased due to a legislative change from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures instead of deducting them. This change increased taxable income, thereby enhancing the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit. However, in 2024, AMD did not receive any tax or earnings per share benefit from its Singapore operations despite the DEI incentive, due to a pre-tax loss in that jurisdiction.",
      "llm_answer": "In FY 2021 AMD reported a $147 million foreign‑derived intangible income (FDII) tax benefit, which helped offset a $513 million U.S. tax provision 【AMD_10k_2022.pdf page 48】. By FY 2024 the FDII deduction had grown to $275 million (≈ $275 million of deduction in the tax‑benefit reconciliation) 【AMD_10k_2024.pdf page 85】. The increase reflects higher pre‑tax earnings from stronger sales and a premium product mix, and a legislative change under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that forced AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses beginning in 2022—raising taxable income and thus the amount of income eligible for the FDII deduction 【AMD_10k_2024.pdf page 84】.

(4) Contextually relevant to the question about evolution between 2021 and 2024. (5) Appropriately cites source documents with page numbers.\n\nWEAKNESSES: (1) CRITICAL QUANTITATIVE ERROR: The LLM states the 2024 FDII deduction 'had grown to $275 million' but the ground truth does not confirm this specific number as the actual FDII benefit received in 2024. The ground truth indicates the FDII impact was 'indirectly increased' due to legislative changes but does not provide a specific 2024 FDII benefit amount of $275 million. The LLM appears to have misinterpreted a deduction amount as the actual benefit. (2) MISSING KEY INFORMATION: The ground truth explicitly states that 'in 2024, AMD did not receive any tax or earnings per share benefit from its Singapore operations despite the DEI incentive, due to a pre-tax loss in that jurisdiction.' The LLM completely omits this important contextual detail about Singapore operations and DEI incentives. (3) INCOMPLETE ANSWER: The LLM mentions a '2024 inter-company integration transaction' but this is not mentioned in the ground truth and appears to be an unsupported addition.

The ground truth provides specific cash outflow projections ($70M in 2024 declining to $56M in 2028, cumulative $207M for 2029-2033) which the LLM completely omits. (2) MISSING KEY DATA: The ground truth explicitly mentions the asset allocation targets (65-80% fixed income/cash, 20-35% equity) for 2022 and the projected cash outflows for 2023-2033. The LLM provides none of this information. (3) INCOMPLETE MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The question asks about evolution from 2022 to 2023 and what this indicates about long-term pension liability management. The ground truth addresses both by showing the decreasing cash outflow trend and connecting it to improved funding status. The LLM only addresses accumulated benefit obligation changes without the supporting cash flow data or asset allocation context. (4) REASONING DISCONNECT: While the LLM's conclusion about 'disciplined long-term pension-liability management' is reasonable in tone, it's not supported by the specific metrics provided in the ground truth. The LLM appears to have introduced different financial metrics (accumulated benefit obligation) rather than synthesizing the actual data points (cash outflows, asset allocation) that form the basis of the ground truth answer.

The calculated decline of ~$800 million and ~13% is accurate ($5,878M - $5,081M = $797M; $797M/$5,878M ≈ 13.5%).

MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across multiple documents (2022 and 2024 10-K filings) to establish the strategic shift. The connection between declining license revenue and Oracle's stated strategy to move customers to cloud-based subscriptions is logically sound and well-supported. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the question - the revenue evolution (with specific numbers and trend) and the strategic implications (shift toward cloud-centric, subscription-driven model). The LLM provides supporting evidence from the filings about Oracle's explicit strategy to encourage cloud migration. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The ground truth mentions 'cloud services and license support revenues' increasing from $30,174M to $39,383M as additional context, which the LLM answer does not include. However, the LLM's answer is not incomplete on this point - it focuses on the core question about licensing strategy shift, which is adequately demonstrated through the license revenue decline and stated strategic initiatives.

The LLM's phrasing of 'broader reputational damage' is somewhat interpretive and not explicitly stated in the ground truth.

By 2024, the company placed a more structured and explicit emphasis on retail e-commerce sales as part of the macroeconomic forecasts used in its consumer loss models, particularly for the revolving credit portfolio. This shift indicates a more direct integration of retail e-commerce trends into the credit risk modeling process.

The qualitative reasoning is sound and the multi-hop synthesis across the two years is accurate.\n\nHowever, there is a significant quantitative omission: The ground truth specifically mentions that 'The 2024 allowance for consumer loans receivable was $341 million,' which is a concrete, verifiable metric directly relevant to the question's focus on how the reliance evolved and its impact. The LLM answer fails to include this important financial figure, which would have strengthened the answer by providing concrete evidence of the modeling changes' materiality.\n\nAdditionally, the LLM answer mentions 'household disposable income' as being incorporated in 2024 alongside retail e-commerce sales, which is accurate but represents a slight expansion beyond what the ground truth emphasizes. The ground truth focuses more narrowly on the evolution of retail e-commerce sales specifically, though it doesn't contradict the inclusion of household disposable income.\n\nThe LLM correctly identifies: (1) the 2023 treatment as one of several factors, (2) the 2024 shift to more explicit/formal integration, (3) the specific application to the revolving credit portfolio, and (4) the use of external forecasts.

The company was in the process of acquiring VMware for approximately $61 billion, signaling a strategic intent to strengthen its infrastructure software capabilities.

By fiscal 2024, after completing the VMware merger, the segment had become a core pillar of Broadcom’s integrated infrastructure portfolio, and the company’s financial commitment jumped dramatically—evidenced by a $25.9 billion acquisition outlay (including VMware) and the full consolidation of VMware’s software assets and revenues.",

The completion date of November 22, 2023 is correctly identified. QUALITATIVE ISSUES: While the LLM correctly identifies the strategic evolution from complementary segment to core pillar and the completion of the VMware acquisition, it fails to provide the specific financial commitment figures that are central to answering 'financial commitment' aspects of the question. The LLM's characterization of the acquisition as 'responsibly-financed' with 'modest acquisition spending' in 2022 is misleading—the acquisition was announced/planned in 2022 but the massive financial commitment ($84.2 billion total) occurred upon completion in 2023. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM does attempt to synthesize the evolution across fiscal years and connect strategic positioning to financial commitment, but the execution is flawed due to incorrect numbers. The answer conflates fiscal 2022 spending with the total acquisition value.

The segment was clearly defined and aligned with how the company’s CODMs allocated resources. By fiscal 2023, while the Services Business was still acknowledged as one of the three businesses, it was mentioned more peripherally and without the same level of detailed explanation. Instead, the 2023 filing placed stronger emphasis on Oracle Cloud Services, positioning them as central to customer migration strategies and broader ecosystem engagement.

The qualitative reasoning about the shift in narrative focus is sound and aligns with the ground truth's core finding. However, there are significant quantitative accuracy issues: (1) The LLM states Services accounted for 'about 8% of total revenue' in 2022 - this specific percentage is not verified in the ground truth and appears to be an unsupported quantitative claim that could be factually incorrect. (2) The LLM provides specific page references (pp. 36-40 for 2022, pp. 5-9 for 2023) which cannot be verified against the ground truth and may be hallucinated citations.

By 2024, the impact of FDII had evolved due to a change in U.S. tax regulations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures instead of deducting them as incurred. This change increased taxable income in 2024 and 2023, which in turn increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit, indicating a growing influence of FDII on AMD's tax position despite no direct benefit amount being disclosed for 2024.",

These are completely different figures - the LLM appears to have fabricated or misread numbers that don't match the source documents. The magnitude difference ($261M vs $147M) is substantial and cannot be explained by rounding or format variation. (2) CONCEPTUAL CONFUSION: The LLM conflates 'FDII deduction' amounts with 'FDII tax benefit' impact on the income tax provision. These are related but distinct concepts - the ground truth specifically references the benefit's contribution to the tax provision, not a deduction amount. (3) PARTIAL CREDIT FOR REGULATORY CONTEXT: The LLM correctly identifies the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the R&D capitalization/amortization requirement as the regulatory change driving the evolution. This reasoning is sound and matches the ground truth explanation. (4) MISSING KEY INSIGHT: The ground truth emphasizes that while the regulatory change increased taxable income (making more income eligible for FDII), no direct FDII benefit amount was disclosed for 2024, suggesting the benefit's influence evolved but wasn't explicitly quantified. The LLM misses this nuance by providing a specific 2024 figure. (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: While the LLM attempts to connect the regulatory change to FDII impact, the incorrect numbers undermine the entire analysis.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Oracle's Free Cash Flow as a percentage of Net Income was 100%. By fiscal year 2024, this figure had increased to 113%, representing a 13 percentage point rise. This indicates a significant improvement in the company's ability to generate free cash relative to its net income over the two-year period.",

(1) CORRECTNESS: All factual information matches the ground truth perfectly - FY2023 FCF/NI ratio of 100%, FY2024 ratio of 113%, and the 13 percentage point increase are all correct. (2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: All numeric values are precise and correctly formatted. The calculation of the change (113% - 100% = 13 percentage points) is accurate. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: Oracle is correctly identified, fiscal years 2023 and 2024 are correct, and the metric (free cash flow as percentage of net income) is properly identified. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes the comparison across two fiscal years and properly calculates the magnitude of change. (5) COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses all parts of the question - the evolution (from 100% to 113%), the magnitude of change (13 percentage points), and provides appropriate context about what this indicates. The only minor distinction from the ground truth is that the LLM answer is slightly more concise and doesn't explicitly state the interpretive conclusion about 'significant improvement in the company's ability to generate free cash,' but this is a minor omission of interpretive commentary rather than factual error. The citation to source documents adds credibility. Overall, this is an excellent response with perfect numerical accuracy and sound reasoning.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Office Commercial revenue was mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, along with the shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365. By 2023, the description remained largely the same, with installed base growth still being a key driver. However, the 2023 filing added emphasis on AI and productivity categories such as communication, collaboration, analytics, security, and compliance as part of the growth strategy. This indicates that while installed base growth remained a consistent factor, its context expanded to include AI-driven capabilities.",

The ground truth explicitly states that the role of installed base growth EVOLVED between 2022 and 2023, with 2023 adding emphasis on AI and productivity categories. However, the LLM answer claims 'The wording is unchanged, indicating that installed‑base growth remains a core, unchanged driver.' This directly contradicts the ground truth's key finding about evolution in context and emphasis. While the LLM correctly identifies that both years mention installed base growth, average revenue per user expansion, and the shift from on-premises to Office 365, it fails to recognize the important evolution: the 2023 filing added new emphasis on AI-driven capabilities and productivity categories (communication, collaboration, analytics, security, compliance). The LLM's conclusion that there is 'no change' misses the essential point of the question about how the role EVOLVED. The page number citations appear reasonable but cannot be verified. The quantitative accuracy is relatively high since the LLM correctly identifies the consistent factors, but the qualitative accuracy is low because it fundamentally misinterprets the nature of change between the two years.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Cisco's Long-term RPO was $14,603 million, while in fiscal year 2024, it increased to $20,166 million. This represents a significant growth of $5,563 million over the two-year period, indicating improved future revenue visibility and stronger customer commitments extending beyond the next 12 months.",

Quantitative verification: FY2022 Long-term RPO of $14.6 billion matches the ground truth of $14,603 million (format variation acceptable); FY2024 value of $20.2 billion matches $20,166 million; the calculated increase of $5.6 billion matches the ground truth of $5,563 million (minor rounding difference of $37M is negligible and represents 0.66% variance, well within acceptable rounding); the percentage calculation of approximately 38% is accurate (5,563/14,603 = 38.07%). All entities are correctly identified (Cisco, Long-term RPO, fiscal years 2022 and 2024). The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the answer correctly synthesizes the two-year evolution and draws the appropriate conclusion about improved revenue visibility and customer commitments. The LLM adds valuable context by explaining what the larger RPO backlog signifies (greater visibility into future earnings), which directly addresses the second part of the question about what this indicates. The only minor distinction is that the ground truth uses exact figures ($14,603M and $20,166M) while the LLM rounds to billions ($14.6B and $20.2B), but this is a standard and acceptable format variation in financial reporting.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM highlighted that its hybrid cloud infrastructure was designed specifically for mission-critical and regulated workloads. By 2024, the company expanded its focus to include AI workloads, indicating a strategic shift toward supporting emerging AI-driven applications alongside traditional mission-critical systems. This reflects an evolution in IBM's infrastructure segment to align with growing market demands for AI capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "In its 2023 filing IBM stressed that its hybrid‑cloud infrastructure—on‑premises and cloud server and storage solutions—was engineered for “mission‑critical and regulated” workloads, while the 2024 filing updates that focus to “mission‑critical and AI” workloads. Thus, IBM’s market positioning stayed strong in the hybrid‑cloud space, but the workload emphasis shifted from regulated applications toward AI‑intensive use cases.",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2023 positioning focused on 'mission-critical and regulated' workloads; (2) Accurately captures the 2024 shift to 'mission-critical and AI' workloads; (3) Properly synthesizes the comparison across both years; (4) Correctly identifies this as a strategic evolution/shift in focus; (5) Appropriately characterizes the change as moving from regulated applications toward AI-intensive use cases. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: No numeric values are present in either answer, so this dimension is not applicable but receives full marks as there are no calculation or date errors. QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The reasoning is sound - the model correctly identifies that IBM maintained its focus on mission-critical workloads while expanding to include AI workloads, replacing the previous emphasis on regulated workloads. This represents accurate multi-hop synthesis across the 2023 and 2024 filings. MINOR CONSIDERATION: The LLM answer uses slightly different phrasing than the ground truth ('regulated applications toward AI-intensive use cases' vs. 'regulated workloads' and 'AI workloads'), but this is a semantic variation that conveys equivalent meaning. The LLM also adds contextual detail about 'on-premises and cloud server and storage solutions' which provides helpful specificity without contradicting the ground truth.

Quantitative verification: All four settlement asset figures are correct - $1.319 billion (2022), $1.233 billion (2023), and $1.821 billion (2024) match the ground truth exactly. The format variation ($1.319 billion vs $1,319 million) is acceptable and properly handled. The multi-hop synthesis correctly traces the evolution across three years and identifies the key pattern: decline from 2022 to 2023, followed by a significant rebound in 2024 that exceeds the 2022 baseline. The reasoning is sound - the LLM correctly interprets the data trajectory and draws a logical conclusion about financial positioning. The answer addresses both parts of the question: (1) how settlement assets evolved (specific numbers and trend), and (2) what this indicates about financial positioning (stronger liquidity position to meet settlement obligations). The interpretation that the 2024 rebound to $1.821 billion represents a 'stronger liquidity position' is reasonable and well-supported by the data showing increased settlement assets. The only minor distinction from the ground truth is that the LLM provides more interpretive analysis (\"stronger liquidity position\") while the ground truth uses more neutral language (\"evolving financial positioning\"), but this represents added value rather than inaccuracy. The citation references to specific PDF pages add credibility.

For 2023, ground truth shows fair value of $737M and unrealized gains of $93M, but LLM reports $690M and $89M (which are actually the 2024 figures). For 2024, ground truth shows fair value of $690M and unrealized gains of $89M, but LLM reports $621M and $64M (completely incorrect). All four numeric values are wrong. (2) CALCULATION/COMPARISON ERRORS: The LLM's conclusion about 'simultaneous drop in both fair value and unrealized gains' is based on false numbers. The actual trend shows fair value declining from $737M to $690M (a $47M decrease), while unrealized gains declined from $93M to $89M (a $4M decrease). The LLM's invented figures ($690M→$621M and $89M→$64M) don't match reality. (3) REASONING FLAW: While the LLM's logic about 'simultaneous drops indicating weakening market valuation' would be sound IF the numbers were correct, the entire analytical foundation is built on fabricated data. (4) ENTITY/YEAR ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies Capital One and non-agency RMBS, but completely botches the year-to-year comparison by swapping and misreporting all values. (5) SEMANTIC ISSUE: The ground truth indicates 'mixed trend' with 'slight deterioration' and 'relatively stable' gains, whereas LLM claims a clear 'downward valuation trend' - this contradicts the actual modest changes in the data.

The ground truth states that Products gross margin percentage rose from 36.3% to 37.2%, and Services from 71.7% to 73.9%. The LLM answer does NOT provide these segment-level gross margin percentages at all - instead it provides absolute dollar amounts ($114.7bn, $56.1bn, etc.) and their proportional contribution to total gross margin (67%, 33%, 61%, 39%). While the dollar amounts and composition percentages may be accurate, the answer fundamentally fails to address the specific question about 'gross margin percentage' for Products and Services segments. The question explicitly asks about 'the composition of gross margin contributions from Products and Services' which could be interpreted as either (1) the gross margin percentages of each segment or (2) the dollar/percentage contribution to total margin. The LLM interpreted it as (2), while the ground truth answers (1). This represents a significant misalignment with what the ground truth considers the correct answer. The multi-hop reasoning is sound (correctly synthesizing data across 2022 and 2024 filings), and the overall narrative about the shift toward Services is correct, but the omission of segment-level gross margin percentages is a material gap that prevents this from being a high-quality answer.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco reported total amortization of purchased intangible assets at $1,077 million. By fiscal 2024, this expense had increased, with the management commentary noting higher amortization as a key factor contributing to a 3.8 percentage point decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue. The increase in amortization expense was driven in part by the acquisition of Splunk in March 2024, which also brought in approximately $1.4 billion in revenue and contributed to higher operating expenses overall. This shows that the amortization expense not only grew in absolute terms but also had a measurable negative impact on operating margin trends.",

(2) Accurately captures the operating income margin decline from 27.1% (FY2022) to 22.6% (FY2024), representing approximately 4.5 percentage points - very close to the ground truth's 3.8 percentage point figure. (3) Properly synthesizes the Splunk acquisition as a driver of increased amortization in fiscal 2024. (4) Correctly identifies the causal relationship between higher amortization and operating margin compression. (5) Provides proper source citations. MINOR DISCREPANCY: The LLM reports a 4.5 percentage point decline (27.1% - 22.6% = 4.5%), while the ground truth states 3.8 percentage points. This 0.7 percentage point difference is notable but could reflect rounding or different calculation methodologies in the source documents. The LLM's calculation (27.1 - 22.6 = 4.5) is mathematically correct based on the percentages cited.

The ground truth states that in 2022, there was NO specific goodwill amount disclosed for the Analog segment, but in 2023, the Analog segment had $4,158 million in goodwill. This represents a significant change - from no disclosed goodwill to $4.158 billion. The LLM incorrectly claims the goodwill was $4.158 billion at BOTH year-end 2022 and year-end 2023, stating 'showing no change in the amount of goodwill recorded.' This is factually wrong. The LLM's conclusion that 'the Analog segment's financial weight...remained essentially stable' is therefore incorrect. The LLM has fundamentally misunderstood the multi-hop synthesis required: the question asks about the EVOLUTION of financial significance based on changes in goodwill, and the correct answer is that goodwill went from undisclosed/zero to $4.158 billion - a substantial increase indicating newly gained financial recognition. The LLM's citation to page 55 of the 2023 10-K may be accurate for the 2023 figure, but the claim about 2022 goodwill being the same amount is contradicted by the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "In its 2022 filing, NVIDIA said that, because of industry‑wide shortages, it shifted from the usual six‑month ordering horizon to “placing orders at least twelve months in advance” and began using “non‑cancellable inventory orders… pay premiums and/or provide deposits” to lock in capacity, exposing the company to higher financial risk if demand fell (2022 pp. 22‑26). By the 2023 filing, the company was “shortening lead times for certain components” and relying more on “prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements” and a broader supplier base, which reduces the reliance on long‑lead‑time, premium‑laden contracts but still acknowledges execution‑ and inventory‑related financial risk (2023 pp. 32‑36).",

Key issues: (1) CORE MISALIGNMENT: The ground truth explicitly states there was NO CHANGE in how the CODM evaluates the segment between FY2023 and FY2024 - the evaluation methodology remained consistent, using net revenue and operating results without discrete asset information. The LLM answer acknowledges the methodology stayed the same but then pivots to discussing how the 'weight' of the segment shifted due to VMware acquisition, which is not what the question asks. The question asks about evolution in the ORGANIZATIONAL APPROACH to managing the segment, not about the relative size/importance of the segment. (2) QUANTITATIVE ISSUES: While the LLM provides specific revenue and operating income figures ($7.6B/$5.6B for FY2023 and $21.5B/$13.98B for FY2024), these numbers cannot be verified against the ground truth provided, and more critically, citing these numbers to argue for a shift in 'weight' and 'resource allocation' misses the point - the ground truth indicates the CODM's evaluation APPROACH did not change. (3) LOGICAL FLAW: The LLM conflates two different concepts: (a) the methodology used to evaluate segments (which remained constant), and (b) the relative importance/size of segments post-acquisition (which changed). The question specifically asks about the former, not the latter. (4) MISSING KEY POINT: The ground truth emphasizes that despite the VMware acquisition, there was NO CHANGE in the organizational framework - the segment continued to be evaluated without discrete asset information. The LLM's answer about resource allocation shifts, while potentially true, does not address the actual question about organizational approach evolution. (5) SEMANTIC ACCURACY: The LLM does correctly identify that the CODM uses net revenue and operating results, but this correct statement is embedded in an answer that fundamentally misinterprets what changed (or didn't change) between the two years.",

By 2024, this figure had increased to $20,166 million, representing a growth of $5,563 million over two years. This indicates a significant improvement in the company's future revenue visibility, as Long-term RPO reflects contracted revenue that will be recognized beyond the next 12 months.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco’s long‑term contract backlog grew from about **$14.6 billion in FY 2022** to roughly **$20.2 billion in FY 2024** (an increase of ~ $5.6 billion)【2022 10‑K – Long‑term RPO $14,603 m】【2024 10‑K – Long‑term RPO $20,166 m】. This rise shows that a larger share of Cisco’s revenue is tied up in contracts extending beyond the next 12 months, giving the company greater visibility of future earnings even though more revenue is now deferred further out【2024 10‑K – “We expect approximately 51% of total remaining performance obligations to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months.”】.",

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All numbers are correct - FY 2022 Long-term RPO of $14,603 million ($14.6B), FY 2024 Long-term RPO of $20,166 million ($20.2B), and the calculated increase of approximately $5.6 billion ($5,563 million). Number format variations are appropriately handled (millions to billions conversion is accurate). COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (1) the evolution of Long-term RPO from 2022 to 2024, and (2) what this indicates about future revenue visibility. ENTITY ACCURACY: Cisco is correctly identified, fiscal years are accurate (FY 2022 and FY 2024), and the metric (Long-term RPO/remaining performance obligations) is correctly identified and explained. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across multiple 10-K filings (2022 and 2024) and correctly interprets the meaning of the RPO metric. The interpretation that increased Long-term RPO indicates improved future revenue visibility is sound and well-reasoned. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT: The LLM appropriately adds the 51% metric from the 2024 10-K regarding revenue recognition timing, which provides valuable context about revenue deferral patterns. This demonstrates thorough document analysis. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The phrase 'more revenue is now deferred further out' is a reasonable interpretation but slightly more speculative than the ground truth's straightforward statement. However, this represents a nuanced analytical addition rather than an error. The answer is well-sourced with specific citations to the relevant 10-K filings.",

Because about half of the total RPO is expected to be recognized within the next 12 months (≈54 % in FY 2022 and 51 % in FY 2024), the larger short‑term RPO pool signals stronger near‑term revenue visibility for Cisco.",

The LLM correctly synthesized multi-hop information across two 10-K filings (2022 and 2024) and properly cited sources. The reasoning about near-term revenue visibility is sound and well-supported. The additional context provided about the proportion of total RPO expected to be recognized within 12 months (54% in FY2022, 51% in FY2024) adds valuable insight beyond the ground truth answer, demonstrating deeper analysis without introducing errors. The semantic equivalence is excellent - 'short-term remaining performance obligations' is the correct technical term for Short-term RPO.

      "original_answer": "The potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations remained qualitatively similar in both years, with no explicit quantitative changes provided. In 2023, IBM noted that premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. In 2024, the same phrasing was used, indicating that the risk factor remained consistent and no material changes were made to how IBM assessed or disclosed this risk. Therefore, while the risk remains present and is described in identical terms, there is no evidence of a change in magnitude or impact between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 Annual Report IBM warned that premiums for mandatory pension‑insolvency insurance outside the United States could rise sharply—driven by high insolvency levels in those markets—and that such increases could negatively affect its results of operations.

The LLM accurately captures the core finding that the risk remained consistent between 2023 and 2024. (2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: No specific dollar amounts or percentages were provided in either the ground truth or the question, so this dimension is not applicable.

(3) QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM demonstrates sound multi-hop reasoning by synthesizing information across two annual reports and correctly identifying the parallel language used in both years. The characterization of the risk as 'unchanged' and 'material' aligns with the ground truth's conclusion that the risk 'remained consistent.' (4) ENTITY ACCURACY: IBM is correctly identified, the years 2023 and 2024 are correct, and the specific risk (pension insolvency insurance premiums) is accurately described. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's phrasing ('repeats the same warning in essentially identical language') conveys the same meaning as the ground truth's statement that 'the same phrasing was used.'

The LLM's $14.8B figure is incorrect. (2) GROWTH RATE: The LLM claims ~7% YoY growth, but the ground truth explicitly states 9% growth. This is a significant discrepancy - the LLM underestimated the growth rate by 2 percentage points. (3) CALCULATION VERIFICATION: If FY2022 was $13.816B and growth was 7%, that would yield ~$14.78B, which roughly matches the LLM's stated $14.8B.

The company increased its additions to the allowance in 2023 ($201 million) compared to 2022 ($162 million), but also experienced higher write-offs in 2023 ($183 million) versus 2022 ($148 million), reflecting a proportional response to inventory risk.",

This is a $2 million discrepancy on a key baseline figure. The LLM correctly identifies the 2023 balance as $658 million and calculates the net increase as $27 million, which is approximately correct given their starting point ($658M - $631M = $27M), but this is built on an incorrect 2022 figure. The ground truth shows the correct increase should be $25 million ($658M - $633M = $25M).

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was described as being driven by demand for volume licensing, Software Assurance, and advanced security offerings such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on the number of information workers in enterprises rather than PC sales. By 2023, the revenue categorization expanded to include 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services,' explicitly listing Windows cloud services as a component alongside volume licensing. The inclusion of 'cloud services' in the 2023 breakdown indicates a strategic shift toward integrating cloud-based offerings into the Windows Commercial portfolio. This evolution suggests that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, as part of the broader cloud services, became more embedded within a diversified set of commercial offerings, aligning with the company's emphasis on cloud transformation and subscription-based models. The 2023 filing also introduced a formalized growth metric for this revenue segment, signaling a more structured approach to tracking and expanding this part of the business.",

This is a fundamental factual error that misses the entire point of the question - which asks about the EVOLUTION of the plan between these two years.

The ground truth shows a clear declining trend: $633M (2022) → $577M (2024), representing a $56 million reduction or approximately 8.9% decrease. This is a material change, not a flat trend. (3) INTERPRETATION ERROR: The LLM concludes the flat trend indicates 'stable' risk assessment and 'consistent' provisioning strategy. However, the actual declining trend suggests improved inventory management or adjusted provisioning strategy, as stated in the ground truth. The LLM's interpretation is based on incorrect data and reaches the opposite conclusion. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year comparison required by the question. It did not properly track the evolution from 2022 to 2024. (5) ENTITY ACCURACY: While IBM is correctly identified, the financial metric values are drastically wrong. The answer demonstrates a fundamental failure to accurately retrieve or report the correct financial data from the source documents.",

By fiscal 2024, the year-over-year growth rate had slowed to 18%, with revenue increasing from $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023 to $3.18 billion in fiscal 2024.

(2) FY2024 growth rate of 18% is correct, with revenue of $3.18 billion matching ground truth. (3) The LLM correctly identifies the prior year baseline for FY2024 ($2.70 billion in FY2023), which is consistent with the 18% growth calculation ($2.70B × 1.18 = $3.186B ≈ $3.18B). (4) Segment share calculations are accurate: FY2021 share of 17% ($1.97B/$11.52B = 17.1%) and FY2024 share of 20% ($3.18B/$15.86B = 20.0%) are both correct. (5) The LLM goes beyond the ground truth by providing additional context about Document Cloud's increasing share of Digital Media segment revenue, which strengthens the answer. The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer synthesizes growth rate trends across fiscal years, calculates segment contribution percentages, and draws a logical conclusion about maturation and importance.

These numbers appear accurate and properly formatted. The multi-hop synthesis is sound—the answer connects the geographic revenue shift with the Compute & Networking segment driver and links this to customer concentration changes. However, the answer has a notable omission: it does not address the international revenue proportion mentioned in the ground truth (69% of revenue from outside U.S. in FY2023). The ground truth explicitly states this geographic mix detail as part of how the segment's contribution evolved. The LLM answer focuses heavily on U.S. revenue growth but doesn't provide the complementary international revenue context that would fully answer how the geographic mix evolved. The statement about the 13% customer concentration is slightly imprecise—the ground truth indicates this customer is Compute & Networking-related, but the LLM doesn't explicitly confirm this connection, though it's implied.

By 2023, Schwab continued to update Estimated Current LTV ratios monthly using the same methodology, but expanded its disclosure to include detailed credit quality indicators that incorporated this metric, indicating a more comprehensive integration into credit reporting processes.

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies that monthly update frequency remained constant across both years; (2) Accurately notes the use of home price appreciation index methodology in both periods; (3) Properly identifies that the metric was used as a credit quality component in both years; (4) Correctly observes the expansion to include more granular LTV bands (>90%-≤100% and >100%) in 2023; (5) Accurately characterizes the evolution as moving toward more detailed integration into credit quality disclosure. MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM answer emphasizes the granular LTV band expansion and larger total amounts in 2023, which is a valid observation but slightly shifts focus from the broader 'transformation' narrative in the ground truth; (2) The ground truth emphasizes a shift from 'monitored metric to disclosed and detailed credit quality component,' while the LLM answer frames it more as 'same metric presented with more granular detail' - these are subtly different framings, though both are defensible interpretations of the evolution; (3) The LLM answer could have been slightly more explicit about the expansion of disclosure scope, though it does mention 'more granular integration.' MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes information across two years and identifies the continuity (monthly updates, same methodology) versus change (expanded disclosure, more granular bands). The reasoning is sound and logically structured.

The answer successfully addresses all parts of the multi-part question: (1) the evolution of the segment's contribution (both in absolute and relative terms), (2) the specific dollar amounts for each year, and (3) the quantitative changes between periods.

However, there is a significant factual error: the LLM introduces geographic revenue data (international sales declining from 69% to 56%) that is NOT present in the original ground truth answer. This geographic information appears to be either fabricated or sourced from outside the provided knowledge graph, which is a material error in a financial analysis context. The LLM correctly synthesizes the multi-hop information about customer concentration across the two fiscal years and properly identifies this as indicating 'greater customer concentration' and 'pronounced dependency.' The reasoning about the shift toward a 'more U.S.-focused customer base' is logical IF the geographic data were accurate, but since it cannot be verified against the ground truth, it represents an unsupported claim. The answer demonstrates good understanding of the core question but fails the strict standard required for financial accuracy by introducing unverified data.

In contrast, CCG revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 to $54.2 billion due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in the second half of the year.

(2) The year-over-year comparisons are properly synthesized across the two 10-K filings. (3) The factors contributing to performance changes are comprehensively identified: notebook/desktop volume declines, lower ASPs from product mix shift, inventory normalization, and partial offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial/gaming segments. (4) The answer correctly captures the temporal evolution showing 2022 strength followed by 2023 weakness with some H2 recovery.

The ground truth explicitly provides these numbers. (2) The phrase 'inventory normalization' appears in the LLM answer but is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth, though it is a reasonable inference from the context of demand reduction. (3) The LLM answer slightly condenses the explanation of 2022 drivers (mentions 'modest' rise but doesn't explicitly note 'strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand').

The characterization of this as 'roughly $2.0 billion' is an appropriate simplification. The reference to the $4.0 billion authorized program is contextually relevant and accurate. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses the core question about how the repurchase capacity evolved (remained unchanged) and what this indicates (unused capacity, stable but unutilized funds). MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM correctly synthesized information across two separate 10-K filings (2022 and 2024) to compare the values at different time periods. The logic is sound - same dollar amount at both endpoints indicates no utilization over the period. ENTITY ACCURACY: IBM is correctly identified, fiscal years are correct (2021 end/2022 filing and 2024 end/2024 filing), and the metric (approximate dollar value of shares available for repurchase) is accurately described. MINOR DIFFERENCES FROM GROUND TRUTH: The LLM provides slightly more context by mentioning the $4 billion authorization and calculating that $2 billion represents roughly half of it. While the ground truth focuses on the unchanged amount indicating 'unused repurchase capacity,' the LLM frames it as 'maintained roughly half of its original authorization' - both interpretations are semantically equivalent and correct.

      "question": "How has the impact of gross margin compression on MetLife's universal life insurance products evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what specific risk management actions were taken?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, MetLife experienced gross margin compression on its universal life insurance products due to interest rate sensitivity, and managed the risk through product design features and asset/liability management (ALM) strategies, including interest rate derivatives. However, lowering crediting rates could be partially offset by increased liabilities for policies with secondary guarantees. By 2024, MetLife significantly reduced its interest rate risk exposure for universal life products as a result of an external reinsurance transaction that closed in November 2023, leaving minimal exposure from this block. This represents a major reduction in the risk profile of these products year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing MetLife said that gross‑margin compression on its universal‑life policies was a concern, but it was mitigated by using product‑design features, asset‑liability‑management (ALM) strategies and interest‑rate derivatives, and by lowering crediting rates on some in‑force policies (although secondary‑guarantee liabilities limited the benefit) 【MET_10k_2023.pdf p.52】. By the 2024 filing the company reported that an external re‑insurance transaction that closed in November 2023 had substantially reduced its interest‑rate risk on the universal‑life block—leaving only minimal exposure—while it continued to employ derivatives and credit‑rate adjustments as part of its risk‑management toolkit 【MET_10k_2024.pdf p.52】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer demonstrates excellent accuracy and completeness in addressing the multi-hop question about MetLife's universal life insurance margin compression and risk management evolution. STRENGTHS: (1) All key facts are correct - the 2023 mitigation strategies (product design, ALM, derivatives, crediting rate adjustments) are accurately identified; (2) The critical date of November 2023 for the reinsurance transaction closure is correct; (3) The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the answer properly contrasts 2023 conditions with 2024 outcomes, showing the evolution from active management strategies to substantially reduced exposure; (4) The secondary guarantee liability constraint is correctly noted as limiting the benefit of crediting rate reductions; (5) The characterization of the reinsurance transaction's impact as 'substantially reduced' and 'minimal exposure' aligns with the ground truth's 'significantly reduced' and 'minimal exposure' language; (6) All entities are correctly identified (MetLife, universal life products, interest rate risk). MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The answer includes a note about 'continued' use of derivatives and credit-rate adjustments in 2024, which is a reasonable inference but not explicitly stated in the ground truth - however, this is a minor elaboration that doesn't contradict the source material; (2) The citation format with page numbers adds credibility and specificity. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: No specific dollar amounts or percentages were provided in either answer, so quantitative accuracy focuses on dates and temporal relationships - the November 2023 date is correct. The answer successfully synthesizes information across two fiscal years and multiple risk management dimensions as required by the multi-hop question structure.",

      "question": "How did the role of the CCB segment in JPMorgan's derivative risk management activities evolve between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the CCB segment was primarily involved in mortgage-related revenue generation through Home Lending production and net mortgage servicing revenue, with no mention of its involvement in derivative risk management. By 2024, the CCB segment was explicitly listed as being responsible for managing risk associated with mortgage commitments, warehouse loans, and mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) through specified risk management strategies involving derivatives. This marks a clear shift from a purely revenue-generating role to one that includes active risk management using financial instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 10‑K the Firm’s Consumer & Community Banking (CCB) unit was called out explicitly – it used interest‑rate derivatives to hedge the interest‑rate risk of its mortgage‑commitments, warehouse‑loan and mortgage‑servicing‑right portfolios (see the “primary uses of derivatives” table, page 221 of JPM_10k_2023.pdf). By the 2024 filing, the derivative‑risk‑management discussion (pages 211‑215 of JPM_10k_2024.pdf) presents only aggregate notional‑amount and balance‑sheet tables and does not single out CCB for any specific risk‑management derivative activity, indicating that CCB’s distinct role in derivative risk management was de‑emphasized or folded into the broader corporate risk‑management framework.",

The ground truth states that in 2023, CCB had NO mention of derivative risk management involvement, and by 2024, it was explicitly listed as responsible for managing derivative-related risks. However, the LLM answer claims the opposite: that in 2023 the CCB was 'called out explicitly' for using interest-rate derivatives to hedge mortgage-related portfolios, and by 2024 this role was 'de-emphasized or folded into the broader corporate risk-management framework.' This is a complete reversal of the actual evolution described in the ground truth. The LLM also cites specific page numbers (221 for 2023, 211-215 for 2024) and references a 'primary uses of derivatives' table, but these citations appear to be fabricated or misinterpreted, as they contradict the documented ground truth about CCB's role evolution. The LLM's conclusion that CCB's derivative risk management role was de-emphasized in 2024 is the opposite of what actually occurred. The answer demonstrates poor multi-hop reasoning by failing to correctly synthesize the temporal evolution of CCB's responsibilities across the two filing years. While the answer is well-structured and uses appropriate financial terminology, the core factual content is inverted from reality, making this response fundamentally incorrect.",

      "question": "How did the role of card conversion volumes in estimating rebates and incentives evolve between 2023 and 2024, given the changes in net revenue and audit considerations?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, card conversion volumes were considered as part of the estimation factors for rebates and incentives, which contributed to $25.1 billion in total net revenue. By 2024, the net revenue increased to $28.2 billion, and card conversion volumes became a more integral component, indicating a shift from being a general consideration to a dependency in the estimation process. This reflects a growing strategic and financial reliance on card conversion volumes in managing customer agreements and forecasting rebates.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2023 filing, Mastercard said that card‑conversion volumes were one of the key inputs used to estimate variable rebates and incentives that were embedded in its $25.1 billion net‑revenue base, and the auditors highlighted the estimation of those rebates as a critical audit matter. In the 2024 filing, after net revenue grew to $28.2 billion, card‑conversion volumes remained a primary driver of the rebate‑and‑incentive estimates, and the auditors again treated the same estimation process as a critical audit matter, reflecting the larger, more material impact of those rebates.",

The quantitative data is precise and properly formatted. The multi-hop synthesis is sound, correctly connecting card conversion volumes, rebate estimation, net revenue changes, and audit considerations across both years. The answer accurately identifies that card conversion volumes were a key input in 2023 and remained a primary driver in 2024, with both years flagged as critical audit matters. However, there is a subtle but meaningful difference in characterization: the original answer emphasizes an 'evolution' or 'shift' from 'general consideration to a dependency,' suggesting a qualitative change in the role of card conversion volumes. The LLM answer states they 'remained a primary driver,' which is more conservative and doesn't fully capture the evolutionary aspect implied in the ground truth. The LLM does add valuable context about auditor treatment and materiality impact, which enhances the answer but wasn't explicitly in the original. The reasoning about growing strategic and financial reliance is present but less explicitly stated in the LLM response. All factual elements are correct, the synthesis across years is accurate, and the audit consideration is properly integrated. The minor gap is in fully articulating the nature of the evolution/change in the role rather than just continuity.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Technology Services Revenue was primarily earned through investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management, and digital distribution tools, with fees generally based on the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue from software licenses was recognized upon granting access rights. By 2024, BlackRock disclosed future revenue expectations tied to unsatisfied performance obligations under Technology Services, indicating a shift toward more structured, forward-looking revenue recognition based on contractual commitments. This evolution reflects a strategic emphasis on long-term service delivery and improved revenue visibility.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024 BlackRock’s technology‑services revenue rose to $1.603 billion from $1.485 billion in 2023, still coming mainly from fees for Aladdin‑platform usage, risk‑management and wealth‑management tools that are recorded as services are performed (or on a fixed‑rate basis) and from software‑license sales recognized when access rights are granted. The 2024 filing adds that a larger share of the business now comes from upfront payments and fixed‑minimum‑fee contracts—about $1.2 billion of annual minimum fees are expected in 2025—and that the remaining performance‑obligation balance fell to $319 million (vs. $334 million at year‑end 2023), with $131 million slated for 2025, $73 million for 2026 and the rest thereafter.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer provides substantial factual accuracy with strong quantitative detail. STRENGTHS: (1) Revenue figures are correct ($1.603B in 2024 vs $1.485B in 2023), demonstrating accurate multi-hop synthesis across years. (2) Specific performance obligation metrics are accurate ($319M remaining balance, $131M for 2025, $73M for 2026). (3) The answer correctly identifies the shift toward upfront payments and fixed-minimum-fee contracts (~$1.2B expected in 2025). (4) Service delivery mechanisms are correctly described (Aladdin platform fees, risk/wealth management, software licenses recognized upon access grant). (5) The answer demonstrates proper multi-hop reasoning by synthesizing 2023 and 2024 data to show evolution. MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) The original answer emphasizes a strategic shift toward 'more structured, forward-looking revenue recognition based on contractual commitments' and 'improved revenue visibility'—the LLM answer provides the specific metrics supporting this but doesn't explicitly frame it as a strategic shift or discuss the conceptual evolution as clearly. (2) The original answer notes that 2024 disclosure of unsatisfied performance obligations represents a shift in disclosure practice itself, which the LLM answer doesn't explicitly highlight. (3) The LLM answer is more transaction-focused (specific numbers) while the original emphasizes the strategic/conceptual evolution. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All dollar amounts, years, and calculations check out correctly. The performance obligation breakdown ($131M + $73M + remainder) is logically consistent. The answer successfully addresses both composition (service types) and recognition (timing and basis) aspects of the question, though with more emphasis on quantitative detail than strategic framing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel reported a 'Total Interest and Other, Net' of $1,166 million, driven largely by a strong 'Other, net' value of $1,073 million. By 2024, this figure had significantly declined to $226 million, with 'Other, net' dropping to just $15 million. This represents a major reduction in the net gains or other financial benefits contributing to this line item over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel’s “Total interest and other, net” fell sharply from **$1,166 million in 2022** to **$226 million in 2024** (a $940 million decline)【INTC_10k_2024.pdf p.78】. The drop was driven primarily by the collapse of the “Other, net” line, which fell from a **$1,073 million positive** in 2022 (largely a $1.0 billion gain from the NAND‑memory divestiture) to **$15 million** in 2024 (including a $755 million derivative loss)【INTC_10k_2024.pdf p.78】, while interest income rose (from $589 million to $1,245 million) and interest expense more than doubled (from $(496) million to $(1,034) million), partially offsetting the decline.",

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All key numbers are correct - Total Interest and Other, Net: $1,166M (2022) and $226M (2024) match ground truth exactly; the $940M decline calculation is accurate; Other, net: $1,073M (2022) and $15M (2024) match ground truth. The LLM provides additional component details (interest income rising from $589M to $1,245M, interest expense doubling from $496M to $1,034M) that are not contradicted by the ground truth and add valuable context. The mention of the $1.0B NAND-memory divestiture gain in 2022 and $755M derivative loss in 2024 provides specific explanations for the 'Other, net' changes. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes the evolution across the 2022-2024 period, identifying both the primary driver (Other, net collapse) and secondary factors (interest income/expense changes). The logic is sound - explaining how the decline in Other, net was partially offset by interest income gains but overwhelmed by interest expense increases. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses all aspects of the question - the overall evolution, specific component changes, and what drove the shift. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The ground truth answer is more concise and focuses on the main components (Total Interest and Other, Net and Other, net), while the LLM provides additional granular detail on interest income and expense.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, BNY had previously restructured its business segments in Q4 2021, separating Investment Services into Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services, while keeping Investment and Wealth Management unchanged. At that time, the company reported $2.4 trillion in assets under management. By 2024, BNY had stabilized its segmentation approach, maintaining three principal segments including Investment and Wealth Management, and reported $2.0 trillion in assets under management. This indicates a strategic consolidation rather than expansion, with a slight decrease in assets under management despite overall growth in assets under custody and administration.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022 BNY Mellon still reported two main segments—Investment Services (which was split in Q4 2021 into Securities Services and Market & Wealth Services) and an unchanged Investment & Wealth Management segment—while the firm held about $46.7 trillion in assets under custody/administration and $2.4 trillion in assets under management (AUM) as of Dec 31 2021. By 2024 the company formally reorganized into three principal segments—Securities Services, Market & Wealth Services and Investment & Wealth Management—so the Investment & Wealth Management unit now sits alongside a distinct Market & Wealth Services segment, sharpening its focus on investment‑management and wealth‑service offerings; at the same time total custody assets grew to $52.1 trillion and AUM fell to $2.0 trillion at Dec 31 2024.",

MINOR ISSUES: (1) The LLM answer includes specific custody asset figures ($46.7T and $52.1T) that are not mentioned in the ground truth, though these appear factually accurate based on typical BNY reporting; (2) The phrasing 'still reported two main segments' in 2022 is slightly ambiguous—the ground truth indicates the restructuring occurred in Q4 2021, so by 2022 the three-segment structure was already in place, though the LLM clarifies this by noting the split happened in Q4 2021; (3) The ground truth emphasizes 'strategic consolidation rather than expansion' which the LLM answer doesn't explicitly state, though it does note the AUM decrease.

By 2023, the company increased its focus on capital expenditures, allocating over $15 billion during the 10-year period from 2014 to 2023, explicitly stating that these investments were intended to support future revenue growth, which would become a greater component of free cash flow per share growth going forward.

The LLM fundamentally misrepresents the comparison by suggesting evolution/change when ground truth explicitly states no evolution occurred. The quantitative accuracy is relatively high (dates/years are correct), but the qualitative reasoning is severely flawed - the model failed to recognize that the ground truth's key finding is the LACK of change and LACK of specific percentages in both years.

All quantitative data is correct: 2022 GDV growth of 21% on local currency basis, 2024 GDV growth of 11% year-over-year, and the calculated 10 percentage point decline between the two years. The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the model correctly synthesized information from two different annual filings (2022 and 2024) and performed the appropriate calculation (21% - 11% = 10 percentage points). Entity identification is accurate (Gross Dollar Volume, local currency basis, year-over-year comparisons). The answer directly addresses all parts of the question: (1) how the growth rate evolved (from 21% to 11%), (2) the magnitude of change (10 percentage points). The semantic meaning matches the ground truth perfectly. The citation format with document references adds credibility. Minor note: The LLM uses slightly different phrasing ('slowed by about 10 percentage points' vs 'represents a 10 percentage point decline') but this is semantically equivalent and actually more concise. No calculation errors, no missing data, and the contextual interpretation of 'moderate slowdown' is appropriately conveyed through the numerical facts presented.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Switched Transactions were reported with a specific growth metric of 25%, indicating a clear quantitative emphasis on transaction volume growth through Mastercard's network. In 2023, the filing no longer provided a specific growth percentage but instead focused on refining the definition and methodology of measuring Switched Transactions, including normalization for switching and carryover days, and noting the impact of data exclusions from sanctioned Russian banks starting in Q1 2022. This shift indicates a move from purely reporting growth to enhancing transparency around measurement practices.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K Mastercard introduced “Switched Transactions” as a key metric, defining it as “the number of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period” and reporting a 12 % year‑over‑year increase (21 % when adjusted to exclude Russian‑bank activity) with a footnote that data from sanctioned Russian banks was omitted beginning Q1 2022【2022】. The 2023 filing kept the same definition but expanded the context – noting that transaction‑processing assessments are “primarily driven by the number of switched transactions” and tying the metric to payment‑network revenue growth – and updated the growth to 14 % (16 % adjusted for Russia)【2023】.",

(1) GROWTH METRICS - Ground truth states 2022 reported 25% growth, but LLM claims 12% (21% adjusted). This is a fundamental factual error on the primary quantitative metric. The 2023 figure of 14% (16% adjusted) is also not mentioned in ground truth. (2) MEASUREMENT EVOLUTION - Ground truth emphasizes a SHIFT from reporting growth metrics to focusing on measurement methodology and transparency. The LLM answer misses this critical evolution, instead suggesting both years reported growth percentages and that 2023 merely 'expanded context.' This fundamentally mischaracterizes the disclosure evolution. (3) DEFINITION CHANGES - Ground truth highlights that 2023 refined the definition and methodology including 'normalization for switching and carryover days.' The LLM answer states the definition remained 'the same' in both years, which contradicts the ground truth's emphasis on methodological refinement. (4) RUSSIAN SANCTIONS CONTEXT - While LLM correctly notes the Q1 2022 Russian bank data exclusion, it frames this as a 2022 footnote rather than emphasizing how 2023 enhanced transparency around this impact as part of the measurement methodology shift. (5) SEMANTIC MISALIGNMENT - The ground truth's core insight is a transition from 'purely reporting growth to enhancing transparency around measurement practices.' The LLM answer presents both years as growth-reporting focused with 2023 adding context, missing the fundamental shift in disclosure philosophy.

However, in the 2023 filing, GDV was elevated to a more prominent position as a defined and discussed key metric, with a detailed explanation of its components (purchase volume and cash volume), how it is calculated, and its role in strategic decision-making.

However, the LLM claims the wording is 'unchanged' between 2023 and 2024, and even quotes language including 'shift in client buying patterns' as if it appeared in both years identically. This is a fundamental misreading of the evolution described in the ground truth. The LLM's conclusion that 'IBM's exposure to client-spending-budget fluctuations has remained essentially the same from 2023 to 2024, with no new language' directly contradicts the ground truth's finding of a meaningful evolution in how the risk is characterized.

The LLM failed to identify the key distinction: while the core risk remained, the 2024 filing added explicit mention of 'shift in client buying patterns' as a new nuance not present in 2023.

The LLM correctly identifies the percentage increase context (77.6% implied by the numbers, though not explicitly stated in the LLM answer). The answer goes beyond the ground truth by providing additional granular detail - breaking down the amortization into cost-of-sales ($649M to $955M) and operating-expenses ($282M to $698M) components. These component figures are verifiable as they sum correctly to the totals ($649M + $282M = $931M for 2023; $955M + $698M = $1,653M for 2024). The multi-hop reasoning is sound, synthesizing information across fiscal years and identifying the evolution of the metric. The only minor difference from the ground truth is that the LLM does not explicitly state the 77.6% percentage increase, though this is a minor omission since the absolute numbers are provided. The inclusion of component-level detail actually enhances the answer's value without introducing any inaccuracies.

(3) MISSING KEY INFORMATION: The LLM completely omits the ground truth's discussion of the conservative investment strategy (65%-80% fixed income allocation) and the multi-year projection trend showing declining obligations from $80M to $54M. (4) REASONING QUALITY: While the LLM's logic about improving funded status is reasonable, it's based on incorrect numbers and metrics. The ground truth's reasoning about strategic liability reduction through hedging and conservative asset allocation is more sophisticated and specific. (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The ground truth successfully synthesizes investment strategy (asset allocation) with liability trends (projected payments) to draw conclusions about liability management. The LLM fails to synthesize these elements and instead presents unverified financial data. The answer demonstrates a fundamental misalignment with the source material.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BNY Mellon cited ESG concerns—specifically climate change—as a risk that could affect client activity levels. By 2024, the company broadened its risk language to include 'sustainability concerns, including a focus on climate change and diversity.' This evolution indicates that BNY Mellon likely expanded its client engagement strategy to incorporate diversity-related initiatives as a material factor influencing client behavior and expectations. The addition of diversity as a risk factor suggests a strategic shift in how the firm anticipates client priorities evolving, requiring more comprehensive ESG integration across products and services to retain and attract clients.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 filing adds “diversity” to the sustainability‑risk factor that previously mentioned only climate change (2023) – “sustainability concerns, including a focus on climate change and diversity…” versus “sustainability concerns, including climate change…”【BK_10k_2023.pdf, pages 3‑7】【BK_10k_2024.pdf, pages 3‑7】. By expanding the ESG focus to include diversity, BNY Mellon is likely broadening its client‑engagement agenda, weaving diversity metrics and solutions into advisory conversations and product offerings and positioning itself as a partner that can help clients address both climate and diversity expectations, a step beyond the climate‑only emphasis of 2023.",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the specific textual evolution from 2023 to 2024 - the addition of 'diversity' alongside climate change in BNY Mellon's risk disclosures. (2) Accurately cites the relevant document sources and page numbers (BK_10k_2023.pdf and BK_10k_2024.pdf, pages 3-7). (3) Provides precise quotations showing the exact language change: '2023 version' vs '2024 version' with diversity explicitly added. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound - correctly synthesizes that the textual expansion indicates a strategic shift in client engagement priorities. (5) Extends the analysis appropriately by explaining practical implications: 'weaving diversity metrics and solutions into advisory conversations and product offerings' and positioning as a partner addressing both climate and diversity. (6) Maintains semantic equivalence with ground truth while using slightly different phrasing ('broadening its client-engagement agenda' vs 'expanded its client engagement strategy'). MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM answer is slightly more specific and actionable in its implications (mentioning 'advisory conversations,' 'product offerings,' 'diversity metrics and solutions') compared to the ground truth's more general statement about 'comprehensive ESG integration.' This additional specificity is appropriate and enhances rather than detracts from the answer. No quantitative errors, no entity misidentifications, and the reasoning chain is logically sound.

In 2024, the growth rate slowed to 6%, with the volume reaching $2,990 billion from $2,826 billion the previous year.

The 6% growth rate for 2024 is accurate, as is the 8% growth rate for 2023 (verified: ($2,826B - $2,622B)/$2,622B = 8.0% and ($2,990B - $2,826B)/$2,826B = 5.8% ≈ 6%). COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question - the evolution of growth rates from 2023 to 2024, and what this indicates about Visa's performance. ENTITY ACCURACY: Correctly identifies Visa, U.S. Consumer Debit Volume, and the relevant fiscal years (2023-2024). REASONING: The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the model correctly compared growth rates across two years and drew the logical conclusion that growth has moderated while remaining positive. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The phrasing 'solid but slightly slower performance' effectively conveys the same meaning as 'pace of growth decelerated' from the ground truth. The answer includes appropriate source citations. Minor deduction (1 point) only because the ground truth explicitly states the prior year volumes ($2,622B for 2022), which the LLM answer references but doesn't explicitly state, though this is a very minor omission that doesn't affect the core answer quality.",

By 2023, GDV was still disclosed but only appeared in a chart format without a direct explanation of its impact on revenue.

By contrast, the 2023 filing places GDV front‑and‑center: the performance highlights list “Gross dollar volume (growth on a local‑currency basis) $9.0 T up 12 %,” and a detailed chart breaks out GDV by program with absolute values and growth rates, making GDV a headline operating metric directly tied to the company’s financial results.",

The LLM incorrectly characterizes 2022 as 'supporting volume metric' appearing 'only' in COVID tables, downplaying its prominence. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the temporal change - it inverted the narrative entirely, claiming increased prominence in 2023 when the ground truth shows decreased prominence and explanation.

The LLM claims FY2024 was $12 million gain, but ground truth shows $(583) million loss. These are not minor rounding differences; they represent completely wrong numbers. (2) DIRECTIONAL ERROR: The LLM describes a swing from negative to positive (loss to gain), but the ground truth shows both years were negative, with only a marginal improvement from $(595)M to $(583)M. The LLM's characterization of 'modest positive' in FY2024 is factually incorrect.

The conclusion that 'exposure to pension-related financial swings was markedly reduced in 2024' is based on false premises. (4) SEMANTIC MISALIGNMENT: The ground truth indicates a 'marginal decrease' in adverse impact (from $595M to $583M loss), while the LLM describes a 'marked reduction' based on a false swing to profitability.

This was driven by declines in annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by higher premiums in Korea. In contrast, for 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $212 million, or 3%, compared to 2023, but net of foreign currency fluctuations, there was an increase of $149 million, or 2%, driven by growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products.

If 2023 reported revenue was $6,969 million and constant-currency revenue increased by $149 million, the constant-currency 2024 figure would be $7,118 million, NOT $6,757 million.

The directional shift in FX impact is correctly noted (from modest drag to significant headwind), but the magnitude is wrong.

(2) DIRECTIONAL CONTRADICTION: The LLM's interpretation directly contradicts the ground truth.

(3) INCOMPLETE SYNTHESIS: The ground truth emphasizes that 2024 GDV discussion shifted to 'descriptive reporting...without directly linking GDV to revenue performance.'

(4) PARTIAL ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies that 2022 showed GDV as a growth driver (21% increase linked to 22% revenue rise) and that 2024 showed segmentation by program type.

The time periods are accurately specified (10-year spans). The comparison showing an increase from $15B to $20B is mathematically sound. (2) COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses the core question about capital expenditure allocation evolution from 2023 to 2024, showing both the baseline and the change. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: The company is correctly identified as TXN (Texas Instruments) with proper filing references. The fiscal years and time periods are correctly matched to their respective filings. (4) REASONING: The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the model correctly extracted data from two different filings (2023 and 2024) and compared them to show the evolution. The connection to free cash flow per share growth is properly maintained throughout. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM answer uses nearly identical language to the ground truth, including the phrase 'just over $15 billion' and 'about $20 billion,' demonstrating accurate information extraction. The minor difference is that the LLM answer includes source citations [TXN_10k_2023.pdf] and [TXN_10k_2024.pdf], which adds transparency without detracting from accuracy.

The LLM states Series C increased from $6M to $20M, but ground truth shows it increased only to $11M. These are not minor discrepancies - the direction of change is completely wrong for Series B (claimed increase vs. actual decrease), and the Series C 2024 figure is off by 82% ($20M vs. $11M actual). (2) ENTITY/CONTEXT ERRORS: The LLM incorrectly attributes this to Visa and references a 'Europe retrospective responsibility plan' which is not mentioned in the ground truth and appears to be fabricated context. The ground truth does not specify the company as Visa. (3) REASONING FAILURE: The LLM's interpretation that 'larger adjustments indicate the company is increasingly using' conversion rate adjustments is directly contradicted by the actual data showing a DECLINE in these adjustments. The LLM's strategic analysis is based on false premises. (4) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year comparison, which is the core requirement of the question. The ground truth clearly indicates a 'significant decline' while the LLM claims growth. This represents a fundamental misunderstanding or misreporting of the financial data.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BlackRock recognized performance fee revenue of $214 million, which was a decrease from $263 million in 2022, indicating a decline in realized performance-based revenue. By 2024, the company explicitly disclosed that performance fee revenue recognition is deferred until the revenue recognition criteria are met, and a liability for deferred carried interest is recorded when cash or capital allocations are received prior to meeting those criteria. This evolution shows a more detailed articulation of the timing and conditions under which performance fees are recognized, emphasizing the deferral mechanism and liability treatment, which was not explicitly described in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "BlackRock continued to apply the same performance‑fee accounting policy in both years – it only books performance‑fee revenue (including carried interest) once the fund’s performance hurdles are satisfied and the amount is no longer likely to be reversed, and it records a “deferred carried‑interest” liability for any cash or capital received before those hurdles are met【BLK_10k_2023.pdf p.96‑100】. In 2023 the company recognized $214 million of performance‑fee revenue, reducing the deferred carried‑interest liability (which rose from $1.42 billion at the start of the year to $1.78 billion after accounting for unrealized allocations)【BLK_10k_2023.pdf p.99】. The 2024 filing shows the same timing and condition criteria unchanged, but the liability balance and the amount of performance‑fee revenue recognized were updated to reflect new unrealized allocations and fees earned in 2024 under the same recognition rules【BLK_10k_2024.pdf p.85‑89】.",

(2) The description of the accounting policy (revenue recognition when hurdles are met, deferred carried interest liability for cash received before criteria met) is accurate. (3) The reference to deferred carried interest liability balances is mentioned. SIGNIFICANT ISSUES: (1) The LLM claims the policy was 'the same' between 2023 and 2024, but the ground truth explicitly states there was an EVOLUTION - specifically that 2024 showed 'more detailed articulation' and 'explicit disclosure' of the deferral mechanism that 'was not explicitly described in 2023.' This is a fundamental mischaracterization of the question's core premise about evolution/change. (2) The LLM provides specific liability balance figures ($1.42 billion to $1.78 billion) without clear verification against ground truth, and these appear to be presented as 2023 data but lack proper context. (3) The answer fails to highlight the KEY DISTINCTION: that 2024 brought EXPLICIT disclosure of the deferral mechanism and liability treatment, whereas 2023 did not explicitly describe this - this is the core 'evolution' the question asks about. (4) The LLM states policies were 'unchanged' when the ground truth indicates the disclosure and articulation evolved/improved between years. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer attempts to synthesize across 2023 and 2024 filings but misses the critical evolution in disclosure and articulation. It treats the years as having identical accounting rather than recognizing the evolution in how the accounting was disclosed and explained.

(2) Accurately notes that SOX certifications (31.1, 31.2, 32.1, 32.2) remained consistent across both years. (3) Provides sound multi-hop reasoning by synthesizing information across 2022 and 2024 filings to show the evolution from certifications/references to explicit policy filings. (4) The semantic interpretation of the shift toward 'strengthening governance frameworks' aligns with the ground truth's characterization. WEAKNESSES: (1) The ground truth specifically mentions Exhibit 10.46 (2021 Form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement) and Exhibit 21.1 (primary subsidiaries list) as 2022 exhibits, but the LLM answer does not reference these. While the LLM focuses on governance-specific exhibits, the omission of Exhibit 21.1 (which the ground truth notes remained in both years) represents incomplete coverage. (2) The LLM mentions Exhibit 13.1 (2021 annual report reference) in 2022, which is not mentioned in the ground truth, suggesting possible over-inclusion or different source interpretation. (3) The LLM answer doesn't explicitly note that Exhibit 21.1 persisted in both years as the ground truth does.

      "question": "How has the financial significance of the Embedded Processing segment evolved from 2022 to 2023 based on TXN's disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Embedded Processing segment accounted for about 17% of TXN's total revenue in 2021. By 2023, the segment's financial significance was reflected in $172 million of goodwill allocated to it, compared to $4,158 million for the Analog segment and $32 million for Other. This suggests a relatively minor role for Embedded Processing in TXN's overall asset structure in 2023, contrasting with its more notable revenue contribution in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "TXN’s 2023 filing shows that goodwill attributable to the Embedded Processing segment was $172 million at year‑end 2023 – the same amount reported at year‑end 2022. Because goodwill is a key measure of a segment’s lasting financial value, the unchanged $172 million indicates that the Embedded Processing segment’s financial significance remained essentially flat from 2022 to 2023.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant factual errors and incomplete analysis. (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies the $172 million goodwill figure for Embedded Processing in 2023, but fails to address the ground truth's mention of the 17% revenue contribution in 2021 or the comparative goodwill figures for other segments ($4,158M for Analog, $32M for Other). The claim that goodwill was 'the same amount reported at year-end 2022' cannot be verified from the provided ground truth and represents an unsupported assertion. (2) COMPLETENESS: The question asks how the segment's financial significance 'evolved from 2022 to 2023,' but the LLM only provides a static comparison of goodwill amounts without addressing the broader evolution. The ground truth explicitly contrasts the segment's 'more notable revenue contribution in the prior year' with its 'relatively minor role' in asset structure in 2023, suggesting a decline in significance. The LLM misses this key evolution entirely. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: The company (TXN) and segment (Embedded Processing) are correctly identified, but the temporal analysis is flawed. (4) REASONING: The LLM's logic that 'unchanged goodwill indicates flat financial significance' is overly simplistic and contradicts the ground truth's narrative of declining relative importance. The ground truth suggests the segment's significance declined from 2022 to 2023 based on the contrast between prior revenue contribution and current asset allocation. The LLM's conclusion of 'essentially flat' significance directly contradicts the ground truth's implication of relative decline. (5) MISSING CONTEXT: The LLM fails to synthesize the multi-hop information about revenue contribution (17% in 2021) with goodwill allocation in 2023, which is central to understanding the evolution of financial significance.",

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's approach to capital distributions evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of regulatory constraints and internal liquidity mechanisms?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo emphasized the Federal Reserve's requirement for large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit annual capital plans, including planned capital distributions such as dividends, and compliance with Basel III capital requirements, leverage ratios, and capital surcharges for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Failure to meet these could limit capital distributions. By 2024, the company introduced a new internal liquidity mechanism through the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), which imposed restrictions on dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if bankruptcy proceedings are authorized. This indicates a shift from purely regulatory constraints to a combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations on capital distributions.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Wells Fargo framed capital distributions almost exclusively as dividend payments that are capped by federal‑ and state‑statutory limits, the FRB’s annual capital‑plan rule, Basel III, leverage‑ratio and G‑SIB surcharge requirements, and by enhanced‑supervision triggers that can block dividends after stress‑test, risk‑ or liquidity‑metric breaches. The company relied on its 2017 Support Agreement – which routes cash to the parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit and can suspend dividend flows if defined liquidity or capital thresholds are missed – as its internal liquidity back‑stop. By 2024 the disclosure broadens “capital distributions” to include share repurchases as well as dividends, but the same regulatory constraints and the same Support‑Agreement‑based liquidity mechanism (with triggers that can restrict payments) remain central, now explicitly tied to FRB‑mandated stress‑test and liquidity‑risk triggers.",

      "detailed_feedback": "STRENGTHS: The LLM answer correctly identifies key regulatory constraints (Basel III, leverage ratios, G-SIB surcharges, stress tests) and accurately references the Support Agreement mechanism in both years. It correctly notes the 2024 expansion to include share repurchases alongside dividends. The answer demonstrates understanding of the multi-hop synthesis required (comparing 2023 vs 2024 approaches). Dates are accurate (2017 Support Agreement, 2023 vs 2024 comparison). WEAKNESSES: The LLM answer introduces a significant factual discrepancy regarding the Support Agreement's introduction timeline. The ground truth states the Support Agreement was 'introduced' or 'new' in 2024, implying it was a 2024 development. However, the LLM correctly identifies it as a 2017 agreement that was already in place in 2023. This creates ambiguity about whether the ground truth meant the Support Agreement was newly disclosed/emphasized in 2024 or newly implemented. The LLM's interpretation (that it existed in 2017 and continued through both years) appears more factually grounded, but contradicts the ground truth's framing of it as a 2024 introduction. CRITICAL ISSUE: The ground truth states the shift is 'from purely regulatory constraints to a combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations,' implying the internal mechanism (Support Agreement) was NOT present in 2023. The LLM states the Support Agreement was relied upon in 2023 as well ('The company relied on its 2017 Support Agreement'). This is a material contradiction about the evolution of the approach. The LLM's answer suggests continuity of the Support Agreement mechanism across both years, while the ground truth suggests it was introduced in 2024. CALCULATION/NUMERIC ACCURACY: No calculations required; dates and references are accurate where verifiable. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM successfully synthesizes information across 2023 and 2024, identifying both regulatory and internal mechanisms. However, the temporal framing of when the Support Agreement became operative differs from ground truth. The answer is more detailed and nuanced than the ground truth but may be factually inconsistent with the source documents regarding the Support Agreement's introduction date.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring 'significant fees or fines' if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including increased transaction costs or loss of payment processing ability. In 2023, the language evolved to place greater emphasis on the potential liability, using the phrase 'can also incur significant fees or fines' following 'associated investigatory expenses,' suggesting an increased likelihood or severity of financial penalties. This indicates an evolution in the perceived risk, with Apple signaling a potentially more severe consequence structure tied to payment card compliance failures.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s 10‑K disclosures in both 2022 and 2023 contain the same statement that, if it fails to follow payment‑card industry data‑security standards, the company “can be liable for associated investigatory expenses and can also incur significant fees or fines” (2022 p. 16; 2023 p. 16). Because the wording and emphasis are unchanged, Apple’s exposure to potential payment‑card‑related fees or fines has not materially shifted, indicating that this compliance risk remains a steady, ongoing concern rather than a newly heightened or reduced threat.",

Ground truth states that language EVOLVED between 2022 and 2023, with 2023 showing 'greater emphasis on potential liability' and a 'more severe consequence structure.' The LLM claims the wording is 'unchanged' and that exposure 'has not materially shifted.' This is a direct factual contradiction of the ground truth's central claim about how the risk disclosure evolved. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies both years (2022, 2023) and correctly cites page 16 for both filings. However, the LLM's assertion that the wording is identical contradicts the ground truth, which explicitly states the language evolved to place 'greater emphasis' with the phrase 'can also incur significant fees or fines' following 'associated investigatory expenses' in 2023 versus the 2022 version. QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM's reasoning is fundamentally flawed. It concludes that unchanged wording means unchanged risk exposure, but the ground truth indicates the wording DID change in a meaningful way that signals increased severity. The LLM failed to detect or acknowledge the linguistic evolution that the ground truth identifies as significant. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The question asks about how exposure CHANGED between years and what this indicates about evolving risks. The LLM's answer that nothing changed directly contradicts the ground truth's finding of evolution. The LLM did not properly synthesize the comparative analysis across the two years. CONTEXTUAL RELEVANCE: The answer addresses the right companies and years but arrives at the opposite conclusion from the ground truth regarding the nature of the change, making it contextually misaligned with the actual risk evolution described in the filings.",

This is a massive discrepancy - the LLM's numbers are approximately 3x higher than actual values. The LLM's calculation of a $77 million increase is mathematically correct for its stated numbers, but those numbers are fundamentally wrong. (2) DIRECTIONAL ERROR: The LLM claims assets INCREASED by $77 million (3.7%), but ground truth shows a DECREASE of $5 million ($686M to $681M). This is a complete reversal of the actual trend.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",

By 2024 DCAI revenue actually grew ≈ 1 % versus the prior year, a gain that Intel attributed to higher‑core‑count server products that lifted ASPs even though volumes fell【13†L31-L34】.

The characterization of 2023 challenges (GPU shift, competitive pressure, ASP erosion, market share loss) is accurate. The 2024 recovery mechanism (higher core-count products lifting ASPs despite lower volumes) is correctly identified. QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the answer correctly synthesizes the 2023 competitive headwinds with the 2024 strategic response. The identification of high-performance, AI-optimized Xeon CPUs as the strategic pivot is accurate and well-reasoned.

By 2024, this trend had reversed, with MG&A expenses decreasing by $127 million, or 2%, driven by lower incentive-based and share-based compensation as well as cost-reduction measures, despite higher corporate spending for business transformation.

The ground truth clearly states 2022 was 52.6% and 2024 was 13.9%, a 38.7 percentage point decline. These are not minor rounding differences - they represent a completely different financial picture. The LLM's numbers suggest a modest margin compression, while the ground truth shows a catastrophic collapse in profitability. (2) CALCULATION ERROR: The LLM calculates the decline as 'roughly 14 percentage points' (48.8% - 34.9% = 13.9%), which is arithmetically correct for their stated numbers, but those numbers are wrong.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the executive compensation disclosures incorporated sections such as 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis' and 'Executive Compensation Tables and Other Compensation Disclosures' under the heading 'Item 2 Advisory Vote on Compensation.' In 2023, the structure remained largely similar, but the formatting of the headings was adjusted, with the heading in 2023 using 'Compensation Discussion & Analysis' and including a more detailed breakdown of committee information under 'Board Meetings and Committee Information.' While the core content appears consistent, the presentation evolved with more granular sub-sections in 2023, indicating a refinement in disclosure structure.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2022 and 2023 Form 10‑K filings disclose executive compensation by reference to the same proxy sections – Director Compensation; the Compensation Discussion & Analysis and Executive Compensation Tables; and the Human Resources & Compensation Committee information (including the HRC Committee report). The 2023 filing simply refines the wording of those references, adding hyphens and a more consistent “Item 1 – Election of Directors” and “Item 2 – Advisory Vote on Compensation” format, but no new sections are added or removed.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant issues in addressing the core question about structural evolution of executive compensation disclosures between 2022 and 2023. CRITICAL PROBLEMS: (1) The LLM claims 'no new sections are added or removed' and that structure 'remained largely similar,' which directly contradicts the ground truth stating there was a 'refinement in disclosure structure' with 'more granular sub-sections in 2023.' (2) The LLM identifies different sections than the ground truth: LLM mentions 'Director Compensation,' 'Human Resources & Compensation Committee information,' and 'HRC Committee report,' while ground truth specifically references 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' 'Executive Compensation Tables and Other Compensation Disclosures,' and 'Board Meetings and Committee Information.' (3) The LLM's characterization of changes as merely 'refining the wording' and 'adding hyphens' significantly understates the actual structural evolution described in the ground truth. (4) The ground truth explicitly states the heading changed from 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis' (2022) to 'Compensation Discussion & Analysis' (2023) with more detailed breakdown of committee information - the LLM acknowledges the ampersand change but misses the substantive structural refinement. WHAT WAS CORRECT: The LLM correctly identifies that both years incorporate sections by reference from the proxy and correctly notes Item 1 and Item 2 references. The years (2022 and 2023) are correct. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM failed to properly synthesize the comparative analysis between the two years - it should have identified specific structural differences in how sections were organized and presented, not just dismissed them as formatting changes. The answer demonstrates incomplete understanding of the disclosure evolution question.",

(2) Temporal accuracy is correct - properly distinguishes between 2023 and 2024 filings. (3) The core insight about the strategic significance of adding Palo Alto Networks is captured accurately, with appropriate emphasis on cybersecurity/security capabilities.

(5) The answer addresses all parts of the question: how the ecosystem evolved, what partners were added, and what this indicates about IBM's approach. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM uses slightly more elaborate phrasing ('deepening its ecosystem,' 'broader, more integrated set of alliances') compared to the ground truth's more concise language, but this represents semantic enhancement rather than factual deviation. The characterization of Palo Alto Networks as 'a leading security-technology firm' is accurate and adds helpful context. No numerical errors, calculation errors, or factual inaccuracies detected.

The number format conversion (millions to billions) is appropriate and correct. The fiscal year identification is accurate.\n\nWEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM answer is INCOMPLETE - it fails to address the accumulated depreciation data ($264 million to $525 million), which is explicitly mentioned in the ground truth as a key indicator of the company's capital investment strategy. This is a significant omission for a multi-hop question asking about capital expenditure strategy evolution. (2) The LLM's interpretation shifts focus to 'finance lease liability' and emphasizes 'leasing strategy' (cash preservation, spreading costs), but the ground truth frames this as 'investment in Computers, Equipment and Software under finance leases' and describes it as indicating 'more aggressive capital investment strategy in technology infrastructure.' While both interpretations could be valid, the LLM's emphasis on leasing as a financing preference differs from the ground truth's focus on aggressive technology infrastructure investment. (3) The LLM provides reasonable inference about capital strategy but misses the accumulated depreciation context that would strengthen the analysis of investment intensity.\n\nCALCULATION VERIFICATION: $1.579B - $1.053B = $0.526B ≈ $0.5B ✓; ($0.526B / $1.053B) × 100 = 49.95% ≈ 50% ✓\n\nMULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The answer addresses the evolution question but only partially synthesizes the complete picture. It captures the primary metric change but omits the accumulated depreciation trend that provides additional evidence of capital intensity.\n\nOVERALL: Core numbers are correct and calculations are accurate, but the answer is incomplete (missing accumulated depreciation data) and provides a somewhat different strategic interpretation than the ground truth. The answer is substantially correct on the main figures but falls short of fully addressing the question's scope.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Accenture highlighted that many of its consulting contracts were less than 12 months in duration and could be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, posing a risk to revenue predictability. Additionally, the company noted that delays or reductions in client spending—especially under existing contracts—could materially affect results, particularly in geographic markets or service lines where a small number of clients contributed significantly to revenue. By 2024, the focus of client spending risk had evolved to emphasize broader operational vulnerabilities, including global disruptions such as geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, and infrastructure failures. These risks, combined with Accenture's global delivery model's concentration in India and the Philippines, introduced new layers of unpredictability in maintaining consistent client spending and service delivery. While contract flexibility remained a concern, the 2024 filing expanded the risk profile to include external macro-operational factors, indicating a shift in how client spending volatility could impact the company.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Accenture stressed that many consulting engagements were < 12 months and could be terminated with as little as 30 days’ notice, leaving the firm highly exposed to client‑spending cuts and making revenue less predictable (2022, pp. 16‑20). By the 2024 filing the company highlighted a shift to longer‑term outsourcing and managed‑services contracts that include longer notice periods and early‑termination fees, plus growth in subscription‑type offerings, which together improve revenue predictability and reduce—but do not eliminate—its exposure to client‑spending volatility (2024, pp. 27‑31).",

(1) MAJOR FACTUAL ERROR - EVOLUTION DIRECTION: The ground truth states that by 2024, Accenture's risk focus EXPANDED to include broader operational vulnerabilities (geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, infrastructure failures), NOT that contract flexibility improved. The LLM claims the opposite - that by 2024 the company shifted to 'longer-term outsourcing and managed-services contracts' with 'longer notice periods and early-termination fees' that 'improve revenue predictability.' This is a fundamental mischaracterization of how the risk profile evolved. (2) MISSING KEY INFORMATION: The LLM completely omits the critical 2024 risk factors mentioned in the ground truth: global disruptions, geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, infrastructure failures, and concentration risks in India and Philippines delivery model. These are central to understanding how client spending risk evolved. (3) UNSUPPORTED CLAIMS: The LLM makes specific claims about 'longer-term outsourcing contracts,' 'early-termination fees,' and 'subscription-type offerings' that are not mentioned in the ground truth and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. (4) PAGE REFERENCES: The LLM provides specific page numbers (2022 pp. 16-20, 2024 pp. 27-31) that cannot be verified and may be hallucinated. (5) CORRECT ELEMENTS: The LLM correctly identifies that in 2022 contracts were <12 months with 30 days' notice, which matches the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.'

The 2024 filing repeats the same description but drops the “home builders” reference, listing only Chase‑branch bankers, real‑estate brokers and other third parties (2024 p. 330‑332).

MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM's interpretation that the omission 'suggests referrals from home-builder partners have become less material' is a reasonable inference but represents analytical judgment rather than explicit statement from the filings. However, this aligns with the ground truth's similar characterization ('could imply a strategic shift'). The LLM's additional mention of 'digital channels' as a potential alternative focus is a reasonable extension of the analysis, though not explicitly stated in the ground truth. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: Page numbers are cited (though not verified against actual filings in this evaluation context), and the factual descriptions of what was included/omitted are accurate.

(1) REVENUE FIGURES: Ground truth states LinkedIn generated $13.816 billion in FY2022 (LLM correctly approximates as $13.8B). However, the LLM claims FY2023 revenue was 'roughly $14.8 billion,' which would represent approximately $1 billion growth. The ground truth indicates only a 9% increase from $13.816B, which would be approximately $15.06 billion ($13.816B × 1.09), NOT $14.8B. The LLM's FY2023 figure appears to be incorrect. (2) GROWTH RATE CALCULATION: The LLM calculates the growth as '≈ 7%' based on their stated figures ($1B increase on $13.8B base = 7.2%). However, the ground truth explicitly states a 9% increase. This is a material discrepancy - the LLM's calculated growth rate of 7% contradicts the ground truth's 9% figure. (3) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The LLM attempts to synthesize information across fiscal years and connect it to Microsoft's portfolio context, which is appropriate. However, the fundamental numerical errors undermine this synthesis. (4) REASONING QUALITY: The LLM's interpretation that this represents a 'modest rise' and 'steady, moderate trajectory' is reasonable qualitatively, but is based on incorrect quantitative premises. The 9% growth rate (per ground truth) is actually more significant than the 7% the LLM calculated. (5) CITATION REFERENCES: The LLM provides specific page references (MSFT_10k_2022 p. 96; MSFT_10k_2023 p. 39), which adds credibility but cannot override the factual inaccuracies in the stated numbers.

      "question": "How did the growth trajectory of iPhone net sales evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this shift suggest about the product line's performance over time?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, iPhone net sales increased compared to 2021, driven by the launch of new iPhone models since the fourth quarter of 2021. However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth to stagnation suggests a notable change in the iPhone's sales momentum, potentially indicating market saturation, longer upgrade cycles, or weaker demand despite ongoing product releases.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022 Apple’s iPhone net sales rose to **$205.5 billion**, a 7 % increase over 2021. The next two years reversed that trend: sales slipped to **$200.6 billion in 2023** (about a 2 % decline) and were essentially unchanged at **$201.2 billion in 2024** (flat versus 2023)【AAPL_10k_2022.pdf p. 24‑25】【AAPL_10k_2024.pdf p. 26‑27】. This progression shows the iPhone’s growth momentum has stalled, moving from a period of strong expansion to a plateau‑or‑slight‑decline phase, suggesting a slowdown in demand or market saturation for the product line.",

STRENGTHS: (1) All financial figures are correct: $205.5B (2022), $200.6B (2023), $201.2B (2024). (2) Percentage calculations are accurate: 7% increase 2021-2022, ~2% decline 2022-2023, flat 2023-2024. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound - the answer correctly synthesizes data across three fiscal years and identifies the trajectory shift from growth to stagnation. (4) Entity identification is precise (Apple/AAPL, iPhone net sales, fiscal years). (5) The conclusion about market saturation and demand slowdown aligns with the ground truth characterization of 'relatively flat' performance in 2024. (6) The answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the evolution of growth trajectory AND what it suggests about product performance. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: The LLM provides more specific numerical detail than the ground truth (exact dollar amounts and percentages), which enhances rather than detracts from accuracy. The characterization of the shift from 'growth to stagnation' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth's 'growth to relatively flat' description. The reasoning about potential causes (market saturation, longer upgrade cycles, weaker demand) matches the ground truth's implications. No calculation errors detected.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COF reported total gross unrealized losses of $9,156 million in its investment securities available for sale. In 2024, this figure slightly increased to $9,152 million. Despite the small numerical decrease, the magnitude of the unrealized losses remained largely significant, indicating that the company continued to face substantial market value declines in its investment portfolio over this period.",

      "detailed_feedback": "CRITICAL ERRORS - The LLM answer contains fundamentally incorrect financial figures that directly contradict the ground truth. (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURE: The LLM states 2023 gross unrealized losses were $9.2 billion and 2024 were $10.1 billion, but the ground truth clearly shows 2023 was $9,156 million ($9.156 billion) and 2024 was $9,152 million ($9.152 billion). The LLM's 2024 figure of $10.1 billion is off by approximately $948 million (10.4% error). (2) CALCULATION ERROR: The LLM calculates an increase of roughly $1 billion (10%), but the actual change was a DECREASE of $4 million (from $9,156M to $9,152M), representing a 0.04% decline, not an increase. This is a directional error - the losses actually slightly improved, not worsened. (3) MISINTERPRETATION: The LLM's conclusion that 'the portfolio's market values fell further' is incorrect. The data shows unrealized losses remained essentially flat year-over-year, indicating stable (not deteriorating) market exposure. (4) ENTITY/SOURCE ISSUES: The LLM references 'Table 2.1' and 'Table 3.1' without verification, and these table citations appear to be fabricated or misidentified. (5) SEMANTIC CONTRADICTION: While the LLM correctly identifies the question's focus on market value decline exposure, it reaches the wrong conclusion based on incorrect numbers. The ground truth indicates the company's exposure remained 'largely significant' but stable, whereas the LLM suggests worsening exposure.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, PayPal reported a 10% increase in TPV compared to 2023, processing $1.68 trillion in total payment volume. This growth indicates continued expansion of PayPal's platform. In the 2022 filing, TPV was explicitly defined as a key nonfinancial performance metric used by management to measure the performance of the business, showing its strategic importance. While the specific TPV figure for 2022 is not provided, the fact that TPV was highlighted as a core metric in 2022 and continued to grow significantly in 2024 suggests that the company maintained its focus on platform scale and transactional relevance over time.",

QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: The 10% TPV growth rate is correct, and the $1.68 trillion figure for 2024 TPV is accurate. Both numbers match the ground truth exactly. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (1) the 2023-2024 TPV growth rate with specific dollar amount, and (2) the 2022 filing's emphasis on TPV as a key metric. ENTITY ACCURACY: All entities are correctly identified - PayPal, the correct fiscal years (2022, 2023, 2024), and the correct metric (TPV/total payment volume). MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across three different years and two different 10-K filings, correctly connecting the 2022 strategic emphasis on TPV to the 2024 growth performance. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's phrasing ('total payment volume rose ≈10%' and '$1.68 trillion of TPV') is semantically equivalent to the ground truth. The characterization of TPV as a 'key non-financial performance metric' that 'drives transaction revenue' and measures 'platform scale and strength' aligns with the ground truth's description of its strategic importance. MINOR NOTES: The LLM includes specific page citations which add credibility but weren't in the ground truth. The use of '≈10%' (approximately) is slightly more cautious than the ground truth's definitive '10%', but this is a negligible difference.

The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",

(2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY - The numbers cited ($5M in 2023, $4M in 2024) appear correct based on the citations provided, but the interpretation is wrong. (3) METHODOLOGY DISCLOSURE - The ground truth indicates 2023 had 'limited disclosure' with just a brief mention in a table, while 2024 provided expanded disclosure explaining the measurement basis and investment types (venture capital funds, etc.). The LLM incorrectly states the methodology 'did not change' when the disclosure itself evolved significantly. (4) RISK EXPOSURE - The ground truth explicitly states 2024 included 'broader discussion of counterparty risk' indicating 'more comprehensive approach to risk management,' while the LLM claims the company 'continues to discuss risk exposure only in the broader credit-risk concentration section, without adding any specific risk commentary.' This directly contradicts the ground truth's assertion of expanded risk disclosure. (5) MULTI-HOP REASONING - The LLM failed to synthesize the evolution of disclosure practices across the two years, instead focusing narrowly on the measurement methodology remaining constant while missing the larger point about disclosure expansion and enhanced risk transparency.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the discount rate assumption for Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans was 1.57% for 2021 and 1.31% for 2020, indicating a low discounting of future obligations. Lower discount rates increase the present value of future liabilities. In 2023, the projected benefit payments for Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans show a steady increase from $88 million in 2024 to $95 million in 2028, with a cumulative $501 million beyond 2028. The low discount rate assumptions in 2022 likely contributed to higher liability valuations, which aligns with the increased projected benefit obligations seen in 2023. This suggests that the company is recognizing growing pension liabilities for its Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans, influenced in part by the conservative discount rate assumptions used in prior years.",

This is a critical error as the entire premise of the answer hinges on discount rate analysis. The LLM's 3.45% rate is substantially higher than the ground truth rates and contradicts the key insight that lower discount rates increase liability valuations. (2) PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS ERROR: The LLM cites $101 million for 2023 and $99 million for 2022, but the ground truth specifies the 2023 projected benefit payments show a range from $88 million in 2024 to $95 million in 2028, with cumulative $501 million beyond 2028. The LLM's numbers don't align with the ground truth's payment schedule.

The LLM fails to correctly establish the causal chain because the discount rate number is wrong. (4) REASONING FLAW: The LLM's logic that 'increase in projected payments despite a relatively high discount rate signals expanding liabilities' is backwards from the ground truth's insight. The ground truth emphasizes that LOW discount rates (1.31-1.57%) increase present value of liabilities, not high rates. The LLM's 3.45% rate would actually suggest lower liability valuations, contradicting the ground truth's conclusion about growing pension liabilities.

The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan's 10-K filing primarily introduced MEV (Macroeconomic Variable) as a defined term within the glossary, with no explicit application or strategic context provided. By 2024, the treatment of MEV evolved significantly, as it became a core component in the estimation of collateral values for mortgage risk modeling. Specifically, in 2024, MEV was applied through MSA-level home price indices, which were used to forecast collateral values for junior lien home equity products. This shift indicates a move from a purely definitional disclosure in 2023 to a functional, risk-modelling role in 2024, particularly in the context of combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio calculations.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 Form 10‑K (pages 315‑319) only defines MEV as a “macroeconomic variable” in the glossary and does not describe a specific use of MEV in its mortgage‑credit‑loss models. The 2024 Form 10‑K (pages 330‑334) repeats the same definition and still lists MEV merely as a macro variable, with no new methodology or expanded application to mortgage risk modeling disclosed. Therefore, based on the disclosed pages, JPMorgan’s approach to MEV – and its use in mortgage risk modeling – appears unchanged between 2023 and 2024.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect in its core conclusion. The ground truth clearly establishes that JPMorgan's approach to MEV DID change significantly between 2023 and 2024, evolving from a purely definitional disclosure to a functional application in mortgage risk modeling. Specifically, by 2024, MEV became integral to collateral value estimation for mortgage risk modeling through MSA-level home price indices used in CLTV ratio calculations for junior lien home equity products. The LLM answer contradicts this by claiming the approach 'appears unchanged between 2023 and 2024' and states that MEV was 'still listed MEV merely as a macro variable, with no new methodology or expanded application.' This is a direct contradiction of the ground truth. The LLM's reasoning appears to be based on a narrow reading of glossary definitions rather than understanding the broader application context described in the 2024 filing. The quantitative accuracy score is relatively high (8) because the LLM correctly identifies page numbers and years without numerical errors, but the qualitative accuracy is very low (2) because the fundamental synthesis and interpretation of how MEV's role evolved is completely wrong. The LLM failed to identify the multi-hop connection between: (1) MEV definition in 2023, (2) MEV's application to MSA-level home price indices in 2024, and (3) the use of these indices in CLTV calculations for mortgage risk modeling.

Ground truth states the gross value of equipment, compute hardware, and software was $7,568 million in 2024, but the LLM reports $5,200 million - a discrepancy of $2,368 million (31% understatement). The 2023 figure of $4,303 million is correct. The calculated increase of $0.9 billion (21%) is therefore incorrect; the actual increase should be $3,265 million (76% growth).

The LLM correctly identifies the 2023 date (Jan 29, 2023) and 2024 date (Jan 28, 2024), and the qualitative interpretation about capital expenditure strategy and scaling computational capabilities is reasonable and aligned with the ground truth's conclusion. However, the quantitative foundation is severely flawed. The LLM appears to have cited a source (NVDA_10k_2024.pdf†L71-L73) but extracted the wrong number for 2024.

However, the LLM states 'Oracle's cloud‑services share of total revenue rose from 32% in fiscal 2023 to 37% in fiscal 2024' which is CORRECT in the opening sentence, but then contradicts itself by saying this represents a rise FROM 32% TO 37%, when the question asks about evolution FROM fiscal 2023 TO fiscal 2024. The LLM's cited source clearly states '37%, 32% and 25% of our total revenues during fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively' - meaning 37% in FY2024, 32% in FY2023, and 25% in FY2022. The LLM's opening statement is actually correct (32% in FY2023 to 37% in FY2024), but the phrasing 'rose from 32% in fiscal 2023 to 37% in fiscal 2024' is correct. Upon closer inspection, the LLM answer IS numerically correct regarding the percentages and years. However, the answer is INCOMPLETE: it fails to mention the fiscal 2022 comparison (25%) which the ground truth includes as important context showing the multi-year trend. The answer also lacks the specific strategic initiatives mentioned in the ground truth (programs to help customers migrate and expand workloads to Oracle Cloud). The answer provides only a surface-level interpretation without the depth of strategic context provided in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and specifically noted that interest revenue from financing arrangements was recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle continued to include unbilled receivables in accounts receivable and maintained similar revenue recognition timing under ASC 606. However, the 2024 disclosure reclassified interest revenue from financing contracts to 'non-operating expenses, net'—a more specific categorization than in 2022.

(2) It does not discuss the timing of revenue recognition under ASC 606 or how this may have evolved. (3) The answer states the policy 'has not changed,' which is partially misleading since the ground truth indicates there was a refinement in financial reporting terminology and structure regarding interest revenue classification, even if the core treatment remained consistent. The LLM answer is too narrow in scope—it focuses only on the unbilled receivables inclusion in accounts receivable but misses the important disclosure evolution regarding interest revenue treatment. The question specifically asks about 'evolution' and 'disclosure,' and the LLM answer largely dismisses evolution by stating 'has not changed.'

By FY23, the segment's description expanded to explicitly include automotive platforms for infotainment systems and Omniverse Enterprise software for 3D internet applications. While exact revenue figures for FY23 are not provided, the inclusion of these new areas indicates an effort to diversify the revenue mix and extend the Graphics segment's role into emerging markets such as automotive and enterprise 3D applications.",

Key issues: (1) FACTUAL CONTRADICTION: The LLM claims the segment narrative was 'essentially unchanged' between FY22 and FY23, directly contradicting the ground truth which explicitly states the description 'expanded to explicitly include automotive platforms for infotainment systems and Omniverse Enterprise software.' The LLM then lists all these items as if they were present in both years, which misrepresents the evolution. (2) QUANTITATIVE ERRORS: While the LLM correctly cites FY22 revenue as $15.9 billion and FY23 as $11.9 billion, it misinterprets what these numbers mean in context. The ground truth notes that exact FY23 revenue figures are 'not provided' in the segment description evolution analysis, yet the LLM presents specific numbers without clarifying their source or acknowledging this limitation. (3) MISALIGNMENT WITH QUESTION: The question asks what the 'evolution' of the segment description suggests - implying there WAS a change. The LLM's opening claim that the narrative was 'essentially unchanged' directly contradicts both the ground truth and the question's framing. The ground truth clearly identifies an expansion to include automotive and Omniverse, which represents a strategic shift. (4) REASONING FLAW: The LLM concludes that 'while the product mix stayed the same, NVIDIA's revenue mix is shifting' - but this contradicts its own premise that the description was unchanged. If the description expanded to include new areas (automotive, Omniverse), then the product mix did change. (5) MISSING CONTEXT: The LLM fails to recognize that the inclusion of automotive platforms and Omniverse Enterprise in FY23 (but not FY22) represents the key evolution the question asks about. Instead, it dismisses this as 'essentially unchanged' and pivots to discussing overall revenue shifts toward data center/AI, which is a different analytical angle than what the ground truth identifies.",

In fiscal 2024, this figure significantly increased, with the MD&A noting that higher amortization was a key driver in operating income as a percentage of revenue decreasing by 3.8 percentage points. This indicates a material rise in amortization costs, likely due to recent acquisitions such as Splunk, which also contributed $1.4 billion in revenue.

(2) The answer correctly identifies that amortization was 'higher' in fiscal 2024 without providing a specific number, which aligns with the ground truth's statement that the figure 'significantly increased' without stating the exact fiscal 2024 amount. (3) Operating income percentage calculation: The LLM states operating income fell to 22.6% of revenue (down 3.8 percentage points from 27.1% in fiscal 2022) - this is mathematically consistent (27.1% - 3.8% = 23.3%, though the LLM states 22.6%, which may reflect rounding or a slightly different calculation basis, but the 3.8 percentage point decrease is explicitly confirmed in ground truth). (4) Splunk acquisition correctly identified as the driver of increased amortization, consistent with ground truth.

The LLM's reasoning is flawed because it focuses only on the identical core language while missing the material additions and nuances that the ground truth identifies as key to understanding the evolution. The answer demonstrates a failure to perform proper multi-hop synthesis across the two years' disclosures and to identify the substantive differences in how the company characterized its capital constraints.

The LLM answer is more informative than the ground truth, which was somewhat vague about whether the 2024 disclosure actually covered specific years. The only minor consideration is that the ground truth's statement about 'reduced explicit mention' could be interpreted as suggesting the 2024 disclosure was less specific, whereas the LLM answer shows it was equally specific but with different years.

This indicates that despite an increase in gross settlement exposure from $75,023 million to $78,385 million, the company applied more risk mitigation arrangements, increasing them from $12,167 million to $13,466 million. However, the net settlement exposure still rose, suggesting that the growth in gross exposure outpaced the additional risk mitigation.",

Multi-hop synthesis: The LLM correctly synthesized the relationship between gross exposure growth, risk mitigation expansion, and net exposure increase, drawing the logical conclusion that growth in gross exposure outpaced mitigation efforts. The reasoning about 'effective risk-management' is well-supported by the data showing mitigation arrangements increased alongside exposure. The answer addresses all parts of the question: evolution of net settlement exposure (correct), gross exposure context (implied correctly), risk mitigation context (correct), and interpretation of risk management effectiveness (sound logic).

Additionally, in 2023, AMD's methodology expanded to include 'excess and obsolescence reserves' that were evaluated based on forecasted demand, competitiveness, customer requirements, and product life cycles.

The LLM conflates the reporting year with the fiscal year being reported. The 2022 10-K reported $1,955 million as of December 25, 2021 - this is correct in the LLM answer. QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The dollar amounts are correct ($1.96B ≈ $1,955M and $4.35B ≈ $4,351M), but the date attribution is fundamentally wrong. COMPLETENESS: The LLM answer addresses inventory valuation methodology and mentions both years, but fails to properly distinguish between reporting year and fiscal year end dates. The ground truth emphasizes that 2023 methodology 'expanded to include excess and obsolescence reserves' evaluated on specific factors (forecasted demand, competitiveness, customer requirements, product life cycles), while the LLM answer lists these factors but doesn't clearly articulate that this represents an expansion/evolution in methodology from 2022. The LLM does mention 'lower of cost or net realizable value' which is appropriate but not explicitly stated in the ground truth excerpt. REASONING: The multi-hop synthesis is partially sound - the LLM correctly identifies the growth trajectory and attempts to explain methodology - but the date error undermines the temporal comparison that is central to the question about 'evolution between 2022 and 2023.' The LLM should have been clearer that the $4.35B figure represents December 30, 2022 data (fiscal 2022, reported in 2023 10-K), not 2023 fiscal year data.

      "detailed_feedback": "MAJOR DISCREPANCIES IDENTIFIED: (1) QUANTITATIVE ERRORS - The LLM states 'four acquisitions totalling $245 million' in FY 2022, but the ground truth specifies '$110 million to intangible assets primarily within its infrastructure software segment.' The $245M figure is not mentioned in ground truth and appears to be incorrect or from a different context. The LLM also cites a '$61 billion VMware merger' as pending in May 2022, but ground truth states the final transaction was 'approximately $84.2 billion.' This is a significant discrepancy - either the $61B was an initial bid/estimate and $84.2B was final, or the LLM has the wrong figure. The LLM correctly identifies the VMware closing date as Nov 22, 2023. (2) COMPLETENESS - The LLM does address the evolution from FY 2022 to FY 2024 and mentions both acquisition activity and segment enhancement, matching the question's requirements. However, the specific $110M figure from ground truth is absent. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY - Broadcom, VMware, and Infrastructure Software segment are correctly identified. Fiscal years 2022 and 2024 are correct. (4) REASONING - The multi-hop synthesis is sound in structure (comparing pre-VMware to post-VMware positioning), but the quantitative foundation is flawed. The narrative about transformation from 'building-out' to 'integrated platform' is qualitatively reasonable but undermined by number errors. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE - The conceptual framing (modest acquisitions → transformative VMware deal) aligns with ground truth, but the specific dollar amounts create factual inaccuracy. The $245M figure for FY 2022 acquisitions contradicts the $110M stated in ground truth. The $61B vs $84.2B VMware valuation discrepancy is material and suggests the LLM may be conflating different transaction values or time periods.",

Quantitative verification: (1) 2022 Products revenue stated as $18.3 billion vs. ground truth $18.275 billion - acceptable rounding variation; (2) 2023 Products revenue stated as $19.1 billion - matches ground truth exactly; (3) Percentage share of 30% in both years - matches ground truth; (4) Growth calculation of roughly $0.8 billion ($19.1B - $18.3B = $0.8B) - accurate; (5) Growth rate of 4-5% is mathematically correct ($0.8B / $18.275B ≈ 4.4%). Multi-hop synthesis: The answer correctly synthesizes information across 2022 and 2023 filings, comparing both absolute dollar amounts and relative revenue share. Entity accuracy: Correctly identifies Accenture (ACN) and the Products segment. Reasoning quality: The interpretation that \"modest absolute growth while maintaining a steady one-third contribution signals continued emphasis on product-based offerings\" is sound and directly addresses the strategic focus question. Minor observation: The LLM uses $18.3B (rounded) while ground truth specifies $18.275B, but this is an acceptable formatting variation and doesn't materially affect accuracy.

By 2024, this number increased to 36,906,603 securities, and the weighted-average exercise price rose to $144.81.

The calculation of the increase (9.8 million shares) is approximately correct: 36,906,603 - 27,116,118 = 9,790,485, which rounds to 9.8 million. The LLM correctly identified the upward trend in both metrics and synthesized the multi-hop information across the 2022-2024 period. Minor weakness: The answer states 'roughly 9.8 million shares' which is accurate but could have been more precise (9.79 million). The answer appropriately addresses both parts of the question (change in securities volume and trend in weighted-average exercise price) and correctly identifies IBM as the company (implied from context). The reasoning is sound and the semantic meaning matches the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco reported amortization of purchased intangible assets at $313 million. By fiscal 2024, this figure had increased significantly, driven by the acquisition of Splunk Inc. in March 2024, which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in total revenue and brought additional intangible assets requiring amortization. The 2024 filing explicitly notes a higher amortization of purchased intangible assets as part of increased operating expenses, directly tied to the Splunk acquisition. This indicates a substantial increase in amortization costs over the two-year period.",

As a result, amortization rose from $313 million in fiscal 2022 (shown in the Consolidated Statements of Operations) to roughly $700 million in fiscal 2024, more than double the prior level and a key factor behind the 8.8‑percentage‑point decline in operating‑income margin 【CSCO_10k_2022.pdf p. 62‑66】【CSCO_10k_2024.pdf p. 33‑34】.",

However, there is a critical quantitative error: the LLM states amortization rose to 'roughly $700 million in fiscal 2024,' but the ground truth does not provide this specific figure. The ground truth only confirms the fiscal 2022 figure of $313 million and notes a 'significant' increase driven by Splunk, without specifying the exact 2024 amount. The LLM's claim of 'more than double' ($700M vs $313M) cannot be verified against the provided ground truth. Additionally, the LLM introduces an unsupported claim about an '8.8-percentage-point decline in operating-income margin' that is not mentioned in the ground truth. The qualitative reasoning is sound - correctly identifying Splunk as the driver and understanding the relationship between acquisition and increased amortization. The answer appropriately addresses the 'what drove the change' and 'how significant' parts of the question, but the specific $700 million figure appears to be either fabricated or from a source not validated by the ground truth. The Splunk revenue contribution of approximately $1.4 billion mentioned in ground truth is not referenced in the LLM answer, representing a minor omission.

However, the LLM's conclusion that 'Digital Experience's share of total revenue stayed near 25%' is INCORRECT. FY2022: 4,422/17,606 = 25.1% ✓. FY2024: 5,366/21,505 = 24.9% ✓. While the percentages are indeed near 25%, the LLM's statement that growth was 'proportional' is misleading. The original answer correctly states that 'growth in Digital Experience revenue outpaced the overall revenue growth' (21.35% vs 22.15% is marginal, but the original framing is more accurate). The LLM's characterization as 'steady, proportional driver' understates the nuance that Digital Experience grew slightly slower than overall company revenue, not faster as the ground truth suggests.

      "llm_answer": "Bank‑deposit‑account fees fell sharply, from $1,409 million in 2022 to $705 million in 2023 – a drop of roughly 50% (Consolidated Statements of Income, 2023 p. 66). Because these fees are earned for providing marketing, record‑keeping and support for off‑balance‑sheet sweep programs that move client cash to third‑party FDIC‑insured accounts, the decline signals that Schwab’s cash‑sweep activity – and thus its reliance on or relationship with those off‑balance‑sheet sweep programs – has markedly weakened in 2023.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: All numbers are correct - $1,409 million in 2022, $705 million in 2023, and the calculated 50% decline is accurate (($1,409-$705)/$1,409 = 49.96% ≈ 50%). The page reference (p. 66) adds credibility. (2) COMPLETENESS: The answer fully addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (a) the revenue evolution between years with specific figures, and (b) what this shift suggests about Schwab's relationship with off-balance sheet sweep programs. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: Correctly identifies Schwab, the specific revenue line item (Bank Deposit Account Fees), the correct fiscal years (2022 and 2023), and accurately describes the nature of these fees (marketing, record-keeping, support for off-balance-sheet sweep programs). (4) REASONING QUALITY: The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the LLM correctly connects the decline in fees to a weakened reliance on/relationship with off-balance-sheet sweep programs, which is the logical inference from reduced activity in this revenue stream. The causal chain is well-articulated. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM answer conveys identical information to the ground truth, using slightly more detailed language ('cash-sweep activity' and 'markedly weakened') while maintaining factual accuracy. Minor difference: LLM provides slightly more context about how these fees are earned, which enhances rather than detracts from the answer. No material errors or omissions detected.",

(2) The calculation of the 10 percentage point drop in currency-neutral contribution (20% to 10%) is accurate.

Key issues: (1) QUANTITATIVE ERRORS: The LLM cites $131M in 2022 ROU assets and $425M in 2024 ($343M operating + $82M finance), but the ground truth shows $390M operating leases in 2023 and $599M operating + $73M finance in 2024. The LLM's numbers don't align with the actual disclosed figures. The $82M finance lease figure is close to but not exactly the $73M reported. (2) MISINTERPRETATION OF METRICS: The LLM appears to be discussing 'newly recognized' or 'added' ROU assets rather than total ROU lease assets on the balance sheet, which is what the question asks about. The ground truth focuses on total ROU assets as of year-end (balance sheet amounts), not incremental additions. (3) INCOMPLETE SYNTHESIS: The LLM fails to address the 2022 context about impairment charges and fair value measurement that the ground truth mentions. (4) MISSING KEY DATA: The LLM doesn't properly compare the 2023 baseline ($390M operating) to 2024 ($599M operating), which shows a $209M increase in operating leases alone. (5) REASONING FLAW: While the LLM correctly infers a strategic shift toward more leasing, the numerical foundation supporting this conclusion is incorrect. The actual evolution shows operating leases grew from $390M to $599M (53% increase) and finance leases emerged at $73M in 2024, which is a more dramatic shift than the LLM's numbers suggest.

By 2024, these fees had decreased to $729 million, indicating a significant drop in revenue from this stream. This decline suggests a strategic shift where Schwab moved more BDA balances onto its own balance sheet to utilize them as a funding source for interest-earning assets, which aligns with the company's capital management strategy mentioned in 2022.",

The intermediate 2023 figure ($705M) is not mentioned in the ground truth but appears to be accurate based on the LLM's statement about year-over-year progression. The $10.6 billion transfer reference adds specific supporting detail. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM successfully synthesizes information across multiple dimensions: (1) the fee revenue trend across three years, (2) the strategic rationale (moving BDA balances to own balance sheet), (3) the capital management objective (converting fees to interest income), and (4) the funding source benefit. This demonstrates proper multi-hop synthesis. ENTITY ACCURACY: Correctly identifies Schwab, BDA (Bank Deposit Account), and relevant time periods. Properly distinguishes between Investor Services and Advisor Services components. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's explanation of strategy aligns perfectly with the ground truth - both identify the deliberate shift to internalize BDA balances for interest-earning asset deployment. The LLM provides slightly more operational detail (mentioning the specific 2021 transfer and the mechanism of converting fee-based to interest-based income) which enhances rather than contradicts the ground truth.

The ground truth explicitly notes that while overall exposure remained consistent, there WAS a refinement in how the sensitivity was characterized between years. The LLM's conclusion of 'no material shift' is correct, but the characterization of the language as 'essentially unchanged' misses the evolution/refinement that the ground truth identifies.

Correctly describes the transition to a two-segment model\n5. Appropriately cites source documents (AVGO_10k_2022.pdf p.59 and AVGO_10k_2023.pdf p.56)\n6. Captures the semantic essence of the business transformation\n\nWEAKNESSES:\n1. MISSING CRITICAL QUANTITATIVE DATA: The ground truth specifies the VMware acquisition value as \"approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split-adjusted basis).\" The LLM answer completely omits these specific financial metrics, which are important quantitative details for understanding the scale of the strategic shift.\n2. The LLM answer does not mention the supply imbalances and supply chain constraints that characterized FY 2022 profitability in the Semiconductor Solutions Segment\n3. Does not explicitly state that the acquisition marked a \"transformation\" in strategic focus with the specific value metrics\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two fiscal years and two 10-K filings, correctly linking the VMware acquisition to the strategic shift. The reasoning is logically sound.\n\nNUMERIC ACCURACY: While the LLM doesn't provide incorrect numbers, it fails to include the specific acquisition value figures ($30,788 million) and share count (544 million shares) that are part of the ground truth answer. This represents a significant omission in quantitative accuracy for a question about business evolution.\n\nSEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The core narrative matches the ground truth - both describe a shift from semiconductor-driven to diversified software-inclusive portfolio. However, the absence of specific acquisition metrics reduces the completeness of the answer.",

      "question": "How has the financial performance of AMD's Embedded segment evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what factors contributed to this change?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Embedded segment was identified as one of AMD's four reportable segments, including products such as embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. However, in 2024, the Embedded segment experienced a 33% decline in net revenue, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion. This decline was attributed to customers normalizing their inventory levels. Therefore, the Embedded segment's financial performance significantly decreased between 2023 and 2024 due to inventory adjustments by customers.",
      "llm_answer": "AMD’s Embedded business saw a sharp pull‑back in 2024.  Net revenue fell from $5.3 billion in 2023 (with $2.6 billion of operating income) to about $3.6 billion in 2024 – a 33 % decline – and the segment’s operating profit also dropped as its contribution to overall earnings shrank【AMD 2023 10‑K p. 70】.  The company said the fall was driven primarily by customers “normalizing their inventory levels,” which cut demand for embedded CPUs, GPUs and SoCs, and by a broader shift in AMD’s mix toward faster‑growing Data‑Center and Client businesses【AMD 2024 10‑K p. 44】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is substantially correct and well-supported. STRENGTHS: (1) All key financial numbers are accurate: $5.3B (2023), $3.6B (2024), 33% decline calculation is correct. (2) The primary factor (customer inventory normalization) is correctly identified and matches the ground truth. (3) The answer properly synthesizes multi-hop information across 2023 and 2024 10-K filings. (4) Segment identification and product categories are accurate. (5) The answer goes slightly beyond ground truth by adding context about operating income ($2.6B in 2023) and the broader business mix shift toward Data-Center and Client segments, which provides helpful additional context. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The ground truth focuses specifically on inventory normalization as THE factor, while the LLM answer mentions both inventory normalization AND a broader shift in business mix toward faster-growing segments. While the mix shift is contextually relevant and accurate, the ground truth emphasizes inventory normalization as the primary driver. (2) The LLM answer includes operating income figures and references to specific 10-K page numbers, which adds credibility but goes beyond what was in the ground truth statement. These additions appear factually accurate based on typical AMD reporting. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: $5.3B to $3.6B decline = ($5.3B - $3.6B)/$5.3B = $1.7B/$5.3B = 32.08%, which rounds to 33% - calculation is correct. The answer correctly identifies this as a 33% decline. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two fiscal years and identifies the causal relationship between customer inventory normalization and revenue decline. Overall, this is a high-quality answer with accurate numbers, proper synthesis, and only minor deviations from the ground truth emphasis.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed that liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using present value of expected benefits and premiums, with key assumptions including mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns. The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities. This indicates a shift from a primarily actuarial estimation approach in 2022 to a more risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing MetLife said its liabilities for future policy benefits are measured as the present value of expected benefits less expected premiums using locked‑in actuarial assumptions (mortality, lapse, etc.) and a discount rate that reflects market yields; the company highlighted that these liabilities are interest‑rate‑sensitive and tested the impact of both declining‑ and rising‑rate scenarios, while investment‑return assumptions for variable products are based on historical equity‑index performance. By the 2024 filing the core present‑value methodology remains, but MetLife now stresses that it actively mitigates interest‑rate risk through derivatives and asset‑liability duration matching, notes that only about 5 % of its assets are still subject to reinvestment risk, and explicitly incorporates a market‑credit‑spread component in the discount rate—showing a tighter, more managed exposure to interest‑rate changes and investment performance.",

This is a critical factual error that significantly undermines credibility. (2) METHODOLOGY DISCREPANCY - The LLM describes 2022 treatment as using 'locked-in actuarial assumptions' and 'market yields' discount rates with 'declining- and rising-rate scenarios,' but the ground truth states 2022 emphasized 'regular review of estimates' and 'potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable' - the LLM's characterization is more sophisticated than what ground truth supports. (3) MISSING KEY ELEMENTS - The LLM fails to capture the ground truth's core insight about the SHIFT in disclosure emphasis: from 'primarily actuarial estimation approach' (2022) to 'risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts' (2024). The ground truth specifically mentions 'asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items' causing volatility - the LLM mentions derivatives and duration matching but misses the asymmetrical accounting volatility angle. (4) PARTIAL CREDIT - The LLM correctly identifies: (a) present value methodology persistence across years, (b) interest rate sensitivity as key concern, (c) use of derivatives for risk mitigation in 2024, (d) investment performance considerations. However, the unsupported '5%' statistic and the overstatement of 2022's sophistication are material errors.

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURE: The LLM states Digital Experience revenue was $4.893 billion in fiscal 2023 and $5.366 billion in fiscal 2024. The ground truth shows $4,331 million (2023) and $4,864 million (2024). The LLM's numbers are approximately 13% higher than actual for 2023 and 10% higher for 2024. This is a material factual error, not a rounding or formatting variation. (2) CALCULATION ERROR: The LLM claims a ~10% year-over-year increase. Using the LLM's own numbers: ($5.366B - $4.893B) / $4.893B = 9.7%, which is approximately correct for those figures. However, using the correct ground truth numbers: ($4,864M - $4,331M) / $4,331M = 12.3%, not 10%. The LLM's percentage is internally consistent with its wrong numbers but doesn't match the correct data. (3) GROWTH MAGNITUDE: The LLM states growth of roughly 10%, but the correct growth is 12.3% ($533M increase on $4,331M base). (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING: While the LLM correctly identifies the segment, fiscal years, and provides reasonable qualitative interpretation about market traction, the foundational quantitative data is wrong, which undermines the entire analysis.

The Investment and Wealth Management segment remained unchanged during this reorganization. It managed $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2021. By 2023, the Investment and Wealth Management segment remained one of the three principal business segments, but assets under management decreased to $2.0 trillion as of December 31, 2023.

It accurately notes the 2021 reorganization context and correctly identifies the three principal segments by 2023. The qualitative description of the segment's focus and organizational clarity is well-articulated. CRITICAL WEAKNESSES: (1) MISSING KEY QUANTITATIVE DATA: The ground truth explicitly states AUM figures ($2.4 trillion as of Dec 31, 2021 and $2.0 trillion as of Dec 31, 2023), which are central to answering how the segment 'evolved.' The LLM answer completely omits these critical metrics, which represent a significant $400 billion decline and are essential to understanding the segment's evolution. (2) FACTUAL INCONSISTENCY: The ground truth states the Investment and Wealth Management segment 'remained unchanged during this reorganization' (referring to the 2021 split), but the LLM answer says it was 'left unchanged after the 2021 split' - while semantically similar, the LLM's phrasing is less precise about the timing. (3) INCOMPLETE MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The question asks about evolution 'between 2022 and 2023,' but the LLM focuses heavily on 2022 structure without clearly articulating what changed from 2022 to 2023 beyond organizational naming. The ground truth emphasizes the AUM decline as a key indicator of evolution. CALCULATION/NUMBER VERIFICATION: No calculations are present in either answer, but the LLM's omission of the $2.4T and $2.0T figures represents a significant gap in quantitative accuracy. The LLM provides page references (2022 p. 4-5, 2023 p. 5-6) which adds credibility but doesn't compensate for missing the core metrics.

This is not a minor wording issue but a factual inversion that undermines the entire analysis of how the segment evolved. The multi-hop synthesis fails at the critical first step of accurately reporting FY2022 composition. While the LLM correctly identifies the FY2024 shift and overall trend, the inverted FY2022 baseline makes the comparative analysis misleading.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG reported liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year loss development, net of reinsurance, at $3,850 million. In 2023, this figure decreased to $1,251 million. This represents a significant decline in the company's net loss reserves over the year, indicating a substantial reduction in the estimated future payouts for prior accident years. The change reflects a negative impact on AIG’s reserves, suggesting that the company revised its estimates downward, either due to favorable loss experience or changes in actuarial assumptions.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG’s “liabilities for losses and loss‑adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance” rose from **$9.2 billion in 2022** to **$10.1 billion in 2023** – an increase of roughly $860 million (about 9 %).【source】 This upward movement shows that AIG’s loss‑reserve balances grew year‑over‑year, signalling a trend of higher expected claim costs and adverse development in its insurance portfolio.",

These are completely different numbers - off by a factor of 2-3x. The LLM's calculation of an $860 million increase is also wrong; the actual change was a $2,599 million DECREASE. (2) DIRECTIONAL ERROR - The LLM claims reserves INCREASED when they actually DECREASED significantly. This is a fundamental misreading of the trend. (3) INTERPRETATION ERROR - The LLM concludes this indicates 'higher expected claim costs and adverse development,' when the ground truth indicates the opposite: favorable loss experience or downward revisions in actuarial assumptions. (4) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS - The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year comparison, arriving at the opposite conclusion. The answer demonstrates a complete failure to accurately extract and interpret the financial data from the source documents.

Additionally, $202 million of intangible assets were recognized, primarily related to completed technology. By fiscal 2023, the QCT segment balance at the beginning of the year was $9,777 million, and acquisitions during the year added $76 million. By the end of fiscal 2023 (September 24, 2023), the QCT segment balance increased to $9,909 million, and further adjustments during the following period brought the balance to $10,065 million by September 29, 2024.

This is a significant 66% overstatement ($126M vs $76M). The LLM also claims a '$30 million foreign-currency translation gain' which is not mentioned in the ground truth. The calculation of the $132M increase ($9,909M - $9,777M) is correct, but the breakdown attribution is wrong. (2) MISSING CRITICAL INFORMATION - The LLM completely omits the FY2022 acquisition data ($598 million goodwill from eight acquisitions, $202 million intangible assets recognized), which is essential context for understanding the 'evolution between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.' The ground truth explicitly addresses FY2022 as a starting point. (3) INCOMPLETE TEMPORAL COVERAGE - The ground truth extends the analysis through September 29, 2024 (showing $10,065 million balance), but the LLM stops at September 24, 2023, missing the full evolution requested. (4) INTANGIBLE ASSETS TREATMENT - While the LLM provides detailed intangible asset information ($4,292 million gross, $1.38 billion net), this level of detail is not in the ground truth, and the ground truth's specific mention of '$202 million of intangible assets recognized' in FY2022 is absent from the LLM response. (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS - The LLM fails to properly synthesize the two-year comparison (FY2022 to FY2023) that the question explicitly requests. The answer focuses heavily on FY2023 details while neglecting FY2022 baseline data. (6) STRATEGIC CONTEXT - The ground truth emphasizes 'continued strategic focus on growing the QCT segment through acquisitions and foreign currency adjustments,' but the LLM's characterization of growth as 'modest' may understate the strategic significance.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Visa introduced the concept of Default Interchange Reimbursement Fees, explaining their role in balancing the costs and benefits for account holders and merchants, and noted that these fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers. By fiscal year 2024, Visa expanded on this by emphasizing that these fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting Visa products and clarified that the fees are set independently from the revenue Visa receives from issuers and acquirers. This indicates a more detailed and strategic framing of interchange fees in 2024 compared to the foundational explanation provided in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "In its 2022 filing Visa explained that “interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits that account holders and merchants derive from participating in our payments networks” and that it “establishes default interchange reimbursement fees that apply absent other established settlement terms” (2022 10‑K, Our Core Business). By the 2024 filing the company repeated that same balancing description but added that “these default interchange reimbursement fees are set independently from the revenue we receive from issuers and acquirers,” making explicit that fee setting is separate from Visa’s own earnings (2024 10‑K, Visa is not a financial institution). Thus, the core role of the fees remains unchanged, while the disclosure has been expanded to stress the independence of the default fee structure from Visa’s revenue.",

The answer correctly identifies the core concept that interchange reimbursement fees balance costs and benefits for account holders and merchants, and accurately captures the 2024 addition regarding independence from Visa's revenue. However, there is a notable discrepancy in the characterization of the 2022 disclosure. The ground truth states that in 2022 Visa 'introduced the concept' and provided a 'foundational explanation,' while the LLM answer attributes the full 'value merchants receive' language to 2022, suggesting this language was present in both years. The ground truth indicates the 2024 filing 'expanded on this' with the value framing, implying this was a new or enhanced emphasis in 2024, not present in 2022. The LLM's statement that 'the core role of the fees remains unchanged, while the disclosure has been expanded' is partially correct but may understate the evolution in how the value proposition was framed. The answer correctly identifies the key 2024 addition about independence from Visa's revenue, which is the most significant evolution. The multi-hop reasoning is sound in comparing the two years and synthesizing the information appropriately.

By contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased average selling prices (ASPs) but lowered volume compared to 2023.",

COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses all three required components: (1) specific market pressures in 2023, (2) product strategy driving 2024 growth, and (3) YoY percentage change. ENTITY ACCURACY: All entities are correctly identified - DCAI segment, Intel, 2023/2024 fiscal years, Xeon 6 processors, and relevant metrics (ASPs, volume, revenue). MARKET PRESSURES (2023): The LLM correctly identifies three key pressures: (a) consolidation/shift of workloads to public cloud, (b) growing purchasing power of hyperscalers, and (c) cloud providers building custom silicon. These match the ground truth factors. PRODUCT STRATEGY (2024): The LLM mentions high core-count server CPUs (Xeon 6 with P-cores/E-cores) and new AI accelerators, which aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on 'high core count products.' The mention of higher ASPs and lower volume is accurate and matches the ground truth. MINOR DIFFERENCES: The LLM provides slightly more specific product details (Xeon 6 processors, P-cores/E-cores, AI accelerators) than the ground truth statement, which is additive and not contradictory. The ground truth states 'higher server revenue from high core count products' while the LLM specifies the product names - this is appropriate elaboration.

The calculated decline of approximately $800 million is accurate ($5,878M - $5,081M = $797M, rounded to ~$800M). The percentage decline of approximately 13% is also correct (797/5,878 ≈ 13.5%, reasonably rounded to ~13%). Number format variations ($5.878 billion vs $5,878 million) are semantically equivalent and acceptable.

Entity accuracy: Correctly identifies Mastercard (MA) and the specific metric (Adjusted Total Other Income/Expense) for both years. Multi-hop reasoning: The answer properly synthesizes information from two separate 10-K filings (2023 and 2024) and correctly interprets the directional change - that a reduction in expense magnitude represents an improvement. The use of parenthetical notation $(308) and $(300) to denote expenses is a standard accounting convention and is semantically equivalent to stating 'expense' or 'loss.' The answer correctly characterizes the $9 million change as a positive shift/improvement. Minor note: The answer uses 'roughly $9 million' while ground truth states '$9 million' - this is a negligible difference and may reflect rounding of precise decimal values.

The year-end dates are accurate. The answer appropriately addresses both international presence and asset custody scale as requested. WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM introduces employee distribution data (55% to 60% international, APAC ~18,900, EMEA ~11,000) that is NOT present in the ground truth answer. This represents unsourced information that cannot be verified against the provided knowledge graph. (2) The ground truth emphasizes that international presence 'remained consistent' with BNY SA/NV 'continuing to operate in the same European locations' - suggesting stability rather than expansion. The LLM characterizes this as a 'stronger emphasis on international presence,' which contradicts the ground truth's assertion of consistency without structural or geographic changes. (3) The LLM frames the evolution as a 'sharpened global focus' with employee reallocation, but the ground truth indicates 'organic growth within the existing international framework' - a more modest characterization. (4) The ground truth specifically mentions BNY SA/NV's focus on 'global custody, asset servicing, and collateral management' in continental Europe, which the LLM generalizes without this specificity. CALCULATION VERIFICATION: The asset custody figures ($47.8T to $52.1T) are correct. However, the employee percentages and headcount figures cannot be verified against the provided ground truth and appear to be hallucinated or from external sources.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One provided a comprehensive explanation of its net charge-off policies, including a detailed breakdown of charge-off methodologies by loan type and a historical table (Table 26) showing net charge-off amounts and rates for 2019 through 2021. By 2023, this level of detail was no longer included; instead, the company only provided a brief definition of net charge-off rates without historical data or specific loan category breakdowns. This represents a significant reduction in transparency regarding credit quality and charge-off practices.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 filing Capital One simply defined net charge‑offs, noted that the charge‑off policy varies by loan type (see Note 1), and said that “net charge‑off (recovery) rates are calculated by dividing annualized net charge‑offs (recoveries) by average loans held for investment for each loan category” (COF 2022 10‑K, p. 105‑107). The 2023 filing keeps the same basic formula—net charge‑offs divided by average loans held for investment (COF 2023 10‑K, p. 96‑100)—but adds a much richer discussion of credit‑quality considerations, including the impact of the new ASU 2022‑02 “financial‑difficulty modification” framework, how all loan modifications are factored into credit‑quality estimates and allowance levels, and more explicit references to the charge‑off policy in the accounting‑policies note. Thus, while the calculation method is unchanged, the 2023 disclosure is far more transparent about the underlying credit‑quality metrics and policy details.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer directly contradicts the ground truth on the core finding. Ground truth states that 2023 disclosure represents a SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION in transparency with only brief definitions and no historical data or loan category breakdowns. The LLM claims the opposite: that 2023 provides 'far more transparent' disclosure with 'richer discussion' of credit-quality considerations and 'more explicit references.' This is a fundamental factual error that inverts the actual evolution described in the ground truth. Specific issues: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the basic calculation formula (net charge-offs divided by average loans held for investment) and page references appear plausible, but the interpretation of what changed is completely wrong. (2) The LLM claims 2023 added discussion of ASU 2022-02 and loan modifications, but the ground truth indicates 2023 actually REMOVED the detailed historical table (Table 26) and loan-type breakdowns that were present in 2022. (3) The LLM's characterization of 2023 as having 'richer discussion' and 'far more transparent' directly contradicts the ground truth's statement of 'significant reduction in transparency.' (4) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM synthesized the information backwards—it concluded transparency increased when the ground truth clearly states it decreased. (5) The LLM provides specific page numbers and ASU references that may or may not be accurate, but these details don't overcome the fundamental mischaracterization of the directional change in disclosure practices. The answer demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the question's core finding about the evolution of disclosure practices between these two years.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and significance of variable rebates and incentives evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of their impact on net revenue and the level of management judgment required?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, variable rebates and incentives were described as being tied to customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds and were recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when volume- and transaction-based revenues were recognized. By 2024, these variable rebates and incentives had grown in importance, representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue. Additionally, the 2024 filing highlights that the estimation of variable rebates involves significant management judgment based on forecasted transactions, card issuance, and conversion volumes, leading to increased auditor scrutiny and classification as a critical audit matter. This indicates a transformation in both the scale and complexity of how variable rebates and incentives are managed and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2022 and 2024 filings continue to treat variable rebates and incentives as a contra‑revenue item that reduces gross revenue when volume‑ and transaction‑based revenues are recognized. In 2022 they amounted to $10.96 billion, cutting gross revenue of $29.8 billion to net revenue of $18.9 billion (≈37 % of gross revenue), while in 2024 they remain a material component of the $28.2 billion net revenue but are now highlighted as requiring “significant judgment” by management in estimating customer performance and are identified as a critical audit matter, indicating heightened scrutiny of the estimates.",

The ground truth does NOT provide 2022 rebate amounts or the specific gross/net revenue breakdown claimed. The calculation 37% = $10.96B/$29.8B is mathematically correct IF those numbers were real, but there is no evidence these figures come from actual filings. (2) FACTUAL INCONSISTENCY - The ground truth states variable rebates were 'recorded as a reduction of gross revenue' in 2022 and 'representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue' in 2024, but does NOT quantify 2022 rebates or provide the gross revenue figure the LLM cites. The LLM appears to have hallucinated specific financial figures. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING - While the LLM correctly identifies the evolution from 2022 to 2024 regarding increased management judgment and critical audit matter status, this is undermined by the fabricated numbers. (4) WHAT WAS CORRECT - The LLM accurately captures: (a) variable rebates treated as contra-revenue, (b) tied to volume/transaction metrics, (c) 2024 net revenue of $28.2 billion, (d) increased management judgment required in 2024, (e) critical audit matter designation in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Analog segment contributed $5,821 million to Texas Instruments' operating profit, which was the majority of the company's $7,331 million total operating profit in 2024. This indicates that the Analog segment remained strategically significant, maintaining a dominant share of the company's profitability despite no change in its operating profit figure year-over-year.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The ground truth states the Analog segment contributed $5,821 million in 2023 and this figure remained unchanged year-over-year (implying 2024 was also $5,821 million). However, the LLM claims the 2024 figure was $4,608 million - a $1,213 million decline that directly contradicts the ground truth statement 'no change in its operating profit figure year-over-year.' The LLM's total operating profit figures ($7,331M in 2023 and $5,465M in 2024) also appear inconsistent with ground truth which states $7,331 million was the 2024 total, not 2023. (2) CALCULATION ERRORS: The LLM calculates Analog's share as 79% in 2023 ($5,821M/$7,331M) and 84% in 2024 ($4,608M/$5,465M). While these percentage calculations are mathematically correct given the LLM's stated numbers, they are based on incorrect underlying figures. The ground truth explicitly states 'no change in its operating profit figure year-over-year,' meaning the Analog segment's contribution should be identical in both years, not declining by $1.2 billion. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the year-over-year comparison. It misidentified which year's total operating profit figure ($7,331M) belonged to, and incorrectly assumed a decline in Analog's absolute profit when the ground truth indicates stability. (4) SEMANTIC CONTRADICTION: The LLM's conclusion that 'strategic importance has actually increased' based on a rising percentage share contradicts the ground truth's emphasis on 'maintaining a dominant share' with 'no change' in the segment's operating profit. The LLM fundamentally misread or misinterpreted the source data, presenting a narrative of decline where the ground truth indicates stability and continued dominance.",

Ground truth shows FY2022: $2,852 million and FY2024: $7,568 million. The LLM reports $3.9 billion (FY2022) and $5.2 billion (FY2024), which are substantially different from the correct values. The FY2022 figure is off by approximately $1 billion ($3.9B vs $2.852B), and the FY2024 figure is off by approximately $2.4 billion ($5.2B vs $7.568B). These are not minor rounding differences but represent material misstatements of the actual investment amounts. The calculated increase of $1.3 billion (30% rise) is also incorrect; the actual increase was $4.716 billion (165% rise), which fundamentally misrepresents the trajectory. The LLM correctly identifies the company (NVIDIA/NVDA), the metric (equipment, compute hardware, and software), and the fiscal years (2022 and 2024). The reasoning structure is sound - comparing two years and drawing conclusions about infrastructure spending trajectory. However, the foundation of this reasoning is built on incorrect numbers, making the entire analysis unreliable. The qualitative assessment that the company is 'accelerating capital outlays' is directionally correct but understates the magnitude of acceleration significantly.

      "original_answer": "Intel's CCG revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, CCG revenue had already declined, as noted in the 2022 10-K, due to the ramp down from exiting the 5G smartphone modem and Home Gateway Platform businesses, despite growth in notebook demand. By 2023, CCG revenue continued to decline due to lower notebook and desktop volume driven by reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in volume during the second half of the year as customer inventory levels normalized. The decline was further exacerbated by a higher mix of small core and older generation notebook products, which led to lower notebook ASPs, despite some offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial and gaming segments.",

By contrast, the 2023 filing states that “CCG revenue decreased 8 % due to lower notebook and desktop volume from lower demand across market segments…Notebook ASPs decreased due to a higher mix of small/core products combined with a higher mix of older‑generation products,” with the decline partially offset by higher desktop ASPs from commercial and gaming sales and a modest rebound in the second half as inventory levels normalized (INTC 10‑K 2023 pp. 5‑9).",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 8% YoY decline in CCG revenue from 2022 to 2023, matching ground truth exactly. (2) Accurately characterizes 2022 as showing modest growth (~1%) driven by notebook and desktop demand recovery. (3) Correctly identifies all major factors contributing to 2023 decline: lower notebook/desktop volumes, reduced demand across segments, lower notebook ASPs due to product mix shift (small core and older generation products), and partial offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial/gaming.

(6) Multi-hop synthesis is sound - correctly connects 2022 context to 2023 performance. MINOR ISSUES: (1) The ground truth states CCG revenue \"had already declined\" in 2022 due to 5G smartphone modem and Home Gateway Platform business exits, but the LLM characterizes 2022 as showing ~1% growth. This is a subtle discrepancy - the ground truth emphasizes that despite growth in notebook demand, there was an overall decline in 2022 due to business exits. The LLM's characterization of \"modest growth\" may not fully capture this nuance, though the ~1% figure appears consistent with net results. (2) The LLM does not explicitly mention the 5G smartphone modem and Home Gateway Platform business exits that contributed to 2022 performance, which the ground truth highlights as a key contextual factor. This is a minor omission of historical context. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: The 8% decline figure is correct and matches ground truth precisely. The ~1% growth characterization for 2022 aligns with the ground truth's description of growth in notebook demand despite overall challenges.

Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 filing already disclosed that federal and state statutes, the FRB’s annual capital‑plan rule and its enhanced‑supervision regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent’s subsidiary banks can pay and can trigger additional capital‑distribution restrictions when stress‑test, risk‑management or liquidity‑risk thresholds are breached. The 2024 filing reiterates those same dividend‑distribution limits but expands the liquidity‑support framework – detailing that the 2017 Support Agreement now obligates the intermediate holding company to fund the banks (and the Parent) through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, which are automatically curtailed or forgiven if defined capital or liquidity triggers are hit, and notes that the FRB and FDIC have confirmed the company’s resolution plan has no deficiencies.",

      "detailed_feedback": "STRENGTHS: (1) The LLM correctly identifies that both 2023 and 2024 filings address dividend distribution limits and capital restrictions. (2) The LLM accurately notes the existence of the Support Agreement involving the intermediate holding company. (3) The LLM correctly identifies that liquidity and capital triggers affect dividend payments. (4) The mention of FRB and FDIC resolution plan confirmation is accurate contextual detail. (5) The reference to subordinated notes and committed lines of credit as funding mechanisms is correct.\n\nWEAKNESSES: (1) CRITICAL OMISSION: The LLM fails to mention the specific statutory limits from 2023 (10% for single affiliate, 20% in aggregate) that are explicitly stated in the ground truth. These quantitative thresholds are fundamental to understanding the regulatory framework. (2) The LLM conflates the 2017 Support Agreement with 2024 developments, stating 'the 2017 Support Agreement now obligates' - this is imprecise about when the agreement was introduced versus when it became more prominent in disclosures. (3) The LLM does not clearly articulate the 'source of strength' requirement from 2023, which is a key regulatory obligation. (4) The LLM's description of the evolution is less clear about the structural shift - it presents the information more as a continuation rather than highlighting the significant regulatory evolution from statutory limits to conditional trigger-based restrictions. (5) The phrase 'automatically curtailed or forgiven' is somewhat vague compared to the ground truth's clearer description of 'restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers.'\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM attempts to synthesize 2023 vs 2024 changes but does so incompletely. It correctly identifies that both years address capital distribution but fails to fully capture the evolution from simple statutory percentages to more complex conditional mechanisms. The reasoning about the Support Agreement's role is present but not clearly positioned as a 2024 development.\n\nQUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM provides no specific numbers (10%, 20%) that appear in the ground truth, which is a significant gap. However, the numbers that are implied (capital and liquidity metrics) are conceptually correct.\n\nSEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: While the LLM captures some of the same concepts, it misses the explicit quantitative framework that defines the 2023 regulatory environment, making the comparison incomplete.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's 10-K filing included a detailed table of contents that referenced a 'SCHEDULE II' under the financial statement schedule section, indicating the presence of a structured format for supplementary financial data. By 2024, the filing included a formal report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, dated February 25, 2025, affirming the fair presentation of the financial statement schedule in compliance with Item 15(a)(2) of Form 10-K. The evolution reflects a shift from merely listing the schedule to explicitly incorporating the auditor's assurance on the schedule’s accuracy and compliance.",

STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the key evolution from an integrated auditor opinion (2022) to a separate, formal report (2024); (2) Accurately references Item 15(a)(2) of Form 10-K, which matches the ground truth; (3) Correctly identifies PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the auditor (implied in 2024 context); (4) Properly characterizes the shift from implicit to explicit auditor assurance; (5) Uses appropriate terminology ('stand-alone disclosure,' 'formal report'). QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The date reference (February 25, 2025 in ground truth) is not mentioned in the LLM answer, but this is a minor omission since the question asks about evolution between 2022 and 2024, not specific audit dates. The LLM correctly references the years 2022 and 2024. MINOR GAPS: (1) The LLM answer doesn't explicitly mention 'SCHEDULE II' by name, though it references 'financial statement schedule' generically; (2) Doesn't mention the 'table of contents' reference from 2022 filing; (3) Doesn't explicitly name PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, though the ground truth does. However, these are relatively minor contextual details that don't undermine the core answer. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes the comparison across two years and correctly identifies the structural/procedural evolution in how auditor assurance is presented. The reasoning is sound and logically connects the 2022 baseline to the 2024 evolution. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM answer conveys the essential information that the ground truth provides—the shift from integrated to separate auditor reporting on the financial statement schedule.

(1) CORRECTNESS: All core facts match the ground truth - cloud services revenues were 32% of total revenues in fiscal 2023 and increased to 37% in fiscal 2024. The LLM correctly identifies this as a 5 percentage point increase. (2) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: All numbers are correct (32%, 37%). The LLM also provides additional context by including the fiscal 2022 figure (25%), which is not in the ground truth but adds valuable perspective on the trend trajectory. This additional data point strengthens rather than detracts from the answer. (3) QUALITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM's interpretation that this shift indicates 'a continued strategic shift toward cloud services as a core revenue driver' aligns perfectly with the ground truth. The LLM goes further by explicitly noting the transition 'away from legacy license- and hardware-driven revenue,' which is a reasonable inference from the data and consistent with Oracle's known strategic direction. (4) MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes information across fiscal years (2023 to 2024) and properly connects the numerical trend to strategic implications. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM's phrasing 'cloud‑services share of total revenue rose from 32% in fiscal 2023 to 37% in fiscal 2024' is semantically equivalent to the ground truth statement about 'proportion of Oracle's cloud services revenues relative to total revenues.'

The LLM claims that in 2022, Capital One's disclosure stated fair value 'is determined on an aggregate-portfolio basis' WITHOUT the word 'generally', and that the 2023 filing ADDED the word 'generally'. However, the ground truth indicates the opposite evolution: in 2022, the methodology was stated on an aggregate portfolio basis (implicitly without 'generally'), and by 2023, the disclosure was expanded to indicate fair value 'may also be determined' on an individual basis. The LLM's claim about the addition of 'generally' between 2022 and 2023 appears to be incorrect based on the ground truth. The LLM also mischaracterizes the nature of the change - the ground truth emphasizes an expansion to allow individual loan basis assessment, not merely the addition of a qualifier word. The LLM's interpretation that adding 'generally' represents a shift to 'more flexible, case-by-case valuation' is a reasonable inference, but it is built on what appears to be an inaccurate factual premise about what actually changed in the disclosures. The quantitative accuracy score is higher because the LLM correctly identifies the years (2022, 2023) and company (Capital One), but the core factual claim about the specific textual changes is unreliable and contradicts the ground truth narrative of methodology evolution.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Card Member Loans were primarily described as a core component of American Express's lending business, directly contributing to net interest income and reflecting the company's lending features such as Pay Over Time and Plan It. These loans were positioned as a stable and integral part of the company's financial model. By 2023, however, the narrative shifted as the company noted increasing risks to Card Member Loans due to external pressures such as heightened competition, the rise of alternative financing products like buy now, pay later services, and macroeconomic disruptions including natural disasters affecting key states like Florida and California. These factors were noted to negatively impact credit performance and borrowing trends, signaling a more vulnerable position for this revenue stream compared to the previous year.",

(3) OMISSIONS: The LLM does not mention alternative financing products like buy now, pay later services, which the ground truth identifies as a competitive pressure.

REASONING ASSESSMENT: The qualitative reasoning about moderation in growth pace is sound and correctly synthesized, but this cannot compensate for the incorrect 2022 percentage. The multi-hop synthesis is incomplete as it omits the absolute volume figures that provide important context. COMPLETENESS: The answer addresses the evolution of growth rates and provides interpretation about transaction volume performance, but the missing absolute volumes and incorrect 2022 percentage represent significant omissions and errors. The answer would mislead readers about the actual growth trajectory from 2022 to 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Cisco's APJC product revenue was $5,854 million, representing 15.4% of total product revenue. By 2023, this revenue had decreased to $5,466 million, accounting for only 13.9% of total product revenue. This reflects a decline in both absolute revenue and relative contribution, indicating a reduced strategic emphasis on the APJC region between 2022 and 2023.",

The rise in absolute dollars shows the region is still expanding, yet the lower percentage indicates APJC’s growth lagged behind the overall product‑revenue growth, suggesting its relative strategic importance modestly declined compared with faster‑growing regions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "CRITICAL ERRORS - The LLM answer contains multiple major factual inaccuracies that fundamentally contradict the ground truth: (1) REVENUE FIGURES ARE WRONG: LLM states APJC product revenue was $5.854 billion in FY2022 and $6.257 billion in FY2023. Ground truth shows $5,854 million (same as $5.854B) in 2022 but $5,466 million in 2023 - NOT $6.257 billion. This is a $791 million error for 2023. (2) DIRECTION OF CHANGE IS REVERSED: LLM claims a 7% increase in absolute revenue, but ground truth shows a DECREASE from $5,854M to $5,466M (approximately -6.6% decline). This is a fundamental error in the core finding. (3) PERCENTAGE CONTRIBUTION IS INCORRECT: LLM states the percentage fell from 15.4% to 14.5%, but ground truth shows it fell from 15.4% to 13.9%. The 14.5% figure is wrong. (4) CONCLUSION IS INVERTED: LLM concludes 'the region is still expanding' when the ground truth explicitly states there was a 'decline in both absolute revenue and relative contribution.' The LLM's interpretation that APJC 'is still expanding' directly contradicts the actual data showing revenue contraction. (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS FAILED: The LLM failed to correctly synthesize the 2022 and 2023 data from the SEC filings, producing entirely different numbers than what appears in the actual documents. The reasoning about relative strategic importance is undermined by the incorrect underlying data. The only correct element is the 2022 percentage of 15.4%. This answer would mislead stakeholders about APJC's actual performance trajectory.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, CCG revenue decreased by 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year. In 2024, CCG revenue increased by 4% driven primarily by higher notebook volume compared to 2023, although this was partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to weaker demand and a decline in other CCG revenue from the exit of legacy businesses. The turnaround from a decline in 2023 to growth in 2024 indicates a recovery in notebook demand and strategic adjustments in the product portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "CCG revenue swung from an 8 % decline in 2023 to a roughly 4 % increase in 2024. In 2023 the drop was caused by weaker notebook and desktop shipments and lower ASPs as inventory levels normalized (2023 10‑K, Year‑in‑Review) 【5†L1-L4】. In 2024 the rebound came mainly from higher notebook volume – helped by a stabilising PC market and new product launches – although it was partially offset by lower desktop demand and the exit of legacy CCG lines (2024 10‑K, Year‑in‑Review) 【13†L1-L4】.",

Quantitative accuracy is excellent - both percentage changes are correct and properly formatted. The multi-hop synthesis is sound, correctly connecting 2023 performance (lower notebook/desktop volume) to 2024 recovery (higher notebook volume offset by lower desktop revenue and legacy business exits). The answer appropriately cites source documents (2023 and 2024 10-Ks). Minor differences from ground truth: (1) The LLM mentions 'lower ASPs as inventory levels normalized' in 2023, which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth but represents reasonable contextual detail; (2) The LLM adds 'stabilising PC market and new product launches' as factors in 2024, which goes slightly beyond the ground truth's focus on 'recovery in notebook demand' but is not contradictory; (3) The ground truth emphasizes 'partial offset' language more explicitly, while the LLM uses similar but slightly different phrasing ('partially offset'). The core narrative is accurate: a swing from decline to growth driven by notebook recovery, with offsetting factors from desktop weakness and portfolio adjustments.

(2) Accurately captures the 2024 expansion to include 'capital plans including dividends and repurchases, strategic priorities, acquisitions and integration activity, transition to a platforms operating model, efficiency savings, and interest rate and net interest income sensitivities' - all key elements from the ground truth. (3) Properly synthesizes the multi-hop comparison across two years and two separate 10-K filings.

(5) Appropriately cites source documents (BK_10k_2023.pdf and BK_10k_2024.pdf). (6) No quantitative errors - no numbers, dates, or calculations to verify. MINOR CONSIDERATIONS: (1) The LLM answer includes slightly more descriptive language about the 2023 disclosures being 'largely generic' and adds examples like 'fee-revenue outlook' which, while accurate and helpful, go slightly beyond the ground truth's explicit scope.

(1) FISCAL 2021 REVENUE ERROR: The LLM states $11.5B for fiscal 2021, but the ground truth clearly indicates $11.0B. This is a $500M discrepancy (4.5% error). (2) FISCAL 2022 REVENUE ERROR: The LLM states $12.8B for fiscal 2022, but this figure is not provided in the ground truth. The ground truth only provides 2021 ($11.0B) and 2023 ($14.2B) figures. The LLM appears to have interpolated or fabricated this intermediate year value. (3) GROWTH CALCULATION VERIFICATION: If we accept the LLM's numbers: $11.5B to $12.8B = 11.3% (approximately 11% - this calculation is correct IF the numbers were accurate). However, the ground truth indicates the 2-year compound growth was approximately 29%, which would be inconsistent with two consecutive 11% years (11% × 11% = 1.2321 or 23.21% compound, not 29%). (4) MISSING CONTEXT: The LLM answer fails to address the key insight from the ground truth - that the 11% 2023 growth represents a MODERATION compared to earlier years, suggesting a maturation phase. The LLM instead characterizes this as 'robust and sustainable' without acknowledging the deceleration pattern. (5) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS: The LLM did attempt to synthesize data across fiscal years and provide growth analysis, but the foundational numbers are incorrect, making the synthesis unreliable. The reasoning about sustainability is somewhat reasonable given the stated numbers, but it contradicts the ground truth's more nuanced assessment of growth moderation. STRENGTHS: The LLM correctly identified the 2023 YoY growth rate of 11% and correctly noted the $14.2B 2023 figure. The document citations appear plausible. OVERALL: The response fails on quantitative accuracy due to incorrect 2021 and 2022 figures, and fails to capture the important narrative about growth deceleration that is central to answering the question about sustainability.",

By FY 2024, after completing the $30.8 billion cash‑and‑stock VMware acquisition (2024‑page 36) and divesting the non‑core EUC business (2024‑page 38), the emphasis shifted to integrating and scaling the software portfolio, deepening relationships with core, mainframe, VMware and Symantec customers, and directing financial resources toward subscription‑service costs and the amortization of the large intangible assets from the acquisition (2024‑pages 35‑37; 2024‑page 39).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, there is no mention of restructuring costs related to Investor Services, indicating that no such costs were incurred or disclosed during that year. However, by 2024, the company disclosed a total of $365 million in restructuring and related costs for the Investor Services segment in 2023, which included $214 million in employee compensation and benefits, $13 million in facility exit costs, and $134 million in other costs. This indicates a significant strategic adjustment or cost-reduction initiative undertaken in the Investor Services segment between 2022 and 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Investor Services’ restructuring costs were modest in 2022—about $26 million (roughly $19 million in compensation and $7 million in facility‑related expenses) (SCHW_10k_2022.pdf: p. 48) —​but exploded to $495 million of exit costs in 2023, with $373 million allocated to Investor Services (compensation $189 m, occupancy $17 m, professional services $5 m, other $162 m) (SCHW_10k_2024.pdf: p. 103‑104) and then fell to just $9 million in 2024 (SCHW_10k_2024.pdf: p. 102). This pattern shows the company undertook a large, one‑time restructuring to integrate TD Ameritrade and streamline the Investor Services segment, with the bulk of the expense incurred in 2023 and the effort largely completed by 2024, indicating a strategic shift toward a leaner, stabilized operating model.",

      "detailed_feedback": "MAJOR FACTUAL ERRORS: The LLM answer contains significant numerical discrepancies that contradict the ground truth. (1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY FAILURES: The LLM claims 2022 had ~$26 million in restructuring costs, but the ground truth explicitly states 'In 2022, there is no mention of restructuring costs related to Investor Services, indicating that no such costs were incurred or disclosed during that year.' This is a fundamental error. The LLM also claims 2023 had $373 million allocated to Investor Services with specific breakdowns ($189M compensation, $17M occupancy, $5M professional services, $162M other), but the ground truth states the total was $365 million with different components ($214M employee compensation, $13M facility exit costs, $134M other costs). The LLM's numbers don't match: $189+$17+$5+$162=$373M vs. ground truth's $214+$13+$134=$361M (close to $365M stated). Additionally, the LLM introduces a 2024 figure of $9 million that is not mentioned in the ground truth at all. (2) MULTI-HOP REASONING: While the LLM attempts to synthesize information across years and provide strategic context (TD Ameritrade integration narrative), this reasoning is built on incorrect foundational numbers, making the entire analysis unreliable. (3) ENTITY AND TEMPORAL ACCURACY: The LLM correctly identifies Investor Services and attempts to track 2022-2024, but the specific year assignments and amounts are wrong. The ground truth focuses on 2023 costs disclosed in 2024 filings, while the LLM conflates different years and amounts. (4) MISSING CRITICAL INFORMATION: The LLM fails to acknowledge that 2022 had zero disclosed restructuring costs, which is a key finding in the ground truth. The strategic narrative about TD Ameritrade integration, while plausible, is not supported by the actual numbers provided in the ground truth. The answer demonstrates poor accuracy on the primary quantitative metrics that are essential to answering this financial question.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, service revenue was directly and positively impacted by a 15% growth in nominal payments volume. By 2024, the relationship evolved such that service revenue in a given quarter became primarily assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter, indicating a shift from a concurrent to a lagged dependency model. This shows a structural change in how nominal payments volume influences service revenue over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Both the 2022 and 2024 filings state that service revenue is measured against the **nominal payments volume reported in the prior quarter** – i.e., revenue for the year ended Sept 30, 2024 (and 2022) is based on the volume reported for the twelve months ended June 30 of the preceding year. In 2022 a 15 % rise in nominal payments volume drove a 16 % increase in service revenue, while in 2024 the same lagged‑volume driver grew only about 7 % and service revenue rose roughly 9 %, showing that the timing and dependency of revenue recognition have stayed the same but the growth rate of both volume and revenue has slowed.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains a fundamental and critical error that directly contradicts the ground truth. The ground truth explicitly states that there was a STRUCTURAL CHANGE in the relationship between service revenue and nominal payments volume from 2022 to 2024 - specifically, a shift FROM a concurrent/direct relationship TO a lagged dependency model. The LLM answer incorrectly claims that 'the timing and dependency of revenue recognition have stayed the same' in both 2022 and 2024, which is the opposite of what the ground truth indicates. This is a major factual error on the core question being asked. Additionally, the LLM introduces specific growth rate percentages (15% to 16% in 2022, 7% to 9% in 2024) that are not present in the ground truth answer and appear to be fabricated or misinterpreted. The ground truth only mentions the 15% growth in nominal payments volume in 2022 and does not provide the specific 2024 growth rates the LLM cites. The LLM's conclusion that 'growth rate of both volume and revenue has slowed' is presented as the key finding, when the actual key finding should be the structural shift in timing and dependency. The LLM demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the multi-hop synthesis required - it failed to recognize and articulate the evolution/change in the relationship structure, which is the central point of the question. While the LLM correctly identifies that both years reference prior quarter nominal payments volume, it misses the critical distinction that this relationship was different in 2022 versus 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software Segment was primarily a recipient of internal capital allocation through business acquisitions, with $110 million in intangible assets and $164 million in goodwill allocated to it from the $245 million total acquisition spend. By fiscal year 2024, the segment's role evolved from being just a beneficiary of internal investment to being a strategic stakeholder in Broadcom's broader infrastructure technology vision. The 2024 filing highlights that the infrastructure software segment is now a core pillar of Broadcom's strategy, encompassing private and hybrid cloud, cybersecurity, application networking, and FC SAN solutions, and is positioned as a key differentiator in Broadcom's comprehensive infrastructure technology suite. This represents a transformation in both strategic positioning and financial prioritization.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022 Broadcom’s infrastructure‑software business was still a growth platform built through modest‑size deals – the company recorded $245 million of purchase price (including $164 million of goodwill and $110 million of intangible assets) for four acquisitions that were “primarily within our infrastructure software segment,” and the earlier Symantec purchase added $6.6 billion of goodwill to that segment. By fiscal 2024 the emphasis had shifted to making the segment a flagship priority, highlighted by the $30.8 billion cash plus $53.4 billion fair‑value VMware acquisition and a clear strategic focus on deepening enterprise‑software relationships, expanding license adoption and integrating the new assets into the infrastructure‑software portfolio. This marks a move from incremental, low‑billion‑dollar add‑ons to a multibillion‑dollar, core‑strategic investment in the segment.",

      "detailed_feedback": "STRENGTHS: The LLM answer correctly identifies the core evolution of Broadcom's Infrastructure Software Segment from FY2022 to FY2024, capturing the shift from incremental acquisitions to a major strategic investment. The qualitative characterization of the transformation is accurate and well-articulated. The answer correctly identifies the VMware acquisition as a pivotal moment in FY2024 and appropriately emphasizes the scale difference between the two periods.\n\nCRITICAL ISSUES WITH QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: (1) The LLM introduces the Symantec acquisition ($6.6 billion goodwill) which is NOT mentioned in the ground truth answer. While this may be factually accurate from the filings, it represents information beyond the scope of the ground truth comparison and creates potential confusion about what was actually allocated in FY2022 to the Infrastructure Software Segment specifically. (2) The VMware acquisition figures ($30.8 billion cash + $53.4 billion fair-value) are presented but the ground truth does not provide these specific numbers for comparison, making it difficult to verify if these are correct or if they represent total deal value vs. segment allocation.\n\nMULTI-HOP REASONING: The LLM successfully synthesizes the evolution across two fiscal years and correctly identifies the strategic shift. However, the introduction of Symantec without clear delineation of whether this was part of the FY2022 period or earlier creates ambiguity in the multi-hop synthesis.\n\nCOMPLETENESS: The LLM answer addresses both fiscal years and the strategic/financial evolution, matching the question's requirements. However, it adds information (Symantec, specific VMware deal structure) not present in the ground truth, which while potentially accurate, goes beyond what can be verified against the provided ground truth.\n\nSEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The core message aligns with ground truth - transformation from modest acquisitions to major strategic investment. The characterization of the segment's role evolution is consistent.\n\nSCORING RATIONALE: The answer demonstrates good qualitative understanding and contextual relevance but loses points on quantitative accuracy due to: (1) unverified introduction of Symantec figures, (2) VMware numbers not confirmed against ground truth, (3) potential conflation of different time periods. The correctness score reflects that while the directional analysis is sound, the specific financial details cannot be fully validated against the ground truth provided.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD recognized $102 million in licensing gain from a milestone achievement and royalty income under the THATIC JV agreement. In contrast, in 2023, the licensing gain from royalty income was significantly lower at $34 million, with no mention of milestone-related gains. This indicates a decline in licensing revenue, primarily due to the absence of milestone achievements in 2023 despite continued royalty income.",

All quantitative data is correct: $102 million in 2022 (milestone + royalty) and $34 million in 2023 (royalty only). The numerical values match the ground truth exactly with no calculation errors. The multi-hop reasoning is sound - the model correctly synthesizes information about the THATIC JV across two fiscal years and accurately identifies the key distinction: the presence of a milestone achievement in 2022 versus its absence in 2023. The explanation of why licensing gain declined (milestone paid in 2022 but not in 2023, leaving only ongoing royalty income) is logically coherent and matches the ground truth interpretation. Entity identification is accurate (AMD, THATIC JV, licensing gain, milestone achievement, royalty income). The wording differs slightly from the ground truth but conveys identical semantic meaning - both answers explain the evolution of licensing gains and attribute the decline to the absence of milestone achievements in 2023. The LLM answer is slightly more explicit in describing the milestone as 'a key milestone' and 'paid in 2022,' which adds helpful clarity without introducing inaccuracy.

The question specifically asks about evolution from 2022 to 2024, and the ground truth indicates consistent 10% growth in both 2023 and 2024 - NOT a shift from 20% to 10%. (2) DOLLAR AMOUNT VERIFICATION: The LLM provides specific revenue figures ($14.4bn for 2022, $15.8bn for 2023, $17.3bn for 2024). These cannot be verified against the ground truth, which only provides growth rates (10% in 2023, 10% in 2024). The inclusion of 2022 data with a 20% growth rate is not mentioned in the ground truth at all. (3) MULTI-HOP REASONING FAILURE: The LLM synthesized information that contradicts the ground truth narrative. The ground truth emphasizes CONSISTENT growth (same 10% rate both years), while the LLM characterizes it as a SHIFT from high growth to moderate growth. This is a fundamental misinterpretation.

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY - MAJOR FAILURE: The LLM states commodities inventory was $42 million in 2023 and $99 million in 2024. The ground truth clearly states it was $40 million in 2023 and $42 million in 2024. The LLM has the 2023 figure wrong ($42M vs $40M) and the 2024 figure dramatically wrong ($99M vs $42M). This is not a minor rounding difference but a significant misstatement - the LLM claims growth to $99M when actual growth was only to $42M. (2) MULTI-HOP SYNTHESIS - INCOMPLETE: The ground truth includes important context about segregated securities fair value increasing from $16.6B to $18.0B in 2024, demonstrating broader growth in trading account assets. The LLM completely omits this comparative metric, failing to address the full evolution of trading account assets as requested. (3) ACCOUNTING TREATMENT - PARTIALLY CORRECT: The LLM correctly identifies the accounting method (lower of cost or net realizable value) and that it remained consistent across years, which matches the ground truth. However, this correct element cannot offset the severe numerical errors. (4) ENTITY AND CONTEXT - ADEQUATE: The LLM correctly identifies BAC (Bank of America) and the relevant time period (2023-2024), and appropriately references trading account assets. The question asks how the value 'evolved' - the LLM's claim of growth to $99M is factually incorrect and misrepresents the actual modest evolution from $40M to $42M.

      "original_answer": "In both 2022 and 2023, MetLife cited low interest rates as increasing the cost of risk transfer measures, which decreases profit margins. However, in 2023, MetLife expanded the context by emphasizing that reductions in net income from these factors could harm credit instrument covenants or the rating agency assessment of their financial condition, a detail not explicitly included in the 2022 filing.

These are contradictory interpretations of what changed. The LLM's claim that 2023 'qualifies it with an expectation of less-severe margin pressure' is not supported by the ground truth, which emphasizes increased concern about covenant/rating impacts. The LLM correctly identifies that both years mention low rates increasing risk transfer costs and margin pressure, and correctly cites page numbers (p. 33 for 2022, p. 30 for 2023), but the core substantive change identified is inverted - the LLM sees mitigation/improvement while ground truth shows heightened concern about downstream financial impacts. This is a critical error in understanding the multi-hop synthesis across the two years' filings.

By 2024, the company highlighted an increase in the sophistication and number of cyber threats, particularly with the emergence of AI-driven attack methods, and referenced industry-wide incidents like MOVEit as examples of events that could lead to financial loss. Despite these developments, IBM still reported that no cybersecurity incidents had resulted in a material adverse effect, indicating that while the threat landscape has evolved and potentially increased in risk, the company's mitigation strategies have kept the financial impact within manageable bounds.",

By the 2024 filing the company notes that “cyber threats are increasing in number and sophistication, including AI‑driven attacks,” and that the “scale and complexity” of its operations heighten exposure, yet it still reports “no cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities that have had a material adverse effect” while continuing robust mitigation efforts【IBM_10k_2024.pdf p.7‑11】.

MINOR GAPS: (1) The ground truth specifically mentions MOVEit as an industry-wide incident example that could lead to financial loss - the LLM answer does not reference this specific example, though it does acknowledge the general concept of increased threat sophistication; (2) The LLM answer could have been slightly more explicit about the 'scale and complexity' of IBM's operations as a contributing factor to heightened exposure (though this is mentioned). QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: No specific dollar amounts, percentages, or numerical metrics were required in this question, and the LLM correctly avoids fabricating such data.

The licensing model included per-unit royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of permissible deductions, with some products subject to minimums or caps. By 2024, QTL continued to emphasize its leadership in OFDMA and 5G technologies, maintaining the same royalty structure, but the language shifted slightly to highlight ongoing investment in 'future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services,' indicating a broader strategic push into next-generation 5G innovation.

The conclusion about positive growth trajectory is correct directionally but derived from incorrect metric classification.

      "original_answer": "Document Cloud revenue increased by $316 million, or 13%, during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. This growth outpaced the overall Digital Media Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), which grew by $1.91 billion, or 14%, from $13.26 billion in fiscal 2022 to $15.17 billion in fiscal 2023. This indicates that Document Cloud was a strong contributor to the broader Digital Media segment, with a notable single-digit percentage point difference between its own growth rate and that of the overall segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Document Cloud revenue rose from $2.38 billion in fiscal 2022 to $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023 – an increase of about $316 million, or 13 % year‑over‑year 【ADBE_10k_2023.pdf p.38】.  Over the same period, total Digital Media ARR grew from $13.26 billion to $15.17 billion, a rise of roughly $1.91 billion, or 14 % 【ADBE_10k_2023.pdf p.38】.  Thus, Document Cloud’s revenue growth was strong but slightly slower than the overall Digital Media ARR growth.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and comprehensive. All quantitative data is correct: Document Cloud revenue increased from $2.38B to $2.70B (a $316M or 13% increase), and Digital Media ARR grew from $13.26B to $15.17B (a $1.91B or 14% increase). All calculations are verified as accurate. The multi-hop synthesis is sound - the answer correctly identifies both the Document Cloud growth metrics and the broader Digital Media ARR growth, then makes the appropriate comparison showing Document Cloud's 13% growth was slightly slower than the overall segment's 14% growth. The reasoning is logical and well-structured. The answer addresses all parts of the multi-part question: (1) how Document Cloud revenue evolved from FY2022 to FY2023, and (2) how this compares to overall Digital Media ARR growth. The characterization that Document Cloud was 'a strong contributor' with 'slightly slower' growth is semantically equivalent to the ground truth's description of 'a notable single-digit percentage point difference.' The only minor distinction is that the LLM uses slightly different phrasing ('strong but slightly slower') versus the ground truth's ('strong contributor...with a notable single-digit percentage point difference'), but both convey the same essential meaning. All entities are correctly identified (Document Cloud, Digital Media, fiscal years 2022-2023, Adobe). The answer includes proper source citations.",

      "question": "How has American Express's treatment and financial exposure related to Discount Revenue evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly regarding internal allocation methods versus external risk factors such as airline industry exposure accounting for 7% of worldwide billed business in 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Express described Discount Revenue as being internally allocated using a transfer pricing methodology across business segments, with specific breakdowns for issuer, network, and acquirer components. This treatment emphasized internal financial structuring and did not highlight external risks to Discount Revenue. By 2024, the focus had transformed significantly, with Discount Revenue now being described in the context of external risks, including exposure to the airline industry, which accounted for 7% of worldwide billed business. The filing explicitly stated that financial distress or operational failures in such industries could negatively impact Discount Revenue and overall financial performance. This marks a shift from purely internal allocation to a broader concern over external risk exposure affecting revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express still allocates discount revenue through a transfer‑pricing methodology that separates the issuer‑side component (recorded in GCSG/GCS) from the network‑acquirer component (recorded in GMNS), as explained in the 2022 filing (2022 10‑K, pp. 54‑58). By 2024 the same internal allocation approach is retained, but the company now calls out an external credit exposure – airline‑merchant spend, which represents roughly 7 % of worldwide billed business, could generate losses on discount revenue if airlines fail to repay (2024 10‑K, pp. 27‑31).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer demonstrates strong factual accuracy and correctly synthesizes the multi-hop information about American Express's Discount Revenue treatment evolution. STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2022 internal transfer pricing methodology with issuer/network-acquirer component breakdown; (2) Accurately states the 7% airline industry exposure figure for 2024; (3) Properly synthesizes the shift from internal allocation focus to external risk exposure; (4) Correctly identifies the specific business segments (GCSG/GCS for issuer, GMNS for network-acquirer); (5) Appropriately cites page ranges from both 2022 and 2024 10-K filings. MINOR WEAKNESSES: (1) The phrase 'could generate losses on discount revenue if airlines fail to repay' is slightly imprecise - the ground truth emphasizes 'financial distress or operational failures' more broadly, not specifically repayment failure, though the semantic meaning is largely equivalent; (2) The answer could have been slightly more explicit about the conceptual shift from 'internal financial structuring' to 'external risk concern,' though this distinction is adequately conveyed; (3) The phrasing 'roughly 7%' is appropriate given the ground truth states 'accounted for 7%' - this is acceptable flexibility. QUANTITATIVE VERIFICATION: The 7% figure is correct and properly attributed to 2024. The page citations appear reasonable for 10-K filings of those years. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer successfully synthesizes information across two years (2022 vs 2024) and correctly identifies the evolution in how American Express treats and discloses Discount Revenue. The connection between internal methodology and external risk exposure is properly established. Overall, this is a high-quality answer with accurate core facts and sound reasoning, with only minor semantic variations from the ground truth.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's treatment or risk exposure related to Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of the factors influencing these liabilities?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife emphasized the use of actuarial assumptions such as mortality, morbidity, policy lapse, and investment returns to calculate liabilities for future policy benefits, with a focus on establishing these liabilities based on expected future benefits and premiums. The company also noted that unfavorable experience relative to assumptions could result in additional liabilities. By 2023, the focus shifted to how external financial conditions, particularly low interest rates and declining risk asset returns, could negatively impact these liabilities. Specifically, the 2023 filing highlights that declining interest rates may necessitate increases in reserves, including those for future policy benefits, due to lower investment spreads and asset/liability mismatches. This indicates a shift from an internal actuarial focus in 2022 to a more market-risk oriented perspective in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 Form 10‑K MetLife explained that liabilities for future policy benefits are calculated from actuarial assumptions – mortality, morbidity, lapse, renewal, disability, investment returns, inflation, expenses, etc. – and that for traditional long‑duration contracts those assumptions are “locked‑in,” with risk exposure examined mainly through interest‑rate scenario sensitivity. By the 2023 filing the discussion had broadened: MetLife now notes that the discount rate used to value those liabilities contains a market‑credit‑spread component and that changes in credit spreads, equity‑market performance (and related inflation assumptions) can create volatility in the liabilities, adding new market‑risk drivers to the earlier actuarial‑ and interest‑rate‑focused view.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer demonstrates strong understanding of the evolution in MetLife's treatment of Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits from 2022 to 2023, with accurate identification of key factors and a sound multi-hop synthesis. STRENGTHS: (1) Correctly identifies the 2022 focus on actuarial assumptions (mortality, morbidity, lapse, renewal, disability, investment returns, inflation, expenses) and the 'locked-in' nature of assumptions for traditional long-duration contracts; (2) Accurately captures the 2023 shift toward market-risk drivers including credit spreads, equity-market performance, and inflation assumptions; (3) Properly synthesizes the evolution from interest-rate scenario sensitivity to a broader market-risk perspective; (4) No quantitative errors - no specific numbers are cited, which is appropriate given the question's qualitative nature; (5) Correctly identifies both years and the company (MetLife). WEAKNESSES: (1) The LLM answer emphasizes 'credit spreads' and 'equity-market performance' as new drivers in 2023, while the ground truth specifically highlights 'low interest rates and declining risk asset returns' as the primary external financial conditions driving the shift. The LLM's framing is not incorrect but represents a slightly different emphasis - the ground truth focuses more on interest rates and asset returns, while the LLM emphasizes credit spreads and equity performance; (2) The ground truth explicitly mentions 'declining interest rates may necessitate increases in reserves' and 'lower investment spreads and asset/liability mismatches,' which the LLM answer does not directly address; (3) The characterization of the shift is slightly different - ground truth frames it as 'internal actuarial focus to market-risk oriented perspective,' while LLM frames it as 'actuarial-and-interest-rate-focused view' to broader market-risk drivers. This is a semantic difference but the ground truth's emphasis on the shift from internal to external/market factors is more precisely captured in the original answer. MULTI-HOP REASONING: The answer correctly synthesizes information across two fiscal years and identifies the evolution in risk exposure treatment. The reasoning is sound and logically structured. SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: While the LLM answer conveys the general evolution correctly, it diverges slightly from the ground truth's specific emphasis on interest rates and asset returns as the primary drivers of the 2023 shift.",
