(1) All factual information is accurate: Tesla's Total Automotive Revenues increased from $71.462 billion in 2022 to $82.419 billion in 2023, resulting in an increase of $10.957 billion, which aligns with the ground truth's $10,957 million (equivalent). The percentage growth is correctly stated as 15%, matching the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the difference ($82.419B - $71.462B = $10.957B) is mathematically correct, and the percentage growth ((10.957 / 71.462) * 100 ≈ 15%) is accurate. Format variations (billion vs. million) are acceptable and correctly interpreted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—revenue figures for two consecutive years are correctly identified, compared, and used to compute both absolute and percentage growth. (4) The answer addresses both parts of the question: the dollar increase and the percentage growth. Entity accuracy is confirmed: Tesla, 'Total Automotive Revenues', and the years 2022–2023 are all correctly referenced.

      "question": "What was the financial impact of the Optane inventory impairment on Intel's non-GAAP gross margin percentage in 2022, and how does this adjustment help in evaluating the company's operating performance?",
      "original_answer": "The Optane inventory impairment in 2022 had a 1.1% impact on Intel's non-GAAP gross margin percentage. This adjustment helps in evaluating the company's current operating performance by excluding charges that do not reflect ongoing operations, thereby facilitating a more accurate comparison to past operating results.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2022 Optane inventory write‑down was reflected as a **1.1 percentage‑point adjustment** to gross margin, raising Intel’s non‑GAAP gross‑margin to **47.3 %** (versus a GAAP gross‑margin of 42.6 %)【page_49†L13-L19】.  By stripping out this impairment—an item management says “does not reflect our current operating performance”【page_48†L7-L11】—the non‑GAAP margin shows the core profitability of the business, giving investors a clearer view of operating results without the distortion of a one‑time charge.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the 1.1 percentage-point impact on non-GAAP gross margin is correctly stated, and the additional context—non-GAAP gross margin of 47.3% vs. GAAP of 42.6%—is factually consistent and adds precision without contradicting the original answer. These figures are correctly attributed to the Optane impairment adjustment. (2) The entity (Intel), event (Optane inventory impairment), and year (2022) are all correct. (3) The reasoning is sound: the answer correctly explains that the adjustment excludes non-recurring charges to reflect core operating performance, which matches the ground truth's rationale. It even strengthens the explanation by quoting management's view (from cited pages), enhancing qualitative accuracy. (4) The only minor deviation is that the original answer does not mention the specific GAAP and non-GAAP margin percentages (47.3% and 42.6%), so while the LLM provides extra detail, it does not misstate anything—the 1.1% impact is correctly framed as the adjustment size. This additional detail improves contextual relevance without compromising correctness. Thus, the answer is semantically equivalent and factually precise, meriting a 9/10 for correctness (perfect on quantitative and contextual scores, near-perfect on qualitative due to slightly expanded detail not in ground truth but still accurate).",

The percentage change for NextEra is accurately described as 'about 3 percent,' which aligns with the ground truth 3.05% (rounded appropriately). FPL's 0% change is correctly noted. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth in amount and date. The calculation of the increase ($2,534M - $2,459M = $75M) is correct, and the approximate percentage (3%) is a reasonable rounding of 3.05%. No formatting issues. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between NextEra Energy and its subsidiary FPL, and synthesizes data across entities and years appropriately. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more concise wording.

In contrast, Automotive Sales increased by $11,299 million, or 17%, from $67,210 million in 2022 to $78,509 million in 2023.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the dollar and percentage changes for both Automotive Leasing and Automotive Sales from 2022 to 2023, matching the ground truth in all key figures. The leasing revenue decrease of $356 million (from $2,476M to $2,120M) is accurately reported as a 14% decline. The Automotive Sales increase of $11,299 million (from $67,210M to $78,509M) is correctly rounded to $11.3 billion and 17% growth. (2) All calculations are accurate: $2,476M - $2,120M = $356M (14.37% ≈ 14%), and $78,509M - $67,210M = $11,299M (16.81% ≈ 17%). The LLM uses rounded values ($2.48B instead of $2.476B, $67.2B instead of $67.210B, $78.5B instead of $78.509B), but these are acceptable format variations that do not affect factual accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two revenue streams and two years, compares their trends, and draws a valid contrast between declining leasing revenue and growing sales revenue. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing all parts of the question. The only minor limitation is the omission of the concluding interpretive sentence present in the original answer (about core sales growing while leasing declined), but this does not detract from factual correctness.

Over the same period, the interest income from collateralized agreements increased by $3,490 million (from $16,405 million in 2023 to $19,895 million in 2024).

The original answer uses millions (e.g., $373,119 million), while the LLM uses billions ($373.1 billion), which is a valid and equivalent representation. The calculated differences are accurate: 391,063 - 373,119 = 17,944 million ($17.944 billion ≈ $17.9 billion); 19,895 - 16,405 = 3,490 million ($3.49 billion ≈ $3.5 billion). Minor rounding is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth when accounting for rounding and unit conversion. Calculations are correct, and the comparison between the two increases is properly framed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two years and two financial metrics (average balance and interest income), then compares their changes. The conclusion that the balance increase was 'far larger' than the income increase aligns with the ground truth's statement that the balance increase was 'significantly larger in dollar terms'.

However, the calculated year-over-year change is incorrect. The actual difference is $104.7M - $94.9M = $9.8M decrease, but the ground truth states the change is a decrease of $8.0 million, indicating a discrepancy either in source data or calculation. The LLM computes the correct arithmetic difference ($9.8M), but this contradicts the ground truth's stated $8.0M decline, suggesting either an error in the knowledge graph or in the LLM's source data. (2) Number verification: reported balances are accurate; calculation of $104.7M - $94.9M = $9.8M is mathematically correct, but conflicts with the expected $8.0M change. This raises a red flag in quantitative accuracy despite internal consistency. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: the model correctly synthesizes data across two fiscal periods and identifies the correct metric (fair value of U.S. government treasury securities as long-term investments), demonstrating sound reasoning. (4) Scores justified as: correctness 6 due to conflict between accurate input values and incorrect final delta compared to ground truth; quantitative accuracy 5 because the calculation is correct but result mismatches ground truth; qualitative accuracy 7 due to correct entity and period identification; contextual relevance 10 as all information provided is directly relevant and well-structured.",

The cited percentages (18% of $379M and 20% of $346M) do not align with the actual data. (2) Calculations are also wrong: the LLM reports a $1 million decrease, while the correct year-over-year decrease is $35 million ($51M - $16M). These errors invalidate the quantitative accuracy.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect in terms of factual content. According to the ground truth, long-lived assets in Taiwan increased by $5 million (from $313M to $318M), but the LLM claims they fell by $71M (from $588M to $517M). Similarly, in the United States, the ground truth shows a decrease of $99M (from $1,540M to $1,441M), but the LLM reports a much smaller decrease of $15M (from $55M to $40M). These numbers are not only wrong but also inconsistent with the actual scale of assets in each region. (2) All calculations are incorrect: the LLM computes a $71M drop for Taiwan (vs. actual $5M increase) and a $15M drop for the U.S. (vs. actual $99M drop). The cited values for asset levels in both countries are factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely — the model did not correctly identify or synthesize data across fiscal years and geographies. It incorrectly concludes that both regions saw declines, while in reality, Taiwan saw a small increase and the U.S. a large decrease. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the answer attempts to address the right question structure (comparing changes in long-lived assets over two years in two regions), and cites a page reference. However, the factual inaccuracies render the response highly misleading. Scores reflect near-total failure in quantitative and qualitative accuracy, with minimal credit for attempting the correct question type.",

However, the specific line item attributed to this change is incorrect. The ground truth states that the primary driver was a decline in 'Net losses on sales or disposals of assets' from $131.3 million to $17.9 million, whereas the LLM incorrectly identifies 'impairment charges' as the main contributor, citing a drop from $200.0 million to $68.6 million. This misidentifies both the line item and the actual amounts involved. (2) While the overall expense figures ($370.7 million in 2023 and $74.1 million in 2024) are consistent with a $296.6 million decrease and thus calculationally correct, the component figures for impairment charges do not align with the ground truth and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly synthesize the actual line item responsible for the change. It focuses on impairment charges instead of net losses on asset disposals, indicating a failure in accurately retrieving or mapping the relevant financial metric across years. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the structure of the question—providing a total decrease and a purported driver—but the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies in the key explanatory component significantly undermine the correctness. Hence, the correctness score is low due to a critical factual error in the primary explanatory element.",

The ground truth states that LOW financed $9,573 million and paid $10,474 million in 2023, resulting in a $901 million reduction. The LLM claims $12.159 billion was financed and $12.176 billion was paid—values that are over $2.5 billion higher than the correct figures. These numbers do not match the ground truth in magnitude or in the resulting net change. (2) The quantitative accuracy is very low: $12.159 billion ≠ $9,573 million (off by ~$2.6 billion), and $12.176 billion ≠ $10,474 million (off by ~$1.7 billion). The calculated difference of $17 million more paid is also incorrect—the actual difference is $901 million reduction due to more being paid than financed. The direction of the net change is correct (more paid than financed), but the magnitude is wildly off. (3) The qualitative reasoning shows understanding of the required comparison (financed vs. paid) and the concept of net change, and correctly identifies LOW and fiscal 2023. However, it fails on multi-hop synthesis: either the source data is incorrect or misattributed, and the model does not align with the verified knowledge graph.

The shortfall is correctly calculated as approximately $200 million, which aligns with the exact $201 million difference in the ground truth—this minor rounding is acceptable. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: values match across formats (billion vs. million), and the comparison and implied calculation (2,518 - 2,317 = 201) are sound. (3) The reasoning is logically sound: the model correctly infers that the plan was underfunded because obligations exceeded assets, demonstrating proper multi-hop synthesis between asset value and ABO.

It claims IBM had $0.0 allowance for inventory losses at the end of both 2020 and 2021 with no activity, directly contradicting the ground truth which states there was an increase of $123 million driven by $240 million in additions and $118 million in write-offs during 2021. All key financial figures are wrong. (2) The ground truth specifies a $123 million net increase calculated as $240M (additions) - $118M (write-offs), but the LLM reports zero across all categories, indicating a total failure in quantitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model fails to perform the required multi-hop synthesis of additions and write-offs to determine net change, instead asserting no activity occurred. It also contradicts documented financial activity. (4) The answer receives the lowest scores because it is factually false, contains no correct numerical or qualitative information, and fails to address the core of the question. The citation to 'page_32' does not justify the inaccuracies, suggesting either misreading or hallucination of source material.",

The U.S. operations attribution is given as $13.9 billion (vs. $13,947 million actual), and Non-U.S. as $5.9 billion (vs. $5,948 million actual). These are accurate to the nearest tenth of a billion, representing acceptable rounding. (2) All numeric values are factually correct within reasonable approximation; no calculation errors are present. The sum of $13.9B + $5.9B = $19.8B, which is within rounding tolerance of the total. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is synthesized across two different sections (pages 215 and 239), correctly attributing total income and its breakdown by geography. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with minor rounding but no loss of meaningful accuracy. The contextual relevance is perfect, addressing both parts of the question.

According to the ground truth, the total financial impact was $1,167 million, composed of a $787 million loss on deconsolidation and a $380 million write-off of receivables. However, the LLM incorrectly reports a $407 million loss on deconsolidation and a $380 million receivable write-off, summing to a total of $787 million — which reverses the actual components and underreports the total impact by $380 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $407 million loss on deconsolidation is incorrect (should be $787 million), and while the $380 million receivable write-off is accurate, the total pre-tax impact of $787 million is wrong (should be $1,167 million). The calculation itself (407 + 380 = 787) is mathematically correct but based on incorrect inputs. (3) The reasoning is flawed in multi-hop synthesis: the model fails to correctly identify and combine the two components from the source data, misattributing the values and thus failing to reflect the true financial impact. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses the right company (Linde), year (2022), event (deconsolidation of Russian business), and types of charges (loss on deconsolidation and receivable write-off) — but the incorrect numbers undermine factual correctness.

It also accurately includes the $286 million net release of the sales return reserve, which is a key component. All numeric values are correct and properly contextualized. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both dollar amounts ($12.72 billion and $286 million) are reported accurately with acceptable formatting (e.g., $286 million vs $286M). No calculation errors. (3) The qualitative reasoning is strong—multi-hop synthesis is evident in linking increased deliveries to cost components and referencing specific cost drivers. The LLM includes all major cost components from the ground truth: direct/indirect materials, labor, manufacturing overhead (including depreciation), shipping/logistics, vehicle connectivity, electricity and Supercharger infrastructure allocations. However, it adds 'larger warranty reserves and inventory write-downs'—a detail not present in the original answer—which slightly deviates from the source. While plausible, this addition introduces information not confirmed in the ground truth, slightly reducing qualitative accuracy. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent: the answer directly addresses both parts of the question—quantifying the impact and listing contributing cost components—with precise and relevant details. The minor over-addition of warranty and write-downs prevents a perfect 10 on correctness, but overall the answer is factually sound, complete, and well-supported.",

Over the same period, COP's undeveloped bitumen reserves increased by 28 million barrels (from 89 million barrels at the end of 2022 to 117 million barrels at the end of 2023). This indicates that while bitumen production nearly doubled, undeveloped reserves also increased, suggesting a strategic replenishment of reserves alongside production growth.",

In the same period, undeveloped bitumen reserves grew from 89 million barrels to 117 million barrels, a rise of about 28 million barrels【page_145】, so the overall bitumen increase far outpaced the modest gain in undeveloped reserves.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the production volume numbers. According to the ground truth, COP's bitumen production was 127 million barrels at the end of 2022 and 293 million barrels at the end of 2023, resulting in an increase of 166 million barrels. However, the LLM reports 216 million barrels in 2022 and 410 million barrels in 2023, yielding an incorrect increase of 194 million barrels. This misstatement affects the core quantitative claim of the answer. In contrast, the undeveloped bitumen reserves are correctly reported as increasing from 89 million to 117 million barrels (a 28 million barrel increase), which matches the ground truth. (2) The calculation for reserves is accurate, but the production volume calculation is wrong due to incorrect input values. The difference of 194 million barrels (410 - 216) is mathematically correct based on the cited numbers, but those numbers do not reflect the actual data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to compare production growth with reserve growth, which aligns with the question’s intent. However, because the production figures are incorrect, the conclusion that 'bitumen increase far outpaced the modest gain in undeveloped reserves' is based on flawed data and thus misleading. The ground truth shows a substantial but less extreme production increase (166M) relative to reserve growth (28M), while the LLM exaggerates the scale of production growth. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent of the response match the question, and the correct document page is cited. However, the quantitative inaccuracy in the primary metric (production volumes) severely undermines the correctness score, warranting a 4. The qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct identification of entities and comparison logic, but flawed data limits reasoning quality.",

The 'Thereafter' period impact is reported as $3.7 million instead of $3,694 million, again misrepresenting the scale. (2) The individual yearly figures from the ground truth (-$1,920M, -$1,041M, etc.) are completely missing in the LLM answer, and the sum is grossly incorrect. The LLM appears to have either misread the units (e.g., treating thousands as millions) or pulled data from an incorrect source. The correct sum of the annual impacts is -$1,252 million, not -$19.1 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly aggregate the annual impacts over 2022–2026 and does not accurately contrast them with the 'Thereafter' period. While it recognizes a negative-to-positive shift, the magnitude of the effect is so distorted that the conclusion lacks validity. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the right question structure (comparing near-term negative impact to long-term positive), so relevance is moderate.

      "original_answer": "Schwab's exclusion of amortization of acquired intangible assets increases the adjusted net income used in the calculation of return on tangible common equity, which is defined as annualized adjusted net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Management considers this adjustment useful because acquisitions result in significant goodwill and acquired intangible assets, which affect the balance sheet composition. By excluding these items, investors can better assess capital efficiency and returns relative to the ongoing operations of the business, rather than being influenced by non-recurring or non-operational accounting impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "By removing the amortization of acquired intangible assets (and related acquisition costs) from net income, Schwab’s “adjusted net income” is higher; that higher numerator is then divided by average tangible common equity — common equity less goodwill, net acquired intangibles and the related deferred‑tax offset — to produce a non‑GAAP return on tangible common equity that is materially higher than the GAAP return on equity.

(1) It correctly explains that excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets increases adjusted net income, which serves as the numerator in return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), leading to a higher non-GAAP ROTCE compared to GAAP ROE. This matches the original answer’s explanation. (2) There are no specific numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, years) in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly links the exclusion of amortization to adjusted net income, identifies the denominator (average tangible common equity) as common equity minus goodwill, acquired intangibles, and deferred-tax liabilities, and explains management’s rationale—assessing ongoing operational efficiency free from acquisition-related accounting effects. (4) The LLM adds slight precision by mentioning the deferred-tax offset and characterizing the metric as non-GAAP, which is consistent with SEC filings and enhances clarity. The only minor gap is that it does not explicitly state that acquisitions affect balance sheet composition (a point in the original), but this does not detract from the core explanation.

      "question": "How did the decline in gross profit rate for Walmart's International segment in fiscal 2023 impact its segment operating income, and what were the key drivers behind this margin compression?",
      "original_answer": "The decline in gross profit rate for Walmart's International segment by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 contributed to a decrease in segment operating income by $0.8 billion compared to the previous fiscal year. This margin compression was primarily driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China, as well as category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. These factors directly pressured profitability, illustrating the financial impact of strategic and operational shifts in Walmart's international markets.",
      "llm_answer": "The International segment’s gross‑profit rate slipped 50 basis points in fiscal 2023, helping drive a $0.8 billion drop in segment operating income to $2.965 billion (down from $3.758 billion in FY 2022)【page_43†L13-L20】.  The compression was caused mainly by the continued expansion of lower‑margin formats and channels—especially in China—and a shift in the product mix toward lower‑margin categories, which also lifted operating‑expense ratios as reorganization and restructuring charges were incurred【page_43†L21-L27】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the 50 basis point decline in gross profit rate and the $0.8 billion decrease in operating income, matching the ground truth exactly. It also accurately references the drop from $3.758 billion to $2.965 billion, which aligns with the $0.8 billion difference (within rounding). These numbers are factually correct and properly contextualized.\n\n2) Quantitatively, all figures are accurate: the 50 bps decline, the $0.8B impact, and the implied prior-year operating income ($3.758B) and current-year figure ($2.965B) are consistent with the ground truth. The calculation of the difference (~$793M) is approximately $0.8B, acceptable due to rounding.\n\n3) The key drivers—expansion of lower-margin formats/channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories—are fully consistent with the ground truth. The LLM adds a detail about rising operating-expense ratios due to reorganization and restructuring charges, which is not in the original answer. While this additional detail may be present in the cited document (page 43), it was not part of the ground truth synthesis and slightly extends beyond the provided answer. This does not make the response incorrect but introduces a minor over-specification.\n\n4) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: linking the margin decline to the operating income drop and identifying strategic drivers in international markets, particularly China. The answer addresses both parts of the question: the financial impact and the causes of margin compression. The added detail on restructuring charges slightly exceeds the scope of the original answer but does not contradict it.\n\nOverall, the answer is factually correct, well-supported, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, warranting a high score with only a minor deduction in qualitative accuracy for the slight expansion beyond the original answer’s scope.",

The calculated percentage changes—17.6% for operating income and 11.9% for net income—are accurate and match the ground truth. Minor rounding approximations (≈18%, ≈12%) are noted but do not detract from correctness. (2) All numbers and calculations are factually correct. The percentage change in operating income is (7,070 - 6,012) / 6,012 ≈ 17.6%, and for net income, (2,735 - 2,444) / 2,444 ≈ 11.9%, both correctly computed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two financial metrics and two years, correctly comparing the growth rates. It concludes that operating income growth outpaced net income growth, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it omits the specific comparison metric—'by about 5.7 percentage points'—which slightly reduces completeness in qualitative reasoning.

It accurately reports $37 million in interest additions and correctly calculates total reductions as $33 million (though it does not break this down into the $24 million reduction due to facts/circumstances and $9 million due to settlements as in the original answer). However, the total reduction amount is correct ($24 + $9 = $33), so the net change of $4 million matches both the balance change and the ground truth calculation.

The calculation of net change ($37 - $33 = $4) is correct and consistent with the balance movement. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the change in balance to the components of additions and reductions during the year, demonstrating synthesis across time periods and transaction types.

The LLM reports $131.8 million, while the ground truth is $131.6 million. This $0.2 million difference likely stems from rounding but does not significantly affect the overall accuracy. All other numbers — including the short-term ($36.9 million) and long-term ($94.9 million) components for 2024, and the prior year’s total ($107.5 million), short-term ($2.8 million), and long-term ($104.7 million) — are correct. (2) The year-over-year increase is reported as 'roughly $24 million', which aligns with the actual difference of $24.1 million ($131.6M - $107.5M); this approximation is acceptable. The calculation logic is sound and the components add up correctly: $36.9M + $94.9M = $131.8M (slight rounding variance aside). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is accurate — the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data from two different fiscal year-ends (September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023), distinguishes between short- and long-term investments, and computes the trend. (4) The entity (Starbucks), metric (fair value of U.S. government treasury securities), and time periods are all correctly identified.

(1) Quantitatively, the $2.49 billion reduction (equivalent to $2,490 million) is correct, and the consolidated revenue of $78.494 billion matches the ground truth. The LLM provides a more granular breakdown of the intersegment eliminations ($2.445B from Canada, $18M from Lower 48, etc.), summing to approximately $2.49B, which aligns with the total elimination. Minor rounding differences (e.g., $2.445B + $0.018B + $0.001B + $0.026B = $2.490B) are acceptable and do not affect correctness. (2) The answer fully addresses both parts of the question: the impact of eliminations and the rationale for avoiding double-counting. (3) Entities are correct: Chevron, 2022 (implied by context), geographic segments (L48, Canada, EMENA, Corporate), and financial metrics (sales and other operating revenues). (4) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly explains that intersegment transactions are eliminated to prevent double-counting in consolidated revenue, demonstrating proper multi-hop synthesis between segment-level transactions and consolidated reporting. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer emphasizes that the $2,445 million alone refers to L48 and Canada transactions, while the LLM implies $2,445B is solely from Canada—this could cause slight confusion but does not materially misrepresent the data.

These values match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation for percentage growth is accurate: $3,649 / $17,562 = 0.20778, which rounds to 20.8% (the LLM reports ≈20.8%), while the ground truth states 'approximately 20.7%'. This minor discrepancy likely stems from rounding differences (e.g., 20.78% rounded to 20.8% vs 20.7%), but both are within acceptable rounding tolerance.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. While it correctly identifies the projected amounts for 2023 ($48M), 2024 ($49M), 2025 ($50M), and 2026 ($51M), it incorrectly uses $267M for 2027–2031 instead of isolating the 2027 amount. The ground truth specifies $47M for 2027, but the LLM uses a five-year aggregate (2027–2031) of $267M, leading to a grossly inflated total of $465M instead of the correct $255M. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the correct sum is $48M + $49M + $50M + $51M + $47M = $245M (with minor rounding differences possibly explaining $255M in original answer; likely a data discrepancy in source). However, the LLM’s use of $267M for a later period and inclusion of it as part of 2027 obligations is a critical error. Even if $267M were for five years, it should not be added in full to the first four years. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model must extract individual year obligations from CL’s 2022 10-K and sum only 2023–2027. The LLM conflates time periods and misreads the disclosure, failing to isolate the 2027 figure. It appears to misunderstand the structure of the footnote, treating a subsequent five-year bucket as a single-year value. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the right company (CL), the right benefit type, and the right general disclosure location (page 107), and attempts the correct calculation. However, the core numerical and logical flaws drastically reduce correctness. A score of 2 reflects mostly incorrect quantitative output despite relevant framing.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: the decrease from $1,722 million in 2020 to $660 million in 2021 results in a $1,062 million decrease, which the model correctly calculates and reports (with an acceptable format variation noting ~$1.06 billion). The weighted-average useful life is correctly stated as decreasing from 11 years to 8 years, a 3-year reduction. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the multi-part question: the dollar amount decrease and the change in weighted-average useful life. (3) Entity accuracy is correct—UnitedHealth Group (referred to as UnitedHealth, an acceptable shorthand), correct years (2020 to 2021), and correct financial metric (acquired finite-lived intangible assets). (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis across time points and metrics. While the LLM does not explicitly interpret the implication (i.e., 'shift toward shorter-lived assets') as in the original answer, it accurately reports the change in useful life, which directly reflects the trend. The omission of interpretive phrasing does not detract from factual correctness, as the question asks 'how does this reflect,' and stating the numerical change suffices.

However, the final cumulative net increase is incorrect. The LLM calculates $51 million, but the correct total is $65 million (106 - 43 - 12 = 51 is mathematically correct, but the ground truth claims 106 - 43 - 12 = 65, which is factually inconsistent).

These numbers are accurate and properly formatted (e.g., $3 million = $3M). (2) However, the LLM misstates the timing of the gross unrecognized tax benefit balances. It claims the balances were $1.877B at the end of 2022, $2.236B at the end of 2023, and $2.320B at the end of 2024. According to the original answer, the gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1,678M in 2022 (not $1.877B), then rose to $1,877M in 2023, and to $2,236M in 2024 before increasing further to $2,320M due to other adjustments. Thus, the LLM incorrectly shifts the $1.877B figure to 2022 instead of 2023, which is a significant factual error in temporal alignment. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially flawed: while the model correctly aggregates the reduction amounts across years, it fails to accurately represent the progression of gross unrecognized tax benefits over time, incorrectly implying that the post-reduction balance in 2022 was $1.877B when it should have been $1,678M. This suggests a confusion in synthesizing the cause-effect relationship between the reductions and the overall balance changes. (4) Despite this, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question — total reduction and impact on gross benefits — with mostly accurate data. The quantitative accuracy is high due to correct individual figures and sum, but qualitative accuracy is reduced due to incorrect temporal mapping and misrepresentation of the balance trajectory.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors. According to the ground truth, Home Depot's net property and equipment outside the U.S. was $2,503 million in fiscal year 2022 and $2,574 million in 2023, resulting in a $71 million increase. However, the LLM incorrectly states the 2022 value as $2,574 million and the 2023 value as $2,807 million, leading to a wrong increase of $233 million instead of $71 million. Additionally, the LLM provides total global net property and equipment values ($25,631M and $26,154M), which are not requested and distract from the specific 'outside the U.S.' focus of the question. (2) The calculation of the increase is incorrect due to wrong input values. The combined total for both years according to the ground truth is $5,077 million ($2,503M + $2,574M), but the LLM reports $51,785 million, which is the sum of global totals, not the non-U.S. figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not isolate the 'outside the U.S.' component as required. Instead, it uses global totals and misattributes years, indicating a failure to correctly identify and synthesize the relevant data points across the two fiscal years. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer discusses the right company and general topic, but applies incorrect metrics and geographic scope. The qualitative accuracy is low due to incorrect entities (values, years) and flawed synthesis. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to major numerical and calculation errors.

While it correctly identifies the revenue contribution of the Specialty Diagnostics segment as $4.405 billion (equivalent to $4,405 million, so this is semantically acceptable), it grossly misstates the operating income as $1.124 billion instead of the correct $11 million. This is off by two orders of magnitude. Additionally, the LLM calculates a 25%–26% operating margin, whereas the ground truth states that $11 million is about 0.25% of $4,405 million. The LLM’s percentage is thus off by a factor of 100. (2) Number verification: Revenue: $4.405 billion = $4,405 million → correct. Operating income: LLM says $1.124 billion = $1,124 million; correct value is $11 million → error. Calculation: 1,124 / 4,405 ≈ 25.5% → correct math but based on wrong numbers. True ratio: 11 / 4,405 ≈ 0.25% → correct in ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize revenue and operating income to compute a margin, which is logically sound, but because it pulls an incorrect operating income figure (possibly from a different segment or misread data), the conclusion is completely invalid. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to catastrophic error in operating income and resulting percentage. Quantitative accuracy is 2 due to one correct number and one severely incorrect one. Qualitative accuracy is 3 because reasoning structure is valid but based on false data.

These values match the ground truth exactly. (2) The percentage point changes are accurately calculated: 23% to 6% is indeed a 17-point drop; 19% to 89% is a 70-point increase.

These figures are rounded versions of the ground truth values ($11,855 million and $9,316 million), which equate to $11.855 billion and $9.316 billion. The rounding to one decimal place is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (2) The year-over-year increase is stated as roughly $2.5 billion, which aligns with the actual difference of $2,539 million ($11,855M - $9,316M), correctly rounded. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model retrieves data from two different years, compares them, and computes the change, demonstrating proper synthesis across time periods. The citations (page_82 and page_44) support the claim, indicating correct grounding. (4) All entities (GOOGL/Alphabet, Class A share repurchases, 2023, 2024) are accurate. The answer is contextually complete and directly addresses both parts of the question. The only minor limitation is the use of rounded figures without specifying exact values, but this does not affect factual correctness.

The total noncash stock-based compensation expense recorded during the same period was $647 million ($189 million in 2019 + $221 million in 2020 + $227 million in 2021).

However, it reverses the order of the stock-based compensation expenses, listing $227M for 2019, $221M for 2020, and $189M for 2021 — this is factually incorrect. The correct values are $189M (2019), $221M (2020), and $227M (2021). While the total is nearly correct at $637M, the actual total is $647M, indicating a $10M error in summation. (2) The calculation of the tax benefit total ($233M) is accurate, but the expense total is wrong: $189 + $221 + $227 = $637 is incorrect arithmetic; the correct sum is $637 → $647. This is a critical quantitative error. The comparison stating the expense is 'roughly three times' the tax benefit is misleading: $647M vs $233M is about 2.78x, not 3x, and with the incorrect $637M, it's still ~2.73x — not a major deviation, but compounded by prior errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both tax benefits and stock-based compensation as relevant metrics across three years and attempts aggregation. However, it fails to correctly extract or order the expense figures, suggesting a misreading of the source data, which undermines the synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both parts of the question and cites the correct document page. The qualitative reasoning is logical but based on flawed data. The correctness score is 6 due to significant quantitative inaccuracies in the expense total and incorrect year-to-value mappings, despite getting the tax benefit side fully correct.",

However, it incorrectly states that this $3.0 billion represents roughly 13% of total freight revenue in 2024, while the ground truth indicates it represented approximately 8.77%. This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The calculation of the revenue increase ($3.0B - $2.8B = $200M) is correct. However, the percentage of total freight revenue is miscalculated: $3.0B / $22.8B ≈ 13.16%, which aligns with the LLM's 'roughly 13%' claim, but contradicts the ground truth of 8.77%. This suggests either a discrepancy in the underlying data or misattribution of total freight revenue. If total freight revenue were actually ~$34.2 billion ($3.0B / 0.0877), the 8.77% figure would hold, but the LLM uses $22.8B, leading to the higher percentage. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—revenue increase is correctly calculated from two years of data—but the synthesis of total freight revenue and its proportion is flawed, indicating either incorrect data retrieval or misalignment between revenue figures. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to the major error in the percentage of total freight revenues, despite getting the $200M increase right. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because half the numbers (the increase) are correct, but the percentage and implied totals are not.

However, the LLM misstates the starting point of the trend in gross unrecognized tax benefits. The original answer states that gross unrecognized tax benefits began at $1,305 million at the beginning of fiscal 2020, but the LLM claims $1.817 billion at year-end 2020, which is inconsistent with the ground truth timeline and omits the earlier baseline. Additionally, while the LLM correctly reports $3.245 billion at year-end 2022, it incorrectly states $3.135 billion at year-end 2021, which does not align with the original answer’s trajectory of $3,245 million at end of 2022 after increases and settlements over time. (2) The calculation of the cumulative increase ($516M + $92M + $170M = $778M) is correct. However, the reported gross unrecognized tax benefit values at year-end are partially inaccurate: $1.817B for 2020 and $3.135B for 2021 are not supported by the ground truth, which only specifies the starting point ($1,305M in early 2020) and ending point ($3,245M in 2022), without confirming intermediate year-end figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—the model correctly links prior-year tax position increases to the growth in gross unrecognized tax benefits. However, it introduces unsupported intermediate values instead of acknowledging the full period trend from 2020 start to 2022 end, weakening the synthesis. (4) The correctness score is 7 because core financial data (annual increases and total) are accurate, but key contextual metrics (gross unrecognized tax benefits at year-end) contain discrepancies. Quantitative accuracy is 7 due to correct calculations but incorrect reported figures for gross benefits. Qualitative accuracy is 8 due to sound logic and entity identification (Walmart, fiscal years, metric type).

Additionally, the $0.2 billion reduction in pandemic-related expenses—such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices, and personal protective equipment—further contributed to the decline.

(2) All numbers are accurate: $73M (2020), -$26M (2021), $99M reduction, and resulting Comprehensive Income of $1,139M in 2021. The original answer states Comprehensive Income dropped from $132M in 2020 to $1,139M in 2021, which implies an increase, not a drop — this appears to be a typo in the ground truth (likely meant to say 'increased to'). The LLM correctly interprets the $99M reduction relative to what it would have been, not an absolute drop in total Comprehensive Income. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects the change in Other Comprehensive Income to its direct impact on total Comprehensive Income, correctly synthesizing across the two years and metrics. (4) The only minor issue is that the LLM does not explicitly state the 2020 Comprehensive Income figure ($132M), though it correctly implies the $99M reduction affected the 2021 total.

It also accurately states that total QCT revenues increased by $2.814 billion (i.e., $2,814 million), which aligns with the original answer. The counterfactual reasoning—'without the $517 million IoT decline, QCT revenue growth would have been about $3.3 billion'—is logically sound and correctly infers the implied total growth absent the IoT segment's performance.\n\n2) All numeric values are accurate and correctly formatted. $5.94 billion = $5,940 million and $5.42 billion = $5,423 million (rounding to nearest $10M is acceptable in reporting). The $517 million difference is exact: 5,940 - 5,423 = 517. The total QCT revenue increase of $2,814 million is correctly cited. No calculation errors.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model connects IoT revenue decline to its impact on overall QCT revenue growth, correctly interpreting that while total QCT revenues increased, the IoT segment acted as a drag. It infers the offsetting effect of other segments (implied by the net positive growth despite IoT decline), though it does not explicitly name Automotive and Handsets as in the original answer.\n\n4) The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the specific contributing segments (Automotive up $1,038M and Handsets up $2,293M) that drove the overall QCT growth. While the LLM correctly characterizes the IoT decline as offsetting part of the growth, it does not fully replicate the completeness of the original answer’s explanation of *what* caused the net increase. However, the core question—dollar amount of decline and its contribution to overall change—is adequately addressed with correct logic and numbers.

The ground truth reports a $571 million tax benefit in 2019 on a $2.4 billion pre-tax loss, but the LLM states $626 million benefit on a $2.387 billion loss. Similarly, for 2020, the correct tax benefit is $1.6 billion (on a $6.5 billion loss), but the LLM reports $1.607 billion (on $6.484 billion), which is close but still inaccurate. The combined tax benefit in the ground truth is $2.171 billion ($571M + $1.6B), while the LLM implies $2.233 billion ($626M + $1.607B), a notable discrepancy. (2) Calculations: The LLM claims the benefits covered 'roughly one-quarter' of each year’s loss. In 2019, $626M / $2.387B ≈ 26.2%, and in 2020, $1.607B / $6.484B ≈ 24.8%, which supports the 'one-quarter' characterization. However, using ground truth numbers: $571M / $2.4B = 23.8% and $1.6B / $6.5B = 24.6%, also ~24%, so the ratio interpretation is reasonable. The error lies in the raw numbers, not the percentage logic. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that tax benefits are tied to pre-tax mark-to-market losses on pension and postretirement plans and attempts to compare them across two years, showing understanding of the required synthesis. However, the incorrect base figures undermine the validity of the conclusion. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both years, the tax benefits, the pre-tax losses, and their relationship.

However, the LLM claims the segment generated $10.975 billion in 2020 and $12.254 billion in 2021—an increase of $1.3 billion—which is off by a factor of over 100x. These numbers are not just incorrect but orders of magnitude wrong. (2) The acquisition date and entity name (PPD, Inc. on December 8, 2021) are correctly identified, which is a key qualitative element. However, the revenue figures are so grossly inaccurate that they invalidate the financial comparison. (3) While the model correctly identifies the acquisition as a strategic enhancement and links it to clinical research services, it fails the multi-hop reasoning requirement because it does not accurately connect the actual revenue figures from 2020 to 2021. The reasoning appears plausible on the surface but is built on false numerical foundations. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right segment and acquisition, and the structure matches the question’s intent.

The total increase in content obligations is stated as $1.536 billion, equivalent to $1,536,000 thousand, very close to the ground truth $1,535,582 thousand—this minor rounding difference (418 thousand) is negligible and acceptable under format variation. (2) Calculations are accurate: $2,810M - $2,016M = $794M (LLM says $793M, likely due to rounding of original figures), and $23,249M - $21,713M = $1,536M, which is correct. The LLM concludes that the three-to-five-year increase accounts for 'roughly half' of the total increase, which aligns with the ground truth 51.67%—this qualitative summary is reasonable and semantically equivalent. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two years (2023 to 2024), two time buckets (three-to-five years and total), and performs comparative analysis. Entities—Netflix, content obligations, correct time frames—are all accurately referenced.

These numbers match the ground truth exactly. (2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect—values are correctly stated and formatted with acceptable variation (e.g., $536 million). The implied comparison (2023 gain vs. prior two-year cumulative loss) is accurate, though the exact $967 million swing (i.e., $536M - (-$431M)) is not explicitly stated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across three years and compares 2023 to the prior two-year total. However, it stops short of explicitly quantifying the year-over-year swing of $967 million, which is a minor omission in completeness. (4) Despite this, the answer is contextually relevant, clearly structured, and semantically equivalent to the original in all major aspects. The lack of explicit mention of the $967 million swing prevents a perfect 10, but all critical data points and logic are present and correct.",

(Nike Brand + Converse) in fiscal years 2022 ($31,237 million) and 2023 ($35,290 million), which matches the ground truth. However, the year-over-year change is incorrectly calculated: the LLM states an increase of $4,053 million, while the correct difference is $35,290M - $31,237M = $4,053M. Wait — this is actually correct numerically: 35,290 - 31,237 = 4,053. But the ground truth claims the change is $3,920 million, which contradicts the provided numbers. This suggests an error in the ground truth or a misstatement. Upon re-evaluation: 35,290 - 31,237 = 4,053 exactly. Therefore, the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct, and the original answer stating $3,920 million appears to be factually wrong. Given this, the LLM answer is quantitatively accurate, but the evaluation must align with the provided 'ground truth'. Since the task requires comparing against the stated ground truth (which says $3,920M), even though that number is mathematically incorrect, the LLM contradicts it with a correct calculation. This creates a conflict between factual correctness and alignment with the knowledge graph. Per instructions, we must score based on match to ground truth. Thus, the LLM's $4,053M is marked as incorrect despite being numerically accurate. This leads to a low quantitative accuracy score. Entity identification and years are correct. The reasoning is sound — multi-hop synthesis of Nike Brand and Converse into total footwear revenue is properly executed. Contextual relevance is high as all parts of the question are addressed. Final scores reflect conflict: LLM is factually correct but diverges from the (erroneous) ground truth, resulting in penalization.",

It claims Nike's North America footwear revenue declined from $14.897 billion in FY2023 to $14.537 billion in FY2024, but the ground truth shows an increase from $14,897 million to $15,528 million (a 4.2% rise). The LLM incorrectly reports a $360 million drop, while the actual change is an increase of $631 million. The global footwear revenue is partially correct: the LLM correctly states an increase from $33.135 billion to $33.427 billion (~0.9%), though it rounds to 'about 1%', which is acceptable. However, the conclusion that North America fell while global grew is factually wrong. (2) Calculation verification: The correct North America growth is (15,528 - 14,897)/14,897 ≈ 4.2%, not a 2% decline. The global growth is (33,427 - 33,135)/33,135 ≈ 0.88%, correctly approximated as 0.9% in the ground truth. The LLM’s 1% is acceptable, but its North America decline is entirely incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: The model fails to correctly synthesize the North America and global footwear revenue trends, drawing the opposite conclusion from the data. It does correctly identify the need to compare regional vs. global performance, but with wrong inputs. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and directional errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) due to incorrect revenue figures and misdirection of change. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the model attempts the right comparison and cites global revenue correctly. Contextual relevance is fair (7/10) as it addresses the right question structure and metrics, just with wrong data.",

The original answer implies these returns collectively caused the $3.0 billion hit without breaking them down further, so the LLM’s clarification enhances rather than detracts.

(2) The individual segment figures ($25.4B and $4.4B) are accurate and match the ground truth, but the derived total ($25.4B + $4.4B = $29.8B, not $28.1B) is mathematically inconsistent even on its own terms, suggesting an error in aggregation or sourcing. The 33% growth figure lacks a base year reference or source in the original answer. (3) The reasoning partially captures the multi-hop nature by contrasting compensation trends in Google Services and Google Cloud, correctly identifying the opposing impacts on operating income. However, it overreaches by synthesizing a company-wide operating income change not requested or supported in the original answer, which focuses on the collective *impact* of opposing trends rather than a net numerical outcome. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses workforce cost dynamics in both segments and their effect on operating income. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct entity identification and directional logic, but quantitative accuracy is penalized for introducing unverified and inconsistent numbers. Correctness score reflects partial accuracy with significant factual overreach.",

      "original_answer": "The total change in CVX's Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance from the beginning of 2022 ($17,651 million) to the end of 2024 ($21,313 million) is an increase of $3,662 million. Over this period, the cumulative additions to deferred income tax expense were $1,881 million (2024) + $2,348 million (2023) + $3,533 million (2022) = $7,762 million. The cumulative reductions of deferred income tax expense were ($984 million) (2024) + ($1,464 million) (2023) + ($1,652 million) (2022) = ($4,099 million). The net additions to deferred income tax expense over the three years were $7,762 - $4,099 = $3,663 million, which closely aligns with the $3,662 increase in the Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance from 2022 to 2024.",

This rise equals the cumulative net of the yearly additions versus reductions to deferred‑income‑tax expense: 2022 net = $3,533 m – $1,652 m = $1,881 m; 2023 net = $2,348 m – $1,464 m = $884 m; 2024 net = $1,881 m – $984 m = $897 m, together totaling $1,881 m + $884 m + $897 m = $3,662 m【page_118†L19-L24】.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the total change in CVX's Deferred Income Tax Valuation Allowance from $17,651 million to $21,313 million, calculating the $3,662 million increase accurately. All cited numbers (beginning and ending balances, annual additions, and reductions) match the ground truth. (2) The LLM performs correct arithmetic for the net additions per year: 2022 ($3,533M - $1,652M = $1,881M), 2023 ($2,348M - $1,464M = $884M), and 2024 ($1,881M - $984M = $897M), and correctly sums them: $1,881M + $884M + $897M = $3,662M. This matches the total change exactly. The ground truth uses a different method (total additions minus total reductions: $7,762M - $4,099M = $3,663M), which differs by $1M due to rounding, but the LLM’s approach is equally valid and more precise in this case. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across three years, correctly identifies the relationship between net deferred tax expense adjustments and the valuation allowance change, and supports its conclusion with itemized calculations. (4) The only minor discrepancy is that the LLM refers to the 2024 addition as $1,881 million, which is actually the net for 2022 in the ground truth; however, the LLM’s cited value of $1,881M for 2024 additions appears to be a typo/confusion with the 2022 net, but the correct number for 2024 additions is $1,881M per the LLM’s own calculation — which actually matches the ground truth 2024 additions. Upon recheck, the LLM’s numbers are all correct. Therefore, the answer is fully factually accurate. The score is 9 instead of 10 due to slight confusion in labeling (using net values as if they were gross additions), but the underlying data and math are correct.

Similarly, Marketing & Commerce grows from $4.516 billion to $5.281 billion, a $765 million increase, which the model reports as $0.77 billion—again, a reasonable rounding. (2) Calculations are accurate: the absolute increases match the ground truth, and the percentage growths are correctly approximated—33% for Integration & Analytics ((5775-4338)/4338 ≈ 33.1%) and ≈17% for Marketing & Commerce ((5281-4516)/4516 ≈ 16.9%)—both correctly rounded.

However, the LLM states a $3 million decrease in benefit obligations and a $2 million decrease in plan assets, resulting in a net $5 million decrease—this is drastically different from the correct figures. The calculation logic (summing the two components) is sound, but the underlying numbers are wrong, indicating a failure in data retrieval or synthesis. The entity (Bristol-Myers Squibb) and year (2021) are correct, and the answer addresses the right concept (impact on benefit obligations and plan assets), so there is partial contextual relevance.

      "original_answer": "The $2.7 billion as-converted value release triggered the issuance of 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024, which is reflected in the reduction of series B and C preferred stock balances and the corresponding adjustment in the preferred stock amount from $1,698 million to $1,031 million in Visa's equity table. This adjustment mechanism, governed by the litigation management deed, allowed Visa to recover VE territory covered losses by modifying the conversion rates of preferred stock, which in turn reduced the book value of series B and C preferred stock while increasing series A preferred stock balances. The issuance of series A preferred stock also carried an automatic conversion right into class A common stock upon eligible sale, further linking litigation-driven equity adjustments to future capital structure changes.",

(1) Quantitatively, the issuance of 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock is correctly stated. The drop in total preferred stock from $1.698 billion to $1.031 billion is accurate and matches the ground truth. The LLM adds specific book values for series A preferred stock ($540 million in 2024 vs $456 million in 2023), which are plausible and consistent with the $2.7 billion adjustment, though these exact figures are not in the original answer; however, they do not contradict it and may reflect additional context. (2) The mechanism is partially correct: the LLM identifies the reduction in the 'right to recover for covered losses' contra-equity account and reclassification into series A preferred stock and additional paid-in capital, which aligns with equity accounting. However, it omits the key governance mechanism — the litigation management deed — and does not mention the conversion rate adjustment of preferred stock, which is central to how the release triggered the stock issuance. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in linking the anniversary event to stock issuance and equity table changes, but the explanation of the causal mechanism is less precise than the original, missing the automatic conversion right into class A common stock upon eligible sale, which is an important structural consequence. (4) Despite these omissions, the answer correctly identifies the entities (Visa, series A/B/C preferred stock), the timing (2024, eighth anniversary), and the financial impact.

The total fair value is therefore incorrectly implied to be $285 million ($132M + $153M), whereas the ground truth total is $259 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised because the sum of hedging instruments is incorrect despite correct individual components being cited.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and matches the ground truth in all key aspects. (1) Quantitatively, the total increase in pledged assets is correctly calculated as $109.6 billion ($1,174.4B - $1,064.8B), and the breakdown into assets that may be sold or repledged ($7.5B increase) and those that may not ($53.7B increase) is factually correct. The starting and ending values for each category are consistent with the knowledge graph. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the total increase and the breakdown by repledgeability. (3) Entities—JPMorgan Chase, the time period (December 31, 2023, to December 31, 2024), and the financial metric (pledged assets)—are correctly identified. (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis, as it requires pulling data from two points in time and decomposing the change into components. The only minor limitation is that the original answer does not include the absolute values (e.g., $145.0B to $152.5B), so while the LLM provides extra detail, it does not contradict or misrepresent. This additional context improves clarity but is not required, so it does not affect correctness. Overall, the answer is semantically equivalent and factually precise.",

However, the final calculated decline is 3.7 percentage points (45.7% to 42.0%), while the ground truth states a decline of 3.3 percentage points. This discrepancy indicates a factual or computational error in the source data or calculation. (2) The individual percentages cited—Copenhagen (31.8% → 29.4%) and Skoal (13.9% → 12.6%)—appear consistent with the document reference, but their sum is miscalculated: 31.8 + 13.9 = 45.7 (correct), 29.4 + 12.6 = 42.0 (correct), and 45.7 - 42.0 = 3.7 (correct arithmetic), yet the ground truth reports a 3.3-point decline, suggesting either the input percentages are incorrect despite the citation or the ground truth uses different data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—aggregating shares across brands and years and computing the difference—but the conclusion does not match the verified truth.

Over the same period, total Property, Plant, and Equipment (PPE) increased by $1,137 million (from $13,745 million to $14,882 million).

The percentage calculation (approximately 30%) is a rounded version of the precise 29.98%, which is semantically acceptable. (2) All numbers are accurate and correctly formatted, with consistent use of billions/millions ($3.481 billion = $3,481 million, etc.). The calculations for both the CIP and PPE increases are correct, and the proportional contribution of CIP to PPE growth is accurately represented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two time points (end of 2020 and 2021) and two financial line items (CIP and total PPE), then compares their changes—exactly as required by the question.

Over the same period, total store operating expenses increased by $1,724.7 million, from $13,561.8 million in 2022 to $15,286.5 million in 2024.

Over the same span, total store operating expenses grew from **$13,561.8 million to $15,286.5 million**, a rise of **$1,724.7 million**【page_77】, meaning the higher labor costs accounted for roughly 39% of the overall expense growth and were a key driver of the increase in store operating expenses.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified the wages and benefits expenses for FY 2022 ($8,157.7 million) and FY 2024 ($8,828.6 million), as well as the total store operating expenses for both years ($13,561.8 million in 2022 and $15,286.5 million in 2024), which matches the ground truth. However, the calculated increase in wages and benefits is incorrect: the correct difference is $8,828.6M - $8,157.7M = $670.9M, but the ground truth states $770.9M, indicating a discrepancy. The LLM reports $670.9M, which is mathematically accurate based on the provided numbers but contradicts the stated ground truth increase of $770.9M. This suggests either a data inconsistency or error in the knowledge graph or source interpretation. (2) The total store operating expense increase is correctly calculated as $1,724.7M, matching the ground truth. The derived percentage (39%) of labor cost increase relative to total expense growth is reasonable and adds analytical value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—linking labor cost changes to overall operating expense trends—and the entities (SBUX, fiscal years 2022–2024, wages and benefits, total store operating expenses) are correctly identified. (4) Despite the numerical discrepancy in the wage increase amount, the answer uses consistent data from the same source (page 77) and provides meaningful qualitative insight. The correctness score is reduced due to the conflicting quantitative result, but not severely penalized because the calculation from given inputs is accurate.

      "original_answer": "Mondelēz International excludes mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses from marketable securities from its Adjusted EPS because these gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and excluding them better facilitates comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods. Additionally, the company also excludes operating expenses related to the ERP System Implementation program, which include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs, and accelerated depreciation, as these are considered nonrecurring transformational costs that do not reflect ongoing operational performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Excluding mark‑to‑market unrealized (and realized) gains or losses on marketable securities removes a source of earnings volatility that is unrelated to the company’s core operations, so Adjusted EPS reflects only the underlying operating performance and can be compared more consistently across periods【page_59】.  Mondelēz applies the same comparability logic to other large, non‑recurring program items—it strips out the costs of its Simplify‑to‑Grow transformation program and the incremental operating expenses of its ERP System Implementation program, both of which are excluded from the non‑GAAP measures to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating results【page_59】【page_61】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the same core information as the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies that mark-to-market unrealized (and realized) gains or losses on marketable securities are excluded from Adjusted EPS to remove non-operational volatility and improve comparability of underlying performance across periods. This aligns with the original answer, which emphasizes that such gains/losses are not indicative of underlying operations. (2) The LLM correctly notes that ERP System Implementation costs are excluded for the same comparability reason. It also adds the 'Simplify-to-Grow' transformation program as another excluded item, which is consistent with Mondelēz's non-GAAP adjustments per the cited pages (59, 61), even though the original answer did not mention it. This addition does not introduce error but reflects broader context from the source. (3) The reasoning is sound and multi-hop: it connects the exclusion of marketable securities gains/losses to the broader principle of removing non-recurring, non-operational items (like ERP and transformation program costs) to enable performance comparison. (4) Minor difference: the original specifies that ERP-related costs include third-party consulting, direct labor, and accelerated depreciation; the LLM generalizes as 'incremental operating expenses'—slightly less precise but semantically acceptable. Also, the LLM mentions 'realized' gains/losses, which were not in the original; however, this is a reasonable extension if supported by the cited pages and does not contradict the ground truth.

In fiscal 2024 specifically, the allowance began at $85 million, increased by $36 million in provisions, and decreased by $34 million in net recoveries (write-offs), resulting in the ending balance of $87 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified the U.S. Earnings Before Tax for MO (Altria) for 2022 ($7,628 million), 2023 ($10,971 million), and 2024 ($13,680 million), matching the ground truth. The percentage increase from 2023 to 2024 is accurately calculated as 24.7%, which is correct. However, the percentage increase from 2022 to 2023 is reported as 43.8%, whereas the ground truth is 44.0%. This minor discrepancy (0.2 percentage points) likely stems from rounding during intermediate steps, but the exact calculation (10,971 - 7,628) / 7,628 = 3,343 / 7,628 ≈ 0.4382 → 43.8% is mathematically accurate to one decimal place. The ground truth reports 44.0%, suggesting possible rounding up or a different precision standard. (2) All numeric values and calculations are correct within reasonable rounding tolerance. The dollar amounts and years are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesized data across three years, computed two percentage changes, and compared them to conclude a slowdown in growth—fully aligning with the required synthesis. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only a negligible difference in reported percentage (43.8% vs 44.0%). This does not affect the overall correctness significantly, hence a score of 9. All other aspects—entity accuracy (MO/Altria), metric (U.S. Earnings Before Tax), and contextual relevance—are perfect.",

The dollar amount decrease in Starbucks' Income from Equity Investees is reported as $151 million, dropping from $385.3 million in FY2021 to $234.1 million in FY2022. However, the ground truth states the decrease was from $135.3 million to $2.3 million, a drop of $133 million. These numbers are entirely incorrect and not supported by the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly attributes the decline to segment-level drops in International and Channel Development, which misrepresents the nature of the 'Income from Equity Investees' line item. (2) The total operating income figures are also wrong: LLM reports $4.872 billion in 2021 and $4.618 billion in 2022 (a $254 million drop), but the correct figures are $1,245.7 million and $833.2 million, respectively—a much steeper $412.5 million decline. The LLM’s numbers are off by more than 300%, indicating severe quantitative errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. While the LLM attempts to link the decrease in equity income to the trend in operating income, it does so using fabricated data. The correct answer requires synthesizing two precise data points across years and connecting them to the broader operating income trend, which the model fails to do accurately. (4) Despite the incorrect numbers, the answer addresses both parts of the question—dollar decrease and impact on operating income—and maintains relevant context (e.g., referencing correct fiscal years and appropriate financial concepts), warranting moderate contextual relevance.

However, the total expected benefit payment is incorrect: the LLM reports $957 million, while the ground truth is $867 million. This $90 million discrepancy is significant and impacts the factual accuracy of the quantitative answer. (2) The calculation provided by the LLM (2024–2028 = $456 million + 2029–2033 = $501 million) sums to $957 million, which is mathematically correct based on those inputs, but these input values do not align with the ground truth data. Either the source numbers or the time-period breakdowns are inaccurate, indicating an error in data extraction or synthesis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies both required components (total payments over 10 years and max equity allocation) and attempts to compute the sum from sub-periods, showing appropriate synthesis. However, the use of incorrect base figures undermines the reasoning despite correct methodology. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—the answer addresses both parts of the question and cites the correct document page. Qualitative accuracy is decent due to correct identification of the equity allocation cap and logical breakdown approach.

The LLM incorrectly reports a $0.9 billion increase instead of the correct ~$1.36 billion decrease. This is a critical quantitative error. (2) The calculation of change is entirely wrong: using rounded figures, the correct change is ~$1.36B decrease, not a $0.9B increase. The LLM uses incorrect base values (e.g., $9.9B vs actual $12.20B), leading to invalid comparison. However, the second part — that the Communications & Media sub-group accounted for roughly 40% of FY24 revenue — matches the ground truth exactly and is correctly cited. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails on the first hop: the model did not accurately extract or align the correct revenue figures for the segment in FY2022 and FY2024. It appears to have misread or misattributed data, possibly confusing this segment with another or misinterpreting the fiscal year amounts. The synthesis across years is flawed. (4) Despite correct identification of the 40% attribution (qualitative accuracy partially met), the severe numerical inaccuracies in dollar amounts and direction of change (increase vs decrease) severely undermine the answer’s correctness.

      "original_answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb's Tecentriq royalty expense decreased from $107 million in 2023 to $47 million in 2024, resulting in a $60 million reduction. This contributed to the overall decline in total royalty and collaboration expenses, which dropped from $1,488 million in 2023 to $736 million in 2024—a decrease of $752 million. In 2024, Tecentriq royalties represented approximately 6.4% of the total royalty and collaboration expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Tecentriq royalty costs fell by $60 million, dropping from $107 million in 2023 to $47 million in 2024【page_95】.

Total royalty and collaboration expenses declined from $1,488 million to $736 million, a $752 million drop. The proportion of Tecentriq royalties in 2024 is calculated as $47M / $736M ≈ 6.38%, which the model rounds to 'roughly 6%', aligning closely with the ground truth of 'approximately 6.4%'. Minor rounding is acceptable and does not affect factual accuracy. (2) All calculations are accurate: the $60M decrease and $752M total decline are correct. The percentage representation is semantically equivalent despite rounding. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links Tecentriq's expense change to its impact on total royalty and collaboration expenses and computes its share of the total in 2024. (4) The answer is fully relevant and addresses both parts of the question. The only minor shortcoming is the slight rounding down of 6.38% to 'roughly 6%' instead of '6.4%', which slightly affects precision but not overall correctness.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the $38 million reclassification from derivatives and $42 million from investments, totaling $80 million, which matches the ground truth. However, the LLM introduces additional information not present in the original answer — specifically, the $753 million improvement from a $6.343 billion FY2023 balance to $5.590 billion in FY2024 — which, while numerically consistent ($6.343B - $5.590B = $753M), is not supported by the provided ground truth and thus constitutes an unsupported inference. The original answer only states the ending AOCI loss of $5,590 million without referencing the prior year or improvement amount. (2) The core reclassification numbers ($38M, $42M, $80M total) are accurate and correctly formatted. The ending AOCI loss is correctly stated as $5.590 billion (equivalent to $5,590 million). However, the calculation of a $753 million improvement, while mathematically correct if the prior balance were $6.343 billion, introduces data not present in the ground truth, reducing quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound — the model correctly synthesizes reclassification components and their total, and links them to the impact on AOCI. However, the addition of a year-over-year change goes beyond the scope of the provided answer and assumes data not confirmed in the ground truth, weakening the reasoning chain. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the total reclassification and its impact on AOCI. While the impact is described differently (framed as a 'shrink' due to reclassification), this is semantically reasonable since reclassifications out of AOCI reduce the loss. However, the unsupported prior-year figure prevents a higher score. Overall, the core facts are correct, but the addition of unverified comparative data reduces quantitative accuracy.",

Data Processing Revenue is correctly reported as rising from $14,438 million to $17,714 million, a $3.276 billion increase. The LLM rounds this to $3.28 billion, which is a minor acceptable rounding (within $4 million difference). (2) The core calculations are accurate: $12,665M - $9,815M = $2,850M and $17,714M - $14,438M = $3,276M. The LLM’s $3.28B is a rounded version of $3.276B, which is reasonable in context. However, the ground truth explicitly compares the two growth amounts and states that Data Processing Revenue grew by $426 million more than International Transaction Revenue ($3,276M - $2,850M = $426M), which the LLM omits. This is a minor omission in completeness but does not invalidate the correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly pulls revenue figures for two different metrics across two years, computes growth, and compares them. It even adds percentage growth rates (29% and 23%), which, while not asked, provide additional insight and are approximately correct. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant and semantically equivalent in conveying the main growth figures and comparison. The only shortcoming is the lack of explicit comparison stating that Data Processing Revenue grew by $426 million more, though the statement 'data-processing revenue added a larger dollar amount' captures the essence.

It also accurately reports that term software licenses represented about 7% of subscription and support revenues, which aligns with the original answer. (2) The quantitative values are correct: 93% for subscription and support as a share of total revenue, and 7% for term software licenses within subscription and support. The LLM adds an interpretation that this is '≈6½ percent of total revenues,' which is a valid derived calculation (7% of 93% ≈ 6.5%) and not contradicted by the ground truth—though this specific inference was not in the original, it is mathematically sound and adds clarity. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly identifies that term software licenses are a subset of subscription and support revenues and synthesizes their relative contribution both within that category and implicitly in total revenue. (4) The only minor deviation is the addition of the ≈6.5% of total revenues interpretation, which, while accurate, slightly extends beyond the original answer. However, since it's a correct inference and enhances understanding without distorting facts, the answer remains highly faithful.

      "original_answer": "The $431 million goodwill impairment charge in 2021 significantly weakened the financial position of the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment, reflecting a decline in its fair value below carrying value due to challenges such as lower facility admissions and ongoing effects of the pandemic. This impairment eliminated the remaining goodwill balance for the LTC unit. At the same time, the prior-year divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business for $850 million, although generating a pre-tax gain reflected in the Health Care Benefits segment, signaled a strategic shift away from certain LTC-related operations. Together, these events indicate a repositioning of the Retail/LTC segment, with reduced asset base and a focus on adapting to sustained operational challenges in the long-term care space.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the quantitative claim that the goodwill impairment lowered the Retail/LTC’s goodwill balance to $10.376 billion. The ground truth states that the $431 million impairment eliminated the *remaining* goodwill balance for the LTC unit, implying the balance went to zero, not $10.376 billion. This is a major error in both direction and magnitude. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly attributes the $850 million Workers’ Compensation divestiture gain to reducing operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment; the original answer notes the gain was reflected in that segment but does not state it reduced operating expenses—this is a mischaracterization. (2) The $431 million and $850 million figures are correctly cited in amount and year, satisfying basic numerical accuracy, but the calculation or implication about the resulting goodwill balance is fundamentally wrong. The claim about cutting GAAP operating income by $431 million is plausible (impairments reduce income), but the downstream balance sheet effect is misrepresented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking the impairment to operational challenges (occupancy, admissions, pandemic) and connecting the divestiture to strategic repositioning is consistent with the original. However, the synthesis fails on key points: the LLM suggests CVS is focusing more on Retail/LTC, while the original indicates a *repositioning away* from certain LTC operations, especially given the goodwill write-off and prior divestiture. The strategic interpretation is therefore skewed. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both the financial impact and strategic direction, uses correct entities (LTC reporting unit, Workers’ Compensation divestiture, 2021), and cites appropriate challenges. However, due to the critical error in goodwill balance and misattribution of the divestiture’s financial effect, the correctness score is limited to 5—partially correct but with significant factual flaws.",

The question specifically asks to compare Acquired IPRD spending to only two items: the Mavacamten rights buy-out ($445M) and the Zenas upfront license fee ($50M), totaling $495M. The LLM’s inclusion of additional payments leads to an incorrect total of $913M for licensing/milestone payments, resulting in the false conclusion that the two amounts are equal. (2) The calculation of $445M + $50M = $495M is correct in the ground truth, and the difference of $913M - $495M = $418M is accurate. The LLM’s calculation of $913M for licensing payments is factually incorrect based on the scope of the question.

(2) The answer addresses all parts of the question: it explains the use of derivatives to manage foreign exchange and interest rate risks, specifies their designation as cash flow and fair value hedges, and acknowledges their lack of material impact on 2023 net earnings. It also correctly infers that the lack of material impact aligns with a risk-minimization strategy rather than speculation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model synthesizes the purpose of the instruments, their accounting treatment, and the implication of immaterial earnings impact to conclude that the strategy is effective in stabilizing results. The reference to 'Note 15, p. 95' adds contextual support, though not required for correctness. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the ground truth explicitly states that the lack of material impact 'likely due to stable market conditions or effective offsetting,' while the LLM implies effectiveness without specifying external factors like market stability.

Even though the format of numbers is acceptable (e.g., $230 million), the values themselves are factually incorrect.

However, there is a minor inconsistency: the LLM states repurchases were 'roughly $4.45 billion' and 'net purchases of $4,451 million', which is correct, but then refers to the net outflow as 'roughly $4.4 billion'—a slight rounding discrepancy (should be ~$4.42B).

Additionally, supplier disruptions caused by labor shortages, production delays, and transportation bottlenecks reduce product availability and increase procurement costs.

Similarly, for 2022, it reports $15.86 (domestic) and $11.76 (global), whereas the correct values are $8.48 (domestic) and $10.99 (global). These numbers are not only wrong but more than double the actual figures, indicating a fundamental error in data sourcing or interpretation. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on incorrect numbers: the LLM computes a 2023 gap of $4.64 and 2022 gap of $4.10, leading to a conclusion that the gap widened by $0.54. In reality, the 2023 gap was $2.21 and 2022 gap was $2.51, so the gap narrowed by $0.30. The direction and magnitude of change are both incorrect.

However, the LLM incorrectly states that total financing activities cash outflow *declined* to $4.359 billion in 2024 from $5.400 billion in 2023, implying an improvement, while the ground truth states that the net cash outflow from financing activities *worsened* by $1,041 million year-over-year. This is a critical contradiction: if outflows decreased from $5.400 bn to $4.359 bn, that would be a $1.041 bn *reduction* in outflow (i.e., improvement), not a worsening. The ground truth claims the opposite — that the outflow *increased* by $1,041 million — which contradicts the numbers provided. Thus, there is a conflict in the ground truth reasoning, but the LLM’s numerical inputs are correct. (2) All numbers are quantitatively accurate: $4,451 million, $3,925 million, $526 million difference, and financing outflows of $4,359 million in 2024 and implied $5,400 million in 2023 (difference of $1,041 million) are consistent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound — the LLM synthesizes share transaction data and total financing cash flows across years, correctly identifying that higher debt issuance offset the larger buyback. (4) The LLM answer is contextually fully relevant and semantically close, but the interpretation of the impact on financing activities contradicts the ground truth’s qualitative conclusion despite matching its numbers. Given that the LLM’s numbers are correct and internally consistent, and the ground truth contains contradictory logic (smaller outflow labeled as 'worsening'), the LLM should not be penalized heavily. However, since the task is to match the ground truth, and it does not fully align on the directional impact, a score of 7 is justified for correctness.",

The increase in Total Paid Members is correctly calculated as 5.2 million (from 65.8M to 71.0M), which matches the ground truth. However, the LLM incorrectly attributes the $24 million figure to Business Affiliate Revenue growth based on an assumed $60 annual fee and 400,000 new Business members. This reasoning is not supported by the original answer and introduces unverified assumptions. (2) Number verification: The 5.2 million member increase is accurate. The $24 million revenue increase is factually wrong—$400 million is the correct figure per ground truth. The 400k Business member increase is not mentioned in the original answer and appears to be inferred incorrectly. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: The model fails to correctly synthesize the actual Business Affiliate Revenue growth and instead attempts a bottom-up calculation using assumptions not present in the ground truth. It also fails to make the correct comparison that revenue growth outpaced membership growth. Instead, it concludes the revenue gain was 'modest,' which contradicts the original conclusion. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual inaccuracy in the key metric.

'Nonoperating income, other' rose from $134 million to $332 million ($198 million increase), and 'Post-in-service equity returns' increased from $34 million to $39 million ($5 million increase). The sum of the two component changes is $198M + $5M = $203M, which matches the ground truth. (2) All calculations are accurate, including the individual changes and their sum. The comparison correctly notes that the $206M total change is $3M larger than the $203M sum of components. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across the same time period (2022–2023) for Duke Energy, correctly identifies the relevant line items, computes changes, and compares the aggregate change to the sum of sub-components. (4) The only minor difference from the original answer is that the LLM does not explicitly state that the close alignment 'indicates a strong correlation'—a qualitative inference present in the ground truth. However, the factual and numerical content is fully correct, and the conclusion drawn (a $3M difference) is valid and relevant. Thus, the answer is semantically equivalent in substance, with only slight omission of interpretive language, warranting a high score but not perfect on qualitative accuracy.",

However, there is a critical error in the qualitative accuracy: the LLM states that the $81 million is included in 'Other income (expense), net' on the income statement, whereas the ground truth explicitly states it is included in 'Interest expense'. This misrepresentation affects the reasoning and synthesis of how the reclassification impacts the income statement, which is a key part of the question. The mention of 'page 101' and 'page 102' suggests document referencing, but the incorrect mapping of the income statement line item indicates flawed multi-hop reasoning.

According to the ground truth, Life Sciences Solutions' operating profit in 2024 was $69 million, not $3.503 billion as stated by the LLM. Similarly, the 2023 operating profit was $105 million, not $3.420 billion. These errors drastically inflate the combined totals: LLM reports $13.134 billion for 2024 (vs. correct $9,700 million or $9.7 billion) and $13.397 billion for 2023 (vs. correct $10,082 million or $10.082 billion). The difference is reported as $263 million decrease, but the correct decrease is $382 million. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM's incorrect numbers but do not match the ground truth. The correct 2024 sum is $9,631M + $69M = $9,700M; LLM computes $9,631M + $3,503M = $13,134M — a massive overstatement due to wrong operating profit. Same issue in 2023. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound — the model identifies the need to sum revenue and operating profit for two years and compare — but it fails at entity and metric identification: it likely confused 'operating profit' with 'total company operating income' or misread segment income. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right company, segment, years, and required metrics.

The LLM's reported value of -$19.1 million is off by more than two orders of magnitude, likely due to a misreading of units (e.g., confusing thousands with millions or misreading individual entries). Additionally, the 'Thereafter' period impact is stated as $3.7 million, but the correct value is $3,694 million—again, a severe unit error. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are profound: the model fails to correctly extract even the individual yearly values, and the summation is entirely incorrect. The ground truth involves multi-year data that must be summed accurately, but the LLM appears to have either summed the wrong numbers or applied incorrect scaling. (3) The reasoning is flawed—while the model attempts to compare the 2022–2026 period with 'Thereafter', the conclusion is undermined by gross numerical errors. It does not demonstrate proper multi-hop synthesis across years, and the comparison between negative near-term impact and positive long-term impact is lost due to incorrect magnitudes.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in terms of the core facts. The ground truth states that the difference in average monthly revenue per paying membership between the two datasets is $1.02, with values of $7.64 and $8.66 in 2023. The LLM instead reports a $4.64 difference between $16.28 (U.S./Canada) and $11.64 (global), which are not the values in the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM references geographic segments (U.S./Canada vs global), while the original question refers to 'two presented data sets' without specifying geography—implying different reporting metrics or sources, not regions. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the dollar amounts, differences, and year-over-year changes do not match the ground truth. The LLM claims U.S./Canada ARPU was $16.28 (up from $15.86) and global was $11.64 (down from $11.76), but these numbers are not aligned with the ground truth values of $7.64 and $8.66 in 2023. The 10% decline and 2% increase in the ground truth are completely absent in the LLM response. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The LLM fails to identify that the two data sets refer to different internal metrics or reporting segments (possibly ad-tier vs. standard-tier memberships, or different accounting methods), and instead fabricates a geographic comparison not supported by the question or ground truth. There is no synthesis matching the required comparison between two non-geographic data sets. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the LLM introduces geographic segmentation not mentioned in the question or verified in the ground truth. While it attempts to compute differences and trends, the entities and numbers are mismatched, leading to a factually incorrect and misleading answer. Minor credit is given for attempting to compute a difference and year-over-year change, but the core data is wrong.",

The ground truth states the total value of Property, Equipment, and Intangible Assets acquired by NVDA from 2020 to 2022 was $627 million, but the LLM claims $3.11 billion—over five times larger—based solely on the Mellanox acquisition in FY2020. This contradicts the verified data of $212M in 2020, $157M in 2021, and $258M in 2022. (2) The numbers cited by the LLM—$144 million in property & equipment and $2.970 billion in intangibles—are inconsistent with the knowledge graph's ground truth for that period. Even if Mellanox were the only acquisition, the reported figures do not align with the aggregated $627M total across three years. Additionally, the LLM fails to report the correct multi-year sum or annual breakdown. (3) The reasoning is flawed: it focuses on a single acquisition (Mellanox) and extrapolates it as representative, but does not synthesize data across the three fiscal years as required. It also misattributes the entire asset value to liability-financed acquisition without confirming whether those liabilities offset the full value—information not present in the ground truth. (4) While the general idea of NVDA acquiring intangible assets for technology/IP has some strategic plausibility, the answer fabricates specific financials and omits the actual trend (fluctuating but increasing, with a peak in 2022). The contextual relevance is low because it answers a different question—about one deal—rather than the three-year total and strategy trend.

      "original_answer": "The increase in Executive Membership fees is expected to contribute approximately $190 million in additional revenue during fiscal 2025. This increase is linked to the high global member renewal rate of 90.5% and the strong penetration of Executive memberships, which accounted for approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024.

The ground truth states that GM's Total Net Sales and Revenue increased by $4,519 million (3.7%), but the LLM reports a $4.575 billion ($4,575 million) increase, or 4.7%, which is incorrect. The correct calculation from the ground truth values would be $101,252 million (2021) - $96,733 million (2020) = $4,519 million, confirming the original answer. The LLM’s 4.7% growth is also inaccurate—(4,575 / 96,733) ≈ 4.73%, which stems from incorrect input numbers. (2) Regarding adjusted EBIT, the ground truth states it *worsened* by $309 million (34.8% increase in loss), indicating declining profitability. However, the LLM claims adjusted EBIT *grew* from $9.071B to $10.318B with a 13.7% increase, implying improvement—this is the opposite of the truth. This suggests the LLM misread EBIT loss as positive growth, failing to recognize the context of deterioration. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks for a comparison between revenue growth and change in adjusted EBIT (loss), requiring correct synthesis across two financial metrics and years. The LLM incorrectly interprets the direction of EBIT change, leading to a completely reversed conclusion (profitability improving vs. deteriorating). (4) Despite using plausible numbers and citing a page reference, the core quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies—especially the misrepresentation of EBIT as improving when it worsened—severely undermine the answer.

      "original_answer": "The total net cash impact from issuances and purchases of ordinary shares for Linde plc in 2024 is -$4,451 million (issuances of $31 million minus purchases of $4,482 million). This net cash outflow is a significant component of the overall net cash used for financing activities, which totaled $4,359 million. The company ended the year with $4,850 million in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting a small increase of $186 million from the beginning-of-period balance despite the large outflows from share repurchases.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024 Linde received $31 million from issuances of ordinary shares but spent $4,482 million repurchasing them, producing a net cash outflow of roughly **$4.45 billion** from those share‑related activities【page_48】.  Over the same period, the company’s **cash and cash equivalents increased by $186 million**【page_48】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies all key numerical values: $31 million in issuances, $4,482 million in purchases, resulting in a net cash outflow of $4,451 million (rounded to $4.45 billion, which is semantically equivalent and acceptable). The change in cash and cash equivalents is accurately reported as a $186 million increase. These figures match the ground truth exactly in substance, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'billion' vs 'million' scale, but value is correct). (2) Calculations are accurate: $31M - $4,482M = -$4,451M ≈ -$4.45B, correctly interpreted as a net outflow. The comparison to the change in cash is properly framed: despite large outflows, cash increased slightly. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM synthesizes data on share transactions and links it to the overall change in cash, showing understanding of how financing activities affect cash balances. (4) The answer is highly relevant and factually complete, though it omits the mention of total financing outflows ($4,359 million) and ending cash balance ($4,850 million), which are part of the full context but not directly asked. Since the question only asks for the net cash impact from share activities and how that compares to the change in cash, the omission does not detract from correctness. Wording is clear and semantically aligned with the ground truth.",

      "question": "How did the changes in Walmart International's gross profit rate for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, driven by format/channel shifts and supply chain efficiencies respectively, cumulatively impact the segment's operating income over the two-year period?",
      "original_answer": "The gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 due to growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts, contributing to a $0.8 billion decline in operating income. In fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points due to supply chain efficiencies (partially offset by format and channel shifts), which helped drive a $1.9 billion increase in operating income. Therefore, the cumulative impact of these changes in gross profit rate across the two years resulted in a net $1.1 billion increase in operating income ($1.9B - $0.8B).",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2023 Walmart International’s gross‑profit rate fell 50 basis points as lower‑margin formats and channels expanded, which helped drive a $0.8 billion drop in segment operating income. In fiscal 2024 the rate rose 20 basis points on supply‑chain efficiencies, underpinning a $1.9 billion increase in operating income.

(1) All key facts are accurately reported: the 50 basis point decline in gross profit rate in fiscal 2023 due to lower-margin format/channel growth (specifically in China and category mix in the original, though the LLM omits location/detail but retains core cause), leading to a $0.8 billion drop in operating income; the 20 basis point increase in fiscal 2024 due to supply chain efficiencies (with partial offset from format shifts, mentioned in original but not LLM), resulting in a $1.9 billion increase in operating income. (2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect: both dollar amounts ($0.8B decrease, $1.9B increase) are correct, and the net impact of $1.1 billion increase ($1.9B - $0.8B) is correctly implied as a 'net operating-income gain of roughly $1.1 billion'. Minor rounding ('roughly') is acceptable and does not affect correctness. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes two years of data, identifies the direction and magnitude of gross profit rate changes, links each to operating income impact, and computes the cumulative effect. (4) Entity accuracy is maintained: Walmart International, fiscal 2023 and 2024, gross profit rate, operating income—all correctly referenced. The LLM omits some contextual nuance (e.g., China, category mix, partial offset in 2024) but retains all critical causal and quantitative elements required to answer the question.

      "original_answer": "The company has elected to pay the Toll Tax over an eight-year period from 2018 through 2025, which provides a defined future payment schedule for this specific tax liability. However, despite this structured payment plan, the company states it 'cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows' for its $2.02 billion in noncurrent income tax payables unrelated to the Toll Tax. This contrast highlights that while the Toll Tax payments are predictable, the remaining tax liabilities are complex and uncertain, limiting the company's ability to project overall future tax-related cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "The company has elected to pay the $2.149 billion “Toll Tax” over an eight‑year schedule—$253.7 million due in less than one year, $1.11 billion in 1‑3 years and $785.9 million in 3‑5 years—so the cash outflows for that portion are known and can be estimated.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the structured payment schedule for the Toll Tax and contrasts it with the uncertainty around the remaining $2.02 billion in noncurrent income tax liabilities, which aligns with the ground truth. However, there is a discrepancy in the total Toll Tax amount: the LLM states $2.149 billion, while the original answer implies the sum of the scheduled payments should be consistent with known disclosures (though the exact total isn't provided in the ground truth, the breakdown adds to $2.1496 billion, which may be accurate). The ground truth does not specify the $253.7M, $1.11B, and $785.9M breakdowns, so unless these are factually correct in the source data, their inclusion introduces unverified precision. (2) The quantitative breakdown of the Toll Tax payments—$253.7M (short-term), $1.11B (1–3 years), and $785.9M (3–5 years)—sums to $2.1496B, which matches the stated total. However, the original answer does not include these specific tranches, so unless they are from the actual filing, this could be hallucinated detail. The $2.02B for non-Toll Tax liabilities is correct and matches the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between the predictable cash flows of the Toll Tax and the uncertainty of other tax liabilities, drawing the appropriate contrast in estimability. This reflects proper synthesis of the implications of payment timing on cash flow forecasting. (4) The answer is contextually excellent and conveys the core insight: known schedule for Toll Tax vs. inability to estimate timing for other liabilities. The quantitative accuracy is slightly penalized because the detailed payment tranches are not in the ground truth and may not be verifiable from the provided context, risking over-specificity.

The percentage increase from 2020 to 2021 is reported as 'roughly 50%', while the exact ground truth is 50.4%. This minor rounding is acceptable under semantic equivalence. The decrease from 2019 to 2020 is correctly characterized as about 6%, versus the precise 6.1%—again, a negligible difference in context. (2) Calculations are accurate: ($71.612B - $47.603B) / $47.603B ≈ 50.4%, and ($47.603B - $50.722B) / $50.722B ≈ -6.1%. The LLM correctly computes and labels both the increase and decrease.

(2) All numbers are accurate and properly formatted; $145 million, $31 million, and $186 million are all correct. The additional detail of $4.85 billion in cash at year-end is not part of the ground truth provided, but does not contradict it and may reflect supplementary context from the filing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the cost reduction program to both Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow from operations, and infers the net effect on cash position via the increase in cash and equivalents. The original answer notes a 'net positive impact of $176 million' (sum of $145M + $31M), but emphasizes the $186M cash increase as the observed outcome. The LLM focuses on the $186M observed change rather than the $176M theoretical sum, which is more directly supported by the cash flow statement and thus arguably more accurate. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addresses all parts of the question, and conveys semantically equivalent (and slightly more detailed) information. The only minor gap is not explicitly breaking down the $176M net contribution before the $186M cash increase, but since the $186M is the actual reported change and includes other factors likely, the LLM’s focus on the realized cash increase is appropriate.

(2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect: both dollar amounts are correct, and the breakdown of the $7,451.7 million into its regional components (U.S. & Canada, Africa & APAC, Europe, Latin America) sums to the correct total (4,377.2 + 827.5 + 525.3 + 1,187.7 = 7,451.7). The comparison stating that Data Centers is 'about one-fourteenth' of the total is reasonable: 1/14 ≈ 7.14%, which closely matches the ground truth percentage of 7.17%. The phrase 'roughly $7 billion less' is a reasonable approximation (7,451.7 - 534.0 = 6,917.7 million ≈ $6.92 billion).

According to the ground truth, the net impact was a *positive* $334 million ($389M gain on sale minus $55M restructuring charges). The LLM not only gets the sign wrong (negative vs positive) but also the magnitude ($200M vs $334M). This is a major quantitative and directional error. (2) The numbers are not accurate: $0.2 billion ($200 million) is significantly different from the correct net gain of $334 million. The individual components ($389M gain and $55M charge) are not mentioned, and their correct netting is absent. The claim of a reduction contradicts the actual net gain. (3) The reasoning is flawed in the multi-hop synthesis: the model fails to correctly combine the gain on sale and restructuring charges, incorrectly framing them as a net reduction rather than a net increase. It also does not reflect that both items were absent in 2021, though it correctly notes the absence of such charges in 2021, which aligns with the ground truth. (4) Despite the severe factual and quantitative errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right company (MMM/3M), the correct years (2020 vs 2021), and the right topic (divestiture-related impacts on operating income).

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's acquisition-related adjustments contributed 2.3% to its GAAP gross margin, increasing the Non-GAAP gross margin from 40.0% to 43.6%. In 2021, the same adjustments contributed 1.6%, increasing the GAAP gross margin from 55.4% to 58.1%. This reveals that Intel's acquisition strategy had a larger financial impact on its core operational performance in 2023 than in 2021, as the adjustments to gross margin were higher, indicating a greater influence of amortization charges from acquisitions on the company's reported Non-GAAP performance.",

These figures are quantitatively accurate with correct formatting (percentage points, years, and margins). (2) All calculations are implicitly correct—the differences between GAAP and Non-GAAP margins match the stated adjustment amounts (43.6% - 40.0% = 3.6%, but the adjustment is 2.3% of gross margin, not a direct percentage point addition; however, the phrasing '2.3% of gross margin' aligns with the original answer’s intent and typical SEC filing language, so this is acceptable). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly compares 2023 to 2021, identifies the increasing impact of acquisition-related adjustments, and infers implications about Intel’s acquisition strategy. The conclusion differs slightly in emphasis—stating that acquisitions add 'non-core expense without fundamentally weakening underlying performance'—which is a valid interpretation but slightly reframes the original answer’s point about greater influence on Non-GAAP performance. (4) Entity accuracy is perfect: Intel, 2021, 2023, GAAP/Non-GAAP gross margin, and acquisition-related adjustments are all correctly identified and contextualized.

The absolute difference in growth (4.1M - 3.2M = 0.9M) is accurately stated. (2) All calculations are correct: the increases are properly computed, and the comparison (0.9 million greater growth in total paid members) is accurate. The additional percentage (28%) is a reasonable approximation (0.9 / 3.2 ≈ 28.125%) and adds context not in the original answer but does not contradict it. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two metrics and two years, compares their growth, and draws a valid conclusion. (4) The only minor deviation is the use of 'million' units instead of thousands (e.g., 61,700 vs 61.7 million), but this is semantically equivalent and widely accepted. The original answer uses thousands, while the LLM uses millions—this is a formatting difference, not a factual error. No entities, years, or metrics are incorrect.

(1) The total net income for Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders in 2023 is correctly stated as $2.735 billion (equivalent to $2,735 million), which matches the ground truth. However, the second-quarter loss is incorrectly reported as $955 million, whereas the ground truth specifies a net loss of $234 million in the second quarter. This is a major factual discrepancy. (2) The calculation of the percentage is therefore also incorrect: the LLM computes ≈34.9% using $955M ÷ $2,735M, but the correct figure is $234M ÷ $2,735M ≈ 8.56%, as stated in the original answer. The LLM likely confused the $955 million figure with another line item (possibly related to discontinued operations or another company), which reflects a failure in entity or metric identification. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—linking quarterly loss to annual net income as a percentage—is logically sound in structure, but based on incorrect data, rendering the synthesis invalid. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question (annual income and percentage comparison), so it is relevant, but the severe numerical inaccuracies drastically reduce correctness. Wording and format variations (e.g., $2.735 billion vs $2,735 million) are acceptable and correctly interpreted.

While it correctly identifies the overall increase in Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax, as $132 million ($1,455M in 2023 vs $1,323M in 2022), it incorrectly attributes only $108 million of this change to the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups, citing a decline from -$1,349 million to -$1,457 million.

(2) The calculation of the overall change in discontinued operations is correct ($1,455M - $1,323M = $132M), but the LLM introduces a conflicting figure for the Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups’ contribution ($108M worsening), which contradicts the ground truth that this group is responsible for the full $132M increase. This suggests either a misattribution or confusion with another entity or time period. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM identifies the correct time frame, metric, and entity (Duke Energy, Commercial Renewables Disposal Groups, Loss from Discontinued Operations)—but fails in synthesis by introducing a different loss amount for the disposal group that does not align with the overall company-level change. (4) Correctness is scored low due to the core error in attribution: the question asks specifically how much the lower results impacted the year-over-year change, and the answer must be $132 million. By stating only $108 million was due to this group, the LLM underreports the impact. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect figures for the disposal group’s performance.

      "original_answer": "The total dollar value of common shares purchased by the company in treasury across 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $2,790 million ($546 million in 2019, $193 million in 2020, and $2,051 million in 2021). The significant increase in share repurchases in 2021 compared to the prior two years reflects a more aggressive capital allocation strategy toward returning value to shareholders through buybacks, particularly in 2021 when the company spent over $2 billion on treasury share purchases.",
      "llm_answer": "Abbott spent roughly **$2.79 billion** on treasury‑stock purchases over the three‑year span – about **$546 million in 2019**, **$193 million in 2020**, and a much larger **$2.05 billion in 2021**【page_48】. The modest repurchases in 2019‑2020 gave way to a sharply higher buy‑back in 2021, indicating that the company moved toward a more aggressive share‑repurchase strategy as cash generation strengthened, using excess capital to return value to shareholders while still managing its overall capital allocation.",

The total of $2.79 billion matches the ground truth sum ($546M + $193M + $2,051M = $2,790M). (2) All numeric values are accurate and correctly formatted, with acceptable variations in presentation (e.g., $2.05 billion vs $2,051 million). The sum is correct and consistent with the original answer. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly observes the trend of modest repurchases in 2019–2020 followed by a sharp increase in 2021, and accurately infers that this reflects a shift toward a more aggressive capital allocation strategy focused on shareholder returns via buybacks. The mention of strengthening cash generation as a driver adds contextual insight without contradicting the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "The gross profit rate for Walmart International decreased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. Meanwhile, Sam's Club experienced a 155 basis point decrease in gross profit rate, primarily driven by inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. These two segments' negative impacts collectively contributed to a significant decline in Walmart's overall gross profit rate for fiscal 2023, reflecting broad-based margin pressures across both international operations and the membership-based retail segment.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2023 Walmart’s consolidated gross‑profit rate fell 98 basis points to 23.5% (down from 24.4% in 2022) because the Walmart International segment’s gross‑profit rate dropped 50 bps and Sam’s Club’s fell 155 bps【page_41†L13-L16】【page_43†L31-L34】【page_44†L1-L4】. The International decline was driven by continued growth in lower‑margin formats and channels—especially in China—and a shift toward lower‑margin categories, while Sam’s Club’s decline resulted from inventory markdowns, higher supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges【page_43†L31-L34】【page_44†L1-L4】.",

It also accurately states the consolidated gross profit rate decline of 98 basis points to 23.5% (from 24.4%), which aligns with the multi-hop synthesis required. These quantitative figures are all factually correct and properly attributed. (2) All numbers, percentages, and basis point changes are accurate. The calculation of the overall decline (24.4% to 23.5% = 98 bps) is correct, and the segment-level declines (50 bps and 155 bps) match the source. No calculation errors. Format variations (e.g., '50 bps' vs '50 basis points') are acceptable and semantically equivalent. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly links the segment-level declines to the overall gross profit rate impact, and accurately describes the key drivers—growth in lower-margin formats in China and category mix for International, and inventory markdowns, supply chain/eCommerce costs, and LIFO charges for Sam's Club. These match the ground truth drivers. The only minor omission is that the LLM does not explicitly state that these two segments' declines 'collectively contributed to a significant decline' in the overall rate in the same qualitative phrasing as the original, though the implication is clear from context. (4) The answer is highly relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the collective impact on overall gross profit rate and the key drivers. The inclusion of citation markers (e.g., page_41†L13-L16) suggests grounding in source material. Overall, the answer is factually complete and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, warranting a high correctness score with only a slight deduction in qualitative accuracy for slightly less explicit synthesis of the collective impact.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains partially correct information but has a significant error in the quantitative calculation of the change in provision for (benefit from) taxes. The ground truth states a decrease of $1,162 million, while the LLM reports a $664 million decrease (from a $249M benefit to a $913M benefit). However, this reasoning is flawed: a larger tax benefit (i.e., moving from $249M to $913M benefit) actually represents a decrease in tax expense, but the magnitude is miscalculated. The correct difference is $913M - $249M = $664M increase in benefit, which equates to a $664M reduction in tax provision — so while the direction and interpretation ('larger tax benefit') are correct, the original answer claims a $1,162M decrease, which does not match. Thus, the LLM's number contradicts the ground truth. (2) Net income figures are approximately correct: LLM reports $8.0B in 2022 and $1.7B in 2023 (vs. ground truth $8,017M and $1,675M), and the drop of $6.3B matches closely with the actual $6,342M decline. These are acceptable rounding approximations. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly identifies the relationship between tax provision changes and net income impact, and synthesizes data across years. However, the core tax provision change is incorrect per the knowledge graph, undermining full accuracy. (4) Contextual relevance is high — all parts of the question are addressed, with proper focus on tax provision change and net income impact. Wording and logic are clear and relevant. Final scores reflect partial correctness on numbers, especially the key tax provision difference, which is off by $498M compared to ground truth.",

The ground truth states these charges had a pre-tax impact of $1 billion and an after-tax impact of $896 million due to deconsolidation of Russian subsidiaries. However, the LLM incorrectly reports the 2022 pre-tax charge as $103 million and after-tax impact as $73 million, which is drastically lower. The 2024 figures are correct: $145 million pre-tax and $110 million after-tax (after $35 million tax benefit). (2) Calculations: The LLM correctly computes the 2024 after-tax impact ($145M - $35M = $110M), but uses incorrect 2022 figures. The total after-tax impact is therefore wrong: $110M + $73M = $183M (LLM) vs. the correct $110M + $896M = $1,006M ≈ $1,112M (ground truth accounts for additional nuances in tax effects). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across years and charges but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for 2022, undermining the entire synthesis. It does correctly identify the need to compute after-tax impacts and sum them, showing sound reasoning structure but flawed data input. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major numerical inaccuracies despite partial calculation logic. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because the 2022 numbers are off by nearly an order of magnitude.

For other comprehensive income, the LLM reports $3,418 million, but the correct total is $4,418 million (sum of -$1,364M + $956M + $3,826M). The individual yearly values are correctly cited, but the sum is miscalculated by $1 billion. (2) Despite correct sourcing of individual yearly figures, the failure to sum them accurately undermines the core of the question, which asks for cumulative totals. The comparison between the two line items is therefore also flawed—the LLM claims a $3.44 billion difference, but this stems from its incorrect totals. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the model identifies the correct metric, time period, and company, and attempts multi-hop synthesis across three years. However, the failure to correctly aggregate the values represents a critical flaw in quantitative reasoning. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question, uses proper financial terminology, and attempts a meaningful comparison. However, due to major calculation errors, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are significantly reduced. Minor formatting issues (e.g., '‑$19 million' vs $91 million) do not affect scoring, but the factual inaccuracy in totals does.",

However, it incorrectly calculated the contribution percentage: it states Household card growth accounted for 'about 44%' of the total increase, whereas the correct figure is 71% (3,200 / 7,300 ≈ 0.438 → but ground truth states 71%, indicating a discrepancy in underlying data or logic).

(2) Number verification: The starting and ending values for Household cards (49,900 to 53,100) and total cardholders (111,600 to 118,900) are correct, and the differences (3,200 and 7,300) are accurate. However, the percentage calculation (3,200 / 7,300 ≈ 43.8%) contradicts the ground truth's 71%, suggesting either a data inconsistency or misattribution in the model's source. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly synthesized data across two metrics and time points but failed in the final inference—determining the proportional contribution. The 44% figure is mathematically derived from the correct numbers but conflicts with the ground truth's 71%, indicating either a knowledge graph error or a misinterpretation of what 'Household cards' represents within total cardholders.

This introduces a 1,000x overstatement of the actual shares earned, which is a severe quantitative inaccuracy. The difference is reported as 'about 176 thousand shares', which would be correct if the units were accurate, but given the error in magnitude, this calculation is also misleading. (2) The percentages (106% in 2023, 118% in 2024) are correctly stated, and the direction of change (increase in payout leading to more shares) is logically sound. However, the numerical scale of shares is completely off, undermining the factual reliability.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the total 2021 Cost Reduction Program charges as $338 million, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly reports cash payments as $153 million instead of the correct $138 million. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the unpaid amount: $338M - $153M - $41M = $144M (LLM), whereas the correct calculation is $338M - $138M - $41M = $159M (ground truth). The non-cash charges of $41 million are correctly reported. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are significant—while the total charge is correct, the cash payment figure is off by $15 million, leading to a $15 million error in the final unpaid balance. This affects the core of the question, which hinges on accurate calculation after payments and non-cash charges. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—LLM attempts the correct multi-hop logic: total charges minus cash payments minus non-cash charges = unpaid amount. However, due to the incorrect cash payment input, the synthesis fails to produce the correct result. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses all parts of the question, uses appropriate financial terminology, and cites a source page. However, the critical numerical error in cash payments undermines factual correctness, warranting a moderate score of 4/10 for overall correctness. Quantitative accuracy is penalized heavily (4/10) due to the material miscalculation, while qualitative reasoning (5/10) reflects correct logic with faulty data. Contextual relevance remains high (9/10) as the answer is well-structured and directly responsive.",

The ground truth states the total reallocation for Class A shares was $5,174 million in 2021 and $2,307 million in 2019, with a difference of $2,867 million. However, the LLM incorrectly calculates the 2021 total as $4,593 million (by subtracting $581 million from $5,174 million) and the 2019 total as $2,181 million (by subtracting $126 million from $2,307 million), which are not supported by the original answer or question. These subtractions appear to misinterpret 'conversion reallocation' and 'other reallocation' as components to net out, but the original answer presents the totals directly without such breakdowns. (2) The calculations are therefore incorrect: $5,174M - $581M = $4,593M (wrong), and $2,307M - $126M = $2,181M (also wrong in context), leading to an incorrect difference of $2,412M instead of the correct $2,867M. The model fails to report the actual total reallocations and computes an inaccurate comparison. (3) While the model attempts multi-hop reasoning by referencing components across years and performing arithmetic, it introduces unsupported breakdowns not required by the question. The original answer does not mention splitting reallocations into 'conversion' and 'other' for the purpose of deriving totals, so this reasoning is extraneous and erroneous. (4) Despite incorrect numbers and flawed reasoning, the answer is contextually relevant—addressing the right metric, share class, and years—and attempts a direct comparison.

      "original_answer": "Georgia Power, as a subsidiary of Southern Company, has significant asset retirement obligations (AROs) tied to the decommissioning of its nuclear facilities, including Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. These AROs are calculated based on present value techniques and are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset, impacting depreciation and long-term liabilities. Additionally, the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 faces uncertainties regarding cost recovery, as noted by the involvement of external monitors, regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission, and ongoing Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews. These uncertainties raise the risk that Georgia Power may not fully recover its investment, which could lead to financial statement adjustments or regulatory liabilities for Southern Company. Together, these factors increase Southern Company's exposure to both long-term financial obligations and regulatory challenges, directly affecting its balance sheet and disclosure requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Georgia Power’s nuclear decommissioning costs are accounted for as asset‑retirement obligations that are capitalized, depreciated and shown as regulatory assets or liabilities; the associated trust‑fund investments are reported at fair value with gains‑and‑losses recorded in the regulatory‑liability line rather than net income, so any disallowance by state commissions would directly affect earnings and cash flow. The uncertain cost overruns and schedule delays for Vogtle Units 3‑4 have forced Southern Company to record a $1.692 billion pre‑tax loss in 2021 and to carry $8.6 billion of construction‑in‑progress, creating a regulatory‑risk exposure that the Georgia Public Service Commission may not permit full recovery of those costs. Together, the nuclear decommissioning AROs and Vogtle construction uncertainties drive significant disclosures, affect reported profit, and heighten the company’s exposure to regulatory‑rate‑recovery risk.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct and addresses the core aspects of the question with strong qualitative reasoning and contextual relevance. It accurately identifies Georgia Power's asset retirement obligations (AROs) related to nuclear decommissioning and explains their accounting treatment—capitalization, depreciation, and reporting via regulatory assets/liabilities—with accurate mention of trust-fund investments being reported at fair value and gains/losses flowing to regulatory liabilities rather than net income. This aligns semantically with the ground truth’s emphasis on AROs impacting long-term liabilities and depreciation. The LLM also correctly highlights the regulatory risk from Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction uncertainties, including scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission and the financial impact on Southern Company. However, the quantitative accuracy is slightly compromised: the $1.692 billion pre-tax loss in 2021 and $8.6 billion construction-in-progress figure, while plausible and consistent with public filings, are not present in the provided ground truth, which does not include specific dollar amounts or a 2021 loss. Since the evaluation must be based solely on alignment with the original answer (ground truth), these specific figures cannot be verified and thus represent unconfirmed additions. The ground truth emphasizes the risk of non-recovery and potential financial adjustments but does not quantify them. Despite this, the LLM correctly infers the implications—regulatory risk, impact on earnings, disclosures, and profit—that are logically supported by the original answer. The multi-hop reasoning (linking Georgia Power’s obligations to Southern Company’s consolidated financial reporting and regulatory exposure) is sound and well-synthesized. Therefore, while the core facts and logic are correct and the answer is highly relevant, the inclusion of unverified specific figures reduces quantitative accuracy, warranting a score of 8 for correctness.",

The increase of $4,119 million compared to the prior year is not requested in the question and introduces irrelevant data.

      "question": "Given the recurring reach-forward losses on two major fixed-price contracts in the Aeronautics and RMS business segments, how does the negative impact on profit booking rates affect Lockheed Martin's consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments and segment operating profit in 2023?",
      "original_answer": "The recurring reach-forward losses on two major fixed-price contracts — one in the Aeronautics segment with cumulative losses of $270 million and another in the RMS segment with cumulative losses of $280 million — directly reduce Lockheed Martin's profit booking rates. Since profit booking rate adjustments are recognized in the current period and reflect inception-to-date changes, these losses would have negatively impacted the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments. Despite these losses, Lockheed Martin still reported a consolidated net profit booking rate adjustment that increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion in 2023. This indicates that favorable adjustments on other contracts outweighed the unfavorable impacts of the Aeronautics and RMS contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "The reach‑forward losses on the Aeronautics classified fixed‑price incentive‑fee contract (≈ $270 million) and the RMS ground‑radar program (≈ $280 million) have pushed the profit‑booking rates on those contracts lower, which in turn trims the overall net‑profit‑booking‑rate adjustments and the operating profit they would otherwise generate.  Even with those unfavorable adjustments, Lockheed Martin’s consolidated net‑profit‑booking‑rate adjustments still added about **$1.6 billion to net sales in 2023** and **lifted segment operating profit by roughly $1.6 billion (≈ $1.3 billion after‑tax)** for the year【page_64†L1-L9】【page_64†L10-L13】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the two reach-forward losses—$270 million in Aeronautics and $280 million in RMS—and their negative impact on profit booking rates, which aligns with the ground truth. It accurately states that despite these losses, Lockheed Martin’s consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments still increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion in 2023. However, there is a minor but notable error: the LLM claims the $1.6 billion 'added about $1.6 billion to net sales,' which is incorrect. The ground truth specifies this amount lifted segment operating profit, not net sales. This misstatement affects quantitative accuracy. Additionally, the after-tax figure of $1.3 billion is not present in the original answer and appears to be an unsupported addition. (2) The core numbers ($270M, $280M, $1.6B) are correct and properly attributed. The calculation of net impact (that favorable adjustments outweighed the $550M total losses) is implied correctly, though not explicitly calculated. The error in attributing the $1.6B to net sales instead of operating profit is a material misrepresentation of financial impact. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links contract-level losses to segment-level profit booking rates, then to consolidated adjustments and overall segment operating profit. It correctly infers that other favorable adjustments offset the losses. The logic chain is coherent and reflects understanding of how forward-loss provisions affect consolidated financials. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing the question about impacts on consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments and segment operating profit. Despite the error in financial statement attribution, the core conclusion—that negative impacts were outweighed by positive adjustments—is preserved. The scores reflect high accuracy with a deduction for the net sales misstatement and the unverified after-tax figure.",

However, it incorrectly states that the 2023 value is $14 million higher than 2022, when in fact $24,346 million is $14 million *higher* than $24,332 million — but the ground truth claims this is a *decrease*, which contradicts the numbers. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth's narrative. Based on the numbers alone, the LLM's calculation of a $14 million increase is mathematically correct: $24,346M - $24,332M = +$14M.

The question asks for the increase in *revenue* (a financial metric), but the LLM response discusses *membership growth* (number of members), which is not equivalent. The ground truth states that domestic commercial risk-based *revenue* increased by $70 million and fee-based *revenue* by $560 million. The LLM incorrectly reports these as member increases (70 thousand and 560 thousand members), confusing units and metrics entirely. (2) The numbers cited (70 thousand, 560 thousand) are misinterpreted—these are not revenue figures but membership counts, and the units are off by orders of magnitude (thousands of people vs. millions of dollars). Additionally, the LLM claims the risk-based segment grew by 70 thousand members, but the ground truth does not support this—there is no mention of membership changes in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not extract or synthesize the correct financial data from the documents. Instead, it substituted a related but irrelevant metric (membership) for revenue, leading to a completely incorrect comparison. (4) While the structure of the response attempts a valid comparison between two segments, the factual basis is wrong. The contextual relevance is moderate because it discusses UnitedHealthcare's domestic commercial segments over 2022–2023, but the core metric is incorrect, severely undermining accuracy.

It also accurately reports the projected decline from $131 million in 2024 to $56 million in 2026, a total decline of $75 million, which aligns with the ground truth. The breakdown of the decline into $58 million (2024 to 2025) and $17 million (2025 to 2026) is consistent with the stated values ($131 to $73 to $56 implies a $58 drop then $17 drop), so calculations are correct.

While it correctly reports SPG's 2024 consolidated net income as $2.729 billion ($2,729,021 thousand) and 2023 as $2.617 billion ($2,617,018 thousand), it incorrectly characterizes the unconsolidated entities' contribution as a 'loss' in both years. According to the ground truth, SPG had a *positive* share of income from unconsolidated entities: $207,322 thousand in 2024 and $375,663 thousand in 2023. The LLM incorrectly states these as 'losses', which completely inverts the financial reality. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: the LLM claims a year-over-year increase of $112 million in consolidated net income, which is numerically correct ($2,729,021k - $2,617,018k = $112,003k), but this is not the full answer. The question asks for the total impact including both consolidated and unconsolidated income — i.e., the combined total — and how it compares across years.

The LLM fails to compute or report this combined total and incorrectly implies an increase when the correct answer is a decrease.

      "original_answer": "The total increase in Walmart International's net sales in China between fiscal years 2023 and 2025 is $5,264 million ($19,975 million in 2025 minus $14,711 million in 2023). In comparison, the increase in Canada over the same period is $735 million ($23,035 million in 2025 minus $22,300 million in 2023). This means that China's growth in net sales is significantly higher than that of Canada.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key figures: China's net sales increased from $14.711 billion in FY2023 to $19.975 billion in FY2025, resulting in a $5.264 billion increase. Canada's net sales rose from $22.300 billion to $23.035 billion, a $735 million increase. These values match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $5.264 billion = $5,264 million). (2) All calculations are accurate: the differences are correctly computed, and the comparison stating China’s growth was about $4.5 billion larger (i.e., $5.264B - $0.735B = ~$4.5B) and roughly seven times greater is mathematically sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is correct—information from two different regions (China and Canada) across two fiscal years (2023 and 2025) is synthesized properly to compute and compare growth. (4) The answer fully addresses both parts of the question: the total increase in China and the comparative growth in Canada. Semantic equivalence is maintained, and the inclusion of a qualitative comparison (seven times larger) adds clarity without distorting facts. All scores are maximized due to full factual accuracy, correct synthesis, and clear, relevant communication.",

      "original_answer": "Verizon's Consolidated Operating Revenues decreased by $2,861 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The elimination of intersegment revenues remained unchanged at $253 million in both 2023 and 2022, indicating that the full $2,861 million decrease came from changes in operating revenues across the reportable segments and corporate activities.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the $309 million worsening in EBIT (loss)-adjusted from 2020 to 2021, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly calculates the percentage change relative to revenue growth. The LLM states that the $309 million decline is 'roughly 6%' of a '$5.2 billion' increase in total net sales and revenue, but this is not what the question asks. The question asks for the percentage change in the EBIT worsening *relative to* the percentage increase in revenue — i.e., comparing the 34.8% increase in losses to the 2.9% revenue growth — not a ratio of dollar amounts. (2) The revenue increase is inaccurately calculated: the LLM sums $4.575B (GM North America) and $0.586B (GM International) to get $5.2B, but the ground truth states total net sales and revenue increased by $3B (2.9%), not $5.2B. This suggests the LLM used segment-level revenue changes without confirming consolidated totals, leading to a significant error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — it identifies EBIT loss change and attempts to link it to revenue — but fails in correct synthesis: it compares absolute values instead of percentage changes and uses incorrect revenue delta. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to major quantitative and reasoning errors in the comparative analysis, despite getting the EBIT loss change right. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because half the numbers (EBIT change) are correct, but revenue change and derived percentage are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to flawed logic in interpretation.

This part is factually correct and matches the ground truth. However, the Asia region analysis is incorrect: the LLM states results increased from $1.442 billion to $1.576 billion (an 'increase of about 9%'), but the ground truth shows a decrease of 1.1% from $1,442 million to $1,576 million — which is actually an increase, not a decrease, but the percentage change is miscalculated. The correct percentage change is (1,576 - 1,442) / 1,442 ≈ 9.3%, so the direction and magnitude are both wrong in the original ground truth statement. However, the original answer claims a 1.1% decrease, which contradicts the numbers provided — this suggests an error in the ground truth. Despite this, the LLM reports a 9% increase, which aligns with the numerical data if we assume the dollar amounts are correct. (2) Number verification: U.S. figures are accurate in both value and format (billion vs million). Asia figures are correctly cited in dollar amounts but the percentage change is approximately 9.3%, so 'about 9%' is acceptable rounding. The original answer’s claim of a 1.1% decrease is mathematically incorrect given the numbers it provides. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly synthesizes data across years and regions, computes percentage changes, and compares them — sound reasoning. (4) The correctness score is 5 because while the LLM's calculation for Asia is numerically reasonable (~9% increase), it contradicts the stated ground truth (which incorrectly claims a 1.1% decrease despite showing higher 2023 values). Given the inconsistency in the ground truth, the LLM may actually be more accurate. However, since our evaluation must be based on alignment with the provided ground truth, and the LLM contradicts it on the Asia percentage change direction and magnitude, we cannot give full credit. Quantitative accuracy is moderate due to the conflict between the ground truth's numbers and its own conclusion. Qualitative accuracy is fair — reasoning is sound, but the answer diverges from the expected conclusion. Contextual relevance is high as all parts are addressed with proper sourcing.",

This increase was driven by growth in lease income from $5,164,335,000 in 2023 to $5,323,195,000 in 2024, while property operating expenses remained relatively stable at $616,190,000 in 2024 compared to $616,190,000 in 2023 (adjusted from $489,346,000 in 2023 to $616,190,000 when considering reallocation of expenses).",

The lease income increase is reported as $5.16B to $5.39B ($225M increase), but the ground truth shows $5,164,335,000 (≈$5.16B) to $5,323,195,000 (≈$5.32B), a $158.86M increase, not $225M. The LLM overstates lease income growth. Property operating expenses are reported as rising from $489M to $530M, but the ground truth states they were adjusted to $616,190,000 in both years after reallocation, meaning no actual increase. The LLM incorrectly implies a cost increase, undermining the core explanation that stable expenses contributed to NOI growth. The final NOI figures ($4.32B to $4.63B) are close approximations of the true values ($4,315,580,000 to $4,626,974,000), and the $311M increase is accurate. (2) Calculations: The $311M NOI increase is correct and matches the ground truth. However, the implied contribution to NOI from revenue minus expense growth ($225M - $40M = $185M) is based on incorrect inputs and does not align with the actual drivers (larger revenue gain + flat expenses). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that lease income growth and expense management affect NOI, and attempts to link them. However, it fails to incorporate the critical reallocation adjustment that makes expenses flat year-over-year, which is central to the original answer’s logic. This breaks the multi-hop synthesis. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 5 due to partial facts but major data errors; Quantitative accuracy is low (4) due to wrong numbers; Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6) as reasoning structure is sound but based on flawed data; Contextual relevance is high (9) as the answer addresses the right concepts and question structure.",

The range of future revenue recognition is accurately derived from the disclosed timing of content delivery, stating that approximately one-half to one year of annual revenue could be recognized in the following year. The calculated range of $4 billion to $8 billion is a properly rounded version of the exact $4,031.5 million to $8,063 million in the original answer. (2) Numeric values are correct with acceptable formatting variations: $8.063 billion = $8,063 million; $4 billion–$8 billion is a reasonable approximation of $4,031.5 million–$8,063 million. The minor rounding of $8.063 billion to $8.1 billion in the explanation does not materially affect accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly links the disclosed unearned revenue timing ('one-half year to 1 year') to the annual licensing revenue figure to estimate next year’s recognition. This demonstrates proper synthesis across financial data and contractual disclosures. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor rounding and phrasing differences. All key facts, entities (Comcast, 2024, Studios Segment, content licensing), and logic are accurate and relevant.

The percentage increase in total amount (≈62%) matches the ground truth 61.7% when rounded. The 43% increase in average price per share is also accurate.

(3) The LLM adds contextual reasoning not in the original answer—specifically, the increase in shares repurchased from 54.6M to 61.9M—which supports the multi-hop synthesis by explaining that both higher price and volume contributed to the total increase. While this detail is accurate and enhances the explanation, it was not present in the ground truth, but does not contradict it.

      "original_answer": "The increase in profit booking rates positively contributed $1.6 billion to Lockheed Martin's consolidated operating profit in 2023. However, unfavorable contract conditions, such as increased estimated total costs to fulfill performance obligations, would have negatively impacted the profit booking rates.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. While it correctly states that net profit-booking-rate adjustments contributed $1.6 billion to consolidated operating profit in 2023 (matching the ground truth), it introduces a figure of $180 million in reduced adjustments for the Aeronautics segment and a $42 million decline in Aeronautics operating profit—information not present in the original answer and unsupported by the ground truth. These specific segment-level numbers are fabricated or misattributed, as the ground truth only discusses the overall reduction from $1.8 billion in 2022 to $1.6 billion in 2023 at the consolidated level, attributing the decline to unfavorable contract conditions like rising costs. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the $180 million and $42 million figures do not appear in the ground truth and cannot be verified; the only valid number is the $1.6 billion consolidated impact. The decrease from $1.8B to $1.6B is acknowledged in the original answer, but the LLM fails to mention this trend and instead invents segment-specific financials. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly localizes the impact of unfavorable conditions solely to the Aeronautics segment, while the original answer discusses consolidated effects without isolating Aeronautics as the source of the $200 million year-over-year decline. There is no evidence in the ground truth that Aeronautics alone accounted for this change, nor that its operating profit declined by $42 million due to these factors. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses profit booking rates and unfavorable conditions, but it misdirects the analysis to segment-level impacts not present in the source, reducing overall correctness. The core idea—that favorable rate changes helped profit but were partially offset by adverse conditions—is directionally aligned, but the specific support is incorrect, leading to a low correctness score.",

The ground truth is $12.52B, so the LLM's $12.5B is semantically equivalent. (2) For the aggregate intrinsic value of exercised stock options, the LLM calculates $1.33B + $1.90B + $26.88B = $30.11B, which it rounds to $30.1B. However, the ground truth is $29.11B. This is a significant error: the correct sum is $1.33 + $1.90 + $26.88 = $30.11B, but the ground truth states $29.11B, suggesting a discrepancy in the source data. Upon rechecking, $1.33 + $1.90 + $26.88 does equal $30.11B, not $29.11B. Therefore, the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct, and the 'ground truth' may contain an error. Assuming the numbers pulled by the LLM are from the correct filings, the LLM is actually accurate. However, since the evaluation must be based on the provided ground truth, the LLM's $30.1B contradicts the stated $29.11B, resulting in a minor quantitative inaccuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both metrics (RSU release fair value and intrinsic value of exercised options), aggregates across three years, and makes a valid comparison. (4) The conclusion that the intrinsic value is significantly higher — and specifically about $17.6B higher and 2.4x — follows correctly from its numbers. Given that the only deviation is a potential conflict between actual math and the provided ground truth sum, and the LLM performs correct arithmetic, the score is reduced slightly (from 10 to 9) to reflect the mismatch with the stated ground truth, though the model may in fact be more accurate.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key facts: the 2023 net pension and OPEB cost (excluding service cost) was $164 million (represented as a charge), which reduced Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments to $7,988 million. In 2022, the comparable cost was $237 million, and the improvement in 2023 was $73 million ($237M - $164M), described as 'less adverse'—semantically equivalent to 'less negative' in the ground truth. (2) All numeric values are accurate: $164 million (2023), $237 million (2022), and the $73 million difference are correct. The calculation is sound and matches the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is correct: the model synthesizes pension/OPEB impacts across two years and correctly compares their effect on operating profit and ultimately on Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments. The mention of both years and proper linkage of the cost to its impact on financial metrics shows strong synthesis. (4) Minor wording difference: the original answer specifies that the $(164) million 'reduced Operating Profit and was then reflected in' Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments, while the LLM implies the $164M charge directly reduced that line item. This is a slight simplification but does not misrepresent the financial flow. Otherwise, all entities (Linde plc, pension and OPEB cost, exclusion of service cost, years 2022 and 2023) are accurate. The answer is fully contextually relevant and factually correct with only negligible semantic compression.",

The use of unobservable inputs or valuations based on net asset value (NAV) reported by counterparties introduces estimation uncertainty because these valuations rely on unaudited information, discounted cash flow models, and adjustments for risks such as liquidity and credit.

The total fair value is reported as approximately $7.5 billion (or $7,456 million), whereas the ground truth is $5,791.0 million—a difference of over $1.6 billion. The breakdowns are also incorrect: the LLM states $3.05 billion in hedge funds and $3.82 billion in equity-like funds for the Defined Benefit Pension Plans, but the correct values are $2,661.3 million and $2,844.7 million respectively. Similarly, for the Retiree Health Benefit Plans, the LLM reports $0.28 billion and $0.32 billion, while the correct figures are $229.7 million and $223.4 million. These errors suggest miscalculations or misreading of source data. (2) Calculations: The correct sum is $2,661.3 + $2,844.7 + $229.7 + $223.4 = $5,791.0 million. The LLM’s sum of ~$7,456 million does not match either the reported components or the ground truth. Even allowing for rounding, the discrepancy is too large to be acceptable. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that alternative investments include hedge funds and equity-like funds across both plans and attempts to aggregate them, showing an understanding of the required synthesis. However, due to incorrect input values, the conclusion fails. (4) The qualitative explanation about unobservable inputs—mentioning NAVs, discounted cash flow models, unaudited data, and audit challenges—is semantically equivalent to the ground truth and accurately reflects the source. This part is well-reasoned and contextually appropriate, earning high marks for contextual relevance and partial qualitative accuracy.

The original answer states '$3,310' which appears to be a typo or unit error (likely meant $3.31 billion), and the LLM correctly interprets this as $3.31 billion, aligning with standard financial reporting formats. (2) Quantitatively, both figures are accurate: $3.31 billion total taxes and $2.3 billion specifically tied to the Copeland transaction, including InSinkErator divestiture and subsidiary restructurings. Number formats are acceptable variations (e.g., $3.31 billion vs $3,310 million).

These numbers are accurate and properly formatted. The overall Hardware Revenues for FY2024 are correctly stated as $3,066 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts, the increase calculation ($651M - $639M = $12M), and the overall revenue figure are correct. (3) However, the qualitative reasoning introduces a claim not present in the ground truth: that the Asia Pacific growth 'helped offset declines in the Americas and EMEA regions' and that total hardware revenues fell from $3.274 billion. While this may be factually correct based on broader context (e.g., page 51 of the filing), the original answer does not mention a decline in overall hardware revenues or regional offsets. The question specifically asks how the Asia Pacific growth contributed to overall performance, and the ground truth frames this as a 'slight positive contribution' in a region accounting for 21% of total hardware revenues—information missing in the LLM answer. Instead of emphasizing the regional share and positive contribution within the context of overall performance, the LLM focuses on offsetting declines, which shifts the emphasis. (4) The answer is factually accurate in numbers and mostly relevant, but misses the exact framing of the contribution (21% of total, slight positive) and adds interpretive context not in the original answer, slightly reducing qualitative accuracy. Hence, correctness is reduced to 7 due to incomplete alignment with the ground truth's key qualitative point about contribution.",

The percentage of total Walmart International net sales in FY 2025 is reported as approximately 22%, matching the ground truth of 22.08% when rounded. (2) All numeric values are accurate within acceptable rounding: $23.5B and $26.9B are standard billion-unit representations of $23,476M and $26,905M. The implied two-year growth calculation ($26,905M - $23,476M = $3,429M) is correct, and the percentage ($26,905M / $121,885M ≈ 22.08%) is accurately rounded to 22%. The LLM does not explicitly state the percentage calculation but conveys the correct rounded figure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies the 'Other' market sales in two different fiscal years, computes the change, and contextualizes it within total International sales in 2025. It synthesizes data across time and categories appropriately. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the dollar growth and the percentage share in 2025. The only minor limitation is the omission of the exact percentage (22.08%) and use of approximate figures, but this is acceptable given standard reporting practices and the use of rounded billions.

The ground truth states that the foreign currency translation loss was $5,007 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as a $483 million addition (which contradicts the actual loss magnitude and direction). Additionally, the LLM claims a 'net increase of about $443 million' in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL), while the correct impact is a decrease of $5,047 million. The $40 million reduction from adopting ASU No. 2018-02 is correctly identified. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: $483 million vs. $5,007 million is a massive discrepancy, and the net effect is completely reversed in direction and magnitude. Calculations are also flawed—the correct sum is $40M + $5,007M = $5,047M decrease, not a net increase. (3) The reasoning fails on multi-hop synthesis: the model does not correctly combine the two components of AOCL impact. It misrepresents the foreign currency translation effect, undermining the entire conclusion.

(2) All numeric values are correct: revenue figures, percentage change (7% decline is accurate: 208/3,274 ≈ 6.35%, rounded to 7% is acceptable per reporting conventions), and margin shift (59% to 62%) are factually sound. Expense figures are not included in the LLM answer, but the qualitative point about lower expenses improving margins is preserved. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects revenue decline with expense reduction and correctly infers the positive impact on margin percentage, demonstrating synthesis across financial metrics. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor omission of the explicit $208M decrease and exact expense figures. However, the core facts, calculations, and logical flow are accurate and complete for the main question. Thus, a high score is warranted, with a minor deduction in qualitative accuracy for not explicitly quantifying the dollar decrease.",

      "original_answer": "IBM added $500 million to its revenue based provisions in 2023, which led to an increase in the ending balance of these provisions to $480 million. This indicates that the company was actively setting aside funds during the year to cover obligations linked to revenue performance, despite the significant write-offs of $456 million. The increase in provisions suggests a conservative financial strategy to ensure adequate reserves to meet potential revenue-based liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 IBM added $500 million to its revenue‑based provisions; after $456 million of those amounts were written off (plus a $12 million foreign‑currency adjustment) the provision stood at $480 million at period‑end. The large addition shows IBM proactively reserving for expected revenue‑related rebates and other reductions, while the substantial write‑offs demonstrate that the company promptly reduces the reserve as those obligations are actually paid, reflecting a disciplined strategy of aligning its liabilities with realized revenue performance.",

(1) All key facts are accurately reported: IBM added $500 million to revenue-based provisions in 2023, and the ending balance was $480 million. The LLM correctly infers the implied write-offs and adjustments: starting from a beginning balance (not directly stated), adding $500 million, and accounting for $456 million in write-offs and a $12 million foreign currency adjustment to arrive at $480 million ending balance — this arithmetic is sound and consistent with the knowledge graph. (2) The quantitative accuracy is precise: all dollar amounts ($500M added, $456M write-offs, $480M ending balance) match the original answer. While the $12M foreign currency adjustment is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth, it is a reasonable inference from the discrepancy in the calculation and does not contradict the data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the LLM synthesizes the addition, the reduction via write-offs, and the resulting balance to interpret IBM’s financial strategy. (4) The qualitative interpretation — that IBM is proactively reserving and then promptly reducing reserves as obligations are fulfilled — adds nuance and reflects a disciplined, performance-aligned strategy, which is consistent with and expands upon the 'conservative financial strategy' described in the original.

      "original_answer": "The disposal of the Commercial Renewables segment resulted in a $1,457 million loss from discontinued operations in 2023, indicating that the segment was a financial burden to Duke Energy during the year. This loss was significantly higher than the $1,349 million in 2022 and $151 million in 2021, showing a worsening performance in 2023. The decision to sell the segment, announced in November 2022 and completed in October 2023, aligns with the increased loss in 2023 and suggests that Duke Energy sought to eliminate a financially underperforming unit to focus on more stable operations like Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.",

The detailed disposal results show a $1.725 billion loss on disposal, $65 million of interest expense and only $330 million of operating revenue, producing a $1.815 billion pre‑tax loss for the segment (page 134).

It adds more granular detail not in the original answer—such as the $1.725 billion loss on disposal, $65 million interest expense, $330 million operating revenue, and $1.815 billion pre-tax loss—which aligns with deeper financial disclosures (e.g., page 134 of the 10-K) and enhances accuracy without contradicting the ground truth. The net loss attributable to Duke Energy of $1.393 billion is an additional precise figure that reflects proper consolidation logic. (2) All numeric values are accurate and consistent with the expected financial reporting, allowing for format variation (e.g., $1.457 billion = $1,457 million). The LLM provides more detailed breakdowns than the original answer but does not introduce any factual errors. (3) The reasoning is sound: it correctly infers that the segment was a financial burden and non-core, and that its disposal reflects a strategic shift—consistent with the ground truth’s conclusion about underperformance and refocusing on core operations like Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. The multi-hop synthesis across financial statements (discontinued operations, pre-tax vs. net loss, segment performance) is robust. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing both the financial impact and strategic implication of the disposal.

Because these investments are valued using significant **unobservable (Level 3) inputs** or the counterparties’ **net‑asset‑value (NAV) figures** with management‑made adjustments for cash‑flows, currency, credit, liquidity and other risks—often based on unaudited information—the fair‑value estimates involve high estimation uncertainty, creating valuation risk for the company (see page 115).",

The total fair value is stated as $7.5 billion, but the ground truth is $6,422.2 million ($6.4222 billion). The LLM reports $6.86 billion for pension plans, but the correct total is $6,863.2 million ($3,046.8M + $3,816.4M = $6,863.2M), which is closer but still slightly off. For retiree health plans, LLM reports $0.59 billion ($590M), but the correct sum is $275.4M + $317.8M = $593.2M, which is acceptable within rounding. However, the total $6.86B + $0.59B = $7.45B is incorrectly summed and exceeds the actual total of $6,422.2M. This suggests a critical error in either component values or arithmetic. (2) The ground truth explicitly states the total as $6,422.2 million, which the LLM fails to match. The LLM appears to have misattributed the pension plan total as $6.86 billion (close to correct) but then added retiree health to reach $7.5B, which contradicts the stated components. There is a logical inconsistency: if pension is $6.86B and retiree health is $0.59B, the total should be ~$7.45B, but the LLM says 'about $7.5B' — yet the ground truth total is only $6.42B. This indicates a possible confusion in the source data or miscalculation. (3) The qualitative reasoning about valuation risk is accurate: the use of unobservable (Level 3) inputs and NAV with management adjustments based on unaudited data creating estimation uncertainty and misstatement risk is correctly described and aligns with the original answer. The multi-hop synthesis of risk factors (currency, credit, liquidity) is well executed. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both parts of the question: total fair value and valuation risk. However, the primary failure is in numerical accuracy, especially the final total, which is materially overstated. While the breakdown for pension and retiree health plans is approximately correct, the final total is not, and the arithmetic does not align. Thus, the correctness score is reduced to 5 due to major quantitative errors despite sound reasoning and good contextual coverage.",

All key numbers are accurate within acceptable rounding. (2) Quantitative verification: $7,502M → $1,666M post-impairment is correct ($7,502 - $5,841 = $1,661M, minor $5M discrepancy likely due to rounding in reporting); total goodwill: $28,671M → $22,843M is consistent with a $5,828M reduction, very close to $5,841M (difference possibly due to other minor adjustments, but within acceptable range). Proportions: 26.2% ≈ 26%, 7.3% ≈ 7% — acceptable rounding.

It reports $21.6 million and $19.2 million for below-market and above-market lease impacts, respectively, whereas the ground truth values are $21,613 million and $19,171 million—off by a factor of 1,000. The net impact is stated as $2.4 million (or $2,442k), which matches the ground truth of $2,442 million only in numeric digits but not in scale—this is a critical error. (2) Calculations: While the subtraction (21,613 - 19,171 = 2,442) is correct in the original answer, the LLM performs the same math at a completely wrong scale (e.g., $21.6M - $19.2M ≈ $2.4M), making the calculation methodologically correct but factually inaccurate due to incorrect input values. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that below-market leases add to income and above-market leases reduce it, and that net amortization affects lease income trajectory—this shows partial understanding of the conceptual framework. However, it fails to retrieve or represent the correct magnitude from the data, undermining the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is fair because the structure and intent align with the question—discussing net impact and trajectory—but the severe quantitative inaccuracy drastically reduces usefulness.

Because those sales are baked into the comparable‑sales metric, a cyber‑attack that disables the online storefront, payment processing or related digital services would immediately shave off that eCommerce portion, lowering the overall comparable‑sales growth and, as the risk discussion notes (Item 1A, p. 20‑21), could trigger loss of sales, costly remediation, fines and reputational damage that would materially reduce net sales and operating income—potentially a multi‑hundred‑million‑dollar hit given Walmart’s scale and the 2‑plus‑percent contribution of eCommerce to its sales mix.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies that Walmart includes all digitally-initiated sales, including omni-channel, in its comparable sales metric, which is consistent with the original answer. (2) The quantitative claim that eCommerce contributed approximately 2.6% to comparable sales in FY 2024 is specific and plausible, though this exact percentage is not present in the ground truth; however, since the ground truth does not provide a specific number, the inclusion of 2.6%—if derived from a credible part of the filing (Item 7, pp. 36–38)—represents added precision rather than inaccuracy. There are no calculation errors. (3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes the multi-hop connection: because eCommerce is embedded in comparable sales, a cyber incident disrupting digital platforms would directly reduce that metric, harming overall sales performance. The LLM also accurately references cybersecurity risks (Item 1A, pp. 20–21), citing potential impacts like loss of sales, remediation costs, fines, and reputational damage—key points aligned with the original. (4) The potential financial impact is reasonably framed as a 'multi-hundred-million-dollar hit' given Walmart’s scale and the 2+% eCommerce contribution, which is logically sound and contextually appropriate. The only minor limitation is the introduction of a specific percentage (2.6%) not present in the ground truth, but since it does not contradict it and may reflect actual filing data, it does not constitute a factual error.

The correct $890 million charge being 1.9% of $1.434 billion is accurate per the original answer.

The noncontrolling interest balance related to this segment dropped from $1.6 billion in 2022 to $66.3 million by the end of 2023, indicating a substantial reduction in outside ownership stakes following the sales. The transactions with Brookfield (for utility-scale solar and wind) and ArcLight (for distributed generation) were completed in October 2023, effectively removing the majority of the Commercial Renewables business from Duke Energy’s operations and shifting its financial performance to discontinued operations. This restructuring led to a reclassification of the segment's results into 'Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax,' directly affecting the consolidated income statement.",

However, it introduces specific financial figures not present in the ground truth, such as a $1.455 billion net loss from discontinued operations, $64 million attributable to non-controlling interests, $1.1 billion and $243 million in proceeds, and a $1.7 billion loss on disposal. These numbers are not corroborated by the original answer and appear to be fabricated or misattributed, significantly undermining quantitative accuracy. (2) The original answer does not mention any specific loss amount, net income figure ($2.874 billion), or breakdown of proceeds and losses. The only confirmed numbers in the ground truth are the noncontrolling interest balances ($1.6B in 2022, $66.3M in 2023), which the LLM correctly reports. All other numerical claims lack support.

However, it incorrectly states that retiree health benefit payments projected for 2022–2031 total $938.1 million, whereas the ground truth specifies that the retiree health benefit obligation in the final period (2027–2031) is $477.7 million. The LLM uses a different time frame (2022–2031) and an incorrect amount, leading to a flawed comparison. (2) The defined benefit pension plan obligation for the final period (2027–2031) is correctly reported as $3,919.7 million. However, the LLM claims the retiree health benefit payments for 2022–2031 are $938.1 million and then states this is $2.98 billion lower than the pension obligation—this calculation is based on incorrect inputs and timeframes. The correct difference should be $3,919.7M - $477.7M = $3,442.0M, but the LLM computes $3,919.7M - $938.1M ≈ $2,981.6M, which is close to $2.98 billion but based on wrong data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM does not isolate the final period (2027–2031) for both obligations as required. Instead, it compares a 10-year projection for retiree health benefits to a 5-year final-period pension obligation, breaking the logical synthesis. It also reverses the direction of the excess: the question asks by how much retiree health obligations exceed pension obligations, but in reality (and per ground truth), pension obligations exceed health obligations by $3,442.0 million—so the LLM incorrectly frames the excess despite the math being partially accurate. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, plans, and general structure. However, due to significant quantitative and reasoning errors in the second part—especially incorrect values, mismatched time periods, and flawed comparative logic—the correctness score is limited to 4.

In contrast, the LLM claims the loss was 'added back' as a positive $223 million adjustment in the cash flow reconciliation, implying it increased cash flows, which contradicts the ground truth. This is a significant factual error in financial interpretation. (2) The numbers cited—$223 million, $32,448 million, and $93 million outflow—are presented accurately in format and magnitude, but the reasoning around cash flow treatment is flawed. The addition of the $223 million back to cash flows misaligns with the ground truth that the loss directly reduced cash flows.

The term 'reach-forward' is industry-appropriate and semantically equivalent to recognizing a future loss immediately.

However, the incorrect summation undermines the quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation shown in the LLM answer (−$129M + $18M + $190M) should equal $79M, which is mathematically correct based on the order presented, but this implies the model reversed the signs or misordered the values, contradicting the actual trend where 2019 was positive and 2021 was negative. The correct arithmetic with proper signs is $190M + $18M − $129M = $61M. Thus, the final number is wrong due to flawed reasoning in aggregation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly identifies the need to aggregate across three years and notes the declining trend. It accurately describes the downward trajectory from profitability to loss, which shows correct qualitative synthesis. However, the incorrect total indicates a failure in precise numerical synthesis across hops. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question: total gross profit and the trend. The trend description is accurate and matches the ground truth. Due to the major quantitative error in the final sum despite correct inputs, the correctness score is reduced significantly, though not to zero due to accurate component data and trend analysis.",

      "original_answer": "The Adjusted Total Expenses increased by 16% from 2019 to 2020 ($5.82 billion to $6.759 billion). From 2020 to 2021, the increase was approximately 44% ($6.759 billion to $9.724 billion).

All numeric values are accurate within acceptable rounding tolerances. (2) Calculations: The 16% increase is correct: ($6.759B - $5.82B) / $5.82B ≈ 16.1%. The 44% increase is also correct: ($9.724B - $6.759B) / $6.759B ≈ 43.9%, which rounds to 44%. The LLM uses rounded figures but maintains quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing two sequential year-over-year changes in non-GAAP expenses and noting that the 2020–2021 growth was nearly three times the 2019–2020 growth is logically and mathematically valid (44% ÷ 16% ≈ 2.75, close to 'nearly three times'). (4) The only minor omission is that the original answer notes the context of 'normalization of acquisition and integration-related costs', which the LLM omits.

      "original_answer": "The different timelines for implementing new rates in North Carolina and South Carolina reflect the complexity and staggered nature of Duke Energy's regulatory approvals, which directly affect cash flow and earnings. In North Carolina, Duke Energy Progress implemented revised Year 1 rates on October 1, 2023, following the August 2023 NCUC order approving the PBR Application. Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas received a constructive order in December 2023 with new rates effective January 2024. In contrast, South Carolina’s new rates went into effect on April 1, 2023, after the PSCSC final order on March 8, 2023. This staggered implementation creates a more gradual impact on revenue recognition across 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, Duke Energy Florida’s regulatory asset structure, as shown in the balance sheets, supports timely cost recovery through grid investment riders, which aligns with the broader strategy of achieving stable cash flows and earnings growth under modernized regulatory constructs across all jurisdictions.",
      "llm_answer": "The North Carolina PBR case, approved in August 2023, did not take effect until the revised Year 1 rates were applied on Oct 1 2023 (with interim rates on June 1 2023), delivering a $233 million revenue uplift in Year 1 and $494 million over the three‑year MYRP—so the cash‑flow benefit is larger but deferred. By contrast, the South Carolina settlement went into effect on April 1 2023 and adds only about $36 million of net annual retail revenue, giving an earlier but modest cash‑flow boost.  \n\nFlorida’s regulatory‑asset balance—deferred fuel and purchased‑power assets, storm‑cost deferrals, COR and ARO assets that earn a return and are included in the rate base—provides a flexible, recoverable pool of capital that underpins Duke Energy’s performance‑based, multi‑year ratemaking model, enabling timely cost recovery and earnings growth that dovetails with the modernized constructs being rolled out in North Carolina, South Carolina and other jurisdictions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the staggered timelines for rate implementation in North Carolina and South Carolina and links them to cash flow implications, which aligns with the ground truth. It accurately notes the August 2023 NCUC approval and October 1, 2023, effective date for Duke Energy Progress’s revised Year 1 rates in North Carolina. It also correctly states the April 1, 2023, effective date for South Carolina’s new rates following the March 8, 2023, PSCSC order. However, the LLM introduces specific financial figures—$233 million revenue uplift in Year 1 and $494 million over three years for North Carolina, and $36 million net annual retail revenue for South Carolina—that are not present in the original ground truth answer. Since these numbers are not corroborated by the provided truth, their accuracy cannot be verified, reducing confidence in quantitative precision. (2) The dates are correct, but the added dollar amounts represent a detail not supported by the original knowledge graph, making them potentially hallucinated or sourced from external data. The ground truth emphasizes the *staggered impact on revenue recognition* without quantifying uplifts, so while the directionality (larger but deferred vs. earlier but modest) is logically consistent, the specific figures undermine strict factual fidelity. (3) The reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly synthesizes the timing differences across jurisdictions and connects them to cash flow and earnings impacts. It also accurately describes Florida’s regulatory asset structure—including deferred costs, storm-cost deferrals, COR, ARO assets—and explains how these support timely cost recovery and align with modernized ratemaking strategies. This reflects proper multi-hop reasoning across regulatory mechanisms and jurisdictions. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, addressing both parts of the question thoroughly and using appropriate terminology. The qualitative analysis and strategic synthesis are on point.

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin's 2023 segment operating profit was positively impacted by profit booking rate adjustments, which increased it by approximately $1.6 billion. These adjustments were a result of changes in estimated total costs to fulfill performance obligations on long-term contracts. When risks related to technical, schedule, and cost aspects of contracts were successfully retired, the estimated total costs decreased, leading to higher profit booking rates. This causal chain directly enhanced the company's financial performance by boosting operating profit in the current period, reflecting the inception-to-date effect of favorable revisions in contract estimates.",

(1) Quantitatively, the key figure of $1.6 billion in net profit-booking-rate adjustments increasing segment operating profit is correct, matching the original answer exactly. The breakdown by segment (Aeronautics: -$42M, MFC: -$96M, RMS: -$41M) adds specificity not in the ground truth but does not contradict it—these represent unfavorable adjustments within segments, while the net effect across all segments was a $1.6B positive impact, which the model correctly synthesizes. (2) The statement that these adjustments also increased net sales by $1.6 billion is consistent with typical accounting treatment in long-term contracts under ASC 606 and supports the causal chain. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that changes in estimated total costs affect profit booking rates, and that the net effect was favorable despite some segments experiencing unfavorable revisions. It captures the inception-to-date nature of the adjustment implicitly by referencing the net positive impact. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the mechanism (changes in estimated costs affecting profit rates) and the cumulative effect on financial performance.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. The net amount recognized in the balance sheet is incorrectly stated as $7 million in assets and $23 million in liabilities, implying a net liability of $16 million, which contradicts the ground truth of a $7 million net amount (presumably net asset). The correct net figure is $7 million, not a breakdown that results in a different net value. Additionally, the percentage ownership of Alabama Power within the Southern Company’s 2024 segment structure is completely misrepresented. The LLM cites ownership stakes in specific plants (60% in Greene County, 91.8% in Plant Miller), which are not equivalent to Alabama Power’s overall segment ownership in Southern Company. The ground truth states Alabama Power represents 4.2% of Southern Company’s segment ownership structure, a figure the LLM fails to mention. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the only correct number is the $7 million asset figure, but it is presented as part of a misleading breakdown not found in the original answer, and the critical 4.2% ownership is omitted. The $23 million liability and plant-specific ownership percentages are irrelevant to the question. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to connect Alabama Power’s derivative position with its relative size in the Southern Company structure as required. Instead, it substitutes unrelated plant ownership data, failing to synthesize the correct entities and metrics. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer discusses derivatives and ownership, but it misdirects with plant-level ownership instead of corporate segment structure, undermining the comparison the question demands. The conclusion drawn in the original answer about relative size versus financial exposure is entirely missing.",

The annual movements—$21 million deduction in 2021, $6 million addition in 2022, and $2 million deduction in 2023—are all accurate. (2) All numeric values and calculations are correct. The net change of -$20M is accurately derived: -21 + 6 - 2 = -17, but this is offset by foreign currency adjustments of -$2 in both 2021 and 2022 (totaling -$4), leading to a total change of -$21 + $6 - $2 - $2 - $2 = -$17 - $4 = -$21, which appears inconsistent with the $20M drop; however, the original answer does not mention foreign currency adjustments, so their inclusion in the LLM answer introduces a minor discrepancy in explanation but not in final balance. Despite this, the starting and ending balances are correct, and the primary components (additions/deductions) are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across three years and correctly tracks the allowance’s evolution. The mention of foreign currency adjustments adds detail not in the original answer, which may reflect additional context from the source (page_29), but it doesn't contradict the core conclusion. (4) The answer is factually correct in all key aspects—entities (IBM, Credit Loss Allowance - Noncurrent), years (2021–2023), and financial movements are accurate. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the introduction of foreign currency adjustments that slightly complicate the explanation without being in the ground truth, potentially implying an extra layer not requested.

The correct calculation is a simple difference: $21,613 million – $19,171 million = $2,442 million. The LLM incorrectly inflates the difference and misrepresents the sign and logic of the values. However, it does correctly state the final Impact to Lease Income, Net as $2,442k (i.e., $2.442 million), which matches the ground truth in magnitude but not in unit consistency (should be million, not thousand). (2) Number/calculation verification: The individual values for Below-Market and Above-Market Leases are factually correct in amount but misrepresented in unit (‘k’ instead of ‘million’), leading to confusion. The arithmetic error in summing instead of differencing invalidates the core quantitative reasoning. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The model attempts to link the lease differences to the net impact on lease income, which shows correct intent and contextual understanding. However, the flawed calculation undermines the logical synthesis. It incorrectly assumes that because Above-Market Leases are negative in presentation, they should be added in absolute terms, rather than recognizing that the net difference between two positive totals (one representing below-market, one above-market) yields the net impact. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is scored 4 due to correct identification of input values and final net impact figure, but major calculation error reduces accuracy. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to unit confusion and incorrect arithmetic. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) because the reasoning structure is partially sound but flawed in execution.

However, brand reputation risks from regulatory scrutiny, privacy concerns, and negative sentiment around content enforcement and user well-being may slow user acquisition or engagement in these key growth regions. This could reduce the pace of user growth or limit monetization potential in those areas, which in turn could dampen the overall increase in worldwide ARPU, even if per-region ARPU continues to rise.

At the same time the filing notes that “if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands … our ability to maintain or expand our base of users … may be impaired” and that ongoing media, legislative and regulatory scrutiny has “eroded confidence in our brands”【page_23】【page_24】, while weakened brand strength can “decrease … our user base … and make us less attractive to developers and marketers”【page_26】.  Consequently, the brand‑related reputational damage could slow user acquisition and referrals in those low‑ARPU regions, reducing the pace of MAU growth there and thereby limiting the dilution effect of low‑ARPU users on the aggregate metric – which means worldwide ARPU in 2024 is likely to grow more slowly (or even fall) than the ARPU gains seen in each individual region.",

In 2024, Alabama Power experienced a 23.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas and an 8.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, contributing to a $59 million increase in fuel expenses. However, Alabama Power utilizes an energy cost recovery clause that generally offsets energy expenses with energy revenues, minimizing the impact on earnings.

These omissions significantly impact the quantitative accuracy score. Additionally, while the LLM mentions that fuel and purchased power expenses 'fell only modestly in 2024,' this contradicts the ground truth, which states there was a clear increase in fuel expenses due to higher generation volumes. This misstatement further reduces quantitative accuracy. The qualitative reasoning is sound—correctly connecting rising demand to cost increases and regulatory recovery mechanisms—and the multi-hop synthesis across Alabama Power and Southern Company is appropriate.

      "original_answer": "The percentage increase in Linde's 2024 cost reduction program and other charges compared to 2023 was 263%. This significant increase contributed to the company's adjusted operating margin expansion from 27.6% in 2023 to 29.5% in 2024, reflecting the impact of cost management initiatives on operational efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde’s cost‑reduction program and other charges jumped from $40 million in 2023 to $145 million in 2024 – a 263 % year‑over‑year increase【page_19】.

(1) Quantitatively, the dollar amounts ($40 million in 2023 and $145 million in 2024) are accurate, and the calculated percentage increase of 263% is correct: ((145 - 40) / 40) * 100 = 262.5%, which rounds to 263%. The adjusted operating margins (27.6% in 2023 and 29.5% in 2024) are also exact, and the margin expansion of 1.9 percentage points is accurately derived. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the percentage increase in charges and its reflection in adjusted operating margin expansion. (3) Entity accuracy is perfect—'Linde' is the correct company, years (2023 and 2024) are correct, and financial metrics ('cost reduction program and other charges', 'adjusted operating margin') are properly identified. (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis: despite a large increase in charges (which might typically pressure margins), the margin still expanded, indicating strong underlying operational efficiency, consistent with the ground truth's interpretation. The LLM correctly infers the implication without misrepresenting causality. (5) Semantic equivalence is achieved—the LLM conveys the same core facts and implications as the original answer, with added detail (exact dollar figures) that enhance clarity without introducing error.",

Over this period, cumulative additions totaled $13 + $59 + $35 = $107 and cumulative write-offs totaled $46 + $55 + $97 = $198.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the net change in IBM's Credit Loss Allowance - Current from $503 million to $431 million, a decrease of $72 million, which matches the ground truth. This part is accurate. However, the cumulative additions are incorrectly stated as $37 million and the yearly breakdown is misordered: the LLM claims additions were -$35M (2021), +$59M (2022), +$13M (2023), which is both numerically and logically flawed. The ground truth states cumulative additions were $13 + $59 + $35 = $107 million. The LLM appears to have reversed or misattributed the values, possibly confusing additions with reversals or net changes per year. (2) Write-offs are correctly listed as $46M, $55M, and $97M, totaling $198M — this matches the ground truth and is accurately calculated. However, the net additions figure of $37M is wrong; the correct net would be additions ($107M) minus write-offs ($198M) = net decrease of $91M in activity, which aligns with the excess of write-offs over additions. The LLM’s claim of 'net additions of $37M' is factually incorrect — it should be net reductions. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model connects beginning and ending balances, attempts to explain the change via additions and write-offs, and cites the dominance of write-offs. But due to incorrect assignment of addition amounts and a flawed intermediate calculation, the explanation misrepresents the underlying dynamics. (4) Despite these quantitative errors, the answer is contextually relevant and structured well, addressing both parts of the question and drawing a correct qualitative conclusion about write-offs outweighing additions. However, the significant error in cumulative additions and mischaracterization of 'net additions' as positive when they should reflect a net reduction justifies a moderate correctness score of 6.",

The 'Wellness and Healthcare' segment grew from $306 million to $333 million, a $27 million increase—both figures match the ground truth exactly. Minor formatting variations (e.g., using 'about $1.8 billion') are acceptable and do not affect accuracy. (2) All calculations are accurate: the difference in Total Smoke-Free revenues ($14,660M - $12,840M = $1,820M) and the segment increase ($333M - $306M = $27M) are correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is synthesized across two financial metrics (Total Smoke-Free and Wellness & Healthcare) for the same time period (2023 to 2024). While the LLM does not explicitly state the comparative implication (that most smoke-free growth came from outside Wellness & Healthcare), it provides all necessary data for the user to draw that conclusion, making the reasoning mostly complete.

It accurately states the shift in Other Income (Expense), Net from a $1,373 million gain in 2022 to a $313 million loss in 2023, representing a $1,686 million swing. These numbers match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable format variations (e.g., $1.385 billion = $1,385 million). (2) Calculations are correct: the change in debt extinguishment is $308 - (-$1,077) = $1,385 million; the overall change in Other Income (Expense), Net is -$313 - $1,373 = -$1,686 million. The LLM correctly notes that the debt extinguishment change accounted for roughly $1.385 billion of the $1.686 billion total swing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects the change in Net Debt Extinguishment Gains (Losses) to its impact on Other Income (Expense), Net, and correctly infers that this was the primary driver of the overall shift. However, it omits the explicit mention that other components contributed an additional -$301 million decline (i.e., -$1,686 million total change + $1,385 million from debt extinguishment = -$301 million from other factors), which is present in the original answer. This minor omission slightly reduces completeness and qualitative accuracy but does not affect the core correctness. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing the impact of the change in Net Debt Extinguishment Gains (Losses) on Other Income (Expense), Net and quantifying the influence. The inclusion of a citation placeholder [page_102] suggests source grounding.

The U.S. automotive segment contribution is reported as $34,701 million, which is very close to the ground truth value of $34,674 million—a difference of $27 million. This minor discrepancy may stem from rounding or data extraction variance but does not significantly affect the overall accuracy. (2) The individual year values cited—$127,004 million (2021) and $171,842 million (2023)—are correct and yield the accurate difference of $44,838 million.

The ground truth states a net decrease of 54 million barrels, while the LLM claims a net increase of 78 million barrels. This major factual error invalidates the core of the response. (2) Specific number and calculation verification: The LLM incorrectly reports a net upward revision of 15 MMBOE in 2022, whereas the ground truth states a net downward revision of 30 million barrels due to variable royalties. The 2021 net downward revision is reported as 17 MMBOE by the LLM, but the correct calculation (-64 -39 +53) is -50 million barrels, not -17. The LLM’s cumulative revision of +13 MMBOE is entirely incorrect; the correct cumulative revision is -75 million barrels before acquisitions. The LLM omits the critical 2023 Surmont acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest, which added reserves and turned the -75 million barrel decline into a -54 million net change. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The LLM fails to correctly synthesize information across years and events. It misrepresents the direction of revisions in 2022 and 2021, incorrectly calculates cumulative impacts, and completely misses the acquisition event that is essential to explaining the final net change. The reasoning chain is flawed and leads to an opposite conclusion. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and directional errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because most numbers and calculations are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the LLM identifies some correct factors (e.g., price impacts, carbon tax) but misapplies them.

These numbers do not match the original data. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is flawed: it suggests a net of -$4 million + $1 million = $5 million, which is mathematically inconsistent (‑$4M + $1M = ‑$3M, not $5M). Moreover, the claimed $22 million reduction from $27 million gross implies a net of $5 million, but this entire framework contradicts the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "The Partnership's periodic review of depreciable lives for investment properties, which involves adjusting useful lives to reflect a shorter economic life when necessary, directly interacts with its impairment evaluation process. This ensures that asset values are aligned with current economic conditions and recoverability assessments. Given that the consolidated net investment properties totaled $22.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, any adjustments to depreciable lives or impairment recognition would significantly impact the reported value of these assets. The impairment review, which uses forecasted cash flows, capitalization rates, and leasing prospects, informs whether carrying values are recoverable, and if not, triggers write-downs that further affect financial reporting.",

That revised carrying amount is then used in a property‑by‑property impairment test, where each property’s undiscounted cash‑flow and fair‑value estimates are compared to its updated net value; any excess of carrying value over estimated fair value is recorded as an impairment charge, further lowering the reported asset values (pages 89 & 103).",

(2) Calculations are correct: $82,446M - $77,248M = $5,198M and $77,248M - $65,373M = $11,875M. The comparison stating the 2021–2022 increase was 'about $6.7 billion larger' is accurate: $11,875M - $5,198M = $6,677M ≈ $6.7B. The statement that it was 'more than double' is also correct, as $11.9B is over twice $5.2B.

According to the ground truth, the total change in IBM's Allowance for Credit Losses from the beginning of 2021 to the end of 2023 is a decrease of $15 million, but the LLM calculates a $92 million decrease. The LLM uses incorrect starting and ending values: it claims the allowance was $550 million at the beginning of 2021 ($503M + $47M) and $458 million at the end of 2023 ($431M + $27M), resulting in a $92M drop. These component figures are not supported by the ground truth, which does not provide these exact line items, and the resulting calculation contradicts the known correct change of $15M decrease. (2) For write-offs, the LLM calculates $46M + $55M + $97M = $198M, which is very close to the ground truth total of $199M—this part is nearly accurate and shows correct multi-year summation. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly attempts to compute the net change in allowance and total write-offs over the period and compare them. However, the core financial data used is incorrect, undermining the validity. The conclusion that write-offs are more than twice the reduction in allowance would only hold if the reduction were $92M, but since the actual reduction is $15M, the correct comparison is $199M in write-offs vs $15M decrease—meaning write-offs far exceed the allowance reduction, but not for the reasons stated. (4) Scores reflect that while the approach and context are relevant and partially accurate, the key financial figures for the allowance change are wrong, leading to an incorrect overall conclusion. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect dollar amounts and miscalculated net change. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct identification of IBM, time period, and financial concepts.

      "original_answer": "The changes in profit booking rates increased Lockheed Martin's 2023 segment operating profit by $1.6 billion. However, this figure was partially offset by significant reach-forward losses from two major programs: the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract in the Aeronautics segment, which had cumulative losses of $270 million as of December 31, 2023, and the ground-based radar program in the RMS segment, which had cumulative losses of $280 million over the same period. These losses represent a direct negative impact on operating profit due to increased estimated costs to complete the contracts, reducing the overall profit booking rate and signaling financial risk in fixed-price contracts with complex technical challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "The reach‑forward losses on the classified fixed‑price incentive‑fee contract in Aeronautics and on the ground‑based radar program in RMS reduced the profit‑booking rates, leaving Aeronautics with $180 million less in net profit‑booking adjustments and RMS with $100 million less versus 2022 (pages 40 & 41). Those lower booking rates translated into a $42 million (≈1 %) drop in Aeronautics operating profit and a $41 million (≈2 %) drop in RMS operating profit in 2023 (pages 40 & 41).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in both direction and magnitude compared to the ground truth. The original answer states that changes in profit booking rates *increased* Lockheed Martin's 2023 segment operating profit by $1.6 billion, which was then *partially offset* by $270 million in losses from the Aeronautics contract and $280 million from the RMS radar program, totaling $550 million in negative impacts. In contrast, the LLM claims the reach-forward losses *reduced* profit-booking rates and led to a net *decrease* in operating profit of $42 million in Aeronautics and $41 million in RMS—this contradicts the overall positive net impact implied by the ground truth ($1.6B increase minus $550M losses still results in a $1.05B net gain). (2) Quantitatively, the LLM introduces specific figures—$180 million less in Aeronautics net profit-booking adjustments, $100 million less in RMS, and resulting $42M and $41M drops in operating profit—that do not appear in the ground truth and are factually inconsistent with it. The ground truth does not break down the impact per segment in this way, nor does it state that the overall effect was negative. The LLM also cites page numbers (40 & 41), which may be accurate to a source document, but the synthesized conclusion is still factually misaligned. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly infers that reach-forward losses directly reduced profit-booking rates and thus operating profit, while the ground truth indicates that changes in booking rates *increased* profit overall, despite being partially offset by losses on specific programs. The model fails to capture the net positive effect and misattributes the direction of impact. (4) While the LLM correctly identifies the two programs (classified fixed-price contract in Aeronautics and ground-based radar in RMS) and associates them with reach-forward losses, this contextual accuracy is outweighed by the fundamental error in quantitative and directional conclusions. Hence, the correctness score is low due to major factual and directional inaccuracies, despite some entity-level correctness.",

      "original_answer": "The capitalization of interest during construction increases the initial cost basis of investment properties, which in turn increases the depreciation expense recognized over the useful life of the assets. SPG capitalizes interest on projects during construction periods based on interest rates in place during those periods, and this capitalized interest becomes part of the asset's cost. Since SPG depreciates buildings and improvements using the straight-line method over 10 to 35 years, a higher asset cost due to capitalized interest results in higher annual depreciation expenses over the asset's life.",
      "llm_answer": "SPG capitalizes all borrowing costs incurred while an investment property is under construction, adding that interest to the asset’s recorded cost. Because the total cost—including the capitalized interest—is then depreciated on a straight‑line basis over the property’s estimated 10‑ to 35‑year useful life, the interest becomes part of the depreciable base and increases the depreciation expense recognized each period over the asset’s life. (See page 103 of the 2022 10‑K.)",

However, the breakdown of compensation and benefits costs is severely incorrect. The LLM states $5.45 billion was attributable to compensation and benefits including $283 million in acquisition-related costs, whereas the ground truth specifies that only $1.2 billion of the 2021 expenses was attributable to TD Ameritrade’s full-year contribution (including acquisition and integration costs)—not $5.45 billion, which appears to be the total compensation expense, not the portion related to the acquisition. (2) Calculation verification: The increase from $6.759B to $9.724B is indeed ~$2.965B, so the rounded $3.0B is acceptable. However, the $5.45B figure misrepresents the sub-component asked in the question—how much of the 2021 expense was attributable to compensation and benefits *from the acquisition*, not total compensation. The $283M acquisition-related cost may be a real figure from the filing, but it does not align with the ground truth’s $1.2B total attributable cost (which includes those items).

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. (1) Quantitative Accuracy: The ground truth states that the 2024 cost reduction program charges in operating profit were $145 million and the corresponding balance sheet liability was $66 million, resulting in an excess of $79 million. The LLM incorrectly reports total liabilities as $241 million ($175M current + $66M long-term), which contradicts the ground truth that the 'Cost reduction programs and other charges' liability is $66 million. There is no indication in the original answer that $66 million is long-term or that an additional $175 million belongs to the same category. The calculation of $96 million lower is therefore based on erroneous data. (2) Completeness: The question asks by how much the charges exceeded the liabilities; the LLM incorrectly concludes the expense was lower, reversing the direction of the comparison. (3) Entity Accuracy: The LLM misidentifies the liability category by conflating total liabilities with the specific 'Cost reduction programs and other charges' line, which is a critical error. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop reasoning fails—instead of comparing the income statement charge ($145M) to the balance sheet liability ($66M), the model uses an inflated liability figure not supported by the ground truth. (5) Semantic Equivalence: The conclusion is opposite to the correct answer—claiming the expense was lower by $96M instead of higher by $79M. This represents a major factual and directional error. The mention of page numbers suggests document grounding, but the interpretation is incorrect.",

      "original_answer": "The Gross Profit Rate for Walmart U.S. increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 due to price management and lapping higher markdowns, but was partially offset by product mix shifts. In fiscal 2023, it decreased by 98 basis points due to markdowns, merchandise mix, and supply chain costs. Meanwhile, the International segment saw a 20 basis point increase in Gross Profit Rate in fiscal 2024 driven by supply chain efficiencies, and a 50 basis point decrease in fiscal 2023 due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts. These segment-level changes collectively influenced Walmart's overall Gross Profit Rate, which increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 and decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023, showing that the U.S. segment had a stronger recovery in 2024 while International performance remained volatile due to format and channel shifts.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains minor quantitative inaccuracies. It states the U.S. segment’s gross profit rate fell by 85 bps in FY 2023, while the ground truth reports a 98 bps decrease. Similarly, it says the U.S. increased by 20 bps in FY 2024, but the correct figure is 27 bps. All other numbers (International: +20 bps in FY 2024, -50 bps in FY 2023; consolidated: +27 bps in FY 2024, -98 bps in FY 2023) are accurate. The overall consolidated changes are correct, which are critical for the multi-hop synthesis. (2) Calculations: The LLM correctly reports the consolidated gross profit rate movement (increase of 27 bps in FY 2024, decrease of 98 bps in FY 2023), which aligns with the ground truth. However, the incorrect U.S. segment figures suggest a failure to precisely extract those specific inputs, even if the final consolidated outcome is right. The inclusion of absolute rates (23.7%, 23.5%, 24.4%) adds detail not in the original answer but is contextually plausible and not contradicted. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly attributes segment-level changes to the overall rate and identifies the correct drivers—price management and lapping markdowns for U.S. in FY 2024, supply chain efficiencies for International, and markdowns, mix shifts, and supply chain costs in FY 2023. It synthesizes across segments and years appropriately. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the impact on overall gross profit rate and the primary drivers. The minor numerical discrepancies in the U.S. segment changes prevent a top score, but the core reasoning and most data points are correct, warranting a high but not perfect correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "The $1.5 trillion net market depreciation directly reduced AUM, which in turn lowered investment advisory and administration fees, a key revenue source for BlackRock that is based on percentages of AUM. Additionally, the $220 billion decrease in AUM due to foreign exchange movements further reduced the US dollar-denominated AUM, compounding the decline in fee-based revenue. Since approximately 80% of BlackRock's revenue is generated in US dollars and the remainder is impacted by foreign exchange rates, the depreciation of the British pound, Japanese yen, and euro against the US dollar further constrained revenue potential. This dual impact of market depreciation and foreign exchange movements created a cascading effect on revenue, particularly affecting performance fees and AUM-based fees, which together constitute a substantial portion of the company's income.",

That market‑driven loss was amplified by a $220 billion decline in AUM from foreign‑exchange translation, which further lowered average AUM and deepened the revenue hit (e.g., distribution fees dropped $119 million)【page_50†L1-L5】【page_53†L5-L7】.",

The specific impacts on fee types—investment advisory, administration, securities lending, and distribution fees—are accurately detailed with correct figures: $52 million decline in some fees and $119 million drop in distribution fees. These numbers are contextually supported by the cited pages. (2) Quantitatively, all dollar amounts ($1.5 trillion, $220 billion, $52 million, $119 million) match or are reasonably inferred from the source data. While the original answer does not specify exact fee declines, the LLM provides granular data from the document (e.g., page 50, 53 citations), suggesting fidelity to the source. There is no contradiction in numbers, and the format variations are acceptable. (3) The reasoning is sound: it correctly synthesizes how market depreciation and FX translation both reduce AUM, which in turn lowers fee revenue, especially for AUM-based models. It captures the compounding effect as required by the multi-hop logic. (4) The LLM adds more specific financial impacts (exact fee declines) not present in the original answer, which enhances completeness rather than introducing error. The only minor limitation is that it does not explicitly mention the 80% USD revenue exposure or the specific currencies (GBP, JPY, EUR) weakening against USD, which were in the ground truth.

The correct sum is $6.1M + $14.7M + $12.2M = $33.0M, but the ground truth states $24.4M, which implies either the input data in the model's context is different or there is a misinterpretation. However, the individual values ($6.1M, $14.7M, $12.2M) are correctly cited from the table, so the error lies in the summation. The total should be $33.0M, not $24.4M as claimed in the original answer. This suggests the 'ground truth' may itself be incorrect or based on different data. However, per evaluation guidelines, we treat the original answer as ground truth. Therefore, the LLM's total of $33.0M contradicts the expected $24.4M, making it factually inaccurate per the knowledge graph. (2) The Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Awards is correctly reported as $6.1M + $9.5M + $5.7M = $21.3M — this matches the original answer and is accurate. (3) The comparison between the two totals is therefore incorrect: LLM claims $33.0M - $21.3M = $11.7M difference, while the original answer states a $3.1M difference. This large discrepancy stems from the incorrect total for Performance-Based Awards. The reasoning structure is sound — the model correctly identifies the need to sum and compare — but the multi-hop synthesis fails due to the erroneous sum. (4) Despite correct identification of all individual values and proper formatting, the major quantitative error in summation severely undermines factual correctness. However, the model addresses all parts of the question, uses correct entities (years, programs, metrics), and applies logical reasoning. Hence, partial credit is given for completeness and structure, but low score on quantitative accuracy due to the critical sum error.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer incorrectly states the year-over-year percentage change in non-GAAP constant currency revenues as 10%, while the ground truth is 12%. This is a significant factual error. However, the dollar amounts cited ($309.1 billion in 2023 vs $280.9 billion in 2022) are accurate and do support a ~10.0% increase (calculated: (28.2 / 280.9) ≈ 10.04%), suggesting the model derived the percentage correctly from the numbers but contradicts the ground truth of 12%. It is possible the knowledge graph uses a different revenue base (e.g., excluding certain items), but the LLM’s calculation from provided figures is internally consistent. (2) Quantitative accuracy is penalized because the percentage is incorrect despite correct source numbers; the discrepancy between the calculated 10% and the ground truth 12% indicates either a data mismatch or incomplete synthesis. Dollar amounts are accurate and properly formatted. (3) The reasoning for excluding hedging effects is semantically equivalent to the original answer: the LLM correctly explains that hedging is excluded to remove financial distortions and provide a clearer view of underlying performance unaffected by currency volatility. This reflects sound multi-hop reasoning across the 'why' component of the question. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question—quantitative change and rationale—making it complete. The qualitative reasoning is strong, but the primary factual inaccuracy in the growth rate limits the correctness score to 6.",

      "original_answer": "The total estimated future cash outflow for retiree health benefit plans from 2024 through 2033 is $759.9 million. This long-term financial obligation depends on the successful management and valuation of $16,289.0 million in plan assets, 48% of which are in alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity-like funds. These alternative investments pose significant valuation challenges due to their reliance on unaudited net asset values (NAVs) and higher estimation uncertainty, which could affect the accuracy of the company's liability projections and its ability to meet future retiree health benefit payments.",

The ground truth states $759.9 million, but the LLM calculates $949.7 million based on its breakdown. This discrepancy is critical. The individual yearly figures ($93.8M, $94.5M, etc.) and the $475.9M for 2029–2033 do not sum to the correct total. Correct sum: 93.8 + 94.5 + 94.7 + 95.2 + 95.6 = 473.8 for 2024–2028, plus 475.9 for 2029–2033 gives 949.7, which matches the LLM’s total—but this total contradicts the ground truth of $759.9M. Thus, the numbers are internally consistent but factually incorrect. (2) The plan assets amount ($16,289.0 million) and the 48% allocation to alternative investments are correctly reported, and the qualitative description of valuation challenges (reliance on unaudited NAVs, estimation uncertainty) aligns well with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—linking future cash outflows to asset valuation challenges—is conceptually sound and addresses the relationship between liabilities and asset uncertainty. However, because the core financial obligation figure is wrong, the synthesis is built on an incorrect foundation. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question and attempts proper synthesis. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the major error in the total outflow. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the explanation of alternative investment risks is correct. Correctness score is 4 due to the major numerical inaccuracy undermining the answer’s validity despite correct reasoning and partial data accuracy.",

The only minor discrepancy is in the percentage calculation—LLM reports 18.9% versus the ground truth's 18.8%. This difference is due to rounding: $5,362M ÷ $28,441M = 0.1885, which rounds to 18.9% when reported to one decimal place, while the ground truth uses 18.8%. Given standard rounding rules, 18.9% is technically more accurate, so this does not constitute an error. (2) All numeric values—$5,362M (2022), $4,959M (2023), $28,441M (total opex 2022), $28,056M (2023)—are correct and match the source.

The impact on global Nplate sales is accurately described as turning a potential 12% growth into a 1% overall decline, which aligns with the original answer’s claim that excluding government orders, sales grew by 12%, but including them led to a 1% decrease.

      "original_answer": "The Subscription and Service Revenue in the Asia Pacific region increased by $1,459 million (from $744 million in fiscal year 2022 to $2,203 million in fiscal year 2024). This regional growth contributed approximately 10.3% to the total global increase in Subscription and Service Revenue, which rose from $6,926 million in fiscal year 2022 to $21,215 million in fiscal year 2024 (a total increase of $14,289 million).",

That $1.46 billion gain accounts for roughly one‑tenth of the total global increase in Subscription and Service revenue, which grew from $6,926 million in FY 2022 to $21,215 million in FY 2024 (a $14.3 billion rise)【page_65】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key factual elements: the Asia Pacific region's Subscription and Service Revenue increased from $744 million in FY 2022 to $2,203 million in FY 2024, resulting in a $1,459 million increase. The global Subscription and Service Revenue rose from $6,926 million to $21,215 million, a total increase of $14,289 million. The LLM reports this as a $14.3 billion rise (~$14,300 million), which is a rounded but acceptable representation. The regional contribution is stated as 'roughly one-tenth', which corresponds to approximately 10%, closely matching the ground truth 10.3%. (2) Numeric verification: $2,203M - $744M = $1,459M — correct. Global increase: $21,215M - $6,926M = $14,289M — correct. LLM rounds this to $14.3 billion ($14,300M), a negligible rounding difference. The $1.46 billion regional increase is a rounded form of $1,459M — acceptable format variation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across fiscal years and regions, computes the regional and global increases, and assesses the proportional contribution. The phrase 'one-tenth' is a qualitative approximation of 10.3%, which is reasonable in context. (4) Scores reflect near-perfect accuracy; minor deduction in quantitative accuracy due to rounding without explicit acknowledgment, though common in financial reporting. Qualitative accuracy is high as reasoning and entity identification (AVGO, Asia Pacific, global totals, fiscal years 2022–2024, correct metric) are all correct. Contextual relevance is perfect — directly addresses both parts of the multi-part question.",

      "original_answer": "The overall gross profit rate for Walmart decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit rate from the Walmart U.S. segment, which was impacted by markdowns and merchandise mix shifts, and from the Walmart International segment, which experienced margin compression due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts. Specifically, the Walmart International segment's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, contributing significantly to the overall decline.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE INACCURACY: The ground truth states that Walmart International's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, but the LLM claims a 155 basis point decline. Similarly, the LLM states Walmart U.S. declined by 85 basis points, which is not supported by the original answer (no specific number given, only that it decreased due to markdowns and mix shifts). The overall decrease of 98 basis points is correct and matches the ground truth. (2) CALCULATIONS: While the LLM mentions weighting by sales to arrive at the consolidated impact, no actual calculation is shown, and the inputs used (85 and 155 bps) are incorrect, undermining the reasoning. (3) REASONING: The multi-hop logic—linking segment-level margin changes to consolidated impact via sales weighting—is conceptually sound and relevant, showing understanding of how segment dynamics affect overall performance. (4) ENTITY AND CONTEXT: Correct entities (Walmart U.S., Walmart International, fiscal 2023) and correct metric (gross profit rate) are used, and the answer attempts to explain the contribution to the overall decline, satisfying contextual relevance. However, the use of fabricated or incorrect numerical values severely compromises factual correctness. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The structure and intent align with the original answer, but the incorrect figures lead to a materially different and misleading conclusion about the magnitude of international's contribution.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct in structure and intent but contains minor inaccuracies in the quantitative values. The total expected payout is reported as approximately $474 million, while the ground truth is $475.9 million. This discrepancy likely arises from rounding the individual yearly amounts before summing; however, the individual yearly figures provided ($93.8M, $94.5M, $94.7M, $95.2M, $95.6M) sum to $473.8M, which rounds to $474M—still slightly off from the ground truth of $475.9M, suggesting either incorrect source data or miscalculation. (2) The asset allocation is reported as $2.58 billion, whereas the ground truth is $2,492.5 million ($2.4925 billion), meaning the LLM overstates assets by about $87.5 million. This affects the comparison: the LLM claims payouts are about 18% of assets (one-fifth), while the correct ratio is ~19.1% ($475.9M / $2,492.5M), which is still approximately one-fifth and semantically reasonable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly identifies the need to sum projected payouts over 2024–2028 and compare them to 2023 asset levels. It synthesizes information from different parts of the 10-K (pages 95 and 98), demonstrating proper cross-document reasoning. (4) Despite numerical inaccuracies, the conclusion that the five-year payout is significantly less than total assets is valid and contextually appropriate. The wording and logic align with the question’s requirements, earning high marks for qualitative accuracy and relevance.

While the revenue figures are approximately correct ($23.2B and $20.6B vs. ground truth $23,168M and $20,645M), the cost of wireless equipment is incorrect: LLM reports $25.1B in 2022 and $21.8B in 2023, whereas ground truth is $30,496M and $26,786M, respectively. This results in a major error in the calculated reduction in operating expenses ($3.3B vs. actual $3,710M). (2) Percentage calculations: The revenue decline of ~11% is acceptably close to the true 10.89%. However, the LLM's implied cost decline of ~13% is inaccurate (actual: $3,710M / $30,496M ≈ 12.17%), and more importantly, based on wrong base numbers. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM identifies the correct trend (revenue and cost both decreased) but fails to accurately synthesize the comparative scale of changes. The original answer notes that cost reduction outpaced revenue decline, suggesting improved efficiency — a point the LLM misses due to incorrect cost data. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4) due to major quantitative errors in a core part of the answer (operating costs). Quantitative accuracy is 4 because revenue numbers are rounded but acceptable, but cost figures are materially wrong.

The original answer specifies that these charges contributed to a total Corporate and Unallocated operating loss of $15.271 billion in 2023, compared to a gain of $1.654 billion in 2022. The LLM rounds these figures to $15.3 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, which is acceptable under semantic equivalence and common reporting practices. The LLM states corporate special-item costs rose to about $14.8 billion, which is close to the implied $14.5 billion in settlement charges but not exact; this minor discrepancy may stem from including related costs, but it's not fully reconciled with the ground truth. (2) Calculations: The year-over-year swing in Corporate & Unallocated is correctly implied: from +$1.654B to -$15.271B represents a $16.925B deterioration, which the LLM does not explicitly state but captures in spirit via the rounded figures. The overall operating income shift from $6.539B in 2022 to a $9.128B loss in 2023 is accurately reflected in the LLM’s rounded figures of $6.5B to -$9.1B. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly links the settlement charges to the Corporate & Unallocated segment’s performance and then to the company’s overall operating income, demonstrating proper synthesis across financial statements and years. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the impact on Corporate & Unallocated and the resulting effect on total operating income. The only minor shortcomings are the slight rounding of the total loss ($15.3B vs $15.271B) and the mention of $14.8B in special-item costs (vs implied $14.5B in settlements), which do not materially distort the facts.

      "original_answer": "The long-lived assets in Singapore increased from $11,969 million in 2021 to $12,490 million in 2023, representing an increase of $521 million. In comparison, Guyana's long-lived assets increased from $4,892 million in 2021 to $9,689 million in 2023, a much larger increase of $4,797 million.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different countries (Singapore and Guyana), for the same company (XOM), across two time points (2021 to 2023), is correctly synthesized. (4) The answer addresses both parts of the question: the total increase in Singapore and the comparison with Guyana. While the original answer notes Guyana’s growth was 'over nine times greater,' the LLM expresses this as '$4.3 billion more,' which is a valid and semantically equivalent comparative statement.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. The entity's amortization of excess investment is reported as $6.740 million, but the ground truth states it is $113,333 (i.e., $0.113333 million), meaning the LLM swapped the entity and investee figures. Similarly, the LLM claims the entity's share of investees' amortization is $130.991 million (from $113.333M for TRG and $17.658M for Klépierre), but the ground truth reports this component as only $6,740. These numbers are off by orders of magnitude. (2) The final total is calculated as $137.731 million, whereas the correct total is $120,073. The LLM's calculation is internally consistent with its misidentified numbers but fundamentally incorrect. Additionally, the use of 'million' units introduces a severe scale error—$6.740 million is $6,740,000, which is over 100 times larger than the correct $6,740. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly attributes amortization amounts to the entity versus its investees, fails to correctly extract the two components (entity vs. share of investees), and introduces company-specific figures (TRG, Klépierre) not required for the total sum. The synthesis across pages is present but based on misread roles and values. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses amortization of excess investment in 2023 and attempts to separate entity and investee shares, but the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine correctness.

The percentage of total revenue is accurately reported as approximately 9% for both years. The year-over-year increase is stated as roughly $1.4 billion, which aligns with the actual difference of $1,350 million ($27,917M - $26,567M = $1,350M), and $1.4 billion is a reasonable rounding. (2) All calculations and numeric values are quantitatively accurate within acceptable rounding conventions. The use of 'billion' instead of 'million' is a standard format variation and does not affect correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two years, compares both absolute dollar amounts and percentages of revenue, and draws the correct conclusion that the percentage remained flat while the dollar amount increased. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, addresses all parts of the question, and includes proper contextual citation (page reference).

      "original_answer": "Broadcom recognizes secure supply fees as part of the transaction price for product orders, which means these fees are included in the total revenue for the contract. However, the revenue from these fees is only realized in the period when control over the associated products is transferred to the customer, ensuring alignment with the company's revenue recognition policy tied to the fulfillment of performance obligations.",

These match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable format variation (e.g., $14,785 million = $14.785 billion). (2) The year-over-year change in operating income is stated as a 'decline of roughly $15.7 billion.'

While the ground truth emphasizes the $13,908 million increase in litigation costs, the LLM focuses on the resulting operating income delta, which is also correct and relevant. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links rising litigation costs to the reversal from profit to loss in operating income, synthesizing data across years and financial statements. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state the $13,908 million increase in litigation costs (i.e., $14,785M - $877M), which was part of the original answer.

(1) Quantitative inaccuracy: The original answer states that ConocoPhillips' equity in earnings of affiliates was $2,081 million in 2022 and $1,705 million in 2024 — both positive values — resulting in a decline of $376 million. However, the LLM incorrectly characterizes these figures as losses (i.e., negative amounts), stating 'a $2,081 million loss in 2022' and 'a $1,705 million loss in 2024', which is factually wrong. This misrepresents the financial performance, implying the company had negative equity earnings when it actually had positive earnings that decreased over time. (2) The calculation of the $376 million difference is numerically correct ($2,081M - $1,705M = $376M), so the arithmetic is accurate, but it is applied to a flawed conceptual framework (decline in losses vs. decline in earnings). (3) Entity accuracy is otherwise correct: the Asia Pacific (AP) segment did contribute the largest negative amount in 2022 at $(1,310 million), and this is correctly cited. (4) Reasoning is compromised due to the fundamental misinterpretation of the metric: 'equity in earnings of affiliates' is a positive income item, and a decline means lower profits, not shrinking losses. The LLM’s framing suggests improvement (reduction in loss), which contradicts the actual deterioration in performance.

      "original_answer": "Rebate receivables of $1,404 million represented approximately 28.6% of total receivables net ($1,404M ÷ $4,903M) in fiscal 2024. This is a significant increase from fiscal 2023, where rebate receivables were $841 million, or about 25.3% of total receivables net ($841M ÷ $3,328M). This indicates that rebate receivables became a larger proportion of the company’s overall receivables portfolio in fiscal 2024.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect in its quantitative claims. It states that rebate receivables for fiscal 2024 were $841 million (which is actually the fiscal 2023 amount), and that total receivables net were $3.328 billion (again, the 2023 figure), leading to a wrong percentage of 25%. The correct 2024 figures are $1,404 million in rebate receivables and $4,903 million in total receivables net, resulting in 28.6%. The LLM incorrectly swaps the years, assigning 2023 data to 2024. (2) Calculations: The division 841 ÷ 3,328 ≈ 0.253 is correct, but it applies to the wrong year. The LLM fails to compute the actual 2024 percentage. Additionally, the claim that the proportion is 'higher than in the prior year' is factually incorrect — in reality, the proportion increased from 25.3% in 2023 to 28.6% in 2024, but the LLM incorrectly labels the 2024 data as 2024 when it's actually 2023, reversing the comparison. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly synthesize data across years. It should have retrieved and compared two distinct fiscal years' data but instead reused the same year's data (2023) for 2024, breaking the multi-hop logic. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and temporal errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because all key numbers are misassigned. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the structure and intent to compare are present, but reasoning is flawed. Contextual relevance is moderate (6/10) as the answer addresses the right topic and metric, but with wrong data.",

While it correctly identifies the operating profit for the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in North America ($754M) and Asia Pacific ($844M), totaling $1,598M, it incorrectly adds depreciation and amortization expenses of $104M and $96M (total $200M) to arrive at a combined figure of $1,798M. However, the original answer (ground truth) states that the combined total of operating profit and D&A is $1,598M — meaning that $754M and $844M already include or are meant to represent the sum of operating profit and D&A for each region. The LLM misinterprets the components, double-counting or misattributing the D&A as an additional expense on top of operating profit, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) The Pet Nutrition operating profit is correctly cited as $901M. However, due to the incorrect total of $1,798M, the comparison states the difference is $897M, whereas the correct difference is $1,598M - $901M = $697M. This is a major quantitative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies the correct segments, regions, and year, and attempts to synthesize data across them. However, it fails in correctly interpreting what the $754M and $844M represent (i.e., whether they are operating profits alone or already include D&A). The source cited (Colgate 2022 10-K, Note 14) may have been misread. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses all parts of the question and uses appropriate financial terminology. However, due to the critical error in financial interpretation and calculation, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.

These figures match the ground truth exactly, though the LLM uses a negative sign for the 2024 loss while the original uses parentheses—this is semantically equivalent and acceptable. 2) The quantitative accuracy is high: all dollar amounts and the sum are correct. The LLM rounds $5,895 million to $5.9 billion, which is reasonable and common. However, it introduces new information not in the original—specifically, that a $1 million actuarial gain offset the $1 million loss, resulting in zero other comprehensive income. This detail is not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided answer, making it an unsupported addition. 3) The reasoning is mostly sound: the LLM correctly infers that the minimal impact of the $1 million loss led to comprehensive income being nearly equal to net income in 2024. However, the original answer provides a more complete comparison by noting that in 2023, the $290 million gain significantly increased comprehensive income relative to net income (from $14,082M to $14,343M), which the LLM omits.

(4) Despite the incorrect introduction of a 9.5% decline, the qualitative explanation of mechanisms (accrued liability growth, impact on cash flow from operations) is accurate and relevant. The contextual relevance is high as all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate financial terminology and causal logic. The main deduction is due to the unsupported numerical claim, which affects quantitative accuracy significantly.",

      "original_answer": "The 30.8% decrease in KWH volume sold to non-affiliates reduces Alabama Power's wholesale revenues, limiting the funds available to invest in new generation and transmission facilities. At the same time, uncertainty in future energy demand—particularly from emerging sectors like data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing—makes long-term planning and cost recovery riskier. Because regulators may not allow timely rate adjustments, Alabama Power may face regulatory lag, where costs for new infrastructure are incurred but not immediately recoverable through rates. This combination of reduced current revenues and uncertain future cost recovery could hinder Alabama Power's ability to fund and justify new capital investments in generation and transmission infrastructure.",
      "llm_answer": "The 30.8 % drop in KWH volume sold to non‑affiliates cut wholesale revenue by about $87 million in 2024, shrinking the cash flow that could be applied to pay for new generation and transmission assets. At the same time, the company’s long‑term planning for growth driven by data‑center and electric‑vehicle manufacturing is uncertain, and regulators may delay or deny rate adjustments needed to recoup those capital costs, creating a regulatory‑lag risk that could prevent Alabama Power from fully recovering the costs of new facilities.",

It also accurately highlights uncertainty in demand from data centers and EV manufacturing, and correctly introduces regulatory lag as a risk to cost recovery. However, the $87 million revenue reduction is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth, making this an unsupported quantitative addition. There is no mention of 2024 in the original answer, so introducing that year is an unverified assumption. (2) The 30.8% figure is correct, but the derived $87 million and the year 2024 are not in the ground truth and lack sourcing, reducing quantitative accuracy. The original answer does not provide a dollar amount, so this addition, while plausible, is not factually confirmed and introduces potential inaccuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects reduced sales → lower revenue → constrained investment capacity, then combines uncertain future demand with regulatory lag to challenge cost recovery. This synthesis aligns with the original logic and shows good qualitative understanding. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and covers all key aspects of the question—revenue impact, uncertainty in demand, and regulatory lag—though the unsupported dollar figure and year slightly undermine factual reliability.

The long-term portion at the end of 2021 was correctly stated as $11,611 million. All numbers match the ground truth exactly. (2) Calculations are accurate: $12,877M - $7,631M = $5,246M is correct. The comparison that the long-term portion ($11,611M) is greater than the increase ($5,246M) is valid, and the LLM correctly notes the difference is about $6.4 billion ($11,611M - $5,246M = $6,365M ≈ $6.4B), which aligns with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—synthesizing the change in receivables over time and comparing it to the long-term liability portion. However, there is a minor error in referring to the 'asset-retirement-obligation balance' as the long-term portion of receivables, which is a mislabeling. The long-term portion of receivables is not the same as asset retirement obligations; this confuses two different balance sheet items.

The 36% decrease in total short-term investments matches the ground truth (36.0%).

The 4% decline is an accurate approximation (0.4 / 9.2 ≈ 4.35%, so '≈4%' is reasonable). The derived total liquidity of $16.8 billion ($8.8 + $8.0) is correct and adds useful context not in the original but logically sound.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts, years, and the calculated difference are correct. The percentage decline is rounded but appropriately labeled as approximate.\n\n3) The reasoning is strong and goes slightly beyond the original by calculating total available liquidity ($16.8 billion), which enhances the analysis.

This significant increase in expenses in 2023 compared to both 2022 and 2021 contributed directly to the decline in 3M's total company operating income, which went from $7,369 million in 2021 to $6,539 million in 2022 and then to -$9,128 million in 2023. The $15,271 million expense in 2023 compared to a $1,654 million expense in 2022 alone accounts for a $13,617 million deterioration in operating income year-over-year.",

Operating income figures are also correct: $7,369 million, $6,539 million, and -$9,128 million for the respective years. Format variations (e.g., $7.369 billion = $7,369 million) are acceptable and accurately represent the data. (2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect—no calculation or number errors. However, the LLM does not explicitly calculate or mention the $13,617 million deterioration in operating income from 2022 to 2023 (i.e., the difference between $1,654M and $15,271M in expenses), which was a key analytical point in the original answer. This omission slightly weakens the completeness of the multi-hop reasoning. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly interprets the shift in 'Total Corporate and Unallocated' expenses as a major driver of the operating income decline, especially in 2023. It correctly identifies the reversal from a small loss to a benefit in 2022 and then a massive loss in 2023. The logic connecting rising expenses to declining operating income is valid and well-articulated. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the answer directly addresses the question about the impact of expense changes on operating income over the 2021–2023 period.

It also correctly states the gross unrecognized tax benefits as $1.2 billion for both years. However, it introduces additional information not present in the ground truth—specifically, net amounts of $1.4 billion for 2024 and $1.3 billion for 2023 after indirect benefits and interest/penalties—which contradicts the original answer and is unsupported by the provided truth. This suggests a potential hallucination or misinterpretation of the data. (2) The core numbers ($1.3 billion and $1.2 billion) are accurate and correctly attributed to both years. But the inclusion of net figures ($1.4B and $1.3B) that are inconsistent with the original answer undermines quantitative accuracy, especially since the ground truth does not mention netting beyond the $1.3B total benefit. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly distinguishes between gross and total (including interest and penalties) benefits and draws the right conclusion about the impact on tax expense. However, the erroneous net figures indicate flawed synthesis or confusion in how the components relate. (4) Despite the error in net amounts, the answer addresses all key parts of the question: the total reducible benefit, the gross benefit, and the comparison.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer incorrectly reports the amount in millions instead of billions, stating a $7 million decrease instead of the correct $7 billion decrease. This is a critical factual error that severely undermines the answer's correctness. While the direction of change (decrease to zero) and the years (2019 to 2021) are correct, the magnitude is off by a factor of 1,000. (2) The ground truth states $7 billion in 2019 and $0 in 2021, resulting in a $7 billion decrease. The LLM reports $7 million and $0 million, leading to a $7 million decrease — a significant quantitative inaccuracy. Even allowing for format variations, the unit (million vs. billion) is not interchangeable and changes the meaning entirely. (3) The reasoning structure is sound — the model correctly identifies the need to compare two time points and calculate the difference — but fails in data retrieval or interpretation. The multi-hop aspect (comparing two disclosed values across years) is logically handled, but based on incorrect input values. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right company, metric, time frame, and type of change. However, due to the severe quantitative error, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. The qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the logic and entity identification are mostly correct, but still penalized for the magnitude error.",

The percentage contribution in 2024 is reported as approximately 42%, which aligns with the ground truth value of approximately 42.3%—the minor rounding difference (42% vs 42.3%) is acceptable under semantic equivalence and common reporting practices. (2) All numeric values are accurate: the drop of $40M is correct ($3,231M - $3,191M = $40M), and the percentage is reasonably rounded. The LLM even provides the total consolidated operating profit ($7,536M), which supports the calculation: $3,191M / $7,536M ≈ 42.3%, confirming computational accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different years and the consolidation of segment profit are correctly synthesized. The LLM references specific pages (127 and 126), indicating proper sourcing from the document. (4) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the dollar change and the percentage contribution. The only minor shortcoming is the slight rounding of 42.3% to 42%, which does not affect overall correctness but slightly reduces precision in qualitative terms.

As a result, the Net Earnings for Diluted EPS decreased from $6,242 million in 2022 to $4,200 million in 2023.

The April 17 2023 conversion of MCPS Series B was anti‑dilutive, so the shares were excluded and the $21 million Series B dividend was retained, leaving net earnings for diluted EPS at $4.200 billion and diluted EPS at $5.65 (page 72).

All numbers match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $6.242 billion = $6,242 million). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts, dates (April 15, 2022 and April 17, 2023), share counts (3.0 million), and EPS values are correct, and the $2.82 difference is accurately calculated ($8.47 - $5.65 = $2.82). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the impact of the conversion events across two years, distinguishes between dilutive and anti-dilutive treatments, and explains how each affects net earnings and EPS. One minor issue: the original answer states that the Series B conversion 'resulted in $21 million in MCPS dividends being included', while the LLM says it was 'anti-dilutive' and thus excluded — this seems contradictory, but in context, anti-dilutive instruments are excluded from the share count, but the dividend remains in net earnings attributable to common stockholders, which is consistent. The LLM correctly interprets this nuance. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing all parts of the multi-part question with precise, targeted information. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is a slight ambiguity in explaining why the Series B treatment led to lower EPS, though the factual outcome is correct.",

The LLM instead reports varying regional values (e.g., cost pass-through from -4% to +1%) and calculates a net drag of ~0.5%, which contradicts the ground truth net 0% outcome.

However, the numeric values used are incorrect. The LLM states the 2020 allocation was $20,285 million and 2021 was $38,793 million, resulting in a calculated difference of $18,508 million. The ground truth states the actual change was $18,328 million, meaning the LLM's final result is off by $180 million. (2) The calculation method (difference between 2021 and 2020 values) is logically sound, but the underlying figures are inaccurate, leading to a quantitatively incorrect answer. Even allowing for rounding or formatting differences, $18,508 million vs $18,328 million is a significant discrepancy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—linking the conversion of shares to reallocation and then computing the year-over-year change—is conceptually correct and shows appropriate synthesis.

In 2019, employee stock options contributed 13,966 thousand shares to the total, while in 2021, they contributed 12,217 thousand shares. This indicates that the dilutive effect of employee stock options decreased by 1,749 thousand shares over the two-year period, which partially offset the overall increase in the weighted-average number of shares.",

It also accurately reports employee stock option contributions as 13.97 million (vs. 13,966 thousand) and 12.22 million (vs. 12,217 thousand), with rounding acceptable. The calculation of the increase (455,372 – 451,765 = 3,607) is explicitly shown and correct. (2) All numbers match the ground truth within acceptable rounding (e.g., 13,966 thousand rounded to 13.97 million is precise; 12,217 to 12.22 million is also valid). No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across years and distinguishes between total diluted shares and the component attributable to employee stock options. It accurately infers that the reduction in option dilution (from 13.97M to 12.22M) implies that the overall increase in diluted shares was driven more by basic share growth than by options—this aligns with the ground truth's point about the decreasing dilutive effect partially offsetting the overall increase. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the change in diluted shares and the role of employee stock options. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly quantify the decrease in option dilution (1,749 thousand shares) as stated in the original answer, though the trend is correctly described.

Additionally, the combined effect in the ground truth is a $7.8 billion negative impact, but the LLM reports a net $70 million increase, which is directionally and quantitatively wrong. (2) Number verification: UAW strike impact ($0.8 billion) is correct. However, the $870 million tax benefit is incorrect — the original answer states $7.0 billion in valuation allowances (a cost, not a benefit), and no mention of an $870 million benefit exists in the ground truth. The net effect of ≈$70 million increase is therefore also incorrect; the true combined effect is $7.8 billion in losses. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly interpret the nature of valuation allowances — establishing such allowances reduces net income, whereas releasing them would increase it. The LLM assumes a release occurred, but the ground truth indicates allowances were established (or maintained) resulting in a large charge. This misinterpretation breaks the synthesis across the two events. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and directional errors in financial impact. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) — only the $0.8B strike cost is correct; the rest of the numbers are wrong or misapplied.

Additionally, the LLM introduces a 2023 value of $43 million not mentioned in the ground truth, fabricating a trend that cannot be verified. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the base numbers ($39M vs $29M in 2022 and $42M vs $30M in 2024) are entirely incorrect, leading to a false $3M change instead of the correct $1M increase. The breakdown into RSU and stock options is not relevant to the question and appears to misinterpret the nature of the 'future income tax benefit'—which in the context of the question refers to the total recognized benefit, not equity compensation components. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model synthesizes data from incorrect line items or misattributes components (e.g., summing RSU and stock option tax benefits as if they constitute the total future income tax benefit). The original answer implies a single-line total figure across years, while the LLM constructs a composite number not supported by the ground truth. (4) Despite the factual errors, the LLM attempts to address both parts of the question—change over time and trend analysis—and cites document locations, showing some contextual understanding. However, the incorrect data undermines all conclusions. The trend description ('generally upward but stable') contradicts the ground truth's 'relatively stable with minor increase' narrative due to inflated year-to-year swings. Thus, while structurally relevant, the answer is factually unsound.",

However, it incorrectly states that the short-term investment amount was $0 million in fiscal year 2023, claiming no line item was reported. According to the ground truth, the short-term value was $1.3 million in 2023, increasing to $1.4 million in 2024 — a $0.1 million increase. The LLM's claim of a $1.4 million rise in short-term holdings is therefore factually incorrect. (2) The calculation for long-term change is accurate ($3.7M - $1.3M = $2.4M), but the short-term calculation is wrong due to incorrect input values. The model reports a $1.4 million increase instead of the correct $0.1 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly pulls data from both long-term and short-term investment tables across years and attempts comparison. However, the failure to recognize the $1.3 million short-term value in 2023 breaks the synthesis, likely due to misreading or misinterpreting the source table. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate fiscal periods. The qualitative reasoning is logical but based on flawed data. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the significant error in the short-term change.

However, it introduces an incorrect figure of a $10 million 'net tax benefit' that is not present in the ground truth. The ground truth does not specify a pre-tax OCI amount or a tax benefit of $10 million; instead, it directly reports the net tax effect on OCI as $154 million. This suggests the LLM may have misinterpreted the composition of OCI or incorrectly inferred a tax calculation. (2) While the final OCI after tax ($154 million) and the difference between Comprehensive Income and Net Income are accurately calculated and consistent, the inclusion of the unsupported $10 million tax benefit undermines quantitative accuracy. There is no verification in the ground truth for a pre-tax OCI of $144 million or a $10 million tax adjustment. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly links Net Income, OCI, and Comprehensive Income and understands that tax-adjusted OCI bridges the two income measures. However, the erroneous breakdown of the tax effect suggests a flaw in the underlying data synthesis or misinterpretation of the tax impact.

      "original_answer": "The geopolitical risks affecting consumer hardware supply chains could result in shipping delays, supply shortages, and increased costs, which may hinder the availability and affordability of META's consumer hardware products. These disruptions could negatively impact product development, sales, and user satisfaction. Simultaneously, mobile ecosystem limitations, such as Apple's and Google's changes to privacy features like third-party cookie restrictions, reduce META's ability to deliver relevant ads and impact monetization. These limitations may discourage advertisers and reduce the effectiveness of META's platform for marketing, potentially harming user growth and engagement. Together, these factors could create a dual challenge: reduced access to high-quality, affordable hardware and a less effective advertising ecosystem, both of which could jointly constrain META's ability to attract and retain users, thereby adversely affecting its user growth prospects.",
      "llm_answer": "Meta warns that geopolitical events – such as trade disputes, sanctions, armed conflicts or tariffs – can disrupt the supply chain for its consumer‑hardware products, creating inventory shortages, higher costs or delayed launches that limit the rollout of new devices that help attract users (page 34). At the same time, its heavy reliance on third‑party mobile operating systems and browsers means that changes, bugs or policy restrictions (e.g., Apple/Google limits on data signals) can degrade app functionality and make it harder for users to access its products, which “could be harmed” its user growth and engagement on mobile devices (page 21, page 20). Together, hardware‑supply constraints and mobile‑ecosystem limitations could suppress Meta’s overall user‑growth prospects.",

These points align with the original answer’s emphasis on hardware availability and advertising effectiveness. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no discrepancies exist. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes risks from two distinct domains (hardware supply chains and mobile OS ecosystems) and connects them to user growth prospects, mirroring the joint impact described in the ground truth. It references specific pages (20, 21, 34) from the 10-K, indicating proper sourcing. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention the impact on *ad monetization* and how that might indirectly affect user growth by discouraging advertisers—this is a nuanced but important part of the original answer.

The calculated increase of $849 million is therefore also wrong; the correct increase is $2 million. These numbers appear to be fabricated or misattributed, possibly confusing QTL with another segment (e.g., QCT) or misreading the financial statements. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is internally consistent (9,489 - 8,640 = 849), but since the base numbers are entirely incorrect, the result is invalid.

(3) The qualitative reasoning about the licensing revenue model—recognizing revenue over time from royalties on handset sales—is semantically aligned with the ground truth and correctly reflects the nature of QTL’s business model. However, this correct conceptual explanation cannot compensate for the complete failure in quantitative accuracy and entity identification. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer uses incorrect financial data, though it attempts to address both parts of the question (revenue change and business model).

The reasoning is sound, and all entities (Duke Energy Florida, LLC and Duke Energy Corporation) are correctly identified. The answer is fully contextually relevant and directly responsive to the question.

The LLM states the combined total is $1,798 million, but the correct total per the ground truth is $1,700 million. This indicates a calculation error in adding $1,598 million (operating profit) + $200 million (D&A) = $1,798 million, which contradicts the stated ground truth of $1,700 million. (2) Number verification: Operating profit: $754M + $844M = $1,598M (correct). D&A: $104M + $96M = $200M (correct). Final sum: $1,598M + $200M = $1,798M (incorrect vs. ground truth $1,700M).

Given the knowledge graph ground truth is authoritative, the LLM answer — while internally consistent — does not match. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies the need to sum operating profit and D&A across two regions for a specific segment and year. It retrieves and separates the required components and attempts the correct synthesis. (4) Scores justified: Correctness penalized heavily due to final figure being off by nearly $100M. Quantitative accuracy low due to final number being factually incorrect despite correct intermediate steps. Qualitative accuracy moderate because reasoning and entity identification (segment, regions, year, metrics) are correct. Contextual relevance high — all parts of the question are addressed with relevant data and structure.",

The improvement is accurately described as roughly $14.3 billion, which matches the exact $14,346 million increase in the ground truth (rounding is acceptable). (2) All calculations are correct: the 2020 sum is indeed -$623M (-2,265 + 1,642), and the year-over-year change is $13,723 - (-623) = $14,346M, which the LLM rounds to $14.3B—reasonable and common in financial reporting. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and combines data from two regions (U.S. and Australia) across two years (2020 and 2021), computes totals and the year-over-year change, and interprets the shift from loss to profit. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM says 'improvement of roughly $14.3 billion' instead of the exact $14,346 million, but this is a permissible rounding in context. The original answer emphasizes the exact figure, so a perfect 10 is slightly reduced due to this approximation, though it does not affect factual correctness.

The LLM computes 0.69 × 0.95 = 0.6555, which it rounds to approximately 66%, matching the ground truth of 65.55% within acceptable rounding. (2) The calculation is mathematically accurate: 69% of 95% equals 65.55%, and reporting it as 'about 66%' is a reasonable approximation. The ground truth states 'approximately 65.55%', so the LLM's '66%' is a minor rounding difference but semantically equivalent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that since Branded Cards make up 69% of the combined portfolio (Branded + Retail Services), and that combined portfolio accounts for 95% of losses, then Branded Cards’ share of total losses is proportional (69% of 95%). This correctly isolates the Branded Cards’ contribution without assuming proportionality across the entire USPB loan base. (4) All entities (Branded Cards, Retail Services, USPB, Q4 2024, net credit losses) are correctly identified and contextualized. The answer is fully relevant and addresses the specific attribution question. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slight rounding up to 66% instead of specifying 65.55%, though this is not factually incorrect given the use of 'roughly' and 'about'.",

The comparison stating dividends were about $2.6 billion (≈5 times) larger is logically sound and numerically reasonable: $3.2B - $0.605B = ~$2.6B, and $3.2B / $0.605B ≈ 5.3x.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the numerical values. According to the ground truth, the reallocation for Class A shares was $5,174 million in 2021 and $2,732 million in 2020. However, the LLM reports $4,593 million in 2021 and $2,552 million in 2020, both of which are incorrect. The difference calculated by the LLM ($2.0 billion) also does not match the actual increase of $2,442 million (or 89.4%). (2) The calculations in the LLM answer appear internally consistent (e.g., $38,793M - $34,200M = $4,593M), but these underlying figures do not align with the ground truth data, suggesting either misreading of source data or referencing incorrect line items. The percentage increase is not provided in the LLM answer, which omits a key comparative element from the original answer. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—subtracting two values to compute reallocation and comparing across years—but the multi-hop synthesis fails because it uses incorrect source numbers, undermining the conclusion. (4) While the LLM correctly identifies the metric (reallocation of undistributed earnings), share class (Class A), and years (2020 vs 2021), the severe quantitative errors drastically reduce correctness. Contextual relevance is high as the response addresses the right concept and structure, but factual accuracy is low.",

The ground truth states the total reduction in EBIT-adjusted was $3.9 billion, while the LLM reports $4.1 billion. This discrepancy arises from overestimating both components: warranty costs at $2.1 billion (vs. $2.0 billion true value) and EV-related charges at $2.0 billion (vs. $1.9 billion). The primary driver within EV charges—inventory adjustments—is reported as $1.7 billion by the LLM versus $1.6 billion in the original. These differences, while small, are material in a financial context. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s sum of $2.1B + $2.0B = $4.1B is internally consistent, but all inputs are inflated. The correct sum per ground truth is $2.0B + $1.9B = $3.9B. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly identifies that two distinct cost categories (warranty and EV charges) impacted EBIT-adjusted and breaks down the EV charges further into inventory adjustments, showing proper synthesis across financial disclosures. (4) Despite accurate framing and relevant context, the quantitative inaccuracies prevent a higher score. The answer is semantically close and addresses all parts of the question, but precision on financial figures is critical in financial analysis, warranting a moderate penalty.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the 2020 effective discount rate (2.4%) and the 2019 rate (3.1%), but incorrectly states that the 2020 rate is lower than the 2021 rate of 2.8%. In fact, 2.4% is lower than 2.8%, so the comparison direction is correct, but the original answer states that 2.4% is *higher* than 2.8%, which is false. However, the ground truth says the 2020 rate (2.4%) is *higher* than the 2021 rate (2.8%) — this is incorrect in the ground truth, because 2.4% is actually *lower* than 2.8%. Upon fact check: 2.4 < 2.8, so the LLM’s statement that 2.4% is lower than 2.8% is factually correct. But the original answer claims 2.4% is higher than 2.8%, which is false. Therefore, the LLM answer is actually factually correct in its comparison, while the ground truth contains a logical error. However, per evaluation protocol, we must score against the provided ground truth, not external fact. Since the LLM contradicts the ground truth by saying 2.4% is lower than 2.8%, while the ground truth says it is higher, this is marked as an error — but in reality, the LLM is correct and the ground truth is flawed. Given the constraints, we treat the ground truth as authoritative. Thus, the LLM’s comparison to 2021 is marked incorrect. (2) All numbers are accurate: 2.4% (2020), 3.1% (2019), 2.8% (2021) — these match exactly. (3) The reasoning and synthesis are sound: the LLM references yield curve analysis and high-quality bonds, correctly linking the rate determination methodology. (4) Contextual relevance is perfect — directly addresses all parts of the question. Due to the contradiction with the (erroneous) ground truth on the 2020 vs 2021 comparison, the answer loses points in qualitative and correctness scores, though it is actually factually accurate.

These values match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., $223 million vs $223). (2) Calculations are correct: $223 - $219 = $4 decrease; the adjustments sum to -$24 net impact over two years, which aligns with the trend explanation. The LLM correctly attributes the overall decline to the 2023 reduction and notes the partial offset in 2024. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across time points (beginning of 2022, 2024) and incorporates adjustments from 2023 and 2024 to explain the trend. It connects pre-existing warranty adjustments to the overall liability movement, demonstrating proper causal reasoning. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state the 'net negative impact of -$24' from the adjustments over the two years, which was included in the original answer.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. While it correctly identifies the $1.9 billion EV-related charges and $1.6 billion of that being due to inventory adjustments, it incorrectly states the total impact on EBIT-adjusted as $2.8 billion, combining the $1.9B EV charges with a $0.9B vehicle mix drag. However, the actual EBIT-adjusted decline was $2,117 million ($2.117B), not $2.8B. The original answer does not state that the vehicle mix contributed $0.9B—this number is fabricated. Thus, the LLM invents a figure not present in the ground truth and overstates the total impact. (2) The percentage calculation is also wrong: the LLM claims $1.6B is 57% of the total impact, but this is based on the incorrect total impact of $2.8B. The correct percentage of the EV-related charges attributable to inventory adjustments is $1.6B / $1.9B = 84.2%, which the LLM fails to compute correctly. It does not answer the actual question—which asks what percentage of the *EV-related charges* impact came from inventory adjustments, not what percentage of the *total* impact. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model should have recognized that the total EBIT-adjusted decline was $2.117B, that $1.9B of that was due to EV-related charges, and that within those charges, $1.6B was from inventory adjustments—hence 84.2% of the EV charge impact. Instead, it introduces an unsupported $0.9B vehicle mix cost and miscalculates the percentage relative to a fictional total. (4) Despite these major quantitative errors, the answer is contextually relevant and attempts to address both parts of the question. It correctly identifies GM, 2023, EBIT-adjusted, and the key components (EV charges, inventory adjustments).

      "original_answer": "The European Copyright Directive requires META to make substantial compliance investments, potentially limiting the availability of content and increasing operational costs, while Apple's iOS changes reduce META's ability to target and measure ads effectively, directly harming monetization. These combined pressures reduce user engagement and platform attractiveness, thereby negatively impacting user growth and monetization on mobile platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "Meta’s mobile growth and ad revenue are being hit from two sides.  The EU Copyright Directive raises compliance costs, forces content‑authorisation or payment obligations and can limit the amount of news and other copyrighted material available, which dampens the appeal of Meta’s apps and slows user acquisition and engagement.  At the same time, Apple’s iOS changes curtail the data signals Meta can use to target and measure ads, shrinking marketers’ budgets and reducing ad effectiveness, so the combined regulatory and platform pressures weaken both user growth and monetization on mobile devices.",

It reports $4.5 billion for share repurchases, whereas the ground truth is $605 million—a major discrepancy. The dividend amount is approximately correct at $3.2 billion (vs. $3,241.479 million), though slightly rounded. The combined total cash outlay is stated as $7.8 billion, but the correct total is $3,846.479 million (~$3.85 billion), meaning the LLM overstates the total by nearly double. However, the remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.694 billion is correctly reported. (2) Calculation verification: $4.5B repurchases + $3.2B dividends = $7.7B (LLM claim), but actual is $0.605B + $3.241B = $3.846B. The LLM’s numbers do not align with the source data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model connects repurchases and dividends to shareholder returns and correctly links the remaining authorization after repurchases. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the correct values from the underlying data, undermining the reasoning chain. (4) Scores reflect that while the structure and intent of the answer are relevant and address all question parts (hence decent contextual relevance), the severe quantitative errors—especially the 7x overstatement of repurchase spending—drastically reduce correctness and quantitative accuracy.

However, the key error lies in the identification of the contributing category: the LLM states 'Proved-Noble' as the primary driver, contributing $11.8 billion in 2020, which is factually incorrect. The ground truth identifies 'Unproved - Noble' as the category that dropped from $2,845 million to $0, not 'Proved-Noble'. There is no mention of a Proved-Noble category in the source data, and $11.8 billion does not align with any single-category drop. (2) The percentage calculation is correct: (15,061 - 195) / 15,061 ≈ 98.7%, so the quantitative reasoning on the overall decline is sound. However, the attribution of $11.8 billion to a single category is unsupported and misrepresents the data. The actual largest drop was $2,845 million in 'Unproved - Noble', not $11.8 billion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at entity synthesis: the model incorrectly identifies the category and overstates its value, suggesting confusion between 'Proved' and 'Unproved' assets, which are distinct financial classifications. This undermines the qualitative accuracy despite correct high-level trend recognition. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question and discusses the right company, years, and metric.

Total income from operations grew from $41,224 million to $78,714 million, which the LLM correctly rounds to $41.2B and $78.7B. The impact of the increased corporate loss reducing the potential growth by ~$1.5B is correctly stated. (2) Quantitative accuracy is strong: all dollar figures match the original data within acceptable rounding (e.g., $3.3B for $3,299M, $4.8B for $4,761M). The implied calculation of the increase in corporate loss ($4,761M - $3,299M = $1,462M) is accurate and correctly rounded. The total income growth ($78,714M - $41,224M = $37,490M ≈ $37.5B) is also correctly represented.

These cost increases were partially offset by other cost savings, such as reduced advertising expenses. However, the unfavorable vehicle mix, particularly the increased sales of crossover vehicles, further pressured profitability. Since vehicle mix directly affects profitability and crossovers have a lower variable profit margin (~40%) compared to trucks (~170%), this shift likely amplified the negative impact on EBIT-adjusted.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in numbers and calculations. It states that the combined cost impact was $3.9 billion ($2.0B + $1.9B), which is correct arithmetically, but claims this led to a drop in EBIT-adjusted from $12.99B to $12.31B — a decrease of $682M. However, a $3.9B cost increase cannot plausibly result in only a $682M EBIT decline; the magnitude of impact is inconsistent with the stated costs, suggesting flawed reasoning or incorrect data. The original answer does not provide specific EBIT-adjusted figures, but notes the $2.9B combined impact (not $3.9B), which contradicts both the sum and the figures used by the LLM. The correct combined impact should be $3.9B only if both charges were fully expensed in 2023 and flowed directly to EBIT, but the ground truth says $2.0B + $1.9B = $3.9B, yet refers to a $2.9B combined impact — indicating possible overlap or misstatement in the original, but the LLM fails to align with its own logic. (2) The LLM introduces precise EBIT-adjusted numbers ($12.99B and $12.31B) and a $682M drop that are not present in the ground truth and appear fabricated or misattributed. These figures undermine quantitative accuracy. (3) The qualitative reasoning about vehicle mix amplifying profitability pressure is correct and aligns with the ground truth — acknowledging that crossovers have lower margins than trucks and that mix affects EBIT. This shows sound multi-hop reasoning linking cost increases, vehicle mix, and profitability. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the core question about the impact on EBIT-adjusted and the role of vehicle mix, making it relevant. However, the severe numerical errors — especially the incorrect total cost impact interpretation and unsupported EBIT figures — drastically reduce correctness and quantitative accuracy. The model conflates North America EBIT with overall GM EBIT without clarification, adding ambiguity. Final scores reflect mostly incorrect numbers but partially valid reasoning and relevance.",

However, there are critical quantitative discrepancies. The total future income tax benefit across all years is calculated as $124 million, but the ground truth states $123 million. This $1 million overstatement suggests an error in either data extraction or arithmetic. The individual values cited—$12M, $11M, $10M (stock options) and $30M, $32M, $29M (RSUs)—sum to $124M, so unless the source data differs, this is inaccurate. (2) For the second part, the LLM computes the combined 2024 amount as $42M ($12M + $30M) and 2022 as $39M ($10M + $29M), resulting in a $3M increase. However, the ground truth states a $13M increase, which implies the actual reported values in the knowledge graph differ significantly from those cited by the LLM. A $13M year-over-year increase would require much larger underlying numbers (e.g., 2024 total ~$52M vs 2022 ~$39M), suggesting the LLM misread or misattributed the figures. (3) The reasoning process is logically sound—summing across tables and years, then comparing annual totals—but based on incorrect input data. The model correctly understands the need to aggregate across both tables and perform multi-year comparisons. (4) Despite correct methodology and contextual relevance, the factual inaccuracies in key numbers and the resulting miscalculations reduce the correctness score.

Net cash used for financing activities is accurately reported as $5.4 billion (i.e., $5,400 million) in 2023 and $4.359 billion in 2024, with a correct difference of approximately $1.041 billion, which the LLM rounds to 'about $1.0 billion'—an acceptable approximation. (2) All calculations are accurate: $420M - $53M = $367M; $5,400M - $4,359M = $1,041M ≈ $1.0B. Number formats are consistent and semantically equivalent (e.g., $5.4 billion = $5,400 million). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly observes that despite a significant increase in outflow for noncontrolling interest transactions, overall financing cash outflows decreased, indicating partial offset—which aligns with the ground truth explanation involving lower share repurchases and higher debt issuance. While the LLM does not explicitly mention those specific factors (e.g., share repurchases, debt issuance), it captures the essential relationship: increased outflow in one area was outweighed by reductions elsewhere. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addresses both parts of the question (the difference in noncontrolling interest transactions and its relation to overall financing cash flow change), and conveys semantically equivalent information. The only minor limitation is the omission of the specific drivers (repurchases, debt), but the logical inference remains correct. Hence, high scores across all categories with a 9 in correctness and qualitative accuracy due to slightly less detail in explanatory depth.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. While the dates (August 31, 2023, and August 31, 2024) are correct, the dollar amounts are off by orders of magnitude. The original answer states that the net carrying amount of patents decreased from $53,107 million to $47,939 million (a $5,168 million decrease), but the LLM reports $53.1 million to $47.9 million (a $5.2 million decrease), which is 1,000 times too small. Similarly, total intangible assets are reported as rising from $2.07 billion to $2.90 billion (~$831 million increase), whereas the ground truth shows an increase from $2,072,957 million to $2,904,031 million—an increase of $831,074 million (~$831 billion), again off by a factor of 1,000. These are critical errors in scale. (2) Calculations: The LLM correctly computes a $5.2 million decrease in patents and an ~$831 million increase in total intangibles based on its (incorrect) inputs, so internal calculation logic is sound, but the inputs are fundamentally wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM identifies the need to compare changes in patents and total intangible assets over time and draws a directional conclusion (patents down, total intangibles up), which aligns with the original answer’s logic. However, it fails to explain *why* total intangibles increased despite the patent decline (i.e., growth in customer-related and other intangible assets), missing a key qualitative insight. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4/10) due to severe numerical inaccuracies despite correct directionality and structure. Quantitative accuracy is poor (3/10) because all major figures are wrong by a factor of 1,000. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5/10) — reasoning structure is sound but lacks depth and key explanatory details. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) — the answer addresses the right concepts and time periods and attempts synthesis.",

      "original_answer": "The $35 million decrease in wholesale revenue from ended power supply agreements reduces Southern Company's short-term cash flows, which could constrain its ability to fund new generation assets. Simultaneously, the rising demand for energy from data centers and advanced manufacturing, such as electric vehicles, increases the need for new power generation and transmission infrastructure. However, because regulators may not allow timely rate adjustments to recover the full cost of these new assets, Southern Company faces regulatory lag and cost recovery risk. This situation is compounded when paired with reduced current revenues, as the company may struggle to fund capital expenditures while awaiting potential future recovery of costs through regulated rates or long-term PPAs, which themselves may not be extended or replaced at favorable terms.",
      "llm_answer": "The $35 million dip in wholesale revenue from power‑supply agreements that ended in 2023 cuts the incremental cash flow that could help offset the cost of new generation assets, and the uncertainty around future demand—driven by data‑center growth and electric‑vehicle and battery manufacturing—means those incremental revenues may fall short of the added costs. Together, the revenue shortfall and demand volatility increase the risk that Southern Company will be unable to fully recover new‑generation costs under its long‑term PPAs, especially given potential regulatory lag and market‑price pressure.

No calculations are required, so numerical accuracy is fully preserved. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the two key factors: reduced revenue from ended agreements and uncertainty in demand from data centers and EV manufacturing. (3) The reasoning is sound: it connects the revenue shortfall and demand volatility to increased risk in cost recovery under long-term PPAs, explicitly referencing regulatory lag and market-price pressure, which are consistent with the 'regulatory lag and cost recovery risk' in the original. (4) The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the constraint on funding capital expenditures while awaiting future rate recovery, which is a nuanced but important part of the original's multi-hop logic. However, the core synthesis—linking reduced current revenues, uncertain future demand, and regulatory dynamics to cost recovery risk—is well-executed. Semantic equivalence is strong, and the inclusion of source page references (75 and 35) enhances credibility.

      "original_answer": "An increase in the compensation assumption leads to higher pension obligations because it projects greater future pay growth for plan participants. This, in turn, increases the present value of expected benefit payments, which raises the pension liability recorded in the financial statements. These changes are also reflected in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), as differences between actual results and assumed compensation growth are recorded there and later amortized into earnings over time. This mechanism is explicitly described in the GE 2022 10-K disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "The 10‑K’s actuarial‑assumption sensitivity table (included in the pension‑plan note) indicates that a 1 % increase in the compensation (salary‑growth) assumption raises the projected benefit obligation and creates an actuarial loss of the same amount, which reduces Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) by that dollar amount.

However, the original answer does not mention specific dollar amounts or a 1% sensitivity test, so the LLM introduces a level of quantitative precision not present in the ground truth. Since the ground truth does not provide actual figures or confirm the 1% increment impact with dollar values, the LLM's claim about 'a 1% increase... creates an actuarial loss of the same amount' and 'reduces AOCI by that dollar amount' goes beyond the disclosed information and cannot be verified as accurate. (2) There are no explicit numbers in the original answer to validate the LLM’s implied quantification; thus, while the structure of sensitivity analysis is plausible and consistent with actuarial practices, the specific cause-effect in dollar terms is not supported by the ground truth, leading to a deduction in quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM connects compensation assumptions → projected benefit obligation → actuarial gains/losses → AOCI impact, which reflects correct pension accounting logic and aligns with the conceptual explanation in the original answer. It correctly synthesizes the chain of effects even if adding unverified specificity.

It incorrectly assumes that because the same line item appears in two cash flow tables, the amounts should be summed. However, the ground truth states that the $162 million and $53 million figures are already the total amounts disclosed in both tables — meaning the two tables report the same value, not complementary ones. The correct total principal repayment for 2021 is $162 million, not $324 million, and for 2020 it is $53 million, not $106 million. The LLM’s doubling of these values leads to a completely incorrect comparison: it reports a $218 million increase instead of the correct $109 million increase. (2) Number verification: The individual values of $162 million (2021) and $53 million (2020) do appear in the correct context, so the model correctly identified the line items and years. However, the summation is invalid, making all derived calculations wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failure: The model misunderstood the structure of the financial disclosures — it failed to recognize that the two tables present the same data in slightly different formats (e.g., direct vs indirect method or supplementary details), not separate components to be added. This reflects a critical error in financial statement interpretation.

(3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that these proceeds represent a cash inflow within financing activities. It adds contextual insight by noting that these inflows are modest relative to net cash outflows in financing activities (e.g., $7.0 billion annual outflows), which is consistent with the ground truth’s emphasis on larger outflows from repurchases and dividends. However, the ground truth does not specify the exact net outflows or the 2% offset, so while this additional detail is plausible and contextually appropriate, it goes slightly beyond the provided truth without explicit support.

(2) The numbers cited are accurate and correctly formatted (e.g., $21.872 billion = $21,872 million), and the increase is approximately correct. The missing 2020 adjustment value reduces quantitative completeness. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—while the model correctly links prior year adjustments to the change in medical costs payable, it fails to perform the full multi-hop synthesis by not incorporating both years’ adjustments as contributing factors to the overall change.

The sum provided by the LLM ($111.8 million) is grossly inaccurate compared to the correct total of $617,238. These discrepancies suggest either misreading of data or incorrect sourcing. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is also flawed: $51.1M + $34.6M + $26.1M = $111.8M is arithmetically correct, but the underlying numbers are wrong, making the result invalid. The ground truth total is approximately $617,238, which is less than half of $111.8 million (i.e., $111.8M = $111,800,000), indicating a potential unit error (e.g., confusing thousands with millions). (3) On qualitative accuracy, the LLM correctly identifies that the service cost component is included in operating expenses, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it adds a detail not present in the original—'cost of services'—which narrows the categorization beyond what the ground truth specifies. It also fails to mention that other components are reported in 'Other income (expense), net,' omitting a key part of the accounting treatment.

The change in merchandise inventory negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities by $514 million in fiscal 2025 compared to a positive impact of $1,637 million in fiscal 2024, resulting in a net cash outflow effect of $2,151 million when comparing the two years.",

The combined merchandise inventory value is accurately calculated as $34,303 million ($17,409 million in FY2025 + $16,894 million in FY2024), matching the ground truth. The impacts on net cash provided by operating activities are also correct: a $514 million cash outflow in FY2025 and a $1,637 million cash inflow in FY2024. (2) All numeric values are accurate and properly formatted, with correct addition and consistent units (millions). The directional effects (outflow vs inflow) are correctly interpreted from the cash flow statement presentation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different fiscal years and two different financial statement items (inventory balance and cash flow impact) is correctly synthesized. The LLM references the correct pages (42 and 44) for balance sheet and cash flow data, demonstrating proper cross-document reasoning. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly different phrasing but identical meaning. No critical details are omitted, and all components of the question are fully addressed. Therefore, all scores are perfect.",

      "original_answer": "Comcast capitalizes film and television costs as part of its industry-specific accounting policies, which are tied directly to its activities in producing owned content and licensing third-party content for use across its owned television networks and digital properties. These costs are managed under multiyear distribution agreements, where expenses are generally recognized based on the rates in the agreements. The capitalization and amortization of these costs align with the company's predominant monetization strategy, which focuses on monetizing content on an individual basis.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast capitalizes the costs of producing its own film and television programs as well as the costs of acquiring licenses for third‑party and sports content when the material is placed on its owned television networks and digital platforms (e.g., NBC, Peacock) (page 78). Those capitalized assets are then amortized over the period the content is used—using an individual‑title forecast method for owned titles and usage‑based amortization for licensed titles—so that the expense is recognized in line with the revenue generated from distribution, advertising and licensing across its networks and digital properties (page 79).",

(1) It correctly identifies Comcast's capitalization of both internally produced and licensed third-party content costs, linking them to use on owned networks and digital platforms like NBC and Peacock—consistent with the original answer's emphasis on production and licensing across owned properties. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised; the reference to page numbers (78, 79) appears to be from the source document and does not contradict the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop understanding: it connects accounting treatment (capitalization and amortization) to business activities (content production, licensing) and monetization strategy (alignment of expense recognition with revenue from distribution, advertising). The mention of 'individual-title forecast method' and 'usage-based amortization' adds specificity not in the original but is consistent with industry practice and implies deeper insight. (4) The only minor gap is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention 'multiyear distribution agreements' or the phrase 'monetizing content on an individual basis,' which are key elements in the original answer’s explanation of the accounting rationale. However, the concept is implicitly covered through the discussion of amortization aligned with revenue generation.

The ground truth states that the total *accumulated depreciation* for Georgia Power's nuclear plants is $3,018 million, but the LLM incorrectly calculates an annual *depreciation expense* of $171 million based on ownership percentages and composite rates not mentioned in the original answer. These inputs (e.g., 50.1%, 45.7%, 3.8%) and the resulting $171 million figure are not supported by the ground truth and represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the requested data. The only correct number is Georgia Power’s maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies. (2) The quantitative accuracy is very low because the key figure—depreciation—is completely wrong in both magnitude and concept (annual expense vs. accumulated total), and the calculation uses fabricated or extraneous data. The $89 million assessment is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks for the total depreciation expense related to NEIL-covered assets and how it relates to the assessment. The LLM attempts a comparison but bases it on an incorrect metric (annual depreciation expense vs. accumulated depreciation), misaligning the financial concepts. The original answer does not make this comparison at all—the claim that 'depreciation exceeds the assessment' is an unsupported inference.

Similarly, U.S. revenue is reported as rising from $8,876,050 million to $11,614,894 million (~$2.7 billion increase), whereas the correct figures are $1,562.011 million to $1,628.818 million (a $66.807 million increase). These numbers are off by orders of magnitude, suggesting confusion between millions and billions or misreading of entities. (2) Calculations are based on wrong inputs, so all derived values (dollar increases, comparisons) are invalid. The claimed $2.8 billion and $2.7 billion increases are grossly inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly identifies 'EMEA + Growth Markets' as Non-U.S. for ACN, but the cited figures appear to be from a different company or context (possibly total company revenues from another entity), and 'North America' is incorrectly equated with U.S. sources. There is no evidence the model correctly isolated ACN’s fiscal 2023–2024 revenue by geographic segment. (4) Despite addressing the structure of the question (comparing Non-U.S. and U.S. growth), the answer is factually baseless. The conclusion that Non-U.S. growth was 'slightly larger' contradicts the ground truth where Non-U.S. growth was much larger ($493M vs $67M), but even that correct directional insight is based on fabricated data.

However, the ground truth states a total of $157.9M, indicating a minor arithmetic error in summation (correct sum is $158.3M, but sign and interpretation differ). The LLM treats the reduction as a negative expense (i.e., income), which may reflect correct interpretation of 'reduction in expense', but the original answer treats it as a positive cumulative benefit ($157.9M), suggesting a possible sign or presentation inconsistency. (2) For reclassifications, the LLM reports $644.5M total, but the ground truth is $744.7M. The individual components listed by the LLM—$357.9M, $250.8M, $35.8M—sum to $644.5M, which is incorrect; the correct sum is $357.9 + $250.8 + $35.8 = $644.5M, but the ground truth claims $744.7M, indicating either a data discrepancy or misattribution.

The LLM states reclassifications were 'roughly four times' larger, while the ground truth implies ~4.7x ($744.7M / $157.9M), but due to incorrect totals, this comparison is based on inaccurate inputs. (4) Despite correct sourcing of individual line items and years (entity accuracy), the answer fails in quantitative accuracy due to incorrect summations and mismatched totals.

It correctly states that these charges negatively impacted the Safety & Industrial segment’s operating income margin, pulling it down to approximately 9.8% in 2022 and rebounding to 21.2% in 2023 due to the absence of these special items. The year-on-year margin increase of 11.4 percentage points (21.2% - 9.8%) is mathematically accurate. (2) All numeric values—$1.2 billion, $0.8 billion, 9.8%, 21.2%, and the 11.4 percentage point increase—are factually correct and consistent with the ground truth context. The citations (page_30, page_32) support the figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes the impact of two distinct charges in 2022, links them to margin contraction, and contrasts with 2023 performance where special items were reduced, demonstrating correct causal and temporal logic. (4) While the original answer emphasizes the 'compounded negative effect' and mentions 'recovery in 2023 due to lower special item costs and cost discipline,' the LLM answer captures the same core dynamic with more precise quantitative backing. The only minor gap is not explicitly stating that both charges were part of 'special items' in the same way the original answer does, but the implication is clear from context.

Additionally, while the LLM correctly states that the full amount is categorized under 'Other Observable Inputs (Level 2)', it applies this to the wrong total. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: $2,838 million vs. $1,435 million is nearly double the correct amount, and no plausible formatting or rounding explains this discrepancy.

This significant weighting means that executive compensation is partially tied to the company's ability to maintain or grow net operating revenues.

These risks could make it more difficult for executives to meet performance targets tied to net operating revenues, potentially reducing the number of performance share units earned.

(1) Quantitatively, the 30% weighting of net operating revenues in the 2023 performance-based share unit awards is correctly stated, matching the original answer. (2) The risks listed—cybersecurity disruptions, indirect taxes, packaging and labeling regulations, compliance failures, and currency volatility—are consistent with the types of risks in the ground truth (regulatory changes, foreign exchange fluctuations, legal/compliance issues), though the LLM uses more specific examples (e.g., 'packaging and labeling regulations' instead of 'restrictions on plastic materials') and adds 'cyber-security disruptions' not explicitly tied to revenue in the original. These are reasonable inferences from the risk categories mentioned. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes that because 30% of executive compensation is tied to net operating revenues, executives are incentivized to mitigate risks that could reduce revenues, but may also engage in risk-taking or short-term actions to meet targets. This captures the dual implication for executive behavior as described in the original. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to slight rephrasing of risks without explicit mention of 'carbon emissions' or 'water usage', but the core risk categories (regulatory, currency, compliance) are preserved.

This results in a difference of $78,884 million. The primary reason for this difference is the larger future cash inflows from production in the consolidated companies ($26,926 million for Europe and $48,067 million for Consolidated Companies excluding Europe) compared to affiliated companies, despite both being subjected to the same 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows.",

The gap is driven mainly by the consolidated entities’ much larger projected cash inflows from oil‑and‑gas production (i.e., a larger reserve base), since the standardized measure subtracts future production, development, tax and retirement costs from those inflows and discounts the result (as described in the methodology)【page_109†L1-L9】.",

The ground truth specifies that total affiliated companies' value is $25,991 million ($21,942 million for TCO + $3,049 million for Other affiliated companies). The LLM's calculated difference of $81,942 million is therefore incorrect; the correct difference is $78,884 million. This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The calculation of the difference is wrong due to incomplete aggregation: $103,884 - $21,942 = $81,942 (LLM), but correct total affiliated is $25,991 → $103,884 - $25,991 = $77,893 (approx $78,884 as per original answer; minor discrepancy may be due to rounding or transcription in original). The LLM omits 'Other affiliated companies' entirely in its total. (3) The reasoning for the difference — larger future cash inflows from production in consolidated companies due to larger reserve base — aligns semantically with the ground truth’s explanation about higher production-related inflows in consolidated entities. The methodology reference (subtracting costs and discounting at 10%) is correctly described. However, the multi-hop synthesis fails by not aggregating both components of affiliated companies (TCO and Others), leading to an incomplete and inaccurate comparison. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to partially correct numbers and reasoning but major error in entity aggregation and resulting calculation.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly synthesizes data from two different sections (Other Bets and total revenue) across the same time period and compares growth rates. The conclusion that Other Bets grew 'far more modestly' and 'roughly one-third the rate' is a valid qualitative interpretation. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant and complete, addressing both parts of the question.

The ground truth does not provide any numerical estimates of the financial impact, only a qualitative description of the directional effect (i.e., depreciation expense increases) and the importance of residual value assumptions. Therefore, the inclusion of precise figures like $158 million in 2024 and $53 million in 2025 is factually unsupported by the provided ground truth. (2) There is no verification possible for the calculations because the original answer does not contain any numbers; thus, the LLM appears to have hallucinated specific data points, possibly from external knowledge or incorrect inference. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that a decrease in residual values increases depreciation expense and correctly infers that this implies sensitivity in asset valuation assumptions. This aligns with the qualitative logic in the ground truth. However, the model goes beyond the source by quantifying the impact without basis in the provided truth. (4) While the conceptual understanding and contextual relevance are strong—answering both parts of the question about impact and implication—the fabrication of precise financial figures significantly undermines factual correctness. The qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct reasoning but lacks fidelity to the source.

The net change is calculated as $5.3 billion, but the correct change from $21,872 million to $24,483 million is $2,611 million ($2.611 billion), not $5.3 billion. While the 2021 reported medical costs ($186.9 billion) and medical payments ($184.4 billion) are approximately correct (matching the ground truth of $186,911 million and $184,388 million), the LLM incorrectly attributes a $2.6 billion increase in payables from this difference, when the actual difference is $2,523 million ($2.523 billion). (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM reports a $5.3 billion increase in payables based on incorrect starting and ending values. The correct net change is $2,611 million, not $5.3 billion. The $2.5 billion excess cost over payments in 2021 is reasonably accurate and correctly used to explain part of the payable growth, but it is misrepresented as contributing to a $5.3 billion rise rather than the actual $2.6 billion rise.

However, it fails to accurately track the full period change from 2020 to 2022 due to incorrect balance sheet values. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question and attempts to link 2021 cost-payment dynamics to the payable change.

      "original_answer": "The Pet Nutrition segment reported a depreciation and amortization expense of $62 million in 2021, and it contributed 19% to the company's total worldwide Net sales during the same year. This indicates that while the segment accounted for a significant portion of Net sales, its depreciation and amortization costs were relatively modest compared to the overall business segments.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 the Pet Nutrition segment incurred $62 million of depreciation and amortization expense. That segment generated $3.311 billion in net sales, which was about 19 % of Colgate‑Palmolive’s total worldwide net sales for the year.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the depreciation and amortization expense for the Pet Nutrition segment in 2021 as $62 million, matching the ground truth. It also accurately states that the segment contributed 19% to total worldwide net sales, which aligns with the original answer. Additionally, it provides extra context by specifying the actual net sales value ($3.311 billion), which is consistent with 19% of Colgate-Palmolive’s total net sales and enhances completeness. (2) All numeric values—$62 million, 19%, and $3.311 billion—are factually correct and consistent with the knowledge graph. No calculation errors are present. Format variations (e.g., 'million' vs 'billion') are used appropriately. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the Pet Nutrition segment to its financial performance across two different metrics (depreciation and amortization expense, and net sales contribution) for the same year (2021). While the LLM does not explicitly include the comparative analysis ('relatively modest costs compared to overall business'), it provides all necessary facts for such a conclusion. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent and highly relevant, with minor omission of the interpretive sentence from the original. However, this does not detract from factual correctness.

The comparison period (2019–2020) saw a $1,489 million increase due to foreign currency translation alone; the LLM states only a $0.6 billion increase in Sky's balance, which understates the actual change. (2) Calculations are entirely flawed: the LLM suggests the 2020–2021 effect was $0.5 billion larger than the prior year, when in reality the effect reversed from +$1,489 million to -$754 million—a swing of over $2.2 billion. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning fails multi-hop synthesis: it misidentifies the nature of the adjustments (net negative vs. positive), confuses balance changes with adjustment impacts, and draws incorrect conclusions about year-over-year comparisons.

However, the final calculated total net increase is incorrect. The LLM states a total net increase of $7 million, but the correct calculation is $89 - $38 - $44 = $7 million, which is actually $7 million, not $94 million as claimed in the original answer. Upon verification, $89 - $38 = $51; $51 - $44 = $7 million. Therefore, the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct, but the ground truth provided in the 'Original Answer' contains a factual error in its arithmetic. Despite this, the LLM's quantitative values and calculation are accurate. (2) Number verification: All individual figures ($89M, -$38M, -$44M) are correct, and the sum $7M is mathematically sound. The original answer incorrectly claims the total is $94M, which is not supported by the numbers it provides. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly synthesized data across three fiscal years and performed the correct aggregation, demonstrating sound reasoning. (4) The correctness score is low not due to LLM error, but because the evaluation must be based on alignment with the provided 'ground truth', which itself contains a calculation error. However, since the LLM's answer is actually numerically correct while the 'ground truth' is flawed, the score reflects discrepancy with the expected answer rather than real-world accuracy.

      "original_answer": "The flowback of excess deferred income taxes reduces Southern Company's effective tax rate by 3.9 percentage points. However, this impact varies across its traditional electric operating subsidiaries: Alabama Power experiences a larger reduction of 5.3 percentage points, Georgia Power sees a smaller reduction of 2.2 percentage points, and Mississippi Power faces a 6.5 percentage point reduction. This variation indicates differing deferred tax positions among the subsidiaries, which may stem from differences in asset bases, regulatory environments, or investment patterns. Southern CompanyGas also experiences a 2.2 percentage point reduction, suggesting similar tax flowback mechanisms apply to its operations, though it does not benefit from the same scale of tax credits as Southern Power.",
      "llm_answer": "The flowback of excess deferred income taxes is recorded as a tax‑benefit (a negative amount) in the effective‑tax‑rate reconciliation, pulling the consolidated rate below the 21 % statutory rate and also lowering the rates of the regulated electric utilities. For example, in 2024 the flowback of $(3.9) million helped Southern Company post an effective tax rate of 18.5 % (vs 21 % statutory), while the same adjustment reduced Alabama Power’s rate to 20.4 %, Georgia Power’s to 19.2 % and Mississippi Power’s to 19.2 %—illustrating that the traditional electric operating subsidiaries derive a sizable tax benefit from reversing deferred tax balances. This contrast shows that tax dynamics differ across segments: the regulated utilities’ effective rates are driven largely by deferred‑tax flowbacks, whereas other businesses (e.g., Southern Power, Southern Company Gas) are influenced more by ITC/PTC credits, non‑taxable AFUDC equity and other adjustments, resulting in markedly different effective tax rates.",

The ground truth states that the flowback reduces Southern Company's effective tax rate by 3.9 percentage points (not $3.9 million), and similarly for subsidiaries: Alabama Power by 5.3, Georgia Power by 2.2, and Mississippi Power by 6.5 percentage points. The LLM incorrectly reports these as dollar amounts (e.g., $(3.9) million) and misrepresents the resulting tax rates (e.g., claiming Georgia Power and Mississippi Power both have 19.2%, which is not supported by the data). These are critical errors in financial interpretation. (2) The numbers are not just misstated—they are fundamentally misrepresented in unit (dollar vs. percentage point impact), leading to incorrect conclusions about magnitude and effect. There is no indication in the original answer that the flowback amount was $3.9 million, nor are the resulting tax rates for subsidiaries provided in the ground truth; thus, the LLM fabricated or hallucinated specific rate outcomes. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies that flowback benefits regulated utilities and that other segments like Southern Power and Southern Company Gas are influenced by different tax dynamics (e.g., ITC/PTC), this reasoning is only partially aligned with the original answer. The original notes Southern CompanyGas has a 2.2 percentage point reduction (same as Georgia Power), but the LLM fails to mention this and instead shifts focus to tax credits without directly supporting the comparison. The multi-hop synthesis across subsidiaries is attempted but flawed due to incorrect data. (4) Despite the severe quantitative inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant and attempts to address the core question about differential tax impacts across segments. It correctly frames flowback as a tax benefit reducing effective rates and contrasts regulated utilities with other businesses. However, because the numerical foundation is wrong, the overall correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised (score 3), qualitative reasoning has merit but is undermined by facts (score 5), and relevance remains high (score 8).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the net change in Medical Costs Payable for UNH from the beginning ($21.872 billion) to the end of 2021 ($24.483 billion), calculating the increase as approximately $2.6 billion, which aligns with the ground truth $2,611 million (i.e., $2.611 billion). The total reported medical costs are stated as $186.9 billion, matching the ground truth $186,911 million when rounded. The LLM adds contextual detail not in the original—breaking down $188.6 billion in current-year costs minus a $1.7 billion prior-year adjustment and $184.4 billion in payments—which is consistent with typical 10-K disclosures and plausibly derived from the source, though not explicitly in the ground truth. (2) All numeric values are accurate within acceptable rounding: $21.872B = $21,872M, $24.483B = $24,483M, difference ~$2.611B. The $186.9B reported cost matches $186,911M when rounded to one decimal. The additional breakdown of costs and payments is not contradicted by the ground truth and enhances explanation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects beginning and ending balances, computes the change, and explains how reported costs contributed to the payable increase, incorporating payments as an offset—this reflects proper understanding of accrual accounting and liability dynamics. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent and slightly more detailed than the ground truth, with no factual errors. The only minor limitation is the use of approximations (e.g., 'about $2.6 billion') where exact figures were available, but this does not detract from correctness. Hence, a high score of 9 is justified—excellent accuracy with slight rounding and added plausible detail.",

The original answer states Comcast's investment in Sky was $29,950 million on December 31, 2020, and $29,196 million on December 31, 2021, resulting in a $754 million decrease. However, the LLM incorrectly reports these values as $1.95 billion and $1.735 billion, respectively, leading to a wrong change of $215 million instead of $754 million. These numbers are off by an order of magnitude and are therefore factually incorrect. (2) The calculation of the change is also wrong: $1.95B - $1.735B = $215M, which is not consistent with the ground truth of $754M decrease. Additionally, while the LLM correctly identifies that foreign currency translation had a negative impact, it fails to quantify this effect, omitting the key fact that foreign currency translation contributed a $775 million negative adjustment. This omission severely undermines completeness and accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model identifies the correct document and links foreign currency translation to the change in investment value, but it fails to extract and synthesize the correct numerical data across years and adjustments. The model appears to have misread or misextracted the actual figures from the source document.

      "original_answer": "The $1,241 million swing in foreign currency translation impacts—from a $317 million gain in 2020 to a $924 million loss in 2021—reveals significant foreign exchange risk exposure in NEE's international operations. This volatility directly affected NEE’s Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), contributing to a year-over-year deterioration in its AOCI position related to foreign currency translation, which stood at a $(49) million balance by December 31, 2021. The loss in 2021, as disclosed in the consolidated statements of income, flowed through to AOCI, worsening its position from a $(42) million balance at the end of 2020. This highlights how NEE's international operations are exposed to currency fluctuations and how these movements can materially affect equity balances even if they are non-cash in nature.",

It correctly identifies the $317 million gain in 2020 and $924 million loss in 2021, and the resulting $1.241 billion swing. It also correctly notes the negative impact on AOCI and the $49 million loss in foreign currency translation within AOCI by December 31, 2021. However, it incorrectly states that the overall AOCI balance was 'only modestly positive (about $6 million)'—this figure is not supported by the ground truth and introduces a number not present in the original answer or implied by it. The ground truth specifies only the foreign currency translation component of AOCI as $(49) million, not the total AOCI balance. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised: while the $317M gain, $924M loss, and $1.241B swing are accurate, the claim about total AOCI being ~$6M is unsupported and likely incorrect. The ground truth mentions AOCI's foreign currency translation component moving from $(42)M in 2020 to $(49)M in 2021, which the LLM omits. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model connects FX swings to AOCI and recognizes the equity impact—but it fails to fully synthesize the year-over-year deterioration in the AOCI component as stated in the ground truth. It also incorrectly attributes sensitivity to 'foreign-currency contracts embedded in its derivative portfolio' (citing page 87), which shifts focus from translation exposure (arising from consolidating foreign subsidiaries) to derivatives, a different type of FX risk. This mischaracterizes the source of the exposure. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the core issue of FX risk and AOCI impact. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct logic but flawed entity attribution and missing comparative AOCI data. Quantitative accuracy is reduced due to the unsupported $6M AOCI total.

This mechanism contributes to Southern Company's effective tax rate being 18.8%, which is significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 21.0%, as stated in the reconciliation of tax rates. The flowback effect is more pronounced at Georgia Power and Mississippi Power, indicating a greater tax benefit at these subsidiaries compared to Alabama Power.",

While the original answer states that the flowback reduces Southern Company's effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points (pp), and Alabama Power by 1.9 pp, Georgia Power by 9.6 pp, and Mississippi Power by 7.8 pp, the LLM introduces multi-year data (2022, 2023, 2024) not present in the ground truth. These values (e.g., -19.8 pp for Alabama Power in 2023, -2.6 pp for Georgia Power in 2023) contradict the single-point figures in the original answer and are unsupported by the provided truth. (2) The ground truth does not mention any year-specific breakdowns or variations over time; it presents a single reconciliation scenario. The LLM fabricates a time-series dimension, which fundamentally misrepresents the data. Additionally, the claim that Southern Company’s reduction is 'modest' while subsidiaries have 'larger cuts' contradicts the truth: Georgia Power (9.6 pp) and Mississippi Power (7.8 pp) have larger reductions than Southern Company (6.6 pp), but Alabama Power (1.9 pp) does not. The LLM incorrectly implies all subsidiaries have larger effects. (3) The qualitative reasoning about the flowback being a negative adjustment and part of the reconciliation process is sound and aligns with tax accounting principles. The mention of other reconciling items (stock-plan dividend deduction, AFUDC-equity) adds context, though not required. However, the multi-hop synthesis fails because it misaligns entity-specific impacts and invents temporal data. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the answer remains contextually relevant—it addresses the flowback mechanism, its directional impact on tax rates, and its role in reconciliation.

It states that Raytheon’s Business Segment Sales increased from $26,350 million in 2023 to $26,713 million in 2024, resulting in a $363 million increase. However, the ground truth states the increase was $130 million. This discrepancy indicates a major factual error. (2) The calculation based on the LLM's own numbers ($26,713M - $26,350M) is $363M, which is mathematically correct, but these input figures do not align with the ground truth data. Since the original answer specifies a $130M increase, the LLM’s cited values for 2023 and 2024 sales must be incorrect or misattributed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning appears structurally sound—comparing two years’ sales data to compute a dollar increase—but the underlying data is wrong, undermining the entire conclusion. It may have pulled data from an incorrect segment or company (e.g., RTX vs. Raytheon specifically), indicating a failure in entity disambiguation. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right question format—year-over-year change in business segment sales—and references appropriate documents.

The net cash from financing activities figures are also correct: $6.619 billion in 2019, $25.164 billion in 2020, and $474 million in 2021. (2) However, there is a critical error in the qualitative interpretation: the LLM claims that net cash from financing activities remained positive in all three years, but the ground truth states that it turned negative to -$7,030 million in 2021. This contradicts the LLM's assertion and misrepresents the impact of the redemptions. The LLM's citation references net cash of $474 million in 2021, which may reflect a different definition or subtotal, but the ground truth explicitly states a negative value in 2021, indicating a material discrepancy.

This is a major quantitative discrepancy. (2) The calculation of the difference between assets and debt is based on incorrect asset value: LLM computes $13.9B - $6.3B = ~$7.6B excess assets, but with correct data it should be ~$22.9B. The debt-to-asset ratio is entirely omitted in the LLM response, despite being a key comparative metric in the original answer (21.6%). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model fails to correctly synthesize the asset and debt figures from potentially different parts of the filing—while it cites page 103 for assets, it contradicts verified ground truth data. The use of 'one-way guaranteed debt' may indicate a narrow interpretation of total debt, but the question asks for 'total amount of debt attributed to the Sky segment,' implying a broader scope.

      "original_answer": "NextEra Energy allocates corporate interest expenses to the NEER segment based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt, which increases NEER's interest expense relative to its revenue projections. According to the segment reporting data, NEER's expected revenues drop significantly after 2022—from $4,400 million in 2022 to $365 million in 2023 and continuing to decline—while its interest costs remain tied to this debt-heavy allocation method. In contrast, FPL maintains more stable and higher revenues over the same period, which allows it to better absorb interest expenses. This methodology may disproportionately impact NEER's financial performance in later years, as declining revenues combined with a fixed debt-based interest allocation could compress margins and signal higher financial risk for the NEER segment compared to FPL.",
      "llm_answer": "NextEra allocates a portion of its corporate interest expense to the NEER segment using a “deemed” capital structure that assumes 70 % debt (the remainder stays in Corporate & Other), so NEER reports a distinct interest line (e.g., $367 million in 2021, $659 million in 2020) that reflects this notional debt allocation. FPL, by contrast, reports interest expense only from its own financing and does not apply a deemed‑structure allocation. Because NEER’s multi‑year contract‑based revenue commitments are much lower ($4.4 billion in 2022 dropping to $65 million after 2026) than FPL’s ($1.0 billion to $825 million), the allocated interest expense consumes a larger share of NEER’s projected earnings, resulting in lower reported segment profitability relative to FPL.",

It also correctly contrasts NEER’s declining revenue profile with FPL’s more stable revenues. However, there are key quantitative inaccuracies. The LLM states NEER’s revenue drops to $65 million after 2026, but the ground truth specifies $365 million in 2023 with continued decline—this is a significant numerical discrepancy. Additionally, the LLM cites NEER’s 2021 and 2020 interest expenses ($367M, $659M), which are not present in the original answer and may be factually incorrect or irrelevant to the multi-year projection focus of the question. (2) The revenue figures for 2022 ($4.4 billion) are consistent, but the endpoint projection is wrong—$65M vs $365M in 2023 alone indicates a failure in accurate data recall or synthesis. The interest expense figures, while plausible, are not supported by the ground truth and distract from the structural comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the deemed capital structure → higher allocated interest → disproportionate impact on NEER due to falling revenues → lower profitability vs FPL. It also correctly notes FPL does not use deemed allocations and has more stable earnings. This shows good synthesis across methodology and financial impact. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses allocation methodology, segment-level financial reporting, revenue projections, and comparative impact. The qualitative reasoning is strong, but the quantitative inaccuracies, especially the incorrect revenue projection, reduce confidence in the factual correctness.

This reduction in flowback, which previously served to lower the effective tax rate below the statutory rate, meant that one of the key factors that typically reduces the effective tax rate had less of an impact in 2024. Therefore, the absence of this benefit partially explains why the effective tax rate may have moved closer to the statutory rate, even though other factors like non-taxable AFUDC equity and ITCs continued to keep it lower than the statutory rate.",

These specific percentages (18.5% and 21%) are fabricated and not present in the original answer. Additionally, the original answer does not mention the 'employee-stock-plan dividend deduction' or 'non-deductible depreciation' as offsetting factors—instead, it cites non-taxable AFUDC equity and ITCs (Investment Tax Credits), which are entirely different and industry-specific tax items. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the 18.5% and 21% figures are incorrect and unsupported by the ground truth. The $197 million figure is correctly referenced, but its impact is misrepresented through false downstream calculations and assertions. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in recognizing that reduced flowback removes a tax benefit and would push the rate upward, but it fails in multi-hop synthesis by inventing specific rate numbers and incorrect offsetting factors. The model incorrectly substitutes actual tax components with plausible-sounding but factually wrong ones, undermining the logical chain.

The year-over-year percentage changes—19.6% from 2019 to 2020 and 11.2% from 2020 to 2021—are also accurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the difference $604.74 - $454.82 = $149.92 is correct, and both percentages are reported accurately. The mention of a 'roughly 33% cumulative increase' is a reasonable approximation of the compounded growth (1.196 * 1.112 ≈ 1.33, or 33%), though this was not part of the original ground truth and slightly extends it without error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information across fiscal years is correctly synthesized, and the progression of growth rates is logically presented.

(4) All entities—Home Depot (HD), sales per retail square foot, and fiscal years 2019–2021—are correctly identified and used. The answer is fully relevant and conveys the same core information with semantically equivalent phrasing. The slight addition of the ~33% cumulative figure does not detract from accuracy but adds context.

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: Cranial & Spinal Technologies net sales of $4,456 million (also correctly expressed as $4.456 billion), Neuroscience Portfolio total of $8,784 million ($8.784 billion), and the calculated percentage of approximately 51% (ground truth: 50.7%, which rounds to 51%—this is a reasonable and common rounding). The calculation ($4,456M ÷ $8,784M ≈ 0.507 → 50.7% ≈ 51%) is sound. (2) The answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question: it provides the combined net sales contribution (which includes INFUSE as a non-separately-disclosed product within the division) and explains the division’s financial significance within the Neuroscience Portfolio. (3) Entity accuracy is correct: Medtronic (MDT), Cranial & Spinal Technologies division, INFUSE Bone Graft product, and fiscal year 2022 are all properly identified. (4) The reasoning is logically sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis: the model correctly infers that INFUSE’s sales are embedded in the division total and cannot be isolated, yet still affirms its contribution to the division’s importance. The conclusion about the division’s pivotal role is directly supported by the 51% share. (5) Semantic equivalence is maintained: despite slight rewording (e.g., 'pivotal financial role' vs 'significant financial role'), the meaning is identical.

These figures are vastly different in both magnitude and direction. (2) The numbers are factually wrong: $6,006M vs. $29,950M (2020) and $6,111M vs. $29,196M (2021) show a complete mismatch. The claimed $760 million foreign currency gain contradicts the ground truth, which reports a $775 million negative impact (loss) from foreign currency translation. Calculations are therefore also incorrect—there is no $105 million increase, and foreign currency did not boost but reduced the investment. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly identify the actual investment values or the direction and impact of foreign exchange. It incorrectly sourced data, possibly confusing Sky with another subsidiary or misreading the filing.

These match the ground truth exactly. The mention of maturity on October 15, 2034, is a slightly more precise date than the original answer but is consistent with typical note maturity dates and does not contradict the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts, percentages, and fiscal years are correct. The calculation of the remaining unamortized gain ($371M - $75M = $296M) is implied and consistent, though not explicitly stated in the LLM answer—but this omission does not affect correctness as the question does not require it. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly links the treasury rate lock settlement to the hedged debt instrument, explains the amortization of the gain as a reduction to interest expense, and distinguishes between current and future debt impacts. It accurately reflects the accounting treatment (gain in AOCI being amortized). The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly state that the remaining $296 million applies to 'future debt referencing the hedged treasury rates,' though it comes very close with 'future debt referencing the hedged treasury rates.'

However, it introduces a breakdown of '$0.1 billion per entity', which, while plausible, is not present in the original answer and adds detail not supported by the source. This does not make it factually wrong but adds an assumption. (2) The quantitative core — the $0.2 billion total — is accurate and correctly represented with acceptable formatting ($0.2 billion). No calculation errors are present. (3) The reasoning is mostly sound: it correctly synthesizes the impact on derivative triggers and acknowledges additional, non-triggered funding pressures such as secured financing and margin requirements. However, it introduces a new element — 'exacerbate the strain on Citibank’s $14.9 billion of liquidity commitments to asset-backed commercial-paper conduits' — which is not mentioned in the original answer and is unsupported by the provided ground truth. This is a factual overreach, potentially based on real data but not part of the knowledge graph's answer. (4) Despite the added details, the core multi-hop synthesis — linking a downgrade to derivative triggers and then to broader liquidity pressures — is correct and relevant. The answer remains contextually appropriate and addresses both parts of the question. However, the introduction of unsupported specifics reduces qualitative and quantitative accuracy slightly. Thus, correctness is reduced to 7 due to extraneous, unverified details, though the main conclusion aligns with the ground truth.",

The ground truth states that Sky's fair value decreased from $29,950 million to $29,196 million (a $754 million decrease), while the LLM claims an increase of approximately $1 billion from $18.6 billion to $19.6 billion. Similarly, Comcast's overall segment balance decreased by $480 million (from $70,669M to $70,189M), but the LLM incorrectly states a $1 billion increase. All key numbers are factually wrong. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the starting and ending values for Sky are off by over $10 billion each, and the change is not only wrong in amount but also in direction (increase vs actual decrease). The same applies to Comcast's overall segment balance. Calculations are entirely unsupported by the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely — the model did not correctly identify the values for Sky or Comcast across the two time periods, nor did it compute the correct changes. Instead, it fabricated figures that contradict the source data. (4) Scores are low because the answer is factually incorrect on all core metrics.

However, the organic sales increase is correctly described as 'high single-digit,' which aligns with the original answer. (2) The $6.5 billion figure is not only incorrect but is further contextualized as 8% of $82.0 billion in total net sales—this implies internal consistency within the LLM's response but contradicts the ground truth, where $12.7 billion would represent roughly 15.5% of $82.0 billion, not 8%. The 'high-single-digit' organic growth (with an estimated 8-9%) is consistent with the original answer and is reasonably accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning appears flawed: the model likely misattributed another segment’s data or miscalculated the segment’s share. It attempted to synthesize segment sales, total sales, and organic growth, but the core financial figure is wrong, undermining the synthesis.

The calculated percentage increase of approximately 3.1% is accurate. Pratt & Whitney's sales decline is reported as from $20.5 billion to $18.3 billion, matching the ground truth figures of $20,530 million and $18,296 million when rounded, and the stated ~11% decline is a reasonable approximation of the exact 10.9% drop.\n\n2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correctly rounded and presented in consistent formats (billion vs million). The percentage change calculations are accurate: (70,899 - 68,758) / 68,758 ≈ 3.1%, and (20,530 - 18,296) / 20,530 ≈ 10.9%. The LLM rounds this to 'about 11%', which is acceptable for semantic equivalence.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Pratt & Whitney's negative performance with the overall growth, attributing the net positive change to other segments (Collins Aerospace and Raytheon), which matches the ground truth logic. The entity names (RTX, Pratt & Whitney, Collins Aerospace, Raytheon), metric (Net Sales), and years (2022–2023) are all accurate.\n\n4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM says Pratt & Whitney's decline 'dragged down the overall growth', which slightly overemphasizes the negative impact without explicitly stating that the other segments' gains *offset* the decline—though this is implied. The original answer more precisely frames the decline as being *offset*, which better reflects that growth still occurred. This nuance slightly affects qualitative accuracy but does not invalidate the reasoning.\n\nOverall, the answer is factually correct, complete, and contextually appropriate, with only minor phrasing differences from the ground truth.",

(3) All entities are correct—Adobe, 2024 and 2023 fiscal years, derivative instruments, reclassification adjustments, and comprehensive income. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesized components from the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, aggregated across two years, and interpreted the net effect on comprehensive income. The source citation adds credibility. (5) Semantic equivalence is achieved—the LLM provides more granular breakdowns but conveys the same net impacts and directional changes as the ground truth. The $149 million swing is not explicitly stated but is derivable from the provided figures ($106M - (-$43M) = $149M), and the emphasis is on the correct net effects.

According to the ground truth, U.S. pension plan assets increased from $2,180 million in 2020 to $2,317 million in 2021, a change of $137 million. The LLM incorrectly reports the 2020 value as $2,310 million and 2021 as $2,448 million, resulting in a $138 million increase — both values and change are wrong. For non-U.S. pension plan assets, the ground truth shows an increase from $6,254 million to $6,947 million ($693 million increase), but the LLM reports $7,653 million to $7,968 million ($315 million increase), which is completely incorrect. (2) Calculations are internally consistent in the LLM answer (e.g., $2,448M - $2,310M = $138M; $7,968M - $7,653M = $315M), but since the source numbers are wrong, the results are factually incorrect. The comparison claim that non-U.S. gain was 'more than double' and '$177 million larger' than U.S. gain is also false — in reality, non-U.S. growth ($693M) was about five times the U.S. growth ($137M), not double. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to compare changes in U.S. and non-U.S. pension assets over two years — but it fails at entity and data retrieval accuracy. It appears to have pulled data from a different company or year, or misread the document. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right question type and structure, but the factual foundation is entirely flawed.

This is reflected in the interest cost dropping from $35 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021. Additionally, the actuarial gains of $20 million in 2021 further reduced the benefit obligation. As a result, the funded status of the domestic pension plans improved slightly from a deficit of $35 million in 2020 to a deficit of $34 million in 2021.",

However, there is a critical factual error: the LLM states there was a 'net actuarial loss of $20 million in 2021', while the ground truth reports 'actuarial gains of $20 million'. This is a direct contradiction and significantly undermines the reasoning. Actuarial gains reduce benefit obligations, while losses increase them; thus, this error misrepresents the financial impact. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: all percentages and dollar amounts (rates, interest cost, funded status figures) are accurate except for the mischaracterization of the $20 million as a loss instead of a gain. The calculation of the $1 million improvement in funded status is correct and properly contextualized. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly links rate changes to actuarial effects and funded status, but the flawed characterization of the $20 million as a loss leads to incorrect causal logic. The conclusion that higher rates helped limit deterioration is semantically close but implies the funded status would have worsened without them, whereas the truth is that the rates and gains actively improved it. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses all components of the question and attempts synthesis across rates, costs, actuarial items, and funded status.

Since Google believes both of these credits are not likely to be realized, they contribute to the company's decision to maintain a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets.

All numeric values match the ground truth, and the sum is correct. (2) The calculation is accurate: $5.0B + $0.7B = $5.7B. Number formats are acceptable variations (e.g., $0.7 billion = $700 million). (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly links the unrealized nature of these credits to the recording of a valuation allowance, which aligns with the ground truth. It also correctly notes that this reduces the net deferred tax asset balance, reflecting proper multi-hop synthesis between the existence of deferred tax assets and the accounting treatment via valuation allowance. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention the impact on Google's deferred tax asset valuation strategy in terms of 'continued reassessment' or 'potential future release' of the allowance if evidence improves, which is included in the original answer.

However, the income tax benefit change is reported as $37 million (from $49 million to $86 million), which is incorrect—the actual increase is $37 million in absolute terms but should be stated as a $37 million larger benefit, whereas the ground truth specifies a $28 million increase. This appears to be a calculation error: $86M - $49M = $37M, but the original answer states $28M, suggesting either a discrepancy in source data or a typo in the ground truth.

      "question": "How did the goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit in 2023 and the change in estimated useful life of tower assets in 2024 collectively impact American Tower Corporation's financial performance in 2024, particularly in terms of depreciation expense and loss from discontinued operations?",
      "original_answer": "The $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit in 2023 was recorded in the Loss from discontinued operations, negatively impacting the financial results of that year. However, in 2024, the change in the estimated useful life of tower assets from 20 to 30 years led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense ($649 million after tax), which positively affected the 2024 financial performance. Therefore, while the prior year's impairment charge continued to reflect poor performance in discontinued operations, the asset life extension significantly improved the current year's operating results by reducing depreciation costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The $322 million goodwill impairment that was recorded for the India reporting unit in 2023 was taken in loss from discontinued operations and helped drive the $978.3 million net loss from discontinued operations reported for 2024 (see Note 22, page 142). At the same time, the company lengthened the estimated useful life of its tower assets from 20 to 30 years, which cut depreciation‑and‑amortization expense by roughly $730 million for the year and reduced the depreciation component of discontinued operations to $96 million in 2024 (down from $158 million in 2023) (see Note 15, page 95; depreciation detail, page 142).",

The $322 million goodwill impairment for the India reporting unit in 2023 is correctly identified and properly attributed to loss from discontinued operations, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM incorrectly states that this 2023 impairment 'helped drive' a $978.3 million net loss from discontinued operations in 2024, which is not supported by the original answer and introduces new, unverified data (the $978.3M figure) not present in the ground truth. This misattributes ongoing impact of a prior-year charge without evidence of carryover effect. (2) The change in estimated useful life from 20 to 30 years is correctly described, and the $730 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense matches the ground truth. However, the LLM adds specific details not in the original answer—namely that depreciation in discontinued operations fell to $96 million in 2024 from $158 million in 2023—which are unsupported by the provided ground truth and may conflate segments or misallocate expense reductions. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model connects goodwill impairment and asset life changes to financial performance, but fails to correctly isolate the timing and reporting impacts. The original answer emphasizes that the 2023 impairment affected 2023 results, while the 2024 asset life change improved 2024 operating results—this temporal and financial statement distinction is blurred in the LLM response. (4) Quantitative accuracy is moderate: core numbers like $322M and $730M are correct, but additional figures ($978.3M, $96M, $158M) are introduced without grounding. Qualitative accuracy is low due to incorrect causal links and misattribution of expense reductions to discontinued operations without evidence. Contextual relevance is high as the response directly addresses the question’s focus on depreciation and discontinued operations. Overall, the answer is partially correct but undermined by unsupported numerical claims and flawed reasoning about financial statement impacts.",

This increase directly corresponds to the change in deferred tax liabilities related to ROU lease assets, which also rose from $96 million to $153 million over the same period. According to the evidence, ROU lease assets are explicitly tied to deferred tax liabilities, as shown in the deferred tax liabilities table, where ROU lease assets are listed as a direct component of total deferred tax liabilities.",

However, the deferred‑tax liability for those assets rose from **$96 million in 2023 to $153 million in 2024**【page_116】—a $57 million increase—indicating a larger tax obligation on the same ROU‑lease asset base.",

The ground truth states that ROU lease assets increased from $96 million in 2023 to $153 million in 2024, a $57 million increase. However, the LLM claims the ROU lease assets were $112 million in 2023 and remained unchanged in 2024 due to no impairment, which directly contradicts the ground truth. This error undermines the core of the answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the LLM reports $112 million (vs. correct $96 million) for 2023 and implies no change in 2024, while the correct value is $153 million. The only correct number is the deferred tax liability increase from $96M to $153M, which it correctly identifies as a $57M rise. However, it fails to note that the ROU asset change matches this exactly, as both go from $96M to $153M. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in linking deferred tax liabilities to ROU lease assets, and it correctly observes that the tax liability increased despite no impairment. But it fails the multi-hop synthesis: it does not recognize that ROU lease assets and deferred tax liabilities are directly aligned in value in both years, which is a key point in the original answer. Instead, it suggests a divergence (unchanged ROU assets vs. rising tax liabilities), which contradicts the evidence. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the right concepts (ROU assets, deferred tax liabilities, no impairments) and cites relevant pages, but misrepresents the data. The qualitative accuracy is slightly above low because the model attempts correct logic and references, but the factual foundation is flawed, leading to an incorrect conclusion.",

These numbers are accurate and properly attributed to the correct fiscal years. (2) The calculation comparing the two years is correct: $2,521M - $187M = $2,334M (~$2.3B), and the percentage decrease is approximately 93% ((2,521 - 187) / 2,521 ≈ 0.926), so stating 'about 93%' is reasonable. The use of 'after removing the A+E termination gain' correctly interprets the adjustment needed for fiscal 2023, aligning with the ground truth's note that the $2,521M was net of the gain. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different fiscal years, adjusts for the A+E gain as implied by the context, and makes a valid year-over-year comparison. (4) The only minor issue is wording: saying 'after removing the A+E termination gain, fiscal 2023 content impairments were $2,521 million' could be misinterpreted as implying that $2,521M is the amount before the gain, but in context, it correctly reflects that the impairments were reported net of the gain. This is a subtle distinction but does not materially misrepresent the facts. All entities (DIS, fiscal years, content impairments, A+E) are accurate.

The cumulative impact is correctly calculated as $326 million ($37M + $290M - $1M = $326M), which is accurate. (2) All numeric values are correct and properly formatted; the addition of comprehensive income figures for each year (e.g., $11,557M, $14,343M, $5,895M) is extra context not required by the question but does not contradict the ground truth. These figures may represent total comprehensive income but are not part of the core query, so their inclusion doesn't detract from accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the annual impacts and computes the net cumulative effect over the three-year period. It correctly interprets a 'loss' in 2024 as a negative contribution. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more detail. The only minor issue is the introduction of total comprehensive income amounts, which, while potentially sourced from the document (as indicated by citation), are not asked for and could confuse if incorrect—but they don’t undermine the correctness of the specific response to the question.

This impairment was driven by a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and the impact of a new restructuring program. The evaluation of net sales growth rates—both short-term and residual—was a key component in determining the fair value of the Gillette brand. Adverse changes in macroeconomic factors, grooming habits, currency exchange rates, and competitive pressures could negatively impact these growth rates, which in turn would reduce the estimated fair value of the intangible asset and potentially trigger future impairments.",

The impairment was driven by a fair‑value test that placed net‑sales growth assumptions—both the short‑term growth rates used in the cash‑flow forecasts and the longer‑term residual growth rates—among the most material inputs; any change to those sales‑growth assumptions would materially alter the estimated fair value and thus the size of the impairment.",

The mention of $1,341 million on the income statement is a precise figure that aligns with typical SEC filing disclosures and is consistent with the $1.3 billion rounding—this level of detail exceeds but does not contradict the ground truth. Fiscal year (FY2024) and entity (Procter & Gamble, Gillette brand) are correct. (2) The answer correctly identifies that net sales growth assumptions—both short-term and residual—were key inputs in the fair value estimation, which directly addresses the second part of the question. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects the impairment charge to the valuation methodology, emphasizing the sensitivity of fair value to sales growth assumptions, which is a core element in intangible asset impairment testing under accounting standards (e.g., ASC 350). (4) Minor omission: the LLM does not mention specific external factors cited in the original answer—such as higher discount rates, currency weakening, restructuring program, or risks from macroeconomic and competitive pressures—that contributed to the impairment. While the focus on growth assumptions is correct, the absence of these additional drivers slightly reduces completeness in the qualitative reasoning chain. However, since the question specifically asks about the role of net sales growth rate assumptions, the LLM stays tightly on point. Wording differences are semantically equivalent and acceptable.

(2) The percentage decline for Specialty Diagnostics is reported as 'roughly 8%' versus the ground truth 7.5%. This is a minor rounding difference—actual calculation: (4,763 - 4,405)/4,763 ≈ 7.51%, so 7.5% is more precise. Reporting ~8% is a reasonable approximation but slightly less accurate. The Life Sciences Solutions decline is given as 26%, while the exact figure is 26.3%—again, a minor rounding down, but acceptable for 'roughly' or 'about'. The comparison stating Life Sciences Solutions fell about 18 percentage points more is correct: 26.3% - 7.5% = 18.8%, so 18 percentage points is a sensible approximation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly retrieves revenue data for two segments across two years, computes or retrieves percentage changes, and compares them to assess relative performance. (4) All entities (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Specialty Diagnostics, Life Sciences Solutions, 2022–2023) are correct. The answer addresses both parts of the question: percentage change for each segment and their comparative performance. Semantic equivalence is maintained despite slight rounding. Thus, only a minor deduction in quantitative accuracy and overall correctness due to approximate percentages; all other aspects are fully accurate and well-reasoned.",

This growing loss contributed to downward pressure on the company's overall financial performance, although it was overshadowed by larger improvements in operating expenses and revenues, which helped drive an improvement in operating income from a $179 million loss in 2023 to a $328 million profit in 2024.",

The operating income improvement is accurately described, moving from a $179 million loss to a $328 million profit, which represents a $507 million swing. These numbers are all factually correct and consistent with the original answer. (2) All numeric values—$5M, $10M, $179M loss, $328M profit—are accurate. The implied calculation of the $5M increase in equity loss and the $507M improvement in operating income (328 - (-179) = 507) is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two years and two financial metrics (equity in loss of investees and operating income), and acknowledges the counterintuitive point that despite worsening equity losses, overall operating performance improved significantly. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention that the growing equity loss exerted 'downward pressure' on financial performance, nor that this was 'overshadowed' by revenue and expense improvements—contextual nuance present in the original. However, the core facts, calculations, and implications are preserved with high fidelity. Thus, while slightly less detailed in qualitative explanation, it remains semantically aligned.

The total net amount of deferred income tax credits across all listed subsidiaries—Alabama Power ($1,398 million), Georgia Power ($2,149 million), Mississippi Power ($219 million), and Southern Company Gas ($755 million)—sums to $4,536 million, matching the consolidated liability.",

It also correctly lists the individual subsidiary amounts: $1,398M (Alabama Power), $2,149M (Georgia Power), $219M (Mississippi Power), and $755M (Southern Company Gas), all of which match the original answer. However, the total net amount is incorrectly calculated as $9,057 million, which is roughly double the correct consolidated figure of $4,536 million. This suggests the model erroneously summed the parent company (Southern Co.) along with its subsidiaries, despite the fact that the $4,536M liability is already the consolidated total (i.e., inclusive of subsidiaries). (2) The quantitative error is severe: the sum of the subsidiaries alone is $1,398 + $2,149 + $219 + $755 = $4,521 million (off by $15M from $4,536M, possibly due to rounding or unlisted entities), but the LLM adds the $4,536M consolidated figure again, leading to a nonsensical total of ~$9.1 billion. This invalidates the key numerical conclusion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: while the model retrieves correct component data, it does not recognize that Southern Company's consolidated liability should equal the sum of its subsidiaries, not be added to them. This reflects a misunderstanding of financial consolidation principles. (4) Despite strong contextual and conceptual accuracy, the massive quantitative error in the final total severely undermines the answer’s correctness, warranting a low score of 3.

According to the ground truth, the 'Consolidated Companies - Total' undiscounted future net cash flows were $27,300 million in 2020 and $48,067 million in 2021, leading to a 76.0% increase. However, the LLM incorrectly reports these values as $83.8 billion and $187.4 billion, resulting in a fabricated 124% increase. These numbers do not match the ground truth and suggest confusion with different data or misreading of the source. In contrast, the 'Affiliated Companies - TCO' figures are approximately correct: $18.7 billion (vs. $18,652 million) in 2020 and $36.3 billion (vs. $36,314 million) in 2021, yielding a correct ~95% increase (ground truth: 94.7%). (2) The calculation for TCO is acceptable within rounding, but the Consolidated Companies figures are wildly inaccurate—$27.3B vs. $83.8B is a tripling of the actual value. The claimed 124% increase is therefore invalid. The comparison conclusion that 'Consolidated Companies grew faster' contradicts the ground truth, which shows TCO (94.7%) grew faster than Consolidated Total (76.0%). (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model uses incorrect base values for one leg of the comparison, undermining the synthesis. While it attempts to compare both categories over 2020–2021, the erroneous data leads to a flawed conclusion.

The LLM reports $11.5B and $9.9B, implying a $1.6B increase, which is completely unsupported by the ground truth. Even if the PPD acquisition were fully annualized, the actual segment revenue does not approach billions. (3) The qualitative reasoning fails multi-hop synthesis: while the LLM correctly references the PPD acquisition as a driver, it misattributes massive revenue to the segment without grounding in the actual data. It also fails to note that PPD was acquired late in the year (December 8, 2021), so its contribution would be minimal in 2021.

This foreign tax impact of $423 million represented approximately 7.97% of the total provision for income taxes of $5,304 million for fiscal 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2021 Home Depot reported $511 million of current foreign income taxes and a $88 million deferred foreign tax benefit, giving a net foreign tax impact of **$423 million** (current $511 m + deferred –$88 m).

The percentage of foreign tax impact relative to total provision is reported as 'about 8%', which is a reasonable rounding of the ground truth 7.97%. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth exactly or are appropriately rounded: $511M - $88M = $423M is correct; $423M / $5,304M ≈ 7.97%, rounded to 8% is acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly synthesizes current and deferred components to compute net foreign tax impact and compares it to the total tax provision, fulfilling the comparative aspect of the question. (4) Entities are accurate: Home Depot (HD), fiscal 2021, correct financial metrics (current/deferred foreign taxes, total provision). The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor wording differences and acceptable rounding. All evaluation dimensions are fully satisfied.",

      "original_answer": "Regulatory pressure on interchange fees in the EU and Australia has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact American Express's discount revenue by exerting downward pressure on merchant discount rates. This occurs because competitor pricing adjustments in response to interchange fee caps influence American Express's own pricing strategy. Since discount revenue is recognized at the time the Card Member transaction occurs and is retained as part of the merchant payable for facilitating transactions, any reduction in discount rates directly reduces the revenue earned per transaction. Additionally, American Express has exited its network businesses in the EU and Australia due to regulatory constraints, which further limits its ability to generate discount revenue in those regions.",
      "llm_answer": "The EU and Australian caps on interchange fees force AmEx to lower the merchant‑discount rates it can charge, which “negatively impacted…the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from…caps on interchange fees”【page_21】. Because discount revenue is “the amount we earn and retain from the merchant payable…recorded at the time the Card Member transaction occurs”【page_103】, those caps directly shrink the fee recognized on each transaction and, combined with AmEx’s exit from network businesses in those regions, compresses overall discount‑revenue earnings.",

(1) It correctly identifies that interchange fee caps in the EU and Australia have led to downward pressure on American Express's merchant discount rates, directly impacting discount revenue. It accurately explains that discount revenue is recognized at the time of transaction and retained from the merchant payable, so lower rates reduce revenue per transaction. It also correctly notes American Express’s exit from network businesses in those regions as a compounding factor. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or percentages in either the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects regulatory caps → competitor pricing adjustments → AmEx discount rate pressure → impact on revenue recognition → business exit, which aligns with the knowledge graph. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly mention 'competitor pricing adjustments' as a mechanism for influencing AmEx's pricing, though this is implied in the reference to downward pressure. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing how regulatory pressure affects AmEx’s revenue model based on recognition and retention mechanics.

(1) All key numbers are correct: ESPN+ average monthly revenue per subscriber increased from $5.49 to $6.14 (12% increase, correctly implied), total domestic revenue decreased from $9.27 billion (i.e., $9,267 million) in 2023 to $9.13 billion (i.e., $9,131 million) in 2024, representing a ~1% decline—this matches the original answer exactly in substance. The $136 million drop is consistent with the $136 million difference between $9,267M and $9,131M. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $6.14 is correctly stated, and the 12% increase is accurate ((6.14 - 5.49)/5.49 ≈ 11.8%, rounds to 12%). The $1.65 billion subscription revenue and $133 million increase are consistent with the context, though not in the original answer; however, they are plausible supporting details and do not contradict the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that despite a positive trend in ESPN+ ARPU, overall domestic revenue declined, which requires synthesizing subscriber-level pricing with total revenue performance. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer attributes the ARPU increase to 'higher retail pricing and advertising revenue,' which the LLM omits, slightly reducing qualitative completeness.

However, it introduces incorrect quantitative details by stating that merger-related divestitures in 2020 included $98 million from Linde China and 'roughly $130 million' from a non-core Scandinavian business, totaling about $228 million—this contradicts the ground truth that merger-related divestitures were $98 million in total in 2020. This misrepresents the composition and magnitude of the divestitures. (2) The key numbers—total divestiture proceeds and net cash used for investing—are accurate and correctly compared across years. But the unsupported breakdown of the $98 million into two specific deals with inflated totals undermines quantitative accuracy. There is no indication in the ground truth that the $98 million consisted of those two transactions or that one was ~$130 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model correctly infers that the absence of merger-related divestitures in 2021 contributed to lower proceeds and thus increased net cash used in investing. It connects reduced inflows to a change in net investing cash flow, which aligns with the logic in the original answer. However, the erroneous addition of a $130 million transaction introduces factual inaccuracies into the causal explanation.

The adjusted free cash flow productivity ratio is correctly reported as 105% in 2024, which aligns with the original answer.

The mention of an increase from 95% in 2023 adds context not in the ground truth but does not contradict it and may reflect additional data from the source documents (e.g., page_27†L1-L4). This extra detail does not reduce accuracy but slightly extends beyond the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesized information across multiple pages and entities (Gillette charge, foreign currency charge, adjusted free cash flow productivity) and linked the exclusion of these charges to the adjusted metric. The logic that excluding non-cash charges leads to a higher, more normalized productivity ratio is implied correctly.

This is a significant discrepancy that fundamentally alters the conclusion. The capital expenditure figure of $1,327 million is correct and matches the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: while the capital expenditure number is accurate, the operating profit is off by over $1.8 billion. The comparison that 'operating profit exceeded capital spending by $517 million' is therefore completely incorrect—the truth is that capital expenditures ($1,327M) vastly exceeded operating profit ($35M) by approximately $1,292 million. (3) The reasoning is flawed due to incorrect data synthesis.

Therefore, the ground truth contains a calculation error. The LLM correctly computes the difference as $23 million. Thus, the LLM is actually numerically correct, while the ground truth has an arithmetic error. Therefore, the LLM should not be penalized. In fact, the LLM is more accurate. However, the total over two years is $248 + $271 = $519 million, which the LLM does not mention — the question asks for 'total principal repayments over the two years', so this component is missing. Thus, the LLM fails to provide the total, which is a required part of the answer. Therefore: (1) individual yearly amounts correct — $248M and $271M — check. (2) YoY change: LLM says $23M increase — correct calculation. Ground truth says $27M — incorrect. But since we are evaluating against ground truth as reference, and the ground truth claims $27M, we must score based on alignment with ground truth, even if ground truth is wrong? No — the instruction says: 'The ground truth answers were generated from a knowledge graph of actual filing data.' So we assume ground truth is correct. But arithmetic must hold. 271 - 248 = 23. So either the numbers are wrong or the difference is wrong. Given that both the LLM and arithmetic confirm $23M difference, but ground truth says $27M, there is a conflict. However, per instructions, we must evaluate against the provided ground truth. Therefore, even if ground truth has an error, we score relative to it. So: ground truth says increase was $27M. LLM says $23M. This is a discrepancy. So LLM is incorrect on the YoY change amount. But numbers are $248M and $271M — difference must be $23M. Unless the actual filing reports different numbers. But LLM cites page_37 and page_29, and reports $248M and $271M. If those are correct, difference is $23M. But ground truth says $27M. Therefore, either the ground truth is wrong or the LLM misread the numbers. But LLM reports $248M and $271M — same as ground truth. So how can difference be $27M? It cannot. Therefore, the ground truth contains a factual error in arithmetic. But per evaluation guidelines, we are to assess against the provided ground truth. However, the instruction says: 'Be STRICT on numbers, dates, calculations (these must be factually correct)'. So factual correctness includes arithmetic. Therefore, the LLM's $23M is factually correct, while ground truth's $27M is not. But this creates a dilemma. Resolution: since the LLM reports the same component numbers as ground truth and computes the correct difference, it should be considered accurate. However, the total over two years — $519M — is not mentioned in LLM answer, which is a missing element. The question asks: 'What was Amazon's total principal repayments... over the two years' — so total is required. LLM does not state it. Therefore, incompleteness. Final assessment: (1) yearly amounts correct — quantitative accuracy high. (2) YoY change: LLM says $23M — correct calculation. Ground truth says $27M — likely error. But since we must align with ground truth, and it states $27M, the LLM's $23M is discrepant. But logically, it's correct. Given ambiguity, we prioritize actual arithmetic. But evaluation must follow ground truth. To resolve: assume ground truth is authoritative. Therefore, LLM's $23M vs ground truth $27M is a mismatch. So quantitative inaccuracy. But numbers are right. Only the difference is wrong? No — if numbers are $248 and $271, difference must be $23. So either the numbers are wrong or the difference is. Since both LLM and ground truth agree on $248 and $271, the difference must be $23. Therefore, ground truth has an error. But we are instructed to evaluate against ground truth. This is a known issue in evaluation design. Best practice: if component numbers match and calculation is correct, accept LLM. But here, the ground truth explicitly states '$27 million increase', which is false given the numbers. So the ground truth is self-inconsistent. In such cases, prioritize the component numbers. The LLM correctly reports the two yearly figures and computes the correct difference. It fails only to report the total ($519M). Therefore, the main deficiency is completeness — missing the total. The YoY change is correctly calculated. So: quantitative accuracy should be high. But to align with scoring: correctness_score: 8 — because all factual elements are correct except the total is missing. The $23M is right; ground truth's $27M is wrong. But since the LLM does not state the total, it misses a key part. Thus: correctness_score 8, quantitative_accuracy 7 (because difference reported as $23M but ground truth says $27M — discrepancy), but actually LLM is right. Given the conflict, and to follow instructions strictly, we must mark the LLM as incorrect on the YoY change amount relative to ground truth. Therefore, quantitative_accuracy reduced. Final: correctness_score 8 — because yearly numbers correct, reasoning sound, only total missing and YoY number mismatches ground truth (even if ground truth is wrong). Feedback: (1) Correctly identified 2022 ($248M) and 2023 ($271M) repayments. (2) Correctly calculated YoY increase as $23M, but ground truth claims $27M — discrepancy. (3) Failed to state total repayments over two years ($519M), which is required. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound — pulled correct numbers from cited pages. (5) Contextual relevance is perfect — directly addresses the question with proper sourcing. Thus, minor quantitative discrepancy (possibly due to ground truth error) and missing total reduce correctness score to 8.",

At the same time, Thermo Fisher's consolidated revenues decreased from $44,915 million in 2022 to $42,857 million in 2023, a decline of $2,058 million.

Consolidated revenues fell from $44,915 million to $42,857 million, a $2,058 million drop. These values match the ground truth exactly. The percentage declines (8% for Specialty Diagnostics and 5% for consolidated) are accurate calculations and semantically equivalent to the ground truth's focus on dollar declines and proportional contribution. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts, years, and derived percentages are correct. The 8% decline is (358 / 4,763) ≈ 7.52%, which rounds to 8% — acceptable rounding. The 5% decline is (2,058 / 44,915) ≈ 4.58%, also reasonably rounded to 5%. While the ground truth emphasizes the $358M decline representing 17.4% of the total $2,058M decline, the LLM instead compares percentage changes, which is a valid and informative alternative framing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two segments (Specialty Diagnostics and consolidated) across two years, compares trends, and draws a logical conclusion. The conclusion that the segment’s decline was 'steeper' than the overall trend is correct and supported. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the explicit 17.4% contribution to total decline, which is part of the ground truth. However, the LLM provides a functionally equivalent and insightful comparison via percentage declines, maintaining high qualitative and overall correctness. Hence, a score of 9 is justified — highly accurate with a minor omission in detail depth.",

'Other income (expense), net' increased from $1,424 million in 2023 to $7,425 million in 2024, a total increase of $6,001 million (correctly rounded to $6.0 billion). These numbers match the ground truth exactly. (2) All calculations are accurate: the $829 million improvement is correct ($1,238M - $409M), and the total increase in 'Other income' is correctly represented. However, the LLM states that the FX improvement 'accounted for roughly $0.8 billion of the total gain' but does not convert this into a percentage contribution (13.8%) as required by the original answer. While $0.8 billion is equivalent to $800 million (close to $829M), the omission of the explicit percentage (13.8%) representing its proportion of the $6,001M total increase is a minor but notable gap in completeness. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the FX loss improvement to the overall change in 'Other income (expense), net' and uses data from the correct years and company (GOOGL). It synthesizes information across multiple data points accurately.

However, there are significant errors in the annual net repurchase calculations. The LLM states net repurchases were 483 million in 2022 (568M repurchased - 85M issued = 483M), which is correct in calculation but misrepresents the unit (should be ~483,361 shares, not rounded to 483M). More critically, for 2023: 471M - 78M = 393M net (LLM says 393 million), but actual is 471,419 - 78,055 = 393,364, which is acceptable if rounded. For 2024: 499,372 - 66,097 = 433,275, but the LLM reports 433 million, which is a rounding overreach (should be ~433,000 or 0.433 million). The cumulative net reduction is stated as ~1.31 billion, which is correct, but the annual breakdowns use inconsistent and exaggerated rounding. (2) The original answer provides exact figures: total repurchases 1,539,380 and net issuances 229,380, leading to net decrease of 1,310,000. The LLM does not report total repurchases or net issuances explicitly, instead computing net per year with rough rounding. This omits key detail required by the question about how repurchases and issuances contribute. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure—LLM correctly infers net change per year from repurchases minus issuances and sums them—but the execution suffers from poor numerical precision. It fails to report the exact cumulative repurchase and issuance totals that explain the trend, weakening completeness. (4) Despite rounding issues and missing granular data, the LLM captures the overall trend and magnitude correctly, hence a 7 for correctness. Quantitative accuracy is penalized due to aggressive rounding and unit inconsistencies (e.g., '1,310,000 thousand' is 1.31 billion, but writing it as '1,310,000 thousand' is incorrect—should be just 1.31 billion or 1,310,000).

The individual subsidiary figures (e.g., $(1,506)M for Alabama Power, $(2,161)M for Georgia Power, etc.) are not present in the original answer and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM performs an incorrect summation of non-existent subsidiary line items, leading to a total that is double the correct value. Even if the format of negative values in parentheses were acceptable (which it is), the numbers themselves do not align with the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is flawed—instead of recognizing that the $4,686 million figure is the consolidated total across all subsidiaries, the model invents a breakdown and miscalculates the sum. It fails the multi-hop requirement by not correctly identifying that the total was already provided and should not be recomputed from unsupported subsidiary data.

According to the ground truth, the $2,724 million gain was subtracted (not added) from GAAP operating income, resulting in a much lower operating income of $348 million after special items. The LLM incorrectly states that the gain 'boosted' operating income and increased it to $4.717 billion, which is the opposite of the correct treatment. Similarly, for net income, the gain led to a net loss of $(217) million from continuing operations after adjustments, but the LLM claims it increased adjusted net income to $4.035 billion, which is factually incorrect. (2) The numbers themselves are partially accurate in isolation — $2.724 billion gain, $4.369 billion GAAP operating income, $4.013 billion GAAP net income — but their use in calculations is wrong. The correct calculation is $4,369M - $2,724M (and other special items) = $348M operating income, not an increase to $4.717B. The LLM’s derived figures ($4.717B, $4.035B) are unsupported by the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model misunderstands the treatment of special items — gains on divestitures are subtracted (as special items) to arrive at adjusted income, not added as benefits. It also fails to recognize that the net effect was a large reduction in income, not a boost. The synthesis across operating income and net income is incorrect. (4) While the answer addresses the right entities (MMM, 2022, gain on divestiture, special items), the core financial impact is misrepresented in direction and magnitude, warranting a low correctness score.

      "original_answer": "The revenue for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Specialty Diagnostics segment decreased by 7.5% from $4,763 million in 2022 to $4,405 million in 2023. In contrast, the Life Sciences Solutions segment experienced a 26.6% decrease in revenue, from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023. This indicates that the decline in the Life Sciences Solutions segment was significantly more severe than in the Specialty Diagnostics segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Thermo Fisher’s Specialty Diagnostics revenue fell from $4,763 million in 2022 to $4,405 million in 2023 – a decline of roughly **8 %**【page_21】. By contrast, Life Sciences Solutions revenue dropped from $13,532 million to $9,977 million, a **26 %** decrease【page_21】. Thus, the Life Sciences Solutions segment saw a far larger revenue contraction—about 18 percentage points more—than Specialty Diagnostics.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the revenue figures for both segments and years: $4,763 million and $4,405 million for Specialty Diagnostics in 2022 and 2023, and $13,532 million and $9,977 million for Life Sciences Solutions. These match the ground truth exactly. However, the percentage changes are slightly rounded: the LLM reports a 'roughly 8%' decline for Specialty Diagnostics and '26%' for Life Sciences Solutions, while the ground truth specifies 7.5% and 26.6%, respectively. The rounding is reasonable but introduces minor inaccuracies. (2) Calculations: The exact percentage change for Specialty Diagnostics is (4,405 - 4,763)/4,763 ≈ -7.52%, which should be reported as ~7.5%, not 8%. Similarly, (9,977 - 13,532)/13,532 ≈ -26.27%, which rounds to 26.3% or 26.6% depending on source precision; the LLM's 26% is a slight underestimate. The comparison of an '18 percentage point' difference is approximately correct (26.6 - 7.5 = 19.1), so 18 is close but not exact. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes revenue data across two segments and two years, computes trends, and draws a valid comparative conclusion. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness 8 due to minor but notable rounding errors in key percentages; Quantitative Accuracy 8 because numbers are directionally correct but not precise; Qualitative Accuracy 9 due to strong reasoning and correct entity identification; Contextual Relevance 10 as all parts of the question are fully addressed with appropriate context.",

      "original_answer": "A one-notch ratings downgrade would trigger derivative-related cash obligations and collateral requirements for both Citigroup Inc. and Citibank, increasing their liquidity and funding needs. According to the filings, Citigroup Inc. faces an estimated $0.1 billion increase in obligations due to derivative triggers, and Citibank also faces an additional $0.1 billion in similar obligations. Combined, the total estimated increase in cash obligations and collateral requirements is $0.2 billion. These impacts stem from clauses that allow counterparties to demand additional collateral or accelerate payments in response to a downgrade, which could strain Citi’s liquidity resources.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the $1 million positive impact in FY2024 and the $29 million negative impact in FY2023, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly calculates the net effect of the two-year change as a 'net $28 million reduction', whereas the correct net effect is a $30 million improvement (calculated as $1 million minus a -$29 million loss, i.e., $1 - (-$29) = $30). The LLM appears to have computed $29 - $1 = $28 and misinterpreted the direction as a reduction, which is factually wrong. (2) Number verification: $1M (correct), $29M (correct), but $28M net reduction is incorrect—should be $30M improvement. The calculation error is significant and directly affects the conclusion. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly retrieves the two required data points from different fiscal years (multi-hop across time), but fails in the final synthesis step—calculating the net change in impact. The logic should reflect that moving from a $29M loss to a $1M gain is a $30M improvement, not a reduction. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to mostly correct inputs but a major error in the final calculation and conclusion. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because half the numbers are right but the derived figure is wrong and misdirected. Qualitative accuracy is 7 because entity and year identification are correct, and the reasoning structure is sound except for the flawed arithmetic.

The question only asks for the impact of the charge and the resulting value, both of which are provided. (3) The reasoning is sound and correctly links the charge to the decline in the net adjustment. The multi-hop aspect—understanding that a settlement charge reduces the net FAS/CAS adjustment—is properly synthesized. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in addressing the two parts of the question: the size of the charge and the resulting net adjustment.

      "original_answer": "Pension enhancements at CL are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs, which directly affects the balance sheet by either reducing pension assets or increasing pension liabilities. This accounting treatment signals that CL is recognizing additional financial obligations tied to employee benefits, which influences its broader financial strategy by increasing liabilities and potentially affecting liquidity and solvency ratios. These enhancements indicate a strategic decision to modify pension benefits, which may be linked to workforce restructuring or long-standing benefit practices, as noted in both disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 filing notes that pension enhancements are treated as “charges against assets” within employee‑related costs, so they appear on the balance sheet as a reduction of pension‑plan assets (or, equivalently, an increase in pension liabilities). By folding these enhancements into the $175 million of employee‑related costs under the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, Colgate‑Palmolive is using them as a component of its restructuring strategy—adjusting benefits while re‑allocating resources and controlling overall employee‑related obligations as part of its broader cost‑reduction and strategic‑resource‑allocation plan.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that pension enhancements are treated as 'charges against assets' within employee-related costs and that this affects the balance sheet by reducing pension assets or increasing liabilities, which aligns with the ground truth. It also correctly links this to broader financial strategy involving restructuring and resource allocation. However, the LLM introduces a specific dollar amount—$175 million—under the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. This raises concerns about hallucination or unsupported specificity. (2) The quantitative inaccuracy stems from the inclusion of the $175 million figure, which is not mentioned in the original answer. There is no way to confirm if this number is correct based on the knowledge graph provided; thus, it represents a significant deviation. No other numbers are present in either response for comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model connects pension accounting treatment to balance sheet impact and then to strategic implications like restructuring and cost management. This synthesis reflects understanding of both financial reporting and strategic intent. However, the linkage to the $175 million and the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative goes beyond the information in the ground truth, suggesting either overreach or use of external data not confirmed in the source. (4) Despite the unsupported figure, the core reasoning and structure are strong, and the answer addresses both parts of the question—balance sheet impact and strategic implications—with accurate terminology and logical flow. Hence, a score of 7 is justified for overall correctness, with lower quantitative accuracy due to the unverified number, while qualitative and contextual scores remain high due to sound reasoning and relevance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical calculation error in the total sum of Increases Related to Current Year Tax Positions. The correct sum is $66M + $1,582M + $75M = $1,723 million ($1.723 billion), which matches the LLM's stated total. However, the ground truth states $1,643 million, which is incorrect based on the provided numbers. Upon verification, $66 + $1,582 + $75 = $1,723 million, not $1,643 million. Therefore, the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct, but the ground truth appears to have an arithmetic error. Despite this, the LLM incorrectly states the comparison as 'about 53%' of $3.245 billion, when $1.723B / $3.245B ≈ 53.1%, which is accurate. (2) The individual yearly amounts ($66M, $1,582M, $75M) and the Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits ($3.245B) are all factually correct and match the source data. The total sum is correctly calculated by the LLM as $1.723B, contradicting the ground truth’s erroneous $1,643M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies the relevant metric across three fiscal years, sums them, and compares the result to the 2022 year-end Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits. The synthesis across years and metrics is appropriate and logical. (4) The contextual relevance is high, as all parts of the question are addressed. The qualitative reasoning is strong, but the quantitative accuracy score is reduced because the evaluation must assume the ground truth is correct; however, in this rare case, the ground truth seems to contain a factual arithmetic error, and the LLM answer is numerically accurate. This creates a conflict where the LLM is factually correct but diverges from the provided 'ground truth'. Given the instructions to follow the ground truth strictly, the correctness score is penalized despite the LLM likely being right.",

      "original_answer": "The total amortization of net prior service (credits) costs in 2021 was $312 million ($349 million for Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans and $37 million for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans). In 2019, the total was $291 million ($333 million for Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans and $42 million for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans). Therefore, the 2021 total was $21 million higher than the 2019 total.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 the amortization of net prior‑service costs was $‑349 million for the qualified defined‑benefit pension plans and $ 37 million for the retiree medical‑and‑life‑insurance plans, giving a combined net amortization of **$‑312 million** (i.e., $312 million of net cost)【page_101】. In 2019 the same two items were $‑333 million and $ 42 million, respectively, for a combined net amortization of **$‑291 million**【page_101】. Thus the 2021 total was about **$21 million larger (more net cost)** than the 2019 total.",

The comparison showing a $21 million increase from 2019 to 2021 is accurate. The negative signs (-$349M, -$333M) reflect the direction of cost (prior service credits being amortized as cost), and the net totals of -$312M and -$291M are mathematically and conceptually correct, equivalent to $312M and $291M of net cost. (2) All calculations are correct: -349 + 37 = -312; -333 + 42 = -291; difference is 21. The original answer presents absolute values, while the LLM preserves directional accounting treatment, which is more precise. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two benefit types and two years, then computes the total and year-over-year difference. (4) The only minor issue is stylistic: presenting the total as -$312 million might confuse non-experts, but it is financially accurate (amortization of prior service credits increases cost, hence negative). The original answer uses positive values labeled as 'costs', which is also acceptable. Semantic equivalence is maintained. Thus, the answer is factually and quantitatively correct, with excellent reasoning and full relevance.",

The after-tax detail ($1.3 billion) is an additional precision not contradicted by the original answer and likely comes from the cited page 89, so it does not detract from accuracy. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: the $1.7 billion charge and resulting $668 million adjustment are accurately reported. No calculations are required beyond recognition of the causal relationship (the charge reduced the adjustment), which is correctly stated. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that the large settlement charge reduced the net FAS/CAS adjustment, resulting in a positive $668 million value—this aligns with the expected multi-hop inference (understanding that a negative charge can reduce a positive adjustment). (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more detail (after-tax amount) and proper sourcing. The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the original answer emphasizes the net adjustment being 'reported at $668 million' as a result, while the LLM implies the same but could slightly overemphasize the reduction without clarifying the sign or direction of the adjustment.

The LLM reports this as 'roughly $3.6 billion', which is a reasonable rounding (within acceptable precision). The impact on 'Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations' is accurately stated: from $(19,758) million in 2022 to $32,158 million in 2023. The LLM describes the improvement as 'about $52 billion', which rounds the exact swing of $51,916 million — again, acceptable for high-level communication. (2) All key numbers are factually correct and match the ground truth: $7.941 billion = $7,941 million, $4.384 billion = $4,384 million, and the free cash flow figures are precisely aligned. The calculation of the swing ($32,158 - (-19,758) = $51,916 million) is correct in ground truth; the LLM's 'about $52 billion' is a justified approximation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the reduction in lease repayments to the improvement in the adjusted free cash flow metric, showing understanding of cause and effect across financial statements and years. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with only formatting and rounding differences. No critical information is missing, and all entities (Amazon, correct metric, correct years) are accurately used. The slight rounding of $3.557B to $3.6B and $51.916B to $52B prevents a perfect 10 but does not undermine correctness. Hence, correctness_score is 9.",

It states that the fair value of non-U.S. pension plan assets increased from $7,653 million in 2020 to $7,968 million in 2021, resulting in a $315 million increase. However, the ground truth states the total change is $693 million, which indicates a significant discrepancy. The LLM’s calculation ($7,968M - $7,653M = $315M) is mathematically correct based on the numbers it provides, but those numbers do not align with the actual data in the knowledge graph. (2) The quantitative values cited by the LLM ($7,653M and $7,968M) are inconsistent with the source data that produced the $693M change, suggesting either incorrect sourcing or mislabeling of years or entities. The correct change of $693 million implies the actual values should differ by that amount, e.g., from $7,653M to $8,346M or similar. (3) The reasoning is internally logical—calculating year-over-year difference—but fails on multi-hop synthesis because it uses incorrect base figures. The model appears to reference specific pages (87, 88), but the numbers do not support the known correct answer, indicating a failure in retrieving or aligning the correct data points across documents or years.

Even if the reasoning structure were sound, the inputs are so erroneous that the conclusion is invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing segment-level depreciation to total corporate depreciation—is conceptually correct, and the LLM attempts the necessary synthesis.

However, the cumulative net impact to earnings was reported as $503M ($149M + $175M + $179M), which is incorrect—the correct sum is $499M (149+175+179=499), not $503M. This is a clear arithmetic error. (2) Number verification: individual yearly net impact figures are correct, but the total is miscalculated. $149 + $175 + $179 = $499, not $503. The $637M total compensation expense is correctly calculated. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly synthesized data across years and distinguished between pre-tax expense and after-tax net impact to earnings, showing understanding of tax effects on compensation expense. (4) Scores justified: correctness is 8 due to the core data being accurate but final sum wrong; quantitative accuracy is 8 due to one calculation error despite correct inputs; qualitative accuracy is 9—reasoning and entity identification (LMT, years, metrics) are correct; contextual relevance is 10—answer fully addresses both parts of the question and stays focused on the required metrics and period.",

      "original_answer": "A deterioration in the financial condition of Coca-Cola's equity method bottling partners could directly reduce Coca-Cola's net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups, as well as decrease equity income or lead to impairments of equity method investments. Simultaneously, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations—particularly a strengthening U.S. dollar against major currencies—could materially affect Coca-Cola's financial results, especially since $25.6 billion of net operating revenues in 2021 came from operations outside the U.S. The combination of these two risks could lead to a dual impact: reduced revenue from key distribution partners and a decline in the dollar value of international revenues when translated into U.S. dollars, both of which would negatively affect overall financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "A decline in the financial health of Coca‑Cola’s equity‑method bottlers would curb the volume and pricing of concentrate sales and could force the Company to record lower equity income or impair its bottler investments, directly reducing net operating revenues (page 21). If, at the same time, foreign‑currency movements – especially a stronger U.S. dollar – translate foreign sales into fewer dollars, operating income and the value of foreign‑denominated assets would also fall (page 23), and credit‑rating downgrades of those bottlers could raise borrowing costs and further erode earnings (page 24). Together, weaker bottler performance and adverse currency swings would create a double‑hit on Coca‑Cola’s top‑line and overall profitability.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: the impact of deteriorating financial health of equity-method bottling partners on concentrate sales, equity income, and potential impairments is accurately described, as is the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations—particularly a stronger U.S. dollar—on translating international revenues. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: while the LLM does not explicitly mention the $25.6 billion figure from 2021, this omission does not detract from correctness, as the core financial mechanisms are correctly represented without introducing any incorrect numbers. The absence of this specific number slightly reduces completeness but does not affect factual accuracy. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes two distinct risks—bottler financial health and FX volatility—and explains their joint negative impact on net operating revenues and profitability. It even adds a relevant nuance (credit-rating downgrades increasing borrowing costs) supported by the cited page 24, which enhances depth without deviating from the truth. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent: the response directly addresses both parts of the question and their combined effect. The only reason for not scoring a 10 in correctness is the omission of the specific $25.6 billion revenue figure from international operations, which was present in the ground truth and would have strengthened quantitative completeness.

      "original_answer": "Georgia Power contributes $10,118 million in operating revenues to Southern Company, forming a significant portion of its financial base. However, Georgia Power is also subject to a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million under the NEIL policies, which could increase Southern Company's financial risk exposure if triggered. This assessment could impact Southern Company's operational stability by diverting funds that might otherwise be used for growth or debt reduction. Additionally, in the event of a nuclear incident, Georgia Power's uninsured losses could further strain Southern Company's finances, as insurance proceeds may not cover all incurred expenses.",

However, it introduces a new figure—$473 million per incident, capped at $71 million per year—which is not present in the original answer and contradicts the stated $89 million maximum annual assessment. This discrepancy undermines quantitative accuracy. (2) The revenue numbers are accurate and well-contextualized, with correct percentage attribution (~40% of Southern Company’s total), and the $25.3 billion total revenue is consistent with the implied sum. However, the additional insurance assessment details not found in the ground truth suggest either misinterpretation or use of external data, which affects factual fidelity. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes Georgia Power’s revenue contribution and insurance liabilities to assess Southern Company’s financial risk and operational stability. It appropriately balances risk against revenue stability, adding analytical value beyond the original answer. (4) Despite introducing unsupported insurance figures, the core financial facts (revenue, NEIL assessment) are correct, and the reasoning about risk exposure and stability is logically coherent and relevant.

These additions are unsupported and likely incorrect, as the original answer only states general directional effects without specific percentages or segment names. (2) The dollar amounts ($20 million and $13 million) are correctly stated, but the LLM invents precise margin impacts (2-point gain, 3-point decline) and claims the credits 'softened a 3-point margin decline' and 'added roughly a 2-point margin gain'—these calculations are not in the original and lack verification. There is no indication in the ground truth that the $13 million credit partially offset a decline; rather, it states the credit was outweighed by negative factors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the original answer emphasizes that the $13 million credit was insufficient to prevent a margin decrease due to sales mix and investments, whereas the LLM claims the credits collectively helped 'stabilize and modestly improve' TMO’s aggregate margin, which contradicts the original’s implication of divergent outcomes. The LLM incorrectly synthesizes the two effects as net positive, while the ground truth describes one positive and one negative net outcome. (4) Despite the factual inaccuracies, the LLM answer is contextually relevant, addressing the core question about margin trends and offsetting factors. However, the invention of specific metrics and incorrect synthesis of overall impact significantly reduces correctness.

      "original_answer": "The total amortization of net prior service (credits) costs in 2021 was $-312 million for Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans (-$349 million) and Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans ($37 million). This compares to the 2019 total of -$291 million for both plans (-$333 million for Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans and $42 million for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans), showing a slight decrease of $-21 million from 2019 to 2021.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly reports all numeric values: 2021 amortization amounts of -$349 million for Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans and $37 million for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans, summing to a combined -$312 million. For 2019, it correctly states -$333 million and $42 million, totaling -$291 million. These match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation of the combined totals is accurate: (-349 + 37) = -312 and (-333 + 42) = -291. The difference between 2021 and 2019 totals is correctly implied as -312 - (-291) = -21 million, meaning a $21 million increase in net expense (i.e., a larger negative value), which the model describes as 'about $21 million more (a larger net expense)', which is semantically and financially accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—aggregating across two plans and two years, then comparing—is sound and complete. The model synthesizes the correct values from both years and both plans, and draws the correct conclusion about the trend. (4) The only minor issue is wording: the original answer states 'a slight decrease of $-21 million', which is slightly confusing (negative decrease = increase), while the LLM clarifies it as '$21 million more (a larger net expense)', which is clearer and more intuitive. This is an improvement in communication, not an error. All entities, years, and metrics are correct. Thus, the answer is fully factually accurate with excellent reasoning and relevance.",

      "original_answer": "The increase in Sam's Club fuel sales, which have lower margins, contributed to a 68 basis point decrease in the segment's gross profit rate. This was partially offset by reduced tobacco sales, which improved the sales mix.

The total committed Technology Services Revenue for 2024 through 2026 and thereafter is incorrectly stated as $319 million, whereas the ground truth is $228 million ($73M + $56M + $59M). This major discrepancy suggests either a misreading of the table or inclusion of incorrect line items (e.g., possibly including other revenue categories). (2) The revenue figures for 2023 and 2022 are partially correct in terms of the year-over-year increase ($121 million), but the actual values are inaccurate: LLM reports $1.485B for 2023 and $1.364B for 2022, while the ground truth is $1.5B in 2023 and $1.4B in 2022. Although the $121M increase matches, the base figures do not align with the original answer, indicating potential data extraction errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM attempts to extract forward-looking committed revenue and compare annual revenues across years—but fails in accurate data retrieval and synthesis. The reference to 'page_98' and 'page_52' suggests document grounding, but the numbers do not match the expected values. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate financial terminology. However, due to major quantitative errors in both the committed revenue total and the annual revenue figures, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.

      "original_answer": "The $135.4 billion backlog impacts the recognition of contract sales as approximately 38% is expected to be recognized within 12 months and 60% within 24 months. This gradual recognition affects the profit booking rate because the company continuously revises estimates of total costs and variable consideration during the performance of contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Changes in risks surrounding technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contracts within the backlog can either increase or decrease the profit booking rate, depending on whether the risks are retired or escalate.",
      "llm_answer": "The $135.4 billion backlog is the pool of un‑fulfilled performance obligations that will be converted into sales as work progresses; under the cost‑to‑cost percentage‑of‑completion method Lockheed Martin recognizes revenue (and the associated profit) in proportion to costs incurred, expecting to book roughly 38 % of that backlog in the next 12 months and about 60 % in the next 24 months.  The profit‑booking rate applied to those contracts is initially set based on the estimated technical, schedule and cost risks, and is subsequently adjusted—upward when risks are retired (or variable consideration rises) and downward when estimated costs increase—so changes in the backlog’s estimated consideration directly affect the profit‑booking rate and the amount of profit recognized on the backlog.",

No calculations are required, and the percentages match exactly. (2) The answer correctly explains that revenue and profit are recognized under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method in proportion to costs incurred, which is consistent with accounting principles and the context provided. (3) The reasoning regarding the profit booking rate is sound: it correctly identifies that initial profit rates are based on estimated risks (technical, schedule, cost) and are adjusted over time as risks are retired (increasing profit) or costs rise (decreasing profit). It also correctly links changes in variable consideration and cost estimates to adjustments in profit recognition. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly state that the backlog itself consists of long-term contracts subject to ongoing estimate revisions—though this is implied. It also slightly rephrases 'profit booking rate' as being 'applied' and 'adjusted', which is semantically equivalent but could be more precisely tied to the method's requirement for continuous estimation updates. Overall, the answer demonstrates strong multi-hop reasoning by connecting backlog size, revenue recognition timing, accounting method mechanics, and dynamic profit rate adjustments.

While it correctly states the December average price ($244.72) and the program's overall average price ($237.35), it incorrectly reports the number of shares purchased as 2,804,785, which when multiplied by $237.35 yields only ~$665 million—far below the correct total dollar value of $2,804,785,000. The correct number of shares would be approximately 11.8 million (2.8B / 237.35), not 2.8 million. The LLM confuses shares with dollars, suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding. (2) The total repurchase value is off by over $2.1 billion—this is a severe miscalculation. The comparison that December’s average price was $7.37 higher (≈3.1%) is numerically accurate, but the basis is flawed because the overall average is misapplied to an incorrect share count. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize the total dollar amount with the average price and implied share count. It incorrectly infers that 2.8 million shares were bought at $237.35 to reach a fraction of the true total, showing broken logic in connecting the financial figures.

(4) Contextually, while the answer addresses the right topic (OCI impacts of Euro movements on ABBV's hedging), the severe factual inaccuracies in numbers, direction of impact (gain vs. loss), and resulting comparison make the response highly misleading. The citation to 'page_111' does not justify the erroneous data. Thus, the answer fails on all core dimensions, warranting a very low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "The Walmart U.S. segment contributed positively to the overall gross profit rate by increasing it by 51 basis points in fiscal 2022, primarily due to price management in response to cost inflation and a favorable merchandise mix, including the lapping of temporary closures of Auto Care and Vision Centers. In contrast, the Sam's Club segment negatively impacted the gross profit rate by decreasing it by 68 basis points due to increased fuel sales with lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, despite some offset from favorable sales mix and reduced tobacco sales. These opposing effects from the two segments resulted in a net negative impact of 17 basis points on the company's overall gross profit rate performance in fiscal 2022.",

However, the cumulative calculation is incorrect: the LLM states a cumulative loss of $384 million, but the correct sum is $ (304) million (i.e., -1,077 + 308 + 385 = -384? No — actual math: -1,077 + 308 = -769; -769 + 385 = -384? Wait — correction: -1,077 + 308 = -769; -769 + 385 = -384. But the ground truth says $ (304) million. This implies either the ground truth or the input numbers are inconsistent. Rechecking: -1,077 + 308 + 385 = (-1,077) + (308 + 385) = -1,077 + 693 = -384. So the correct cumulative is $ (384) million, not $ (304) million. Therefore, the LLM’s calculation is mathematically correct, but contradicts the stated ground truth. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth. However, per evaluation rules, we must score against the provided ground truth.

While these may be accurate from the filing, they go beyond the scope of the ground truth and introduce unverified data. The original answer only mentions the 2024 value ($995 million), which the LLM correctly includes. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes annual gains/losses, computes cumulative effect, and links them to the 'Other Income (Expense), Net' line.

According to the ground truth, the ABO for Non-U.S. Pensions decreased from $8,694 million in 2020 to $8,404 million in 2021, a decrease of $290 million. However, the LLM reports a drop from $9,830 million to $9,278 million, implying a $552 million decrease—both the starting/ending values and the calculated change are incorrect. Similarly, for plan assets, the ground truth shows an increase from $6,254 million to $6,947 million (a $693 million rise), but the LLM states an increase from $7,653 million to $7,968 million ($315 million rise), which is also incorrect. These numerical discrepancies are substantial and materially affect the analysis. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM’s own numbers (e.g., $9,830M - $9,278M = $552M decrease; $7,968M - $7,653M = $315M increase), but since the source numbers are wrong, the results are invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing changes in ABO and plan assets over time—is conceptually sound and addresses the question structure correctly. The LLM identifies the relevant metric (ABO), the correct category (non-U.S. pensions), and performs year-over-year comparisons for both obligations and assets, showing appropriate synthesis.

While it correctly identifies the increase in franchised-restaurant revenues ($1.33 billion) and attributes the growth to the correct components (rents, royalties, initial fees), it fundamentally misrepresents the 'increase in rents' being compared. The question asks how much the increase in franchised-restaurant revenues exceeded the increase in rents — where 'rents' refers to rent *revenue* received by MCD from franchisees, not rent *expense* paid by franchisees. The LLM incorrectly uses 'variable rent expense paid by franchised restaurants' ($209M to $261M), which is a cost borne by franchisees, not a revenue stream for MCD. This is a critical error that invalidates the comparison. The correct rent revenue increase is $794.3 million (from $9,045.7M to $9,840.0M), not $52.4M. Thus, the claimed excess of $1.28 billion is wrong; the correct excess is $536.4 million. (2) Number verification: Revenue increase is correctly calculated as ~$1.33 billion (matches $1,330.7M). However, rent increase is completely wrong: LLM reports $52.4M vs. correct $794.3M. Component breakdown (rent +$794M, royalties +$525M, initial fees +$11M) is mostly accurate and aligns with ground truth trends, but the LLM fails to note that rent revenue growth alone accounts for most of the total increase. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies the correct revenue components but fails to correctly identify the relevant rent metric — it uses a franchisee expense instead of MCD's rent revenue, indicating a failure in entity disambiguation and financial statement interpretation. This breaks the multi-hop logic. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3) due to the central calculation being based on incorrect data. Quantitative accuracy is poor due to the wrong rent figures and resulting miscalculation. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the revenue components are correctly identified.

However, it provides incorrect total sales figures: $519,926 million in 2020 and $567,762 million in 2022, leading to a calculated increase of $47,836 million. The ground truth reports total sales as $341,004 million in 2020 and $393,247 million in 2022, an increase of $52,243 million. These figures are significantly different, suggesting the LLM used incorrect source data (possibly from a different company or misread document). (2) Due to the incorrect base values, the percentage calculation is also wrong: LLM reports ~5%, while the correct value is ~4.32% ($2,257 / $52,243). Although the approximation is in the same general range, the error stems from incorrect inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly computes the difference in 'Other categories' sales, computes total sales growth, and expresses the former as a percentage of the latter—but it fails due to incorrect data retrieval for total sales. This indicates a failure in entity or metric alignment (possibly confusing Walmart with another company or misreading the 'total net sales' line item). (4) Scores reflect partial credit: correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to critical factual errors in total sales figures; qualitative accuracy is moderate because reasoning logic is intact; contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate structure and sourcing references.",

The ground truth states that the two reported Operating Contributions are $21,312 million and $22,321 million, summing to $43,755 million. The LLM instead uses $23,312 million and $28,279 million, which do not match the ground truth values. These numbers appear to be misidentified—$28,279 million likely refers to the total Operating Contribution of the Communications segment, which includes but is not limited to Mobility, and $23,312 million does not align with any value in the ground truth. (2) The calculation itself ($23,312 + $28,279 = $51,591) is mathematically correct, but the inputs are wrong, leading to an incorrect total. The correct sum is $21,312 + $22,321 = $43,755 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify the two distinct segment reporting structures that both pertain to Mobility. Instead, it incorrectly combines Mobility’s standalone contribution with the broader Communications segment total, which results in double-counting and misrepresentation. The correct approach requires identifying two disclosures of Mobility’s Operating Contribution under different segment reporting formats, not combining Mobility with a parent segment. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the model attempts to address the concept of multiple reporting structures and performs a sum, but the entities and numbers are inaccurate. Due to major factual and reasoning errors, the correctness score is low at 2, quantitative accuracy is 2 (wrong inputs), qualitative accuracy is 3 (partial logic but flawed synthesis), and contextual relevance is 6 (on-topic but incorrect).",

It states that the beginning balance for FY 2023 was $1 million, but the ground truth is $4 million. This is a critical error in entity and quantitative accuracy. The additions in FY 2023 are reported as $5 million by the LLM, but this information is not present in the ground truth, which only discusses additions in FY 2024 ($17 million). The LLM incorrectly calculates a net increase of $15 million by comparing a derived total of $6 million in 2023 to $21 million in 2024, which does not align with the correct method of comparing beginning and ending balances across fiscal years. The correct net increase is $7 million ($11 million ending in 2024 minus $4 million beginning in 2023). (2) Calculations are fundamentally flawed: the LLM adds beginning balance and additions to create a 'total' that has no basis in accounting for allowance accounts, and then takes the difference across years of these invented totals. The correct approach, per the original answer, is to compute the net change in the allowance balance over the period, considering additions and write-offs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is poorly executed: the model fails to correctly identify the relevant balances and time periods, misrepresents the structure of allowance accounts, and does not incorporate the impact of write-offs ($10 million) which are essential to explaining the $7 million net increase. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right metric, company (AVGO implied), and fiscal years, and attempts a quantitative comparison.

This methodology directly affects the accuracy of its U.S. merchandise inventory valuation, which is stated at the lower of cost or market under the retail inventory method.

According to the disclosure, franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by McDonald's but are instead the basis on which franchised revenues are calculated. This indicates that the $15,436.5 million in franchised revenues is directly tied to the volume and health of franchised sales, which in turn reflect the financial health of the franchisee base.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in both magnitude and direction of impact. The ground truth states that the cumulative impact on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) was a net decrease of $112 million, driven primarily by large swings in other comprehensive income (loss) of $74M (2019), $(799)M (2020), and $699M (2021), culminating in a final AOCL balance of $(91) million. In contrast, the LLM claims pre-tax gains of $27M, $18M, and $26M — totaling $71M — which are not supported by the ground truth and misrepresent the actual figures. These numbers do not align with any line items in the original answer and appear fabricated. (2) The reclassification amounts are also incorrect: the LLM states a total reclassification of $71M (implied), while the ground truth specifies total reclassifications of $(56)M, broken down as $(21)M, $(14)M, and $(21)M across 2019–2021. The LLM incorrectly frames reclassifications as reducing AOCL by $71M due to gains being reclassified into earnings, but in reality, the reclassifications were losses (negative values), which reduced AOCL less than they would have if they were gains — a critical distinction the model misses. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to trace the change in AOCL over time, does not compute the correct cumulative impact, and misunderstands the relationship between current-period OCI, reclassifications, and the AOCL balance. It omits the starting balance ($9M) and ending balance ($(91)M), which are essential for calculating the net change. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses net investment hedging and its effect on OCI and reclassification into earnings, which are relevant concepts. However, due to severe factual and quantitative inaccuracies, the answer is misleading and does not reflect the actual financial impact. The qualitative reasoning is superficial and lacks the necessary synthesis across years and components required by the question.",

These numbers are accurately reported with acceptable format variation (billion vs million). (2) However, the calculation of the difference between 2022 revenue and the combined prior two years is incorrect. The combined revenue for 2021 and 2020 is correctly stated as $9.55 billion, but the difference should be $9,550 million - $4,472 million = $5,078 million, or approximately $5.08 billion. The ground truth states the difference is $503 million, which is incorrect — this appears to be a mistake in the original answer. Therefore, the LLM’s calculation of ~$5.08 billion lower is actually mathematically correct, but the ground truth incorrectly claims $503 million. This creates a conflict where the LLM is numerically accurate but contradicts the provided 'ground truth'. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model retrieves revenues across three years, sums the two prior years, and computes the difference. The logic and synthesis are correct.

The main issue is the discrepancy with the original answer’s erroneous $503 million figure. Given that the LLM performs correct calculations and reports correct numbers, but the ground truth contains a calculation error, the correctness score is moderate: the LLM is quantitatively more accurate than the provided ground truth, but this creates evaluation ambiguity.

In the same span, Grocery net sales grew from **$192,428 million to $218,944 million**, a **$26.5 billion increase**【page_81】—meaning Grocery sales grew roughly **$9 billion more** than General‑merchandise sales.",

(1) All key numbers are correct: General Merchandise sales start at $108,687 million in FY2020 and reach $125,876 million in FY2022, resulting in an increase of $17,189 million, which the model correctly rounds to $17.2 billion. Grocery sales increase from $192,428 million to $218,944 million, a difference of $26,516 million, which the model rounds to $26.5 billion—both acceptable rounding. (2) The comparison states that Grocery sales grew roughly $9 billion more than General Merchandise, while the exact difference is $26,516M - $17,189M = $9,327M. The model’s use of 'roughly $9 billion' is a reasonable approximation in context. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies two distinct sales categories across two fiscal years, computes their respective growth, and compares the two—demonstrating proper synthesis across time and categories. (4) Entities (Walmart, General Merchandise, Grocery, fiscal years 2020–2022) are accurate. The only minor deviation is the rounding of $9,327 million to 'roughly $9 billion', which slightly reduces precision but does not affect overall correctness.

The calculated differences—$44,838M for total sales and $9,367M for non-U.S. sales—are correct. (2) Calculations are precise and properly cited with page references. The LLM correctly computes the increase in both categories and accurately compares them, noting that total growth is roughly five times the non-U.S. growth (44,838 ÷ 9,367 ≈ 4.79, which rounds to ~5x—reasonable for qualitative comparison). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two time points and two business segments (total vs. non-U.S. automotive), correctly identifying trends and relative contributions. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits explicit mention of the U.S. segment’s role in driving growth, which is included in the original answer. However, the core facts, calculations, and comparative insight are fully accurate and relevant. Wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence. Thus, high scores across all categories with a 9 in correctness due to slight incompleteness in explanatory depth.",

By contrast, in 2022 the figures were $740 million of transition‑tax liability plus $850 million of net unrecognized tax benefits – about $1.59 billion in total – so the 2023 amount is roughly $340 million lower than in 2022【page_56†L...】.",

The LLM instead reports $7.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, totaling only $10.2 million—over 160 times smaller than the correct amount. These numbers are not only wrong but appear to be based on misread or misinterpreted line items from the cited pages (e.g., possibly confusing catastrophe losses with other line items or misreading units). (2) The calculations in the LLM answer (7.2 = 16.7 - 9.5 and 3.0 = 5.3 - 2.3) are arithmetically correct, but the underlying data is factually wrong—these values do not represent the actual catastrophe loss reductions for 2021 as per the knowledge graph. The correct reductions are on the order of billions, not millions. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the LLM attempts to compute the change in catastrophe losses for both segments and sum them—but it fails at the data retrieval step. It does not correctly identify the relevant financial figures from the source documents, leading to a complete breakdown in factual accuracy. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer discusses the right topic (catastrophe loss impact on underwriting income) and the right companies and year, but with grossly inaccurate magnitudes.

The original answer states that both Disney's Media and Entertainment Distribution and Parks, Experiences and Products revenues declined from fiscal 2021 to 2022, with declines of $2,162 million and $116 million respectively. However, the LLM claims both segments experienced significant growth—$4.2 billion and $12.2 billion increases—directly contradicting the ground truth. (2) The numbers are grossly inaccurate: LLM reports Media and Entertainment Distribution revenue as $50.9B (2021) and $55.0B (2022), while the truth is $14.143B and $11.981B—less than a third of the stated values. Similarly, Parks revenue is reported as $16.6B to $28.7B vs. actuals of $2.952B to $2.836B. These are not formatting differences but fundamental factual errors. Calculations of changes (≈$4.2B increase vs. actual $2.162B decrease) are completely wrong.

However, the total change is reported as $136 million, while the ground truth is $134 million, indicating a $2 million discrepancy. (2) The component calculations are mostly accurate: the increase in the benefit excluding R&D capitalization is correctly calculated as $596M - $447M = $149M. The decrease in the R&D capitalization-related benefit is $598M - $585M = $13M. The net change should be $149M - $13M = $136M, which matches the LLM's calculation. However, the ground truth states $134M, suggesting either a data discrepancy in the source or a minor error in the ground truth. Given the internal consistency of the LLM's math and the cited source (page_43), the $136M figure may actually be correct based on the document, but it diverges from the provided ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes two components from potentially different parts of the filing and computes a net change. (4) The correctness score is 8 due to the $2M difference from the ground truth, though the reasoning and component accuracy are strong.

The LLM does not explicitly state the percentage contribution (103.8%) as in the original answer, but it correctly conveys that the $439M drop in 'All Other Accrued Liabilities' was the primary driver of the $423M total decrease and notes that other components (accrued rebates) increased slightly, thus offsetting part of the decline—this logically implies that the 'All Other' decrease exceeds the total decrease, which is consistent with the 103.8% contribution. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two time points and two line items, correctly infers causality and partial offsetting effects.

The U.S. automotive segment's contribution is also correctly reported with an increase from $116,798 million to $127,472 million, a $10,674 million rise, rounded to $10.7 billion. These minor rounding differences ($10.674B → $10.7B) are acceptable under semantic equivalence and common reporting practices. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth when adjusted for unit formatting (billion vs million); calculations are accurate.

It states that Walmart International's format mix reduced its gross profit rate by 55 basis points, but the original answer does not provide any numerical impact for Walmart International—only a qualitative explanation that the format mix (with more wholesale and cash & carry) led to a lower gross profit rate. This 55-basis-point figure is unsupported and incorrect. (2) The Sam's Club 68 basis point decrease is accurate and matches the ground truth. However, the LLM adds a claim that the U.S. segment had a 51-basis-point gain and that there was a 'net decline' for the company in FY2022. These calculations and conclusions are not supported by the original answer, which only states that both factors created 'downward pressure' on the consolidated gross profit rate—without quantifying the net effect or mentioning U.S. segment improvement. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in linking Walmart International and Sam's Club impacts to consolidated performance, but it overreaches by introducing unsupported numbers and a net conclusion. The original answer does not confirm a net decline or provide segment offsets. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right segments and drivers (format mix in international, fuel sales in Sam's Club). However, the quantitative accuracy is low due to fabricated numbers. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the direction of impact (negative) is correct, but precision is poor.

(2) There are no numerical inaccuracies—no incorrect figures, dates, or calculations are presented. The mention of 'up to 7 years' for software is a reasonable and accurate estimate based on Disney's actual filings and enhances the answer without introducing error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that the same depreciation method applies across two distinct asset classes and infers the financial reporting implications—predictable expense recognition, improved comparability, and stabilized earnings—which aligns semantically with the ground truth's emphasis on uniformity, simplicity in forecasting, and comparability. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the methodology and its impact on financial reporting. The only minor difference is that the LLM uses 'amortized' for software (technically correct, as software is intangible) while the original uses 'depreciated' broadly, but this distinction is acceptable and precise.

However, the LLM introduces unsupported data: the $6,733 million common dividend in FY 2022 and $9.814 billion total in FY 2024 are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified. These figures appear to be hallucinated or inferred from external data not provided in the context. (2) The calculation of a net increase of $2.782 billion in total dividends is not supported by the original answer, which focuses solely on the reduction in preferred dividends. The original answer does not mention common dividends or total payout trends, so this addition goes beyond the available evidence. (3) The reasoning is logically structured but flawed in synthesis—while it correctly notes the cessation of the $299 million preferred dividend, it incorrectly frames the overall impact as a net increase, which contradicts the question’s focus on 'reduction in dividend payments' specifically due to the elimination of preferred dividends. (4) The entity (Broadcom/AVGO) and fiscal years (2022–2024) are correct, and the core fact of $299 million in eliminated preferred dividends is accurate. However, the inclusion of unverified total dividend figures undermines quantitative and qualitative accuracy. The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question, but with incorrect numerical synthesis. Thus, the correctness score is reduced to 6 due to major unsupported calculations despite a correct identification of the key $299M reduction.",

      "original_answer": "The goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million for the Spain reporting unit in 2023 was recorded in 'Goodwill impairment' on the consolidated statements of operations. This indicates that the carrying amount of the Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, signaling underperformance or declining market conditions for that unit. This impairment reflects a direct financial consequence of the reporting unit's inability to meet expected future cash flows, which are key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing. The charge further demonstrates how impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, directly affecting the company’s operating results.",

This charge was added to the other impairment items, raising total impairment charges to $280 million and driving other operating expenses to $370.7 million for the year, which reduced net income 【page_130】.

No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects the impairment charge to the fair value vs. carrying amount shortfall, links it to performance expectations, and correctly infers that declining performance or outlook triggers the write-down—this aligns with the conceptual explanation in the ground truth regarding discounted cash flow assumptions and impairment triggers. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent and slightly more detailed than the ground truth, particularly in showing downstream impacts on operating expenses and net income.

The individual yearly components provided by the LLM ($596M general + $585M R&D in 2024; $447M general + $598M R&D in 2023) do not align with the ground truth values, which are not explicitly broken down but must sum to $2,146M total.

(2) The calculations themselves are arithmetically correct (596 + 585 + 447 + 598 = 2,226), but the input numbers are factually wrong, leading to an incorrect total.

(4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses the right concept, time frame, and structure. However, the quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect figures, dragging down the overall correctness score. Minor formatting like '≈ $2.2 billion' is acceptable, but the core number must match.

(2) All numeric values are correct: $36 million pre-tax charge, $7,379 million segment operating profit, and $9,123 million consolidated operating profit are consistent with the source data. The directional impact—reducing unallocated items and thus consolidated profit—is accurately described. Format variations (e.g., $36 million vs $36 million) are acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across the segment profit, unallocated items, and consolidated profit, showing how restructuring charges are excluded from segment performance but included in consolidated results.

The decrease in freight car velocity was caused by slower train speeds and increased terminal dwell time, which were driven by weather-related disruptions, California wildfires, bridge outages, and global supply chain issues. Despite these challenges, the implementation of Union Pacific’s operating plan—including blending service products and optimizing transportation routes—helped partially offset the negative effects on velocity and train speed, contributing to improved workforce and locomotive productivity. This led to a 10% improvement in workforce productivity (from 947 to 1,038 car miles per employee) and supported the operating ratio improvement.",

Although these slower operations added cost pressure, Union Pacific’s operating ratio still fell 2.7 percentage points because core pricing gains, productivity initiatives (including higher workforce productivity and a 3 % lower headcount) and a favorable traffic mix more than offset the cost impact of the reduced speed and dwell time【page_41】.",

(2) The answer completely addresses both parts of the question: the change in accrued rebates and its impact on net trade receivables. (3) Entities—Abbott, accrued wholesaler chargeback rebates, and net trade receivables—are correctly identified, and the time periods (2022 to 2023) are accurate. (4) The reasoning is sound: because rebates are netted against trade receivables, a decrease in the rebate liability leads to higher net trade receivables, which the model correctly explains as a $2 million increase due to a smaller offset. The semantic meaning and financial logic are equivalent to the original answer, with only minor wording differences (e.g., 'netted against' vs 'netted in'). All multi-hop elements—tracking a liability change over time and linking it to balance sheet impact—are correctly synthesized.",

      "original_answer": "The Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion expense decreased by $1,136.1 million from 2023 to 2024, while Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by $1,538.8 million over the same period. This indicates a significant shift in AMT's financial performance, with lower non-cash expenses coinciding with higher pre-tax income.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the numerical values. According to the ground truth, Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion expense decreased by $1,136.1 million, but the LLM reports a decrease of approximately $900 million (calculated from $2,928.5M to $2,028.8M, which is actually a $899.7M drop). This is off by about $236 million, a substantial error in magnitude. Similarly, for Income from continuing operations before income taxes, the ground truth states an increase of $1,538.8 million, but the LLM claims an increase of about $2.1 billion (from $1,529.3M to $3,624.8M, which is a $2,095.5M increase), overestimating the change by more than $550 million. These miscalculations severely impact quantitative accuracy. (2) The cited numbers do not align with the ground truth, and the resulting calculations are incorrect. Even allowing for rounding, the discrepancies are too large to be considered accurate (e.g., $1.1B vs $900M; $1.5B vs $2.1B). (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound in structure: the model correctly identifies the direction of change (decrease in D&A, increase in pre-tax income) and attempts to compare them meaningfully. It also correctly attributes the data to the right company (AMT) and time period (2023 to 2024), showing proper entity and temporal alignment. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and addresses both parts of the multi-hop question—change in D&A and change in pre-tax income—with appropriate synthesis. However, due to major errors in the core financial figures, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. While the directionality and conceptual interpretation are correct, the magnitude errors undermine the reliability of the response.",

      "original_answer": "The combined change in Walmart's net sales in Mexico and Central America and Canada from fiscal year 2021 to 2022 is an increase of $5,594 million. Specifically, net sales in Mexico and Central America increased from $32,642 million in 2021 to $35,964 million in 2022, a rise of $3,322 million. In Canada, net sales increased from $19,991 million in 2021 to $21,773 million in 2022, a growth of $1,782 million. Together, these two regions contributed a net positive change of $5,594 million, indicating that Walmart International experienced growth in these North American markets during this period.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the individual net sales figures for Mexico & Central America and Canada in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, and the direction of change (increase) is accurate. However, the combined increase is reported as 'roughly $5.1 billion', which is incorrect. The correct combined change is $3,322 million + $1,782 million = $5,104 million, or $5.104 billion — the LLM likely rounded each component to $3.3B and $1.8B and summed to $5.1B, which is acceptable as rounding. But the ground truth states the combined change is $5,594 million, which contradicts the component-wise sum. Upon verification: $35,964 - $32,642 = $3,322; $21,773 - $19,991 = $1,782; sum = $5,104 million. Therefore, the ground truth contains an error in the total ($5,594M), and the LLM’s $5.1B (~$5,100M) is actually closer to correct. This suggests the knowledge graph may have a data error. Given this, the LLM’s quantitative output is more accurate than the 'ground truth'. (2) All individual numbers are correctly cited from the original answer. The use of '$3.3 billion' and '$1.8 billion' is acceptable rounding. The final sum of 'roughly $5.1 billion' is reasonable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly extracted and compared sales across two regions and two fiscal years, computed changes, and synthesized them. The conclusion about positive momentum aligning with regional performance is logically supported. (4) The contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both parts of the question: the combined change and what it indicates about Walmart International. The mention of 'helping offset declines elsewhere' adds context not in the original, but is plausible and not contradicted. Final scores reflect high correctness, but docked slightly due to the discrepancy in the total change amount — however, the LLM appears factually better than the provided ground truth on calculation.",
