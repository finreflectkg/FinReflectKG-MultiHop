      "question": "How has the emphasis on strategic transformation initiatives as a risk factor impacting BK's financial condition evolved from 2023 to 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, BK identified transformational or strategic project initiatives as exposing the company to new or additional risks, with the failure to implement these initiatives potentially affecting results of operations. By 2024, this risk was expanded to include the specific concern that BK 'may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our transition to a platforms operating model,' indicating a more concrete and strategic shift with defined expectations and potential shortfalls. This evolution reflects a deepening risk as the company moves from general transformation initiatives to a specific operating model transformation.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe 2023 filing warned that “new lines of business, new products and services or transformational or strategic project initiatives subject us to new or additional risks, and the failure to implement these initiatives could affect our results of operations,” linking such initiatives directly to BK’s reported financial condition. The 2024 filing repeats this language but adds a more specific focus on the firm’s “transition to a platforms operating model” and notes that it may “not realize some or all of the expected benefits,” underscoring a heightened and more detailed emphasis on strategic transformation as a risk driver for BK’s financial condition. Both years use the KG pattern **ORG ‑ Negatively_Impacts → FIN_METRIC ← Negatively_Impacts ORG** to tie BK’s strategic‑transformation efforts to its financial metrics, showing the risk factor’s continuity but with added granularity in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $633 million, with additions of $162 million and write-offs of $148 million. By 2024, the allowance decreased to $577 million, with additions of $122 million and write-offs of $199 million.

Additions to the allowance grew from $162 million in 2022 to $201 million in 2023 before dropping to $122 million in 2024, while write‑offs increased each year—$(148) million in 2022, $(183) million in 2023 and $(199) million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco reported $313 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets included in operating expenses. By fiscal 2024, this figure had increased significantly, as the company cited 'higher amortization of purchased intangible assets' as a contributing factor to the 3.8 percentage point decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue. This increase reflects the financial impact of acquisitions, such as Splunk, on Cisco's operating expenses over time.",
      "llm_answer": "\nCisco’s amortization of purchased intangible assets grew from **$313 million in fiscal 2022**—which already reflected a **46 % increase** over the prior year (Chunk 1)—to an even higher level in fiscal 2024, a rise the company attributes to the incremental expense from its Splunk acquisition (Chunk 2).

By 2023, its revenue increased to $12,560 million, and it became the third-largest industry group, showing a 11.9% increase in contribution.

These unit errors invalidate all subsequent calculations. While the percentage increase (~12%) is approximately correct, it's based on incorrect base values.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Payment Network contributed 11% to Mastercard's net revenue growth, reflecting its strong operational performance and a key role in driving revenue. By 2024, the Payment Network was fully integrated into the newly defined 'Payment Solutions' segment, which Mastercard now treats as its sole reportable operating segment. This shift indicates a strategic move toward unifying its payment network with value-added services under a single framework, emphasizing holistic payment solutions rather than distinguishing between core network operations and supplementary services. The consolidation of reporting and the repositioning of the Payment Network within a broader segment reflect a significant transformation in how Mastercard organizes and evaluates its core business performance.",

This shift reflects a strategic repositioning in which the network is now embedded within the broader Payment Solutions segment—alongside value‑added services that grew to **16 % of net‑revenue growth**—and is evaluated holistically by the CODM, whose resource‑allocation decisions (reinvestment, acquisitions, dividends, share‑repurchases) are based on the segment’s consolidated performance rather than on the network alone.",

By 2024, PayPal explicitly stated that cross-border TPV occurs primarily between two PayPal accounts in different countries and includes transactions initiated through its Xoom product. Additionally, TPV grew from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, representing a 10% increase.

This expansion is underpinned by the company’s **foreign‑currency‑hedging program** (Chunk 1), which now sets daily FX rates, uses designated net‑investment and cash‑flow contracts to offset translation gains/losses recorded in other income, and explicitly ties cross‑border TPV to transactions between PayPal accounts in different countries, reflecting a structural shift toward multi‑currency payments and tighter risk‑management of its global assets and liabilities.",

      "question": "What does the evolution of NVIDIA's Graphics segment description between FY22 and FY23 suggest about changes in its revenue mix and strategic focus?",
      "original_answer": "The evolution of NVIDIA's Graphics segment description between FY22 and FY23 suggests a shift in strategic focus toward broader applications beyond traditional gaming and workstation graphics. In FY22, the Graphics segment was primarily described in terms of GeForce GPUs for gaming, Quadro/RTX for enterprise workstations, and virtual GPU software, with revenue reported at $15,868 million. By FY23, the segment's description expanded to explicitly include automotive platforms for infotainment systems and Omniverse Enterprise software for 3D internet applications. While exact revenue figures for FY23 are not provided, the inclusion of these new areas indicates an effort to diversify the revenue mix and extend the Graphics segment's role into emerging markets such as automotive and enterprise 3D applications.",
      "llm_answer": "\nIn FY 2022 the Graphics segment alone delivered $15.868 billion of revenue (Chunk 1), and the FY 2023 filing broadens its definition to include not only GeForce GPUs for gaming PCs but also GeForce NOW streaming, Quadro RTX workstation GPUs, virtual‑GPU software, automotive infotainment platforms and Omniverse Enterprise 3D‑internet software (Chunk 2).  This expanded scope—while the Compute & Networking segment is now highlighted as the home of AI‑accelerated data‑center, automotive‑AI and other high‑performance computing platforms—shows that NVIDIA is shifting its revenue mix from a gaming‑centric foundation toward a more diversified portfolio that emphasizes AI, automotive and software‑as‑a‑service growth, even as the Graphics segment remains a large but relatively diminishing share of total sales.  The segregation of “All Other” expenses (Chunk 2) further illustrates how corporate costs are now allocated across these distinct segments, underscoring the strategic re‑balancing of NVIDIA’s business focus.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM disclosed valuation and qualifying accounts and reserves specifically for the year ended December 31, 2022. By 2024, IBM expanded its disclosure to include valuation reserves for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. This evolution suggests a strategic shift toward providing more comprehensive historical financial data in its reporting, potentially enhancing transparency and enabling more robust trend analysis by stakeholders.",
      "llm_answer": "\nIBM’s historical valuation‑reserve reporting moved from a single‑year “Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves” schedule in its 2022 10‑K (shown on page 49 of IBM_10k_2022.pdf) to a three‑year comparative table that presents the reserve balances for 2022, 2023 and 2024 in the 2024 10‑K (page 19 of IBM_10k_2024.pdf).  This expansion—adding prior‑year and forward‑looking figures—signals a more transparent, trend‑oriented disclosure strategy, likely aimed at satisfying heightened regulatory scrutiny and investor demand for clearer insight into the company’s reserve movements.

By fiscal 2024, Oracle reported 28,000 employees dedicated to cloud services and license support operations, compared to only 3,000 employees in the hardware segment.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Accenture highlighted that many of its consulting contracts were less than 12 months in duration and could be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, posing a risk to revenue predictability. Additionally, the company noted that delays or reductions in client spending—especially under existing contracts—could materially affect results, particularly in geographic markets or service lines where a small number of clients contributed significantly to revenue. By 2024, the focus of client spending risk had evolved to emphasize broader operational vulnerabilities, including global disruptions such as geopolitical tensions, health emergencies, and infrastructure failures. These risks, combined with Accenture's global delivery model's concentration in India and the Philippines, introduced new layers of unpredictability in maintaining consistent client spending and service delivery. While contract flexibility remained a concern, the 2024 filing expanded the risk profile to include external macro-operational factors, indicating a shift in how client spending volatility could impact the company.",
      "llm_answer": "\nAccenture’s exposure to client‑spending risk has stayed high from 2022 through 2024: in 2022 the company noted that the majority of its contracts are under 12 months, allow as little as 30 days’ notice and often provide only modest early‑termination fees, while rapid technology change and a concentration of revenue from a few large clients can cause clients to delay, reduce or cancel spending, directly undermining revenue predictability; by 2024 the firm reiterated that its global delivery model—heavily concentrated in India and the Philippines—and external shocks such as geopolitical tension, pandemics or natural disasters can further impair its ability to serve those clients, expanding the risk to contract flexibility and cash‑flow stability. Thus, the financial metric “Client Spending” remains a key dependency of Accenture that both drives and can destabilize the company’s results, illustrating the continued evolution of client‑spending risk across the two years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal identified TPV as a key non-financial performance metric but did not provide a specific quantitative value for TPV. However, in 2023, the company explicitly disclosed that it processed $1.53 trillion of TPV. This evolution indicates a shift in reporting focus toward greater transparency and emphasis on measurable business performance, aligning TPV with other quantified metrics to demonstrate the scale and growth of PayPal's operations.",
      "llm_answer": "\nIn 2022 PayPal only identified total payment volume (TPV) as one of its “key metrics” – defining it as a non‑financial performance indicator that reflects transaction value on its platform (Chunk 1) – but it did not disclose an actual figure. By 2023 the company began reporting a concrete TPV of **$1.53 trillion**, embedding that number within its broader narrative of scale, growth and the reorganized focus on serving consumers, small businesses and large enterprises (Chunk 2). This shift shows that PayPal’s reporting has moved from merely flagging TPV as an important metric to quantifying it as a concrete measure of the size and momentum of its global payments ecosystem, underscoring a strategic emphasis on transparency about transaction volume and market scale.",

      "original_answer": "The company's approach to using market-based measures for expected volatility remained consistent from 2023 to 2024, as it continued to rely on implied volatility from market data for all options granted. Additionally, the method for determining expected option lives also remained unchanged, using a rolling 10-year average of historical exercise behavior.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate was 0.94%, which decreased slightly to 0.93% in 2024. This minor decrease followed an increase in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by unfavorable changes in product mix, particularly a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing, partially offset by favorable regional mix changes. In 2024, the slight decline in the rate suggests that the company may have experienced more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies, although the overall rate remained relatively stable.",
      "llm_answer": "\nPayPal’s Transaction Expense Rate slipped slightly from **0.94 % in 2023 to 0.93 % in 2024**, even though the dollar amount of transaction expense rose **9 % to $15.7 bn** (up from $14.4 bn in 2023).  The modest rate decline is attributed to a **more favorable funding and product mix**—the company noted that a larger share of transactions is now funded by lower‑cost sources such as PayPal/Venmo balances and non‑U.S. credit‑card volumes, which offsets the higher TPV growth (13 % in 2023) and the higher‑expense unbranded card processing that drove the 2023 increase.  As disclosed in the filings, changes in **product mix, merchant mix, regional mix, funding mix, and fees paid to payment processors**—all of which are influenced by macro‑economic shifts in consumer spending—directly affect the transaction‑expense rate.",

      "question": "How has NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of lead time and financial risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "\nFrom fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 NVIDIA shifted from the “approximately six‑month lead‑time” ordering pattern to non‑cancellable, prepaid purchase commitments that are placed at least twelve months in advance and often involve premiums or deposits to lock in capacity—an evolution that broadened its long‑term supply commitments and tied the company’s financial performance to those commitments (the KG link shows Long‑Term Supply Commitments ↔ NVDA, where the metric is negatively impacted by the firm and into which it invests).  While the 2023 discussion notes that lead‑times for certain components have shortened and that the company has added new vendors and prepaid manufacturing agreements, it also warns that the larger, earlier‑placed commitments increase the risk of inventory over‑provision, impairments and margin pressure if demand falls or competitive supply expands.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal processed TPV and payment transactions at levels that served as a baseline for 2024, where the company reported $1.68 trillion in TPV, representing a 10% increase, and 26.3 billion payment transactions, reflecting a 5% increase. According to PayPal’s disclosures, TPV and payment transactions are used by management to measure the scale of the platform and the relevance of its products and services. The growth in both metrics from 2023 to 2024 indicates an expansion in the volume of activity on the platform and suggests increased engagement with PayPal's offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "\nPayPal’s total payment volume grew 10% year‑over‑year to **$1.68 trillion in 2024**, and payment transaction volume rose 5% to **26.3 billion transactions**, figures reported in the 2024 10‑K (Chunk 2). These metrics are explicitly defined as the company’s “key non‑financial performance metrics” that management uses to **measure the scale of its platform and the relevance of its products and services** (Chunk 1). Accordingly, the double‑digit TPV increase and the steady rise in transaction volume directly illustrate how PayPal’s expanding volume validates its stated use of these metrics to evaluate platform scale and product relevance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Broadcom's Semiconductor Solutions Segment operated independently and was characterized by strong profitability driven by supply imbalances, while the VMware acquisition was pending and expected to close in fiscal 2023. The company emphasized semiconductor demand and supply constraints related to wafers and substrates. By 2023, the VMware acquisition was completed on November 22, 2023, for a total consideration of $84,186 million (including $30,788 million in cash and $53,398 million in Broadcom stock). This marked a strategic shift as Broadcom began integrating VMware into its infrastructure software segment, signaling a broader pivot toward software-driven solutions. While the Semiconductor Solutions Segment remained a core part of the business, the acquisition emphasized a new strategic focus on enhancing infrastructure software capabilities, reflecting a transformation in Broadcom’s financial and operational priorities.",
      "llm_answer": "\nIn 2022 Broadcom was focused exclusively on its **Semiconductor Solutions Segment**, reporting $16,736 million of cash from operations and advancing a $61 billion cash‑and‑stock deal to acquire VMware, which it expected to close in fiscal 2023.  The transaction closed in November 2023 for roughly $30,788 million in cash and the issuance of 544 million Broadcom shares (fair‑value $53.4 billion), after which VMware’s results were consolidated and its infrastructure‑software business was added to Broadcom’s two reportable segments—**Semiconductor Solutions** and **Infrastructure Software**—thereby expanding the strategic scope of the semiconductor segment.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing consolidation of data center workloads in the cloud, rising purchasing power of hyperscalers, and cloud providers developing in-house semiconductors, which eroded Intel’s competitive position. By contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased average selling prices (ASPs) but lowered volume compared to 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's semiconductor solutions segment had a high degree of customer concentration, with one customer accounting for 20% of net revenue. This indicated a strong dependency on a single client for a significant portion of the segment's income. Following the acquisition of VMware in November 2023, Broadcom significantly expanded its infrastructure software capabilities, signaling a strategic shift toward a more diversified technology portfolio that now includes enterprise software and cloud services alongside semiconductors. This acquisition suggests that Broadcom is broadening its business model beyond its earlier reliance on concentrated semiconductor sales, potentially reducing its exposure to customer concentration risk in the semiconductor segment by growing complementary revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "\nFollowing the November 2023 closing of the VMware acquisition, Broadcom realigned its **Semiconductor Solutions** segment from a pure‑hardware focus toward a combined hardware‑plus‑infrastructure‑software strategy, leveraging VMware’s multi‑cloud platform to broaden its recurring‑revenue portfolio.  This strategic shift reduces the segment’s FY 2022 customer concentration—where a single customer accounted for 20 % of net revenue—by diversifying earnings across a larger base of semiconductor and software customers, thereby mitigating the earlier reliance on a few large buyers.

      "llm_answer": "\nAMD’s inventory carrying value rose sharply from about **$1.955 billion** (reported as of December 25 2021 in the 2022 filing) to **$4.351 billion** (reported as of December 30 2023 in the 2023 filing), illustrating a more than two‑fold increase in the size of its inventory pool.  Both years describe the same lower‑of‑cost‑or‑net‑realizable‑value methodology—management reviews on‑hand quantities against forecasted demand and adjusts the carrying value using assumptions about future sales quantities, prices, and product‑life‑cycle trends that are sensitive to market and competitive conditions—yet the 2023 disclosures reveal a far more extensive audit effort, including testing of internal controls, evaluation of the basis for those assumptions, and sensitivity analyses, underscoring the heightened scale and complexity of AMD’s inventory management as its inventory balances have expanded.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Oracle emphasized its Fusion Cloud SaaS offerings, such as ERP, EPM, SCM, and HCM, which were built on open standards like SQL and Java and aimed at reducing IT complexity while providing flexible deployment models. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle expanded its strategic positioning by explicitly linking its cloud services to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), describing its SaaS offerings as an 'industry leading business innovation platform' leveraging OCI.

      "original_answer": "In both 2022 and 2023, MetLife cited low interest rates as increasing the cost of risk transfer measures, which decreases profit margins. However, in 2023, MetLife expanded the context by emphasizing that reductions in net income from these factors could harm credit instrument covenants or the rating agency assessment of their financial condition, a detail not explicitly included in the 2022 filing. This indicates a heightened focus on the downstream implications of low interest rates beyond just cost increases.",
      "llm_answer": "\nMetLife’s 2023 filing notes that persistently low interest rates are now **raising the cost of risk‑transfer measures even more than in 2022**, driving a larger compression of profit margins and prompting the company to **increase reserves and accept a potentially negative investment spread**.  The filing ties this cost rise to lower spreads, higher liability values, the need to reinvest proceeds at lower yields, and greater asset‑liability mismatches—all of which negatively affect MetLife’s net income, credit‑instrument covenants and rating‑agency assessments.",

The LLM adds specific details about reserves and asset-liability mismatches not explicitly in the ground truth, though these may align with SEC filings.

In 2023, Gross Dollar Volume growth slowed to 12% on a local currency basis, yet still supported a 13% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple noted the risk of a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs' due to noncompliance with payment card industry data security standards, which could 'materially adversely affect the Company's business.' By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize not only the risk of increased costs but also the growing regulatory and compliance burden Apple faces globally, including 'an increasing number of federal, state and international laws' that heighten the potential for penalties. This indicates a shift from a general risk acknowledgment in 2022 to a more pronounced concern over the expanding regulatory environment in 2023, which likely exacerbates the financial exposure related to transaction costs.",
      "llm_answer": "\nApple’s exposure to payment‑card transaction costs has grown materially between the 2022 and 2023 filings. In 2022 the company warned that a failure to meet payment‑card industry security standards could “materially adversely affect” the business by raising transaction fees or even eliminating the ability to process cards, while the 2023 filing stresses that an “increasing number of … laws” now drive additional compliance‑related costs and that non‑compliance could bring “significant fees or fines” and force costly changes to business practices. Thus, the financial‑risk magnitude has expanded from a possible fee increase in 2022 to a broader exposure to higher fees, fines and potential loss of card‑processing capability in 2023 as regulatory pressure on data‑privacy and payment‑card security intensifies. (Apple → Experiences → Increased Transaction Costs ← Increases ← Apple)",

The segment was clearly defined and aligned with how the company’s CODMs allocated resources.

In 2022 the Services Business is presented mainly as a source of support and cloud‑services revenue within the broader cloud‑and‑license business, with little explicit strategic emphasis on cloud migration. By 2023 the narrative shifts dramatically: Oracle positions the Services Business as the catalyst for its cloud transformation, highlighting the migration of its on‑premise installed base to Oracle Cloud, the rollout of AI‑driven offerings such as the Autonomous Database, and an expanded go‑to‑market to SMBs and partners, while also noting that an active acquisition program underpins this cloud‑first strategy.

      "question": "How did IBM's presentation of valuation and qualifying accounts in the financial disclosures evolve between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, and what does this indicate about the company's reporting approach?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM's valuation and qualifying accounts were referenced in a table format on page 19 under Schedule II, indicating a structured but potentially less prominent placement within the document. In 2024, the valuation and qualifying accounts section was given a standalone heading on page 29, accompanied by a clear temporal label specifying the years ended December 31, with an explicit mention of financial units in millions. This evolution suggests that IBM placed greater emphasis on transparency and clarity in its financial disclosures over time.",
      "llm_answer": "\nIBM’s disclosure of valuation and qualifying accounts shifted from being tucked into **Schedule II** on page 19 of the 2023 10‑K (which listed the accounts for 2023, 2022 and 2021) to a **stand‑alone “VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS AND RESERVES” section** that appears in the Table of Contents and likely contains a dedicated table for the 2024 filing.  This move, reflected in the KG pattern where **IBM → Valuation Reserves** and **Valuation Reserves → IBM** indicate a direct, highlighted disclosure of the metric, shows that IBM is placing greater emphasis on transparency and accessibility of its reserve calculations, signaling a more user‑friendly and transparent reporting approach between the two years.",

Quantitatively, all page numbers (19 and 29), years referenced (2023, 2022, 2021 in Schedule II), and structural changes (standalone section with Table of Contents entry) match the ground truth. The conclusion about increased transparency aligns perfectly. Minor qualitative differences include the LLM's omission of explicit 'temporal label specifying years ended December 31' and 'units in millions' phrasing, though these are implied through context. The multi-hop reasoning is sound, correctly synthesizing structural changes across filings to infer reporting approach shifts.

      "question": "How did the value of Mastercard's settlement assets evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this change indicate about the company's settlement activities?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Mastercard described settlement assets as balances arising from settlement activities among participants in its payment systems, with settlement generally completed on a same-day basis. By 2024, the company reported settlement assets at $1,821 million as of December 31, 2024, up from $1,233 million as of December 31, 2023. This represents an increase of $588 million, or approximately 47.7%, indicating a significant expansion in the company's settlement activities or a change in the timing or volume of transactions settled across its multi-rail payments network.",
      "llm_answer": "\nMastercard’s settlement‑asset balance rose from **$1,233 million in 2023 to $1,821 million in 2024** – an increase of roughly **$588 million (≈48 %)**.  This growth reflects a larger amount of funds that the company is holding or advancing in connection with its same‑day and multi‑rail settlement activities, signalling expanded transaction volume and a deeper use of its payments‑network infrastructure.  The 2022 filing (Chunk 1) explains that such balances arise from the company’s settlement‑asset/obligation operations and can fluctuate with the timing of fund movements, so the upward trend from 2023 to 2024 indicates that Mastercard’s settlement activities have intensified, with more funds being posted or received in advance of final settlement.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, service revenue was directly and positively impacted by a 15% growth in nominal payments volume. By 2024, the relationship evolved such that service revenue in a given quarter became primarily assessed based on nominal payments volume in the prior quarter, indicating a shift from a concurrent to a lagged dependency model. This shows a structural change in how nominal payments volume influences service revenue over time.",
      "llm_answer": "\nFrom 2022 through 2024 Visa’s service revenue has moved in step with the growth of **nominal payments volume**, a 15 % increase in that metric being cited as the primary driver of the rise in service revenues in 2022 (Chunk 1). Because service revenue for a reporting period is **assessed on the nominal payments volume reported in the prior quarter**, the 2024 service revenue is calculated from the June 30 2024 volume supplied by financial‑institution clients and reflected in the September 30 2024 results (Chunk 2). Consequently, revenue recognition is lagged by one quarter and depends directly on the prior‑period volume—total nominal volume, which combines nominal payments volume and cash volume and is subject to Visa’s review—providing the basis for that timing and dependency.",

The LLM accurately describes the upward trajectory from 2021 through 2024, which aligns with the original answer's focus on 2022-2024 evolution since the 2022 value was explicitly stated to use 2021 data. (2) Quantitative accuracy is flawless: $51.86B = $51,860M (matches original $51,861M with rounding), $64.92B = $64,920M (matches original $64,919M with rounding). The LLM also correctly incorporates additional risk mitigation data ($7.71B to $13.47B) from the knowledge graph that supports the same conclusion about expanding net exposure despite mitigation efforts. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes exposure figures across time periods and correctly infers the relationship between gross exposure, mitigation arrangements, and residual risk. The slight framing difference (starting from 2021 vs. 2022) is justified since the original answer explicitly tied the 2022 value to 2021 data.

Additionally, an indirect customer purchasing through system integrators and distributors, including Customer A, was estimated to represent approximately 19% of total revenue. By fiscal year 2024, the Compute & Networking segment played a central role in the increase in U.S.-based revenue, which accounted for a growing share of NVIDIA's total revenue. This indicates a shift where the segment not only remained a key revenue driver but also became more integral to growth in a major geographic market.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Broadcom's strategic focus was primarily on expanding through large-scale acquisitions, as evidenced by the $53.4 billion acquisition of VMware, which included both cash and stock. This acquisition was followed by the divestiture of VMware’s EUC business for $3.5 billion in 2024, indicating a shift toward consolidating VMware’s core assets. In 2024, Broadcom refined its strategy by acquiring Seagate’s SoC operations for $600 million, specifically to strengthen its portfolio of semiconductor products. This represents a shift from broad enterprise software integration in 2023 to a more targeted approach focused on enhancing its semiconductor capabilities in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBroadcom deepened its **Semiconductor Solutions Segment** in 2023 by acquiring **VMware** (a $30.8 billion cash‑and‑stock deal) while still generating the bulk of its revenue from semiconductor devices, and in early 2024 it **sold VMware’s end‑user computing business to KKR for $3.5 billion**, effectively divesting the non‑core EUC unit.  It then **allocated $600 million to acquire Seagate’s SoC operations** (Chunk 2), with the purchase‑price allocation placing the resulting goodwill in the Semiconductor Solutions Segment, signaling a clear shift from a broad software‑hardware expansion toward a focused investment in semiconductor‑centric growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was primarily driven by volume licensing of the Windows operating system and advanced security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on Software Assurance and the number of information workers in licensed enterprises. By 2023, the composition expanded to include a more pronounced focus on cloud services, as reflected in the explicit categorization of 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth' as a tracked metric. This indicates a strategic evolution toward integrating cloud-based offerings more prominently into the Windows Commercial portfolio, moving beyond traditional licensing. While specific dollar figures aren't provided, the shift is evident in how Microsoft now highlights cloud services alongside traditional volume licensing, suggesting a transformation in the revenue model with a stronger emphasis on recurring cloud-based revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBetween FY 2022 and FY 2023, Windows Commercial revenue moved from a PC‑centric, volume‑licensing‑driven model toward a larger share of cloud‑based offerings; the FY 2022 filing notes that this revenue “includes volume licensing of the Windows operating system and Windows cloud services such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint” and is driven mainly by commercial demand for volume‑licensing and Software Assurance (and by the number of information‑worker seats rather than PC shipments), while the FY 2023 table explicitly reports “Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growth” and defines it as “comprising volume licensing of the Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial offerings,” showing a measurable increase in that segment’s growth.

This represents a $0.5 billion or approximately 26% increase in restricted funds. The increase suggests a more conservative liquidity strategy in 2024, with a greater portion of cash being set aside for specific purposes, potentially to mitigate credit and settlement exposures or to meet regulatory or contractual obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by a competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which led to a decline in both platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven primarily by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume compared to 2023. This indicates a strategic shift toward premium product offerings in the data center space.",
      "llm_answer": "\nIntel’s DCAI revenue grew ~1 % in 2024 versus 2023, breaking the multi‑year decline that the 2023 risk‑factor discussion had linked to “the shift of customer spend toward GPUs” and heightened competition from GPU‑centric rivals.  The modest upside was driven by server‑focused CPUs with higher core‑counts that lifted ASPs (even as unit volumes fell) and by Intel’s product‑road‑map that emphasized data‑center workloads, a dynamic highlighted in the 2024 MD&A where DCAI’s “higher server revenue primarily from high core‑count products” offset broader revenue softness.  This shift occurred as Intel simultaneously executed its 2024 restructuring and foundry‑operating‑model overhaul, reallocating resources toward high‑core‑count server silicon while the overall company saw a slight revenue dip and significant non‑cash impairments.",

      "question": "How did the trend in CCG revenue evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what were the key factors driving the change in performance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, CCG revenue decreased by 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year. In 2024, CCG revenue increased by 4% driven primarily by higher notebook volume compared to 2023, although this was partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to weaker demand and a decline in other CCG revenue from the exit of legacy businesses. The turnaround from a decline in 2023 to growth in 2024 indicates a recovery in notebook demand and strategic adjustments in the product portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "\nIntel disclosed that CCG revenue fell 8% to $54.2 billion in 2023 but rose about 4% to roughly $56 billion in 2024, even though total revenue slipped 2% to $53.1 billion, with other revenue down 32% and Intel Foundry external revenue down 60%. The 2023 decline was driven by lower notebook and desktop volumes, weaker demand and ASP compression across segments, while the 2024 rebound stemmed from higher notebook shipments, higher desktop ASPs from a commercial/gaming mix, and stronger server revenue in DCAI, trends that are captured by the disclosed CCG metric. At the same time, 2024 results were shaped by the new internal foundry operating model, $3.3 billion of asset impairments, $3.1 billion of goodwill impairments, $9.9 billion of tax‑valuation allowances, a $2.8 billion restructuring charge, and continued investment of $16.5 billion in R&D and $25.1 billion in capital.",

Quantitative accuracy is slightly reduced due to unverified dollar amounts and additional metrics (e.g., total revenue -2%, foundry revenue -60%) not tied to the question. Qualitative accuracy suffers because the LLM added unmentioned factors (ASP compression, DCAI server revenue) and omitted key original factors (legacy business exit impact in 2024). Contextual relevance remains high as the core trend and multi-year comparison were addressed, but excessive unrelated details (impairments, R&D spend) diluted focus.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel had an unrecognized commitment to fund $29.0 billion as its share of Arizona Fab LLC's total construction costs, and the company consolidated Arizona Fab into its financial statements as a VIE. By 2024, Intel entered into a Purchase and Contribution Agreement with Arizona Fab LLC in August 2022 (amended in November 2022), which formalized the structure of the joint venture and Intel’s ongoing involvement. Additionally, in 2024, Arizona Fab LLC was referenced in the context of legal filings and agreements incorporated by reference, indicating a shift from primarily financial disclosure to contractual and governance-based documentation of the relationship.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBetween 2023 and 2024 Intel’s financial exposure to Arizona Fab LLC deepened through its $29 billion unrecognized obligation to fund the joint‑venture’s construction costs and the $4.8 billion of property, plant and equipment recorded for the VIE as of December 30 2023, with Intel remaining the primary beneficiary and operator subject to minimum wafer‑start and inventory‑control requirements. Legally, the relationship was solidified by the 2022 formation documents and subsequently updated by the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement of Arizona Fab LLC (Exhibit 10.13) and, in June 2024, by the Purchase and Sale Agreement (Exhibit 10.14) that introduced new financing and ownership‑transfer provisions. The same 10‑K filing also documents Intel’s parallel consolidation of Mobileye’s results and the 2023 sale of a 32 % stake in IMS, illustrating that the Arizona Fab evolution is part of a broader pattern of VIE‑based co‑investments disclosed across all provided chunks.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 44.6%, while in 2024 it decreased to 37.9%. This indicates a decline in profitability relative to revenue, suggesting potential challenges in cost management or a reduction in pricing power during the period.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Visa's U.S. Consumer Debit Volume was $2,617 billion, representing a 10% increase from the prior year. In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. Consumer Debit Volume grew to $2,826 billion, reflecting a 6% increase compared to the previous year. This indicates that while the segment continued to grow, the rate of growth slowed down from 10% in 2022 to 6% in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBased on Visa’s FY 2022 filing (Chunk 1, V_10k_2022.pdf, p. 39) the U.S. consumer‑debit volume was **$2.388 bn**, and Visa’s FY 2023 filing (Chunk 2, V_10k_2023.pdf, p. 43) shows it grew to **$2.826 bn**, a **≈18 %** year‑over‑year increase (up from the 10 % growth seen between FY 2021‑2022). This acceleration—from a 10 % rise in the prior year to nearly 18 % in the latest year—indicates that Visa is gaining momentum in its U.S. debit franchise, expanding transaction volume and reinforcing the strength of its core payments platform.

      "question": "How did the composition and geographic distribution of PayPal's transaction revenues evolve between 2022 and 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal's transaction revenues were primarily driven by net transaction fees charged to merchants based on TPV, with additional fees from currency conversion, cross-border transactions, instant fund transfers, and cryptocurrency transactions. Management emphasized TPV growth and the number of payment transactions as key indicators of platform strength and customer engagement. In 2023, PayPal provided a more detailed geographic breakdown of revenues, categorizing transaction revenues by primary geographical markets, although specific dollar amounts or percentages by region were not disclosed in the provided excerpt. This evolution indicates a shift toward more structured revenue transparency, particularly by geography, while maintaining the same core revenue drivers.",
      "llm_answer": "\nPayPal reports transaction revenues as net fees tied to total payment volume (TPV) and the number of payment transactions—a link emphasized in the 2022 filing where growth was driven by TPV and shaped by the mix of merchants, products, domestic versus cross‑border activity, and geographic region; the 2023 filing builds on this by disaggregating revenue by primary geographical market and revenue category, revealing that transaction revenues now span multiple regions and carry a larger share of cross‑border, currency‑conversion and crypto‑related fees, indicating an evolved composition and a more diversified geographic distribution.",

      "question": "How has the regulatory framework governing the relationship between Wells Fargo's Parent company and its subsidiary banks evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo's Parent company was subject to federal banking laws that limited covered transactions with its subsidiary banks to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in aggregate, with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length terms. Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe 2023 regulatory framework for Wells Fargo’s parent‑subsidiary relationship was built around federal “covered‑transaction” caps—no single affiliate could receive more than 10 % of a subsidiary’s capital and surplus and the aggregate could not exceed 20 %—and the FRB’s source‑of‑strength duty, which allowed the holding company to be compelled to support its banks and gave the OCC authority to order a capital assessment or a stock‑sale if a bank’s capital became impaired.  \n\nIn 2024 the framework broadened with a Support Agreement that obligates an intermediate holding company to fund the parent through subordinated notes and a committed line of credit, and includes automatic forgiveness of those instruments (and a ban on dividend payments) if predefined liquidity or capital metrics fall below trigger levels or if the parent files for bankruptcy, while the FRB now requires annual capital‑plan filings that explicitly restrict dividend and share‑repurchase distributions and applies heightened GSIB capital surcharges and stress‑test‑driven distribution limits.  \n\nThese developments occur within the continuing Dodd‑Frank/Basel III regime that imposes leverage, supplementary‑leverage and liquidity‑coverage ratios on the parent and its insured depository institutions, and the FDIC’s assessment and termination powers remain a systemic‑risk factor for the group.",

In 2023, the provisions began at $424 million, with additions increasing to $500 million and write-offs at $456 million, leading to an ending balance of $480 million.

However, there was a notable change in the method of filing related to the consent of auditors: in 2023, the consent was filed under KPMG LLP, while in 2024, it was filed under KPMGLLP. This suggests a possible change in the legal or operational structure of the auditing entity involved, which could indicate an internal restructuring or a shift in service providers. However, no explicit changes to the list of primary subsidiaries themselves were disclosed in the provided exhibits for either year.",

No new subsidiary is listed in the 2024 filing; the only evolution is the removal of the “18 BNY Mellon” exhibit reference that appeared in 2023 and the addition of unrelated exhibits (e.g., 19.1 Insider‑Trading Policies, 101.CAL), indicating a shift in ancillary disclosures rather than a structural change in BK’s subsidiary composition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, variable rebates and incentives were a portion of total net revenue of $25.1 billion, while in 2024, this figure increased to $28.2 billion. The methodology for estimating these rebates remained consistent, based on customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds, forecasted transactions, card issuance, and historical experience.

The audit procedures also remained consistent, emphasizing the significance and complexity of estimating these incentives.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe Company (MA) continues to record variable rebates and incentives only when volume‑ or transaction‑based revenue is recognized, estimating the amount from forecasted transactions, card‑issuance and conversion volumes, expected payments and historical performance – the same judgment‑heavy approach described in both the 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings.  However, the estimated dollar impact of these rebates/incentives rose from **$25.1 billion of net revenue in 2023** to **$28.2 billion in 2024**, reflecting a larger revenue base and more extensive use of variable consideration, and auditors (PwC) explicitly tested the reasonableness of those estimates and compared them to actual customer performance as part of the critical audit matter.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed that liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using present value of expected benefits and premiums, with key assumptions including mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns. The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities. This indicates a shift from a primarily actuarial estimation approach in 2022 to a more risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "\nFrom 2022 to 2024 MET’s accounting treatment of Future Policy Benefit liabilities remained rooted in present‑value calculations that rely on assumptions about mortality, lapse, renewal, investment returns and discount rates (Chunk 1), but the 2024 disclosures reveal that prolonged low‑interest‑rate environments and volatile investment returns have materially heightened the interest‑rate sensitivity of those liabilities—necessitating larger reserves, creating asset/liability mismatches, and exposing the company to greater volatility in liability values when market yields or credit spreads shift (Chunk 2). Consequently, while the 2022 methodology set liabilities based on expected experience and investment performance, the 2024 risk exposure shows that declining rates and uncertain investment returns can inflate the present‑value of future obligations and compress investment spreads, directly affecting both the magnitude of the liabilities and the profitability of MET.",

Both years continue to disclose the identical list of significant subsidiaries (Item 21.1) and the same Amended and Restated General Guarantee Agreements (Items 10.48‑10.49), showing that the evolution is defined by the introduction of carried‑interest incentive paperwork and updated compensation‑recovery provisions rather than a restructuring of the core award agreement categories.",

The original answer explicitly states that older forms (10.35, 10.36, 10.44) were no longer listed in 2024, indicating structural changes rather than mere additions. Quantitative accuracy suffers because the LLM omits specific 2023 forms being replaced and mischaracterizes the continuity of templates.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Express described Discount Revenue as being internally allocated using a transfer pricing methodology across business segments, with specific breakdowns for issuer, network, and acquirer components. This treatment emphasized internal financial structuring and did not highlight external risks to Discount Revenue. By 2024, the focus had transformed significantly, with Discount Revenue now being described in the context of external risks, including exposure to the airline industry, which accounted for 7% of worldwide billed business. The filing explicitly stated that financial distress or operational failures in such industries could negatively impact Discount Revenue and overall financial performance. This marks a shift from purely internal allocation to a broader concern over external risk exposure affecting revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "\nAmerican Express still allocates discount revenue across its reportable segments by means of a transfer‑pricing methodology—issuer‑based in the GCSG and GCS segments and network/acquirer‑based in the GMNS segment—while the 2024 filing adds a new external risk: airline‑related purchases now account for roughly 7 % of worldwide billed business, and the company may have to absorb losses if airlines default, directly threatening the discount‑revenue stream it previously measured only through internal allocation.

In 2024, however, the total revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased to $17,766 million from $15,563 million in 2023.

      "question": "How has the valuation methodology and disclosure around Texas Instruments' nonmarketable investments evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of measurement basis and risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, measured at cost with no changes mentioned during the year. The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "\nTexas Instruments continues to record its non‑marketable investments at cost and only adjusts them for observable price changes or impairments—an approach that was already disclosed for the 2023 $5 million non‑marketable stake (and the $17 million equity‑method interest) shown in long‑term investments—and the 2024 filing retains this cost‑basis treatment, explicitly stating that such securities are not marked‑to‑market and that resulting gains or losses flow through other income; additionally, the 2024 disclosure expands the risk discussion to highlight heightened counterparty and credit‑risk concentrations from cash deposits, short‑term investments and issuer exposures.",

      "original_answer": "Broadcom significantly evolved its strategic positioning in the Infrastructure Software Segment between 2023 and 2024. In 2023, the company completed the acquisition of VMware for approximately $30.8 billion in cash and $53.4 billion in Broadcom common stock, signaling a major expansion into enterprise software. However, in 2024, Broadcom divested VMware's End-User Computing (EUC) business to KKR & Co. Inc. for $3.5 billion, indicating a strategic refocus toward core infrastructure software assets. This shift demonstrates a transformation in Broadcom's approach from broad enterprise software expansion to a more focused infrastructure software strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBroadcom deepened its presence in the Infrastructure Software segment by acquiring VMware in November 2023 (a $30.8 billion cash‑and‑stock transaction) and, in 2024, added Seagate’s SoC business for $600 million, while simultaneously divesting VMware’s end‑user‑computing unit to KKR for $3.5 billion in July 2024—an move that shifts the company’s software focus from broader end‑user offerings toward core infrastructure‑software and related hardware‑software integration.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Semiconductor Solutions Segment was characterized by robust profitability driven by supply imbalances, ongoing supply chain constraints, and a broad range of semiconductor devices used in various end-products. By fiscal year 2023, following the completion of the VMware acquisition in November 2023, Broadcom's business composition shifted significantly, with greater strategic emphasis on infrastructure software. The acquisition of VMware, which brought approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split-adjusted basis) in value, marked a transformation in Broadcom's strategic focus, integrating semiconductor solutions with expanded software capabilities. This evolution indicates a shift from semiconductor-driven profitability to a more diversified technology portfolio with increased emphasis on software solutions.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBetween fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 Broadcom continued to **operate in the Semiconductor Solutions segment** (AVGO → Semiconductor Solutions Segment), but the company’s strategic focus shifted from a cash‑generating, shareholder‑return‑driven semiconductor business to a combined semiconductor‑and‑infrastructure‑software platform.  \n\n- In the 2022 filing the firm highlighted strong cash from operations, dividends and stock‑repurchases while noting that its **two reportable segments were semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software**, and it was pursuing the pending $61 bn acquisition of VMware to bolster the latter.  \n- By the 2023 filing the acquisition had closed, VMware’s results were now **consolidated** and the press release explicitly stated that Broadcom bought VMware “to enhance our infrastructure software capabilities,” indicating that the **infrastructure‑software segment had become a larger, strategic pillar** alongside the still‑core semiconductor solutions business.  \n\nThus, the evolution is characterized by a **strategic pivot toward integrating and expanding the infrastructure‑software segment (via VMware) while maintaining semiconductor solutions as a foundational, operating segment**.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that foreign currency exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities were recorded in other income (expense), net, and partially offset by gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge these exposures. Additionally, PayPal mentioned a matured net investment hedge from 2020, with its gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the foreign subsidiary was sold or liquidated. By 2023, PayPal expanded its disclosure to clarify that foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were included in other, net, along with forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and fair value changes on non-hedging derivative contracts. The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts. This evolution indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to disclosing foreign exchange exposures and their financial effects.",

This decline follows the upward movement from **$418 million in 2021** (the ending balance shown for 2021 in Chunk 1) to the 2022 level, indicating that IBM deliberately trimmed its credit‑loss reserve—driven by lower additions and larger write‑offs—so that its expected credit‑risk exposure was markedly lower over the 2022‑2024 period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GDV was reported with a focus on the impact of currency translation and transactional currency, specifically highlighting that GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased 10.4% compared to 11.9% on a local currency basis versus 2022. In 2024, the presentation of GDV became more standardized, with an explicit statement that U.S. dollar-converted GDV figures are calculated using quarterly average exchange rates, and the emphasis shifted to reporting period-over-period growth rates based on local currency data to eliminate currency fluctuation effects. The 2024 disclosure formalized the methodology and removed specific comparative growth figures, suggesting a more methodological and consistent approach to GDV reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "\nGross Dollar Volume is still defined as the total dollar‑value of Mastercard‑branded activity, but the 2024 filing tightens the conversion method: GDV is now calculated by converting local‑currency spending to USD (and euros) with a **quarter‑by‑quarter average exchange rate** for each currency, whereas the 2023 discussion only referenced “average exchange rates for the period.”  The company reports growth **separately on a U.S.‑dollar‑converted basis and on a local‑currency basis**—for example, USD‑converted GDV rose 10.4 % in 2023 (5.9 % in 2022) while local‑currency GDV rose 11.9 % in 2023 (12.3 % in 2022)—so the USD‑converted growth reflects both volume and currency movement, and the local‑currency growth isolates pure volume change.

The decline was driven by weaker notebook and desktop volumes, a higher mix of older‑generation and small‑core products that compressed ASPs, and inventory correction across market segments, while Intel simultaneously invested $16 billion in R&D and $25.8 billion in capital expenditures, generating $11.5 billion of cash from operations but posting a negative $(11.9) billion adjusted free‑cash‑flow.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM highlighted the risk of intangible asset impairment primarily in the context of acquisitions not yielding expected economic benefits, which could result in charges to the Consolidated Income Statement. By 2024, the company reiterated this risk but placed additional emphasis on broader strategic transformation efforts, including the use of automation and AI to drive productivity and growth. This suggests that while the core risk of impairment remained, it became more closely tied to transformational initiatives and their success in delivering expected value. The evolution indicates a shift from a general acquisition risk to a more strategic and operational context.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBoth the 2022 and 2024 10‑K filings flag goodwill and amortizable intangible assets as items that “may become impaired,” so IBM’s exposure to an impairment charge is present in each year. However, the 2024 filing broadens the risk landscape—adding macro‑economic, global‑regulatory, AI‑cloud, data‑privacy and internal‑control uncertainties—while the 2022 filing ties the impairment risk more narrowly to acquisition‑related goodwill, skilled‑employee shortages, supplier disruptions, product‑quality issues and government‑contract dependencies. Consequently, IBM’s exposure to intangible‑asset impairment has grown from a focused acquisition‑driven risk in 2022 to a more diversified set of operational and regulatory factors in 2024.",

By 2024, Intel entered into a Purchase and Contribution Agreement and an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement with Arizona Fab LLC, suggesting a formalization and potential shift in the financial and governance structure of the relationship, although full operational control remained.

The 2023 filing repeats and expands this risk, again linking product defects in the automotive sector to **inventory write‑downs, recalls, indemnification obligations and other expenses** that could materially harm its results; thus, the disclosure shows a consistent but increasingly emphasized concern that defective inventory write‑downs remain a key financial exposure tied to the automotive industry.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD reported a licensing gain of $102 million, while in 2024, the company recorded a licensing gain of $48 million. This indicates a significant decrease in revenue from licensing arrangements over the two-year period. The decline suggests that AMD may have experienced a reduction in royalty income or milestone payments from its intellectual property agreements, such as those with the THATIC JV, which were previously a source of licensing gain.",
      "llm_answer": "\nAMD’s licensing‑gain line, which the company records as a FIN_METRIC that it discloses in operating income, fell to **$102 million in 2022, $34 million in 2023 and $48 million in 2024** (all shown in parentheses in the consolidated statements), marking a sharp drop from the $60 million gain booked in 2019 and the $12 million gain recorded in 2021.  This evolution—driven by the royalty stream from the THATIC joint‑venture and tempered by the 2019 U.S. Entity‑List restrictions—shows that revenue from AMD’s intellectual‑property licensing arrangements has become increasingly marginal within the firm’s overall earnings.",

In 2024, these figures increased to $1,615 million in current loans, $110 million in 30-89 days delinquent, and $45 million in 90+ days past due. This indicates a moderate increase in both delinquency categories, suggesting a slight rise in credit risk exposure over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe 2024 10‑K shows that American Express’s Card Member Loans classified as “Current” grew from $2.785 bn (2023) to $2.863 bn (2024), while the 30‑89‑day delinquency bucket slipped from $231 m to $220 m but the 90+‑day delinquency rose from $73 m to $89 m, taking total delinquent exposure from roughly $304 m to $309 m.  This evolution reflects the pattern described in Chunk 1—revolving Card Member balances are recorded as current unless they enter long‑term modification programs that push them into the “due after one year” category—so the modest uptick in the most severe delinquency tier signals a slight increase in credit‑risk exposure for Amex despite an overall stable loan portfolio.

It also noted that failure to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends could limit capital return to shareholders. In 2023, the disclosure evolved to emphasize that the ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the Board's discretion and may be limited by U.S. banking laws, Delaware law, and the failure to pay full and timely preferred stock dividends. The 2023 disclosure added more regulatory and governance context compared to the more operationally-focused 2022 version.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Visa reported a 25% year-over-year increase in U.S. Consumer Credit Volume, rising from $1,641 billion to $2,047 billion, while the 2024 filing shows a much slower growth rate of 6%, with U.S. Consumer Credit Volume increasing from $2,230 billion in 2023 to $2,355 billion in 2024. This indicates a significant moderation in the rate of credit volume growth over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBased on the 2022 figures in Chunk 1, Visa’s U.S. consumer‑credit volume was $2,047 bn (a 25 % YoY increase) and its international consumer‑credit volume was $2,684 bn (a 12 % YoY increase). By 2024 (Chunk 2) those volumes had risen to $2,355 bn in the U.S. (6 % YoY growth) and $2,959 bn internationally (5 % YoY growth), showing that the annual growth rates fell from roughly 25 %/12 % to about 6 %/5 % over the two‑year span.

      "question": "How did AMD's licensing gain from the THATIC joint venture evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about milestone achievements and royalty income during these periods?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD recognized $102 million in licensing gain from a milestone achievement and royalty income under the THATIC JV agreement. In contrast, in 2023, the licensing gain from royalty income was significantly lower at $34 million, with no mention of milestone-related gains. This indicates a decline in licensing revenue, primarily due to the absence of milestone achievements in 2023 despite continued royalty income.",
      "llm_answer": "\nAMD’s licensing gain from the THATIC joint venture fell sharply from **$102 million in 2022** (which consisted of a milestone‑achievement payment plus royalties) to **$34 million in 2023** (royalties only), indicating that the large lump‑sum milestone was recognized in 2022 and no comparable milestone was reached the following year; the 2023 amount reflects only ongoing royalty income, and the modest rise in the investment’s carrying value to $99 million (from $83 million) confirms that the venture remains active but now generates a smaller, steady royalty stream rather than a one‑time milestone payment.",

      "question": "How did the amortization of purchased intangible assets recognized in operating expenses evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Cisco's investment in intangible assets?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Cisco reported $282 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets within operating expenses, while in 2024, this figure rose significantly to $698 million. This indicates a substantial increase in Cisco's investment in intangible assets, likely driven by acquisitions and the subsequent amortization of those acquired assets.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe amortization of purchased intangible assets that is recorded within operating expenses jumped from **$282 million in fiscal 2023** (as shown in the 2023 10‑K table) to **$698 million in fiscal 2024** (the 2024 10‑K table), an increase of **$416 million or roughly 148 %**.  This sharp rise—while only modestly amplified by the ≈$30 million foreign‑currency boost noted in the 2023 filing—reflects Cisco’s heavier investment in acquired intangible assets, especially the Splunk acquisition and other strategic purchases, indicating a strategic shift toward expanding its portfolio of technology and intellectual‑property rights.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions of $7.2 billion related to affordable housing and other projects, with additional investments not expected to be significant. By 2024, the unfunded capital contributions increased to $7.5 billion, continuing the pattern of manageable expected commitments. This indicates a relatively stable investment strategy in affordable housing, with no significant escalation in contingent obligations despite an increase in total equity investments from $15.8 billion in 2023 to $16.7 billion in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe Corporation’s disclosed “potential obligation to invest additional amounts” in affordable‑housing projects rose only modestly from 2023 to 2024 – unfunded capital contributions grew from **$7.2 billion** (2023) to **$7.5 billion** (2024), and the language in both 2023 and 2024 filings notes that any further investments “have not been and are not expected to be significant.”  At the same time, tax‑credit recognition from affordable‑housing equity investments increased from **$1.9 billion** in 2023 to **$2.2 billion** in 2024, indicating that the firm is expanding its exposure through tax‑credit‑qualified projects while keeping incremental cash outlays limited.

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's approach to capital distributions evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of regulatory constraints and internal liquidity mechanisms?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo emphasized the Federal Reserve's requirement for large bank holding companies (BHCs) to submit annual capital plans, including planned capital distributions such as dividends, and compliance with Basel III capital requirements, leverage ratios, and capital surcharges for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Failure to meet these could limit capital distributions. By 2024, the company introduced a new internal liquidity mechanism through the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC), which imposed restrictions on dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if bankruptcy proceedings are authorized. This indicates a shift from purely regulatory constraints to a combination of regulatory and internal structural limitations on capital distributions.",
      "llm_answer": "\nWells Fargo’s capital‑distribution policy moved from a 2023 focus on FRB‑mandated annual capital plans, Basel III and G‑SIB capital surcharges that directly capped dividend and share‑repurchase amounts, to a 2024 framework in which those distributions are now tied to a contingent internal liquidity structure; under the Support Agreement the parent can only pay dividends so long as defined capital‑and‑liquidity metrics remain above trigger levels, otherwise the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the committed credit line would end and dividend‑paying ability would be restricted, potentially accelerating bankruptcy.  Consequently, while the 2023 constraints were purely supervisory (Basel III, leverage ratios, FRB‑enhanced supervision), the 2024 approach adds a self‑reinforcing liquidity mechanism—subordinated notes, a credit line and recovery‑plan‑driven triggers—that both reflects and reinforces the same regulatory limits but makes dividend and repurchase decisions conditional on the firm‑wide support arrangement.",

These loans were positioned as a stable and integral part of the company's financial model. By 2023, however, the narrative shifted as the company noted increasing risks to Card Member Loans due to external pressures such as heightened competition, the rise of alternative financing products like buy now, pay later services, and macroeconomic disruptions including natural disasters affecting key states like Florida and California.

In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, decreased by $122 million, and concluded at $577 million. This indicates a shift from an increasing trend in inventory risk provisions in 2023 to a reduction in 2024, suggesting improved inventory risk management or a strategic adjustment in provisioning.",

In 2024 the company added **$122 million** of new provisions but recorded **$199 million** of write‑offs (and a modest foreign‑currency adjustment), resulting in a net decline of the reserve despite the added provisions.  This contraction signals that IBM is **tightening its inventory‑risk reserve**, writing down more stock than it adds to the allowance—likely reflecting improved inventory turnover or a strategic reassessment of obsolescence risk—so the lower allowance indicates a more conservative, risk‑aware approach to managing its inventory balances.",

The LLM's interpretation of the 2024 change is more mathematically coherent but diverges from the original answer's phrasing.

This progression reflects a deepening integration of credit‑risk considerations into the firm’s liquidity framework, as captured by the KG relationship ORG → Credit Line Utilization ← ORG, which underscores that the company’s liquidity (credit‑line) metric is a core financial indicator governing its credit‑risk exposure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the U.S. Defined Benefit plan's asset allocation was targeted between 65% to 80% in fixed income securities and cash equivalents, and 20% to 35% in equity securities. By 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed specific funding obligations showing $70 million allocated for 2024, decreasing to $56 million in 2028, with $207 million projected for 2029–2033. This indicates a strategic reduction in near-term funding with a significant long-term liability remaining, suggesting a shift toward managing future pension obligations over immediate funding increases.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe U.S. Defined Benefit plan’s funding obligations fall from $72 million in 2025 to $56 million in 2028, then aggregate to a $207 million liability for 2029‑2033 (as shown in the 2023 schedule), reflecting a short‑term decline but a sizable long‑term pension commitment for Texas Instruments. This evolution is underpinned by the plan’s asset mix—65‑80 % fixed‑income and 20‑35 % equity securities (Chunk 1)—which provides the financial base that supports the projected cash‑outflows and signals the company’s ongoing, multi‑year responsibility to fund retiree benefits.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon referenced 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis' and 'Executive Compensation Tables and Other Compensation Disclosures' as part of the Proxy sections under 'Item 2 - Advisory Vote on Compensation,' indicating a structured linkage between executive pay and shareholder input. In 2023, the company expanded this integration by explicitly emphasizing 'Compensation Discussion & Analysis' and 'Executive Compensation Tables and Other Compensation Disclosures' within the same Proxy sections, using enhanced formatting (e.g., the use of ampersands and spacing) to highlight the alignment between executive compensation reporting and shareholder advisory vote processes. This evolution suggests a more deliberate effort to present compensation governance in direct relation to shareholder engagement mechanisms.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software segment was primarily a recipient of internal capital allocation through business acquisitions, with $110 million allocated to intangible assets from acquisitions completed during that year. By fiscal year 2024, the relationship had transformed significantly, with the segment being explicitly positioned as a strategic pillar of the company's broader infrastructure technology offerings.

      "llm_answer": "\nBetween fiscal 2022 and 2024 Broadcom shifted the Infrastructure Software segment from a one‑time acquisition push—where FY 2022’s four deals represented $245 million of consideration, with $164 million of goodwill and $110 million of intangible assets recorded “primarily within our infrastructure software segment”—to a core strategic pillar, as reflected in the FY 2024 MD&A that treats the segment as a key reportable line (alongside semiconductors) and ties its growth to the company’s 53‑week fiscal year, which generated higher net revenue, gross‑margin dollars, R&D and SG&A expenses.

In the 2023 filing the company added a clear disclosure that the net charge‑off **rate** is calculated by dividing net charge‑offs by average loans held for investment for each loan category, thereby enhancing transparency around both credit‑quality metrics and the underlying calculation methodology.

However, in 2024, TPV is described as a key performance metric showing strong growth, with TPV increasing by 10% compared to 2023, reaching $1.68 trillion.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Cisco indicated that if it could not enter a market timely with internally developed products, it would pursue technology purchases or licenses, or consider partnerships and acquisitions as an alternative to internal R&D. This suggests a strategic openness to acquiring intangible assets. By 2023, the company reported that amortization of purchased intangible assets had a negative 0.9% impact on product gross margin, indicating that prior acquisitions (and their associated intangible assets) had matured into a measurable financial impact. The presence of this amortization effect in 2023 reflects that Cisco had indeed pursued such acquisitions, consistent with its 2022 stated strategy, and that these acquired assets were now being amortized as part of ongoing operations.",
      "llm_answer": "\nCisco’s 2022 strategy explicitly shifted toward acquisitions – it said it might “purchase or license technology” or “acquire businesses” rather than rely on internal R&D – and by 2023 the amortization of those purchased intangibles was disclosed as a 0.9 % negative impact on product gross margin, showing how the acquired assets now directly affect profitability; the knowledge‑graph relationship confirms that Cisco is decreasing the amortization metric, which it itself discloses, marking the evolution from an acquisition‑driven growth model to a tangible margin drag.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, QCOM recognized $598 million of goodwill from eight acquisitions, which was primarily allocated to the QCT segment. Additionally, $202 million of intangible assets were recognized, primarily related to completed technology. By fiscal 2023, the QCT segment balance at the beginning of the year was $9,777 million, and acquisitions during the year added $76 million. By the end of fiscal 2023 (September 24, 2023), the QCT segment balance increased to $9,909 million, and further adjustments during the following period brought the balance to $10,065 million by September 29, 2024.

Consequently, the segment’s goodwill allocation increased by roughly $132 m (to $9.909 bn) and, after the FY 2023 acquisitions, reached $10.065 bn by the end of FY 2024, illustrating how successive acquisitions and related intangible‑asset valuations reshaped QCT’s goodwill and intangible‑asset composition.",

In 2024, the disclosures expanded to include $8 million in losses on foreclosed properties, down from $10 million in 2023, indicating improved asset management or reduced exposure.

In 2023, this language was expanded to include the phrase 'our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations [...] and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' This evolution indicates a more nuanced disclosure that retains the prior year's emphasis on preferred stock dividends as a limiting factor but adds a broader regulatory and governance context. This suggests the company is reinforcing the conditional nature of capital returns, particularly tied to preferred stock obligations, while emphasizing board discretion and regulatory constraints.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe 2022 filing warned that any shortfall in paying full and timely dividends on its preferred stock would constrain the firm’s ability to return capital to shareholders, linking dividend compliance directly to shareholder‑distribution plans, while the 2023 filing reiterates this constraint but adds that such returns are “subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors” and can be limited by regulatory capital‑planning rules and the need to maintain credit‑rating strength. Together, the disclosures show a deliberate, cautious stance: BNY Mellon ties any capital‑return initiative to the uninterrupted payment of preferred‑stock dividends and to compliance with capital‑adequacy regulations, signaling that the company prioritizes dividend coverage and regulatory safety over aggressive or discretionary shareholder payouts.",

      "question": "How has the methodology for determining the Single Equivalent Rate evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to the treatment of non-U.S. locations with sufficient corporate bond markets?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company disclosed that for non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality bonds, the discount rate was determined by discounting projected cash flows against a yield curve constructed using high-quality corporate bonds, from which a single equivalent rate was derived. In 2024, the company maintained the same general methodology but shifted terminology from 'discloses' to 'determines,' indicating a more active role in the selection process. While the core methodology remained consistent, the change in language suggests a more deliberate and controlled approach in 2024 compared to the descriptive disclosure in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe methodology for the Single Equivalent Rate is unchanged between 2023 and 2024 – TXN continues to disclose that the rate is the single discount rate that produces the same present value of the plan’s cash‑flows, and for non‑U.S. locations with a sufficiently deep corporate‑bond market it is derived by building a country‑specific yield curve from high‑quality corporate bonds and selecting the rate that equates the present value of those cash‑flows (the same approach described in both the 2023 and 2024 filings). If a non‑U.S. location lacks a sufficient corporate‑bond market, the rate is instead based on a government‑bond index, a practice that remains the same in both years.",

However, it introduced 'TXN' as the company reference, which was not present in the original answer (entity error). Critically, the LLM omitted the evolution in terminology from 'discloses' (2023) to 'determines' (2024), which the original answer highlighted as indicating a more active and deliberate approach in 2024. While the quantitative description of the methodology is accurate, the failure to address this key linguistic shift—a central aspect of the methodology's evolution—reduces the qualitative accuracy. The answer is contextually relevant but incomplete in capturing the nuanced changes in disclosure language.",

      "question": "How has the proportion of Oracle's cloud services revenues relative to total revenues evolved between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, and what strategic implications does this shift suggest?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, which increased to 37% in fiscal 2024. This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on cloud-based offerings and aligns with Oracle's corporate strategy of providing customer choice in deployment models. The increase suggests a successful pivot toward cloud adoption, with customer demand for Oracle Cloud Services rising and a corresponding decline in reliance on traditional revenue streams such as hardware and on-premise licenses.",
      "llm_answer": "\nBetween fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 the share of Oracle’s cloud‑services revenue rose from **32 % to 37 % of total revenue**—an increase of five percentage points—reflecting the company’s growing emphasis on cloud‑based licensing and support as disclosed in its 2024 filing.  This shift is underpinned by the constant‑currency growth in Oracle’s cloud and license business noted in the 2023 filing, which attributes the rise to higher cloud‑services and license‑support sales and to customer migrations to Oracle Cloud, while hardware and on‑premise license revenues declined.  Strategically, the rising proportion signals that cloud services are becoming a larger driver of revenue and margin, prompting Oracle to continue investing in cloud capacity, R&D, and geographic expansion to sustain the upward trend.",

Strategic implications about cloud adoption, declining traditional revenue streams, and investment in cloud infrastructure align with original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy verified: Percentages match exactly, and calculation of 5-point increase is correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: Synthesizes cloud revenue growth from 2023-2024 while connecting to strategic investments in R&D and geographic expansion.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, the Health & Public Service segment generated $12.6 billion in revenue, contributing 20% to the company's total revenues. In fiscal 2024, this segment's revenue increased to $13.8 billion, representing a $1.2 billion increase and a rise in its contribution to 21% of total revenues. This indicates a significant increase in both absolute and relative terms.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe Health & Public Service segment grew from **$12.6 bn (FY 2023)** to **$13.8 bn (FY 2024)** – an increase of **≈ $1.2 bn** – and its share of total revenues rose from **20 % (FY 2023)** to **21 % (FY 2024)**, i.e., **+1 percentage‑point**.

      "question": "How did the methodology for determining the single equivalent rate for non-U.S. defined benefit plans evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what specific change in terminology indicates a shift in approach?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the methodology for non-U.S. defined benefit plans involved discounting projected cash flows against a yield curve to develop a present value, from which the single equivalent rate was derived. In 2023, the description remained largely the same, but the language shifted from 'a present value is developed' to 'simulate a portfolio that would provide cash flows sufficient to pay the plan's expected benefit payments when due' in the U.S. context, indicating a more explicit alignment of the U.S. and non-U.S. methodologies. While the core approach for non-U.S. plans did not change, the 2023 filing introduced more descriptive language about simulating a bond portfolio, suggesting a refinement in communication rather than a substantive change in method.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe 2022 filing first introduced the practice of selecting a **single equivalent rate** for non‑U.S. defined‑benefit plans by discounting each plan’s projected cash‑flows against a country‑specific high‑quality corporate‑bond yield curve and then choosing the rate that yields the same present value. In the 2023 filing the same quantitative approach is retained, but the language is refined—where the 2022 text said the portfolio is “designed to **provide** cash‑flows sufficient to pay benefits,” the 2023 text describes it as “designed to **simulate** a portfolio that would provide cash‑flows sufficient,” thereby signaling a shift toward an explicit simulation of the cash‑flow‑generating portfolio. This terminological change—from “provide” to “simulate”—marks the evolution in approach while the underlying metric remains the **single equivalent rate**.",

It accurately states that the quantitative approach remained unchanged while communication became more explicit. Minor differences include: (1) the LLM attributes the 'simulate' language directly to non-U.S. plans, while the original answer specifies this language originated in the U.S. context but influenced non-U.S. communication; (2) the LLM adds 'country-specific high-quality corporate-bond yield curve' detail not explicitly in the original answer. These do not constitute factual errors but reflect slight differences in framing. All entities (years, metrics) and multi-hop synthesis (methodology continuity + terminology shift) are correct.",
