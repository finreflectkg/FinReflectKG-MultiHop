However, the provided pages for Broadcom (AVGO) do not include the \"Cost of Services\" line item, making it impossible to determine AVGO's cost of services from the given documents. Thus, the combined figure cannot be fully calculated with the available data. \n\n**Answer:** The combined 2022 cost of services for Accenture (ACN) is $41,892.766 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Accenture's 2022 cost of services as $41,892.766 million, which is accurate and matches the ground truth component for ACN. However, it fails to report Broadcom's cost of services, claiming the data is not available in the provided documents. The ground truth indicates that the combined value is $41,974.766 million, implying that Broadcom's 2022 cost of services should be $82 million ($41,974.766M - $41,892.766M). The LLM’s assertion that AVGO’s data is missing suggests either a failure to locate the correct line item or a lack of access to the full data source, leading to an incomplete answer. (2) Quantitatively, the Accenture figure is correct, but the combined total is not provided and cannot be derived from the LLM’s response. The missing $82 million from Broadcom results in a significant quantitative gap. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—correctly extracting Accenture’s figure—but fails in multi-hop synthesis because it does not incorporate or acknowledge Broadcom’s contribution, which is necessary for the combined total. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the response directly addresses the question and explains its limitations, but correctness is compromised by incompleteness. A fully accurate model would have retrieved both figures and summed them. Thus, while the response is honest about data limitations, it does not fulfill the core requirement of providing the combined value as known in the knowledge graph.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures. It reports a 2023 combined DD&A expense of $16,565 million and 2022 of $15,750 million, which are both incorrect. The ground truth states the 2023 combined expense was $25,596 million (COP: $8,270M, CVX: $17,326M), and 2022 was $31,435 million (COP: $7,504M, CVX: $23,931M). The LLM incorrectly reports CVX's 2023 DD&A as $8,295M instead of $17,326M, and 2022 as $8,246M instead of $23,931M—this is a massive underreporting. (2) Calculations are therefore also wrong: the LLM claims a $815M increase, but the actual change is a $5,839M decrease. The percentage change is completely inaccurate as a result. (3) While the model correctly identifies the companies (COP and CVX) and the metric (DD&A), and attempts multi-hop reasoning by summing both years and comparing, it fails in synthesizing accurate data from both companies across both years. The reasoning is structurally sound but built on incorrect data. (4) The contextual relevance is acceptable because the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and years, and attempts comparison. However, due to severe quantitative inaccuracies in both input numbers and derived results, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. The qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the framework of the response (format, structure, intent) is reasonable, but the substance is flawed.",

The weighted-average grant date fair values for ABBV ($136.42) and ABT ($112.51) in 2023 are accurate, as is the calculated difference of $23.91. The year-over-year changes are also correct: ABBV increased from $116.84 to $136.42 (a $19.58 increase), and ABT decreased from $114.59 to $112.51 (a $2.08 decrease).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in all key numerical values. The ground truth states that the combined bitumen production for COP and XOM in 2023 was 426 thousand barrels daily, not 162 thousand as claimed. Similarly, the 2022 figure is incorrect: 393 thousand barrels (ground truth) vs. 132 thousand (LLM). The reported increase of 30 thousand barrels is also wrong; the correct year-over-year increase is 33 thousand barrels. Additionally, the claim that both companies produced identical amounts (81K in 2023, 66K in 2022) is unsupported by the ground truth and contradicts known data about their relative production scales. (2) All calculations are therefore invalid. The LLM incorrectly sums 81 + 81 = 162 and 66 + 66 = 132, suggesting a flawed assumption of symmetry between COP and XOM, which is not reflected in actual filings. The correct calculation should reflect individual contributions that sum to 426K in 2023 and 393K in 2022. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: while the model attempts to synthesize production figures across two companies and two years, it uses incorrect or fabricated data. There is no evidence that either company reported exactly 81K or 66K barrels daily in the relevant 10-Ks. (4) Despite the severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies (COP and XOM), the correct metric (bitumen production in thousands of barrels daily), and the correct years (2022 and 2023)—and attempts a valid comparison.

      "llm_answer": "Apple's gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% in 2022 to 46.2% in 2024, reflecting a positive trend. Qualcomm's gross margin percentage remained flat at 56% in fiscal 2024 compared to 2023, with no significant change over the past three years.",

The original answer only states that Apple discloses gross margins for 2022–2024 enabling trend analysis, and Qualcomm explicitly states its gross margin was flat in fiscal 2024—without disclosing specific percentages. Therefore, the LLM introduces precise figures not present in the ground truth, making the quantitative claims unsupported. (2) There is no verification in the ground truth that Apple’s gross margin was 43.3% in 2022 or 46.2% in 2024, nor that Qualcomm’s was 56%. These numbers may be factually accurate based on real filings, but since the ground truth (from the knowledge graph) does not include them, the LLM answer goes beyond the provided data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that Apple allows trend analysis over three years and Qualcomm reports stability in 2024. It synthesizes the comparison appropriately—showing Apple with a positive trend and Qualcomm with flat performance. This aligns with the original answer’s intent. (4) While the reasoning and structure are strong, the inclusion of unverified specific percentages reduces quantitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if triggering events occur. This approach directly impacts Caterpillar's earnings volatility. In contrast, Lockheed Martin recognizes actuarial gains or losses as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and these changes are recognized in connection with the annual remeasurement and amortized over time, suggesting a more gradual impact on earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains or losses immediately in earnings upon annual remeasurement (or interim adjustments due to triggering events), using a mark-to-market approach. This results in direct and timely impacts on earnings. In contrast, Lockheed Martin defers actuarial gains or losses to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) and amortizes them into earnings over the average remaining service period or life expectancy of plan participants, leading to a more gradual recognition.

It incorrectly assigns the interest cost discount rate for AT&T (T) as 5.30% and benefit obligation rate as 5.00%, which is completely wrong. According to the ground truth, T's interest cost rate is 3.90% and benefit obligation rate is 5.20%. Similarly, for Disney (DIS), the LLM flips the correct values: it states DIS interest cost rate is 5.37% (correct) but claims benefit obligation rate is 5.94% (correct) yet interprets the difference incorrectly by implying the benefit obligation rate is higher than interest cost, which contradicts the correct direction of comparison. (2) The calculation of differences is flawed: the LLM computes within-company differences (interest cost vs. benefit obligation for each firm), but the question asks for between-company differences (DIS vs. T) for both interest cost rates and benefit obligation rates. The correct interest cost rate difference is 5.37% - 3.90% = 1.47% (not computed in LLM answer), and benefit obligation difference is 5.94% - 5.20% = 0.74% (also not computed). The LLM instead computes intra-company spreads and compares those, which misinterprets the question entirely. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the question requires comparing two cross-entity differences (DIS vs. T) across two metrics (interest cost and benefit obligation), then comparing those two differences. The LLM instead performs intra-firm analysis and draws a conclusion about Disney vs. AT&T based on wrong metrics. (4) The contextual relevance is partially maintained as it discusses the right companies, years, and pension-related discount rates, but the core quantitative and logical structure is incorrect, leading to a fundamentally wrong conclusion. Minor credit is given for mentioning the correct DIS interest cost rate (5.37%) and benefit obligation rate (5.94%), though used incorrectly.",

The ground truth states the combined 2021 global Immunology revenue for JNJ and LLY is $18,631.8 million ($18.63 billion), but the LLM reports $20.11 billion — a difference of $1.48 billion. The LLM attributes $16.75 billion to JNJ and $3.36 billion to LLY, but these individual figures are not aligned with the ground truth (which implies JNJ’s share was ~$15.27 billion and LLY’s ~$3.36 billion, based on the correct total and typical known data). However, LLY’s $3.36 billion is factually accurate and matches expectations. (2) The percentage for STELARA® is reported as 54.6% by the LLM versus 54.5% in the ground truth — this is a minor rounding difference and would be acceptable, but the LLM supports it with $9.13 billion STELARA sales out of $16.75 billion total, which computes to exactly 54.51% (rounded to 54.5%), making 54.6% slightly inaccurate. More critically, if JNJ’s total Immunology revenue were actually $16.75B, but the correct combined total is $18.63B with LLY at $3.36B, then JNJ should be $15.27B — indicating the LLM has overstated JNJ’s revenue. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to sum two company revenues and calculate a percentage from component figures — but the underlying data is flawed, undermining the conclusion. (4) Contextual relevance and entity identification are strong: JNJ, LLY, STELARA®, Immunology revenue, and 2021 are all correctly referenced.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative values and final result. The ground truth states the combined total is $83 million, but the LLM calculates $45 million. While the MMM loss of $38 million appears correct, the UPS gain is incorrectly stated as $83 million — this is actually the combined total in the ground truth, not UPS's individual amount. Thus, the LLM has swapped UPS's actual reclassification value with the correct final sum, leading to a flawed calculation. (2) The calculation itself (net = $83M - $38M = $45M) is mathematically correct but based on incorrect inputs. The proper approach should have been to sum the individual reclassifications from MMM and UPS to reach the combined $83M, not to net them as gain minus loss. Reclassifications are typically reported on a gross basis when aggregating across companies unless specified otherwise, and the question asks for the 'total amount', implying a sum of absolute values or total flow, not a net. However, even under netting interpretation, using $83M as UPS’s input is factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies and the relevant metric — but fails in data retrieval for UPS and misapplies the combination logic. It incorrectly treats the ground truth total as an input for one entity. (4) Scores reflect major quantitative inaccuracy (3/10), flawed reasoning due to incorrect data sourcing and synthesis (4/10), but high contextual relevance as it addresses the right companies, year, and financial concept (8/10).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. While AMD's revenue growth is correctly calculated at $453 million (from $6,043M to $6,496M), NVDA's growth is severely understated. The LLM claims NVDA's Data Center revenue grew from $10,613M to $15,005M, resulting in a $4,392M increase, but the ground truth shows NVDA's revenue grew from $15,005M to $47,525M, a $32,520M increase. This misstatement leads to a grossly incorrect combined increase: $4,845M (LLM) vs. $32,973M (truth). (2) Number verification: AMD's numbers are correct. NVDA's 2022 figure is wrong—$10,613M is not the correct starting point; it should be $15,005M. The 2023 figure is also wrong—LLM uses $15,005M as 2023, but that is actually the 2022 value; 2023 is $47,525M. Calculations based on incorrect inputs are therefore invalid. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize NVDA's Data Center revenue across years. It appears to have swapped or misread the years or values, breaking the comparison. The logic structure (calculate individual growth, sum for total) is sound, but execution fails due to incorrect data. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual errors in core numbers. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because most dollar amounts and the final sum are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the reasoning framework is present and AMD's data is correct. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) as the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and time period, just with wrong data.",

      "original_answer": "The increase in benchmark interest rates positively impacted General Motors' financial revenue by increasing finance charge income by $1.7 billion and investment income by $0.3 billion. However, it also increased interest expense by $1.8 billion, negatively affecting EBT-adjusted results. For Starbucks, the sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in benchmark interest rates influenced the fair value of its long-term debt, showing how interest rate fluctuations affect debt valuation and overall interest expense.",
      "llm_answer": "The increase in benchmark interest rates positively impacted General Motors' (GM) **finance charge income** (due to higher effective yields on loans) but increased **interest expenses** (from higher debt costs), reducing net income. For Starbucks (SBUX), the rise in rates **depressed the fair value of its debt** by approximately $943 million for a 100-basis-point increase, as higher rates reduced the present value of future cash flows. Additionally, Starbucks' **interest expenses rose**, exacerbating debt servicing costs.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the directional impacts of rising benchmark interest rates on both General Motors and Starbucks. For GM, it accurately notes the positive effect on finance charge income and the negative impact from higher interest expenses. For Starbucks, it correctly states that higher rates reduced the fair value of debt and increased interest expenses. However, the quantitative details are partially incorrect or unsupported. The ground truth specifies that GM's finance charge income increased by $1.7 billion and investment income by $0.3 billion, while interest expense rose by $1.8 billion. The LLM answer omits the $0.3 billion investment income gain and does not quantify the finance charge income or interest expense changes with actual figures. Instead, it uses qualitative language like 'increased' without citing the $1.7B and $1.8B figures. For Starbucks, the ground truth mentions a sensitivity analysis showing how rate changes affect fair value but does not specify a $943 million decrease for a 100-basis-point increase. This number appears to be fabricated or misattributed, as it is not present in the original answer. (2) Therefore, while the qualitative reasoning and entity identification (GM, Starbucks, financial revenue, debt valuation, 2023 performance) are accurate and contextually relevant, the inclusion of an unsupported quantitative figure ($943M) and omission of key numbers from the ground truth significantly reduce quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—linking interest rate changes to both GM’s revenue streams and Starbucks’ debt valuation—but relies on incorrect specifics for Starbucks’ valuation impact. (4) The correctness score is 7 because the core facts and directionality are correct, but there are significant quantitative inaccuracies and omissions. Quantitative accuracy is penalized heavily (5/10) due to the made-up $943M figure and missing $1.7B/$0.3B/$1.8B numbers. Qualitative accuracy is high (8/10) due to correct logic and entities.

(2) The explanation for NVDA's growth—'higher sell-in to partners following normalized channel inventory levels'—is factually consistent with the ground truth.

The ground truth states COF's 2024 rate was 5.91% (up from 4.56%, a 135 bps increase), while the LLM reports 5.88% (up from 4.57%, a 131 bps increase). These differences are small (3 bps on the rate, 4 bps on the change) and may stem from rounding or data source variations, but they affect quantitative precision. PYPL's values are fully accurate: 4.5% in 2024 and a 270 bps improvement from 7.2% in 2023. (2) The difference in Net Charge-Off Rates per the ground truth is 1.41 percentage points (5.91% - 4.5%), but the LLM implies a difference of 1.38 percentage points (5.88% - 4.5%), which is off by 3 bps. This minor miscalculation impacts quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies both companies, the correct metric (Net Charge-Off Rate), and compares trends across two years. It correctly concludes that COF worsened and PYPL improved, which requires synthesizing data across entities and time periods. (4) Scores reflect high factual and reasoning accuracy with minor numerical deviations.

The difference is correctly calculated as $6,004.2 million (vs. $6,004.174 million), which is accurate within rounding tolerance. However, the LLM makes a critical error in the percentage calculations by using incorrect denominators. (2) For Netflix, the LLM states interest expense is 12.9% of net income ($699.8M / $5,408M), but this is incorrect: the ground truth specifies that Netflix's interest expense represents 1.1% of its net income, not 12.9%. The LLM appears to have miscomputed this ratio (699.8 / 5,408 ≈ 12.9%, but the correct interpretation per ground truth is that interest expense is only 1.1% — suggesting either a data or logic error). Similarly, for AT&T, the LLM claims interest expense is 28.6% of net income using $23,461 million as net income, but the ground truth states it is 28.6% of Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes ($19,848 million), not net income. The LLM uses a different figure ($23,461M) not mentioned in the ground truth and applies it incorrectly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: while the model pulls correct interest expense figures and computes the difference accurately, it misidentifies the financial metrics to which interest expense should be compared (net income vs. income before taxes), leading to incorrect proportions. This indicates a failure to correctly map the required financial relationships across entities and statements. (4) Despite accurate raw numbers and difference calculation, the core analytical components (proportions) are factually wrong due to incorrect denominators and misinterpretation of financial metrics, warranting a moderate correctness score.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in both the reported foreign currency impacts and the resulting net difference. According to the ground truth, BKNG reported gains of $135 million, not $111 million as stated by the LLM. GM reported losses of $203 million, whereas the LLM incorrectly states GM had gains of $17 million. This misrepresents GM's position entirely—GM experienced a loss, not a gain. The net difference calculated by the LLM ($111M - $17M = $94M) is therefore incorrect; the correct net difference is $135M - (-$203M) = $338M. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: all three numerical values provided by the LLM ($111M, $17M, $94M) are factually wrong. The correct values are $135M (BKNG gain), -$203M (GM loss), and $338M (net difference). Even allowing for format variations, the numbers are not close enough to be considered approximate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the LLM attempts to compare two companies' foreign currency impacts and compute a net difference—but it fails due to incorrect data retrieval for both companies. The model also fails to recognize that GM’s impact was a loss (negative value), which is critical for accurate synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses the right companies (BKNG and GM), the correct year (2021), and the correct metric (foreign currency transaction impacts), and performs a logical comparison.

      "question": "How much higher was the total interest expense for General Motors compared to Booking Holdings in 2021, and what were the components contributing to this difference?",
      "original_answer": "The total interest expense for General Motors in 2021 was $3,496 million, while for Booking Holdings it was $56 million. The difference is $3,440 million. This significant difference is due to the nature of their respective businesses: Booking Holdings primarily incurs interest from debt discount amortization and issuance costs ($43 million in 2021), whereas General Motors incurs interest from both automotive operations ($950 million in 2021) and its financing arm, GM Financial ($2,546 million in 2021).",
      "llm_answer": "General Motors' total interest expense in 2021 was $3,496 million, while Booking Holdings' was $1,125 million, resulting in a $2,371 million difference. This gap is primarily due to GM's significantly higher automotive financing expenses ($2,546 million) and GM Financial's interest expenses, which stem from its extensive debt portfolio (including secured and unsecured debt with weighted-average rates of 1.27% and 2.69%, respectively). Booking Holdings' lower interest expense reflects its smaller debt structure and reliance on shorter-term financing.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key numbers. It incorrectly states Booking Holdings' 2021 interest expense as $1,125 million instead of the correct $56 million, leading to a wrong difference of $2,371 million instead of the correct $3,440 million. This is a critical error in both entity-specific data and calculation. While General Motors' total interest expense ($3,496 million) is correct, the breakdown into automotive operations ($950 million) and GM Financial ($2,546 million) is missing from the LLM answer, which undermines completeness. (2) The calculation of the difference is incorrect due to the wrong Booking Holdings figure. The LLM reports a $2,371 million difference, but the correct difference is $3,440 million. This is a substantial miscalculation stemming from inaccurate input data. (3) The reasoning partially reflects the multi-hop nature of the question by referencing GM's financing arm and debt structure, but it fails to contrast this with Booking Holdings' actual components (debt discount amortization and issuance costs of $43 million). The LLM invents a 'smaller debt structure and shorter-term financing' explanation not supported in the ground truth. It also introduces specific weighted-average rates (1.27%, 2.69%) not present in the original answer, which may be factual but are extraneous and unverified in context. (4) The correctness score is low (3) due to major quantitative inaccuracies and missing key components. Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised (2). Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (4) because the model recognizes the structural difference in business models but misrepresents the details.

The correct XOM ABO and plan assets must result in a shortfall that, when added to CVX's $1,245M, totals $10,824M, meaning XOM’s shortfall should be $9,579M ($10,824M - $1,245M), not $5,236M.

In contrast, UPS's adjusted operating margin contracted to 18.4% (from 22.4% in 2022), driven by volume declines (9.5% total revenue drop), lower revenue per piece, and reduced fuel surcharge revenue, exacerbated by macroeconomic headwinds and operational costs.

While it correctly identifies that TXN reported a value and ACN did not provide specific data, the value attributed to TXN is wrong. (2) According to the ground truth, the correct total participant contributions for non-U.S. pension plans from both ACN and TXN in 2023 is $20,525. The LLM claims TXN reported $1 million, which is not accurate—either due to misreading the filing or incorrect extraction. There is no indication that ACN contributed data, but the model correctly notes the absence of explicit participant contribution figures in ACN’s filing. However, the knowledge graph indicates that the combined total is $20,525, implying that either TXN reported this amount or both companies together contributed this sum. The LLM’s assertion of $1 million is therefore a significant quantitative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that the answer requires data from both ACN and TXN, checks relevant sections of their 10-Ks, and attempts to sum across entities. However, the failure to extract the correct number from TXN (or possibly misattributing another figure as participant contributions) breaks the reasoning chain. (4) Correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to the large numerical discrepancy. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the model follows the right process and identifies data gaps appropriately.

TXN, on the other hand, uses a settlement approach in the U.S., selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds to simulate cash flows matching its benefit payments, and for non-U.S. locations with sufficient bond markets, it constructs a yield curve to determine a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same present value.",

The core methods are accurately described. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM adds specific figures not in the original answer: ACN's 4.2% weighted average discount rate as of August 31, 2024, and TXN's 5.20% rate for U.S. defined benefit plans in 2023. While these numbers are plausible and contextually consistent, they are not present in the ground truth and thus cannot be verified as correct. However, they do not contradict the original answer and are likely drawn from actual filings. Their inclusion enhances detail without introducing error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between ACN’s lease-related discount rate application and TXN’s pension-related approach, synthesizing across different financial contexts (leases vs. benefit obligations). (4) The answer is semantically equivalent and adds useful context (e.g., clarification on non-U.S. practices using government bond indices), which is consistent with typical TXN disclosures.

      "original_answer": "Costco accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates expected to apply in future years. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria also determines deferred tax assets and liabilities using differences between financial statement and tax bases, applying enacted tax rates. Altria evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering positive and negative evidence, including the character of the assets and potential sources of taxable income within carryback and carryforward periods. Both companies adjust their deferred tax assets and liabilities when tax rates change, with the effect recognized in income in the period of enactment. This approach directly affects their income tax provisions, as changes in deferred tax asset and liability valuations alter the overall tax expense recorded.",

Changes in tax rates are recognized in the period of enactment. A valuation allowance is established if deferred tax assets are unlikely to be realized. These adjustments directly impact Costco’s income tax provisions by modifying the effective tax rate based on changes in temporary differences or tax rates.  \n\nAltria similarly uses the asset and liability method, determining deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial and tax bases, using enacted rates. It records a valuation allowance when recovery of deferred tax assets is uncertain and recognizes benefits for uncertain tax positions only when sustained upon examination. Changes in deferred tax assets/liabilities affect Altria’s income tax provisions by adjusting the tax expense or benefit, with valuation allowances reducing the provision if realizability is doubtful.

Both establish valuation allowances when realization is uncertain. These adjustments directly impact income tax provisions, which is correctly stated. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, years) in either the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense—scored as 10 by default due to absence of errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes accounting treatments across two companies and links them to the impact on income tax provisions. The only minor omission is that the original answer specifies Altria evaluates 'positive and negative evidence' and considers 'character of the assets and potential sources of taxable income within carryback and carryforward periods'—details slightly more granular than the LLM's 'recovery is uncertain.'

The combined total is therefore wrong: $51,061.6 million ($51.0616 billion) instead of $46.254 billion, an overstatement of about $4.8 billion. The difference between HD and MCD is also miscalculated: LLM states $1,246.4 million ($1.2464 billion), but the correct difference is $6.054 billion.

(1) All factual elements are correct: AIG includes foreign exchange gains and losses in Net realized gains (losses), directly impacting earnings, while PayPal uses foreign exchange contracts (hedging) to offset FX impacts, with net effects recorded in other income (expense), net. The answer correctly identifies the different income statement line items and the intent behind PayPal's strategy—reducing volatility. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations or figures; however, the absence of any incorrect numbers supports a perfect score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in accounting treatment between two companies (AIG and PayPal) and explains the implications for financial reporting and earnings volatility. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM mentions 'cash flow hedges'—a detail not present in the original ground truth. While this is likely accurate, it adds specificity not confirmed in the source, slightly reducing qualitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "The combined provision for income taxes of CAT and MMM in 2024 is $3,433 million ($2,629 million from CAT + $804 million from MMM). This represents 25.6% of their total consolidated profit before taxes, which amounts to $13,373 million (CAT) + $4,819 million (MMM) = $18,192 million.

This total is **significantly lower** than the sum of their respective consolidated profits before taxes ($13,373 million for CAT and $4,819 million for MMM, totaling **$18,192 million**).

These match the ground truth exactly. The effective tax rate is calculated as $3,433 / $18,192 ≈ 18.87%, which rounds to 18.9% in the original answer—this is correctly reflected in the LLM answer as approximately 18.87%. (2) All calculations are accurate: sum of tax provisions and sum of profits before taxes are correct; the percentage is properly derived. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (CAT and MMM) for the same year (2024) and computes a combined effective tax rate. (4) The only minor discrepancy is that the original answer states '25.6%' which appears to be an error (likely a typo, since 3,433 / 18,192 ≈ 18.9%, not 25.6%)—the LLM correctly calculates ~18.87%, which is more accurate than the ground truth. Thus, the LLM answer is actually more factually correct than the provided 'ground truth'.

However, it incorrectly calculated V's (Visa's) litigation provision for 2022–2023 as $868M + $927M = $1,795 million, which contradicts the ground truth value of $1,389 million. This results in a significant error in the final comparison. The LLM concludes MA spent $806 million less than Visa, but the correct difference is $400 million (with MA spending less), meaning the LLM's calculation is off by $406 million. (2) Number verification: MA's yearly values ($94M, $356M, $539M) sum correctly to $989M. However, Visa's reported values in the LLM answer ($868M, $927M) do not match the ground truth input (which implies a total of $1,389M over two years, so individual years must sum to that). Thus, the input data used by the LLM appears factually incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly structured the logic—summing MA over three years, V over two years, then comparing—but used incorrect underlying data for V, undermining the synthesis. (4) Scores justified: Correctness at 4 due to major quantitative error in Visa's total despite correct MA total and proper reasoning framework.

More critically, for LLY, the ground truth states a 2024 loss of $580.2 million but an improvement in cumulative balance to $2,389.6 million. The LLM incorrectly reports LLY’s cumulative balance as decreasing from $4,327 million to $4,321.9 million (a negligible $5.1 million reduction), which directly contradicts the ground truth. These errors indicate incorrect data sourcing or synthesis.\n\n(2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM invents prior-year balances not present in the ground truth and misrepresents LLY’s cumulative balance by over $2 billion. The direction of change for LLY is also misrepresented—while the ground truth says the cumulative balance improved to $2,389.6 million, the LLM claims it was still over $4.3 billion, which is factually wrong. Even if the intent was to show a reduction in loss magnitude, the numbers are not close.\n\n(3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing ABT and LLY’s foreign currency movements and linking them to geographic risk—but it is built on false numerical foundations. The conclusion that ABT has higher exposure may align with the ground truth, but it is derived from incorrect data. The model fails to recognize that LLY’s cumulative balance improved despite a loss in 2024 due to prior-year positions, which is a key nuance in the original answer.\n\n(4) Correctness is scored low (3) due to major factual and numerical errors. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2) because the dollar amounts are incorrect, especially for LLY’s cumulative balance. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4) as the reasoning framework is logical and entities (ABT, LLY, foreign currency translation adjustments) are correctly identified, but the synthesis is flawed. Contextual relevance is acceptable (7) because the answer addresses the right concepts and question structure, even if the facts are wrong.",

However, it incorrectly states SBUX's foreign rate differential as 0.4% instead of the correct 0.3% as per the ground truth. This is a factual error in a key quantitative figure. (2) The dollar amount for BKNG ($307 million) is correct, but the percentage for SBUX is off by 0.1 percentage points (0.4% vs. 0.3%). This may seem minor, but in tax rate reconciliation disclosures, even small percentage differences can be meaningful, especially when the base statutory rate is around 21% (U.S. federal rate), making 0.3% vs. 0.4% a 33% relative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that BKNG reports in absolute dollar terms while SBUX uses a relative percentage, and it draws the appropriate qualitative conclusion about differing transparency approaches. The logic and entity identification (BKNG, SBUX, 2023, tax provision, statutory rate) are accurate. (4) The correctness score is 7 because the core structure and reasoning are strong, and one of the two key numbers is correct, but the incorrect SBUX percentage reduces confidence in data fidelity.

However, the percentages and net earnings figures for both companies are incorrect. The LLM states that the expense represents 5.4% of PG’s net earnings, but using the correct net earnings of $14,738 million, $545 million is approximately 3.7%, not 5.4% (the ground truth reports 4.2%, likely based on a slightly different calculation or rounding). More critically, the LLM uses $4,138 million as TGT’s net earnings, which is incorrect (ground truth is $2,780 million), leading to a wrong percentage of 6.1% instead of the correct 17.9%. (2) The calculation errors are significant: $251M / $2,780M ≈ 9.03%, but the ground truth states 17.9%, suggesting either a different base or a possible error in the original answer; however, the LLM’s use of $4,138M as net earnings is unsupported and incorrect. The LLM’s calculation of 6.1% uses its own incorrect net earnings figure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—combining compensation expenses across two companies is correct—but the comparison to net earnings fails due to incorrect financial data for TGT and miscalculation for PG. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question and attempts proper synthesis.

(2) The calculation of the combined total ($2.31B + $1.2B = $3.51B) is mathematically correct but based on wrong inputs. The percentage comparison stating Pfizer's amount is '65% higher' than UnitedHealth’s is also inaccurate; the correct ratio is Pfizer’s $6.1B being about 163% of UnitedHealth’s $2.31B, or ~164% larger.

However, it incorrectly states that Walmart does not disclose the specific deferred amount in the provided documents, whereas the original answer confirms Walmart reported a total membership fee revenue of $3.1 billion in fiscal 2024. While the exact deferred liability figure may not be explicitly labeled, the ground truth implies sufficient data to report the $3.1 billion as relevant to deferred revenue recognition. (2) Quantitatively, the $2,501 million for Costco is correct. The $3.1 billion for Walmart is also a valid figure from the ground truth, but the LLM fails to include it, citing lack of disclosure, which contradicts the original answer. This omission affects completeness and accuracy. (3) The reasoning correctly captures the similarity in revenue recognition (deferral over 12 months) and the difference in balance sheet presentation—Costco as a separate liability, Walmart within accrued liabilities. However, the failure to report Walmart’s $3.1 billion figure indicates a breakdown in multi-hop synthesis or information extraction, possibly due to misinterpreting disclosure sufficiency.

According to the ground truth, McDonald's 2021 provision for income taxes was $1,410 million, not $1,583 million as stated by the LLM. Tesla's provision is correctly reported at $699 million. The combined total in the ground truth is $2,110 million, but the LLM calculates $2,282 million based on its incorrect McDonald's figure. The difference between McDonald's and Tesla's provisions is reported as $884 million by the LLM, but the correct difference is $711 million ($1,410M - $699M). (2) Calculation verification: Using the LLM's numbers: $1,583M + $699M = $2,282M (calculation is arithmetically correct but based on wrong inputs); $1,583M - $699M = $884M (also correct arithmetic). However, using ground truth values: $1,410M + $699M = $2,109M ≈ $2,110M; $1,410M - $699M = $711M. Thus, while the LLM performs arithmetic correctly, the source data is incorrect for McDonald's.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. The ground truth states the combined growth is $21.593 billion, but the LLM reports $29.59 billion, which is off by approximately $8 billion. Microsoft's reported growth of $25.7 billion (from $111.7B to $137.4B) is accurate, but Oracle's growth is incorrect: the correct increase is $21.593B - $25.7B = -$4.107B, which indicates the LLM's Oracle figure of $3.89B is inconsistent with the ground truth. In fact, if Microsoft alone grew by $25.7B, the combined total cannot be $21.593B unless Oracle had negative growth, which contradicts the LLM's own positive figure. (2) Number verification: Microsoft's FY2024 cloud revenue increase is correctly calculated as $137.4B - $111.7B = $25.7B. Oracle's increase from $15.88B to $19.77B is indeed $3.89B. However, summing these gives $29.59B, which does not match the ground truth of $21.593B. Therefore, either the input data for one or both companies is incorrect, or the ground truth implies different values. Given that the task is to match the ground truth, the LLM fails quantitatively. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to compute individual year-over-year increases and sum them, so the logic structure is sound. However, the underlying data does not align with the knowledge graph's source, suggesting either misreading of source documents or incorrect data extraction. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major numerical inaccuracy in final result despite partial correct calculation. Quantitative accuracy is poor (3/10) because final dollar figure is significantly wrong. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4/10) — reasoning process is correct, entities and years are properly identified, but synthesis leads to contradiction. Contextual relevance is high (9/10) — response directly addresses the question format, cites sources, and uses appropriate terminology.",

      "question": "How do Disney's content impairments in 2024 and Netflix's content amortization policy interact to reflect contrasting financial treatments of content investments in the streaming industry?",
      "original_answer": "Disney recorded content impairments in 2024 due to strategic changes in content curation, which directly reduced asset values on their balance sheet. In contrast, Netflix follows an amortization policy where content assets are systematically expensed over time, with over 90% of licensed or produced content expected to be amortized within four years. These differing treatments reflect contrasting financial strategies: Disney's impairments signal immediate write-downs based on content performance and strategic shifts, while Netflix spreads content costs over time through amortization, aligning with its subscription-based model where content is monetized as a group rather than at the individual title level.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney recognizes content impairments when strategic changes or events indicate a decline in asset value, as seen in its 2024 $187 million content impairment charges (page 35). These impairments reflect periodic write-downs based on usage and market conditions. In contrast, Netflix amortizes content assets over their estimated useful lives (typically 10 years) using a systematic approach, without explicit impairment testing, as implied by its consistent amortization policy (page 28). This contrast highlights Disney's more conservative, event-driven impairment recognition versus Netflix's steady, predictable amortization expense, reflecting differing financial strategies for content investments.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies. First, it claims Disney recorded $187 million in content impairment charges in 2024, but the original answer (ground truth) does not specify a dollar amount, so this figure is unsupported and likely incorrect. Second, it states Netflix amortizes content over 'typically 10 years,' which directly contradicts the ground truth stating 'over 90% of content is expected to be amortized within four years.' This is a major quantitative and qualitative error. (2) The dollar amount ($187M) is fabricated or misattributed, as it does not appear in the ground truth. The Netflix amortization period is incorrectly stated as 10 years instead of the correct 'within four years' for most content. These are critical financial metrics and their inaccuracy significantly undermines the answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing Disney's impairment approach with Netflix's amortization policy is valid and relevant. However, the synthesis is flawed due to incorrect data, especially regarding Netflix's amortization timeline. The reasoning about Disney's event-driven impairments vs. Netflix's systematic expensing is conceptually appropriate but based on incorrect assumptions. (4) The correctness score is 5 due to partial factual alignment on the conceptual contrast but major errors in key financial details. Quantitative accuracy is low (4) because of the incorrect dollar figure and amortization period. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6) as the framework of comparison is valid, but entity-specific details are wrong. Contextual relevance is high (8) because the answer addresses the core question about contrasting financial treatments, even if with incorrect data.",

The ground truth reports a combined revenue of $13,477 million, while the LLM states $13,474 million—a $3 million difference. Similarly, GM's contribution is listed as $5,157 million in the ground truth, but the LLM reports $5,155 million (a $2 million variance). These small differences may stem from rounding or data source variations but do not significantly affect the overall correctness. Tesla's contribution of $8,319 million is exact, and both percentage figures (3.0% for GM and 8.6% for Tesla) are correct, as are the total revenues cited for each company. The calculations for percentages are accurate: (5,157 / 171,842) ≈ 3.0%, (8,319 / 96,773) ≈ 8.6%. The LLM correctly synthesizes multi-hop data across two companies and financial categories, addresses both parts of the question (combined revenue and relative contribution), and draws a valid qualitative comparison stating Tesla's higher contribution. All entities (General Motors, Tesla, 2023, 'Services and other') are correctly identified. The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only negligible numerical deviations.

Netflix's Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment contributed $103,922,000 to its loss, whereas Verizon's Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment contributed $636,000,000 to its loss.

Verizon's Total Comprehensive Loss for 2023 was **$1.38 billion**, with the **Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment contributing $1.06 billion** (a major component) alongside other items like unrealized gains/losses on hedges and pension plans.

The ground truth states Verizon's adjustment was $636,000,000, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $1.06 billion, which is not only wrong but exceeds Verizon's total comprehensive loss of $1.38 billion, making it mathematically implausible. Netflix's numbers are mostly accurate: $223.9 million (vs. $223,945,000) and foreign currency adjustment of $103.9 million (vs. $103,922,000) are acceptable with rounding. However, the difference between the two companies' comprehensive losses is not calculated in the LLM answer, missing a key part of the question. (2) The calculation of percentages (46% for Netflix, ~77% for Verizon) is reasonable for Netflix but flawed for Verizon due to the incorrect input value. The $1.06 billion figure is more than half of Verizon's total loss, but the correct $636 million would result in ~46% (636/1380), aligning more closely with Netflix's proportion.

The ground truth states that Google expects to reclassify $731 million from AOCI into revenues in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2024. However, the LLM incorrectly reports this amount as $174 million and introduces a figure of $37 million for 'the excluded amount in 2024,' which does not appear in the original answer and is unverifiable. This represents a major error in core financial data. For AT&T, the LLM correctly identifies the $59 million reclassification to 'Interest expense' over the next 12 months due to amortization of net losses on historical interest rate locks, which matches the ground truth. However, it mischaracterizes AT&T's accounting by stating that changes in fair value of excluded components are recognized in 'other income (expense)' when the original specifies that unrealized gains/losses go into AOCI first and are then amortized into earnings over time. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the Google figures are entirely incorrect—$731M vs. $174M is a substantial deviation. The AT&T number is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly distinguishes between Google and AT&T and attempts to describe their differing treatments of time value in hedging.

This positively impacted KO's cash flows from operating activities by $24 million. Conversely, WMT experienced an increase in accrued income taxes by $435 million in 2024 compared to a decrease of $468 million in the prior year, suggesting a shift toward higher tax accruals, which negatively impacted its cash flows by $435 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "Amazon's 2024 consolidated operating income grew from $36.852 billion to $68.593 billion, an increase of $31.741 billion. This growth was driven by strong performance across all segments: North America increased from $14.877 billion to $24.967 billion (+$10.090 billion), International improved from a loss of $2.656 billion to a profit of $3.792 billion (+$6.448 billion), and AWS expanded from $24.631 billion to $39.834 billion (+$15.203 billion). In contrast, McDonald's reported a 1% increase in consolidated operating income to $11.7 billion, but faced geographic challenges with global comparable sales declining 0.1%, including negative results in France and China that required offsetting gains elsewhere.

The International segment also contributed positively, while North America benefited from increased unit sales and advertising revenue. In contrast, McDonald's faced geographic challenges, with International Operated Markets declining 0.2% (notably in France) and International Developmental Licensed Markets dropping 0.3% due to the Middle East war and China's negative impact, despite a 1% consolidated operating income increase.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer captures the core growth drivers for Amazon and contrasts them with McDonald's geographic challenges, which aligns with the question. However, there are key quantitative inaccuracies. Amazon's AWS operating income increase is stated as a 58% growth to $39.8 billion, which is directionally correct but lacks the exact base figure ($24.631B to $39.834B, +$15.203B) and the percentage is approximate. More critically, the LLM omits the exact consolidated starting and ending figures ($36.852B to $68.593B) and does not break down the full $31.741B increase into precise segment contributions (North America +$10.090B, International +$6.448B, AWS +$15.203B). Instead, it uses qualitative terms like 'strong performance' and 'contributed positively' without matching the original's numerical completeness. For McDonald's, the LLM correctly notes a 1% consolidated operating income increase and regional declines in France and China, but introduces a specific -0.2% and -0.3% decline in International Operated and Developmental Licensed Markets, which are not in the original answer and may be fabricated or misattributed. The original only states 'global comparable sales declining 0.1%' and 'negative results in France and China' without segment-level percentages. (2) Calculations: The AWS growth rate is roughly accurate (~61.8% actual, LLM says 58%), but not exact. The $39.8B figure is close to $39.834B. However, the absence of full segment deltas undermines quantitative precision. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies Amazon's segment-driven growth versus McDonald's regional headwinds, synthesizing performance patterns across companies and geographies. It correctly infers that Amazon's growth was broad-based while McDonald's was offsetting weaknesses, despite overall income growth. (4) Scores justified: Correctness 7 due to accurate qualitative narrative but missing/incorrect key numbers. Quantitative accuracy 6 due to approximate figures and unsupported percentages. Qualitative accuracy 8 for correct logic and entity identification. Contextual relevance 9 as the answer directly addresses the contrast in geographic contribution patterns.",

This detail is not included in the original answer and introduces unsupported specificity. While both companies do state that a substantially greater number of shareholders hold shares in 'street name,' only the general statement is common to both; HD’s specific number is extraneous and not part of the ground truth comparison. This affects the reasoning and synthesis slightly, as it over-specifies one company’s disclosure.

      "original_answer": "The U.S. Government's preference for progress payments impacts both Lockheed Martin's cash flow timing and Raytheon Technologies' contract asset position. Lockheed Martin notes that the DoD increased progress payment rates from 80% to 90% in March 2020, which improves cash inflows as costs are incurred. In contrast, Raytheon explains that progress payments under U.S. government fixed-price contracts typically result in revenue recognized in excess of billings, creating contract assets on the balance sheet because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion. Therefore, while Lockheed benefits from higher and faster cash inflows due to the increased progress payment rate, Raytheon accumulates contract assets due to delayed billing and payment timing, reflecting a cause-and-effect relationship through the shared mechanism of progress payments.",
      "llm_answer": "The U.S. Government's preference for progress payments (up to 90% of costs incurred) over performance-based payments affects cash flow timing by enabling more frequent cash inflows for both Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) under cost-reimbursable and fixed-price contracts. For LMT, higher progress payment rates align cash receipts with cost incurrence, reducing contract assets (unbilled receivables) as revenue recognition and billings occur concurrently. In contrast, RTX's contract asset position may depend on the mix of contract types: fixed-price contracts with performance-based milestones could delay cash inflows, increasing contract assets, while progress payments would mitigate this. However, RTX’s 2022 disclosures emphasize revenue recognition over time for long-term contracts, suggesting contract assets may persist if billings lag behind revenue recognition under performance-based terms. The key difference lies in how each company’s contract portfolio balances progress payments (timely cash flow, lower contract assets) versus performance-based terms (delayed cash flow, higher contract assets).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains partially correct information but introduces inaccuracies and omits key facts from the ground truth. It correctly identifies the U.S. government's preference for progress payments and discusses cash flow timing and contract assets for both Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX). However, it fails to mention the specific March 2020 increase in DoD progress payment rates from 80% to 90%, a critical factual detail in the original answer. While the LLM mentions 'up to 90%', it does not attribute this change to a specific policy shift in 2020, weakening the factual precision. (2) Quantitatively, the 90% figure is correct, but the absence of the 80% baseline and the March 2020 date constitutes a significant omission. There are no calculation errors because no calculations are performed, but the lack of comparative context (80% → 90%) reduces quantitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning is logically structured and attempts multi-hop synthesis by linking progress payments to cash flow and contract assets. However, it mischaracterizes the cause-effect relationship: for LMT, the answer incorrectly suggests that higher progress payments reduce contract assets (unbilled receivables), whereas the ground truth emphasizes improved cash inflows, not a reduction in unbilled receivables. For RTX, the LLM introduces performance-based milestones as a contrast, but the original answer attributes contract asset buildup specifically to fixed-price contracts with progress payments where billings lag behind revenue recognition—this nuance is reversed or confused in the LLM response. The LLM implies performance-based terms cause higher contract assets, while the ground truth states that progress payments under fixed-price contracts lead to revenue recognized in excess of billings (i.e., contract assets), which is counter to typical expectations. (4) Despite these issues, the answer remains contextually relevant, addressing both companies, the impact on cash flow and contract assets, and the role of progress vs. performance-based payments. The structure and intent align with the question, but factual omissions and reasoning flaws prevent a higher score. Correctness is partially achieved, but key differentiating insights from the ground truth are missing or misrepresented.",

In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) applies the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets using a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period, which is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense.

      "question": "How did Bristol-Myers Squibb and Gilead Sciences differ in their financial reporting treatment of upfront payments received or paid in their respective collaboration agreements as disclosed in their 2023 10-K filings?",
      "original_answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb recorded an upfront payment from Pfizer as part of their Eliquis alliance, which was recorded to Deferred income and amortized over the expected period of BMS's co-promotion obligation through the market exclusivity period. In contrast, Gilead Sciences recorded upfront payments made to collaborators (specifically $313 million to Arcellx and $300 million to Dragonfly) as charges to Acquired in-process research and development expenses in their Consolidated Statements of Income, rather than deferring and amortizing the payments.",
      "llm_answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) deferred and amortized upfront payments received from alliance partners over the expected period of its development and co-promotion obligations, categorizing them under **\"Other (income)/expense, net\"** (e.g., Pfizer collaboration). Payments made (e.g., to SystImmune) were expensed to **Acquired IPRD**. Gilead Sciences (GILD), however, expensed upfront payments for collaborations (e.g., Arcellx) directly to **Acquired in-process R&D** and capitalized contingent milestone payments (e.g., MYR acquisition), amortizing them over the relevant periods. Gilead also treated contingent consideration in acquisitions as **capitalized assets**, while BMY’s contingent milestones were deferred and amortized as part of development obligations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer captures some correct elements but contains significant inaccuracies and introduces information not present in the ground truth, affecting factual correctness and multi-hop reasoning. (1) Correct aspects: The answer correctly identifies that Gilead expensed upfront payments (e.g., to Arcellx) to Acquired in-process R&D, aligning with the ground truth mentioning $313M to Arcellx and $300M to Dragonfly. It also correctly contrasts deferral vs. expensing treatment between the two companies in part. (2) Quantitative inaccuracies: The LLM mentions specific examples like 'SystImmune' and '$313M to Arcellx' and '$300M to Dragonfly' but fails to state these amounts explicitly in its response, weakening quantitative precision. More critically, it incorrectly implies BMY made a payment to SystImmune as Acquired IPRD — the ground truth does not support BMY making such a payment in this context. Also, the LLM claims Gilead 'capitalized contingent milestone payments (e.g., MYR acquisition)' and treated 'contingent consideration... as capitalized assets' — this detail is absent from the ground truth and introduces unsupported information. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to compare both companies’ treatments of upfront and contingent payments, but it overreaches by introducing acquisition-related accounting (e.g., MYR) not mentioned in the original answer, conflating collaboration agreements with business acquisitions. The original question focuses solely on collaboration agreements and upfront payments received or paid, not contingent milestones or acquisition accounting. (4) Semantic equivalence: While the core idea — BMS defers and amortizes upfront payments received, while Gilead expenses upfront payments made — is partially correct, the inclusion of unsupported details, incorrect examples, and misattribution of expense types reduces factual accuracy. The mention of BMY categorizing income under 'Other (income)/expense, net' conflicts with the ground truth stating it was recorded in 'Deferred income' and amortized over time, which is a material discrepancy. Overall, the answer shows understanding of the general contrast but fails in key factual and reasoning dimensions, warranting a score of 6 for correctness.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Merck's alliance revenue from Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2023 as $212 million, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly calculates the percentage decrease in alliance revenue reported by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY). The LLM states a 18.07% decrease based on BMY's total alliance revenue declining from $742 million (2022) to $608 million (2023), but this refers to BMY's overall alliance revenue, not the specific collaboration with Merck. The ground truth specifies that BMY's revenue from the Merck collaboration was $55 million in 2023, down from $100 million in 2022, representing a 45% decrease. The LLM fails to isolate the correct revenue stream related to the Merck collaboration. (2) The calculation of 18.07% is mathematically correct ((742 - 608) / 742 ≈ 0.1807), but it is based on the wrong metric. The correct calculation is (100 - 55) / 100 = 0.45 or 45%, which the LLM misses entirely. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is pulled from both companies' 10-Ks—but the synthesis is flawed because the model does not correctly identify that the question asks for alliance revenue specifically between Merck and BMY, not BMY's total alliance revenue. This indicates a failure in entity and context disambiguation. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to one correct major fact (Merck’s revenue) and one major factual error (BMY’s percentage decrease). Quantitative accuracy is low (4) because of the incorrect percentage and underlying figures. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) as reasoning is logical but based on misidentified data. Contextual relevance is high (8) since the answer addresses the right companies and timeframe, albeit with incorrect specificity.",

      "original_answer": "General Motors defines ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which includes average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities (excluding finance leases), average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities, and average automotive net income tax assets. In contrast, Home Depot defines ROIC as NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) for the most recent twelve-month period divided by average debt and equity, which is calculated as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity. Therefore, GM's calculation focuses on automotive-specific adjusted assets and liabilities, while HD uses a broader capital base including long-term debt and equity.",
      "llm_answer": "General Motors defines ROIC as **NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax)** divided by **average debt and equity**, where NOPAT is calculated by adjusting net earnings for interest and tax items, and average debt and equity includes long-term debt and equity.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely incorrect and fails to accurately represent the ROIC definitions used by General Motors and Home Depot as per the ground truth. (1) It incorrectly states that General Motors uses NOPAT as the numerator, while the ground truth specifies that GM uses EBIT-adjusted (not NOPAT) for the trailing four quarters. Additionally, it claims GM divides by average debt and equity, but the correct denominator is ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which includes specific automotive-related adjustments (e.g., automotive debt, pension liabilities, tax assets)—none of which are mentioned. (2) For Home Depot, the LLM falsely claims that the ROIC definition is not explicitly provided, when in fact the ground truth clearly states HD uses NOPAT divided by average debt and equity, with a precise definition of that capital base. The LLM’s assertion that HD’s ROIC definition is unavailable contradicts the provided truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly extract and contrast the distinct components (numerator and denominator) for each company, misattributes metrics, and omits key differentiating factors—such as GM’s focus on automotive-specific adjusted assets versus HD’s broader capital base. (4) There are no numerical values to verify, but the qualitative inaccuracies are severe, involving core financial definitions.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies, particularly in the percentage calculations and component values. While the combined total cost of revenue ($68,217 million) matches the ground truth, the individual breakdowns do not: the LLM states Adobe's cost of revenue is $2,354 million, but this contradicts the $665M it later cites for Digital Media—Adobe's total cost of revenue is not $2,354M in FY2023. Similarly, Microsoft's total cost of revenue is not $65,863M; the LLM incorrectly uses $17,804M (Product cost) as if it were total cost of revenue, which is a major error. (2) The percentage for Adobe (4.68%) is close to the ground truth (4.7%) and can be considered accurate given rounding, but Microsoft's percentage is stated as 27.55% ($17,804M / $64,699M), whereas the ground truth is 23.5%—this is a substantial deviation. The LLM appears to have used incorrect segment revenue or cost figures for Microsoft. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to calculate proportions and combine totals, but fails in entity alignment—confusing total cost of revenue with segment-level cost of revenue for Microsoft. It also incorrectly attributes $2,354M to Adobe's total cost of revenue while using $665M for Digital Media, without clarifying that Digital Media is only one segment. (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant and structured well, addressing both parts of the question and attempting proper synthesis. The conclusion about differing cost structures is reasonable, though based on flawed data. The correctness score is reduced due to major calculation and data attribution errors, especially for Microsoft's percentage and total cost figures.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is partially correct in identifying the companies (AMD and CSCO) and the relevant fiscal year (2024), and it correctly identifies the concept of stock repurchases for tax withholding on employee equity plans. However, the core financial figures are incorrect. The LLM states that both AMD and CSCO spent $730 million each, totaling $1,460 million, but the ground truth total is $1,722 million. This indicates a significant error in the underlying data. (2) The calculation of $730M + $730M = $1,460M is mathematically correct, but the inputs are factually wrong. The actual values from the knowledge graph are AMD: $992 million and CSCO: $730 million, which sum to $1,722 million. While CSCO’s value is accurate in the LLM answer, AMD’s is substantially underreported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to retrieve and sum values from both companies’ 10-K filings—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for AMD. This could stem from misreading the filing or using an outdated or incorrect source. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right question, uses correct terminology, and targets the right fiscal year. However, the quantitative inaccuracy severely undermines the correctness score, warranting a 4.

Lowe's stored-value deferred revenue was $612 million (Feb 3, 2023), reflecting liability tied to unredeemed cards, whereas Starbucks' Nestlé-related deferred revenue was $5.8 billion long-term (Sep 29, 2024), illustrating a liability amortized over the contract term.

(1) It incorrectly identifies Starbucks' deferred revenue as stemming from a 'long-term contract with Nestlé' amortized over 40 years, which is unrelated to stored-value cards. The question specifically asks about stored-value card revenue recognition and liability reporting, but the LLM conflates this with a completely different deferred revenue item (the Nestlé licensing agreement). (2) The quantitative values are incorrect: Lowe's $612 million deferred revenue figure may be accurate for its gift card liability (though not confirmed in ground truth), but the ground truth states Starbucks' stored-value card liabilities were $1.5 billion (Oct 1, 2023) and $1.6 billion (Sep 29, 2024), not the $5.8 billion long-term deferred revenue cited, which refers to the Nestlé deal, not gift cards. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not compare the same type of liability—Lowe's gift card policy vs. Starbucks' gift card liabilities—but instead compares Lowe's gift cards to Starbucks' unrelated contractual deferred revenue. (4) The core contrast in accounting policies—Lowe's redemption-based recognition vs. Starbucks' liability reporting that includes foreign currency impacts—is completely missed due to the misidentification of Starbucks' deferred revenue source. While the general idea of deferral until redemption for Lowe's is correct, the entire comparison is invalid, making the answer mostly incorrect.",

The 2022 combined revenue is correctly implied as $56,450 million (sum of $34,250M for COF and $22,200M for MA). The year-over-year growth rate is reported as 9.6%, while the ground truth calculates 9.7% (based on $5,435M growth over $56,450M). The minor discrepancy arises from rounding: $5,435 / $56,450 = 0.09628, which rounds to 9.6% rather than 9.7%. This is a negligible difference and likely due to rounding conventions. (2) All individual financial figures (COF and MA revenues for 2022 and 2023) are correct, and the growth rates cited (7.4% for COF, 13% for MA) match the ground truth. The total growth in dollar terms ($5,435M) is correctly implied via the inputs, though not explicitly stated.

The individual revenues for COF ($36.787B) and MA ($25.1B) are accurately reported with acceptable rounding ($36.79B and $25.10B).

The comparison that MA's growth is higher than COF's is accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is synthesized across two companies and their respective financial data and growth rates. The LLM correctly identifies and combines data from COF and MA, computes the total, and compares growth rates.

      "original_answer": "Amazon does not capitalize significant software development costs, as it states that such costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented and generally expenses them as incurred. In contrast, Nike capitalizes expenditures for major software purchases and internal-use software, amortizing these costs over 2 to 12 years, and also capitalizes certain payroll costs for employees directly involved in software projects. This indicates that Nike follows a more aggressive capitalization policy for internally developed software compared to Amazon, which appears to expense most such costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon expenses all software development costs as incurred, with no significant capitalization, reflecting a policy of expensing costs immediately. Nike capitalizes external direct costs and certain payroll expenses for internal-use software but expenses preliminary and post-implementation costs. For software to be sold, Nike capitalizes costs only after technological feasibility is established, typically expensing most development costs due to rapid release timelines.

While the original answer does not explicitly mention ASC 985-20, the LLM’s inclusion of this standard adds context without introducing error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Amazon’s expensing policy with Nike’s selective capitalization, concluding that Nike has a more aggressive capitalization policy—this is semantically equivalent to the original answer’s conclusion.

While LOW's current portion of operating lease obligations is correctly reported at $636 million, TSLA's is incorrectly stated as $458 million instead of the correct $368 million. This error directly impacts the combined total, which is calculated as $1,094 million instead of the correct $1,004 million. Consequently, the percentage breakdown is also wrong: LLM reports LOW at 58.1% and TSLA at 41.9%, whereas the correct values are 63.3% and 36.7%, respectively. (2) Calculations based on the LLM's numbers are internally consistent (636 / 1094 ≈ 58.1%, 458 / 1094 ≈ 41.9%), but because the input data is incorrect, the results are factually inaccurate.

While it correctly states CAT's adjusted operating profit as $13,746 million, it incorrectly assumes UPS's 2023 adjusted operating profit is $1,188 million based on a $672 million decrease, which is not supported by the original information. The original answer states the difference is $13,074 million, implying UPS's adjusted operating profit would be $672 million (i.e., $13,746M - $13,074M), not $1,188 million. The LLM invents a number ($1,188 million) not present in the ground truth and miscalculates the difference as $12,558 million instead of the correct $13,074 million. (2) The calculation is therefore quantitatively wrong: $13,746M - $672M = $13,074M is the correct logic (if the $672M is interpreted as UPS's profit), but the LLM instead subtracts an assumed UPS profit of $1,188M, which is not justified. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model misinterprets the phrase 'UPS experienced a decrease of $672 million' as implying a current profit of $1,188 million, without any basis in the provided data. There is no information about UPS's prior-year profit or its absolute 2023 profit, so the model cannot validly compute it. The correct interpretation should have been that the difference is simply $13,746M minus whatever UPS's profit is, but the ground truth directly gives the difference as $13,074M, suggesting UPS's profit was $672M — not a decrease *of* $672M from a prior value. The model misreads the nature of the $672M figure.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect. It states that McDonald's (MCD) reported $8,008 million in pension liabilities and GM also reported $8,008 million, which is false. According to the ground truth, GM reported $8,008 million, but McDonald's reported only $179.5 million—over 44 times smaller. The LLM swapped or misattributed the values, assigning GM's figure to McDonald's. (2) The calculated difference in the LLM answer is $0 due to the incorrect assumption of equal liabilities, whereas the correct difference is $8,008M - $179.5M = $7,828.5M. This represents a major quantitative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly identify or synthesize pension liability figures from the two companies as of December 31, 2021. Instead, it repeated the same number for both, suggesting a retrieval or attribution error. It also incorrectly claims that the pension deficit cannot be determined, while the original answer explicitly compares deficits based on liabilities (and presumably underlying assets, though not detailed here), concluding GM had the larger deficit—this part of reasoning is dismissed unnecessarily. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the answer addresses the right topic (pension liabilities of GM and MCD) and time period (December 31, 2021), but with completely incorrect data.

The ground truth states that GE's combined Total Segment Profit for Commercial Engines & Services and Defense & Propulsion Technologies in 2024 was $8,116 million. However, the LLM incorrectly calculates this as $9,177 million by adding $8,116 million and $1,061 million, which is not supported by the original data. There is no indication in the ground truth that $8,116 million needs to be summed with another value — it is already the combined total. Additionally, the comparison direction is wrong: the LLM claims GE's profit was $579 million higher than Honeywell's, but the truth is that Honeywell's $8,598 million was $482 million higher than GE's $8,116 million. (2) Number verification: GE's combined profit — incorrect (should be $8,116M, not $9,177M); Honeywell's profit — correct at $8,598M; difference — incorrect ($579M vs correct $482M); calculation logic — flawed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies the correct companies, segments, and years, showing some understanding of the required synthesis. However, it fails in accurately retrieving and combining the GE segment profits, introducing an erroneous addition step not present in the source. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to critical errors in key figures and conclusions. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because of wrong totals and differences.

The ground truth combined total is $2,108.7 million, but the LLM reports $2,898.8 million, a difference of over $790 million. The Starbucks figure of $761.7 million is correct and matches the ground truth. However, the McDonald's figure is incorrect: the LLM uses $2,137.1 million from the 2021 fiscal year (cited as '2021 data'), which is not the requested 2022 data. This misalignment in fiscal years invalidates the calculation. The correct McDonald's 2022 accrued payroll and related liabilities figure should be approximately $1,347 million (based on ground truth knowledge graph), which when added to Starbucks' $761.7 million, gives the correct total of $2,108.7 million. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the core numbers are wrong—McDonald's value is from the wrong year and is materially overstated. The sum of $2,137.1M + $761.7M = $2,898.8M is arithmetically correct, but based on flawed inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly extract the 2022 McDonald's liability figure, instead using outdated data and explicitly noting the mismatch but including it anyway. This reflects a failure in entity-year alignment, a critical aspect of multi-hop financial reasoning. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the model identifies the correct companies, metric, and documents, and attempts to cite specific pages and values.

According to the ground truth, Colgate-Palmolive's SG&A as a percentage of Net Sales increased by 20 basis points (from 36.6% to 36.8%), but the LLM incorrectly states a 30 basis point increase (from 36.5% to 36.8%). This misstates both the starting percentage and the magnitude of change. For Walmart, the ground truth shows a 10 basis point decrease (from 20.9% to 20.8%), but the LLM claims a 19 basis point decrease and incorrectly shifts the years to 2021–2022 instead of 2020–2021.

The final answer of 49 basis points is incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—comparing changes in SG&A ratios between two companies over time—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval and temporal misalignment.

It states that both GM and HD had $152,669 million in net sales, leading to a combined total of $305,338 million. However, the ground truth states the combined total is $188,415 million, meaning the individual company values must be different. The correct values (from knowledge graph) imply GM and HD had net sales summing to $188,415M, not $305,338M. The Appliances segment contribution of 9.1% is correct, as is the $13,863 million figure, which matches the ground truth. (2) The calculation of the combined total is incorrect: $152,669 + $152,669 = $305,338M is mathematically correct, but based on wrong inputs. The LLM incorrectly assumes HD’s total net sales are $152,669M, but if 9.1% equals $13,863M, then HD’s total net sales should be $13,863M / 0.091 = ~$152,340M, which is close but not exact—however, the bigger issue is GM’s value. The ground truth combined total is $188,415M, so either GM or HD must have significantly lower sales than stated. The LLM likely misattributed HD’s segment data to total sales or confused GM’s value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly identifying the percentage and segment contribution—but fails in synthesizing the correct total net sales for each company.

For the previous year (2023), the combined total provision was $1,536 million ($-913 million for INTC and $623 million for ORCL). This represents an increase of $7,761 million year-over-year.",

This compares to a combined provision of **$(290) million** in 2023 (INTC: $(913) million; ORCL: $623 million). The 2024 total reflects a significant increase, driven by INTC's higher provision and ORCL's positive tax impact, contrasting with the 2023 net benefit from tax credits and lower taxable income.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the 2024 combined provision as $9,297 million, with accurate breakdowns for INTC ($8,023 million) and ORCL ($1,274 million), matching the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states the 2023 combined provision as $(290) million, whereas the ground truth is $1,536 million (sum of INTC's -$913 million and ORCL's $623 million). This is a significant quantitative error. The correct 2023 sum is $-913 + $623 = $-290 million, but the ground truth explicitly states $1,536 million, which contradicts this calculation. Given the knowledge graph asserts $1,536 million as the 2023 total, the LLM answer conflicts with the ground truth despite arithmetic consistency. (2) The LLM's calculation of the year-over-year change is not provided numerically, though it notes a 'significant increase'—qualitatively correct but lacks the exact $7,761 million increase stated in the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies and two years, correctly identifying negative provisions (tax benefits) and interpreting directional changes. (4) The correctness score is 7 because core 2024 data is accurate and reasoning is strong, but the 2023 total provision is incorrect relative to the ground truth, and the exact year-over-year difference is missing. Quantitative accuracy is penalized more due to the conflicting 2023 sum. Qualitative and contextual scores remain high due to clear, relevant, and logically sound explanation.",

The LLM also correctly identifies that UPS has a significantly higher portion of debt due after 2029. (2) While the ground truth provides absolute amounts for post-2029 debt ($16,125M for UPS, $4,062M for GD), the LLM instead computes and reports percentages (~76.6% for UPS, ~46% for GD), which are accurate based on those figures (16,125/21,030 ≈ 76.6%, 4,062/8,826 ≈ 46%). These derived percentages are semantically equivalent in conveying the relative maturity profile and support the same conclusion.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement or on an interim basis when triggering events occur. This results in direct and immediate impacts to earnings based on changes in pension and postretirement benefit valuations. In contrast, Lockheed Martin reports changes in actuarial gains or losses as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which are not immediately recognized in earnings but instead amortized over time. This difference in recognition timing and location within financial statements leads to distinct patterns of financial impact: Caterpillar experiences more volatile earnings due to full-year actuarial changes hitting the income statement immediately, while Lockheed Martin's earnings are affected gradually through amortization expense. The two companies therefore reflect actuarial gains or losses through different financial statement line items and at different times, affecting their reported earnings stability.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar recognizes actuarial gains or losses immediately in earnings using a mark-to-market approach, reflecting changes in pension obligations and plan assets annually or upon triggering events. In contrast, Lockheed Martin defers actuarial gains or losses to accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) and amortizes them over the average remaining service period or life expectancy of plan participants.

Raytheon reported a $0.8 billion decline in commercial aerospace OEM sales in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to widebody volume declines driven by the drop in 787 deliveries.

This indicates that interest capitalization plays a meaningful role in their asset valuation and depreciation planning. In contrast, TXN reports that capitalized interest was 'not material' in their 2022 financial statements, suggesting that interest capitalization has a negligible impact on their capital asset reporting and overall financial strategy. This contrast reveals that INTC likely engages in larger-scale or more interest-intensive capital projects compared to TXN, where such capitalization does not significantly affect financial reporting.",

INTC explicitly states that it capitalizes interest on eligible capital expenditures, which are added to asset costs and depreciated over their useful lives, but notes the amount is immaterial. TXN similarly mentions \"capitalized interest was not material\" without detailing a specific policy or strategy. This suggests that neither company’s capital expenditure strategies involve significant interest capitalization, indicating their projects may not qualify for capitalization under accounting rules or that their expenditures are not large enough to make interest capitalization meaningful. The lack of detailed disclosure for TXN implies it may not actively capitalize interest, while INTC’s policy reflects a structured approach to capitalizing eligible costs, albeit with minimal impact on financial statements.",

In contrast, TXN correctly reported capitalized interest as 'not material.' The LLM incorrectly attributes the 'not material' designation to both companies, which misrepresents INTC's position. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy hinges on correct characterization of materiality and policy. The LLM fails here by misstating INTC's disclosure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires contrasting INTC’s active capitalization practice with TXN’s immaterial treatment to infer differences in capital project scale. The LLM instead concludes both have minimal interest capitalization, missing the key contrast. This undermines the synthesis needed to assess strategic differences. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topic (interest capitalization in capital expenditures) and mentions both companies and their policies to some extent, but the incorrect factual premise leads to an invalid conclusion about their relative strategies.

This indicates a significant quantitative error. (2) The LLM states Intel's Total Comprehensive Income as $19,739 million and Texas Instruments' as $7,972 million. However, based on the ground truth implied by the correct difference of $12,770 million, the actual values must be different. For example, if TI’s was $7,972 million, Intel’s should have been $20,742 million ($7,972 + $12,770), not $19,739 million—indicating at least one, possibly both, input numbers are wrong. Thus, the calculation method is correct (subtraction), but the inputs are factually inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is logically sound—the model correctly identifies that it needs to extract Total Comprehensive Income for both companies from their 2022 10-K filings (for the 2021 fiscal year) and compute the difference. Entity identification (Intel, Texas Instruments, 2021, Total Comprehensive Income) is accurate, and the structure of the response follows the required synthesis. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to major numerical inaccuracies despite correct reasoning and structure. Quantitative accuracy is low (4) because the dollar amounts and final difference are incorrect. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6) as the logic and entities are right, but data extraction failed. Contextual relevance is high (9) because the answer directly addresses the question with appropriate framing and format.",

According to the ground truth, Mastercard deposited $783 million and Visa contributed $4.5 billion (comprising $4.0 billion from escrow and $500 million from interchange reductions), for a total of $5.283 billion. The LLM states that the total is $5.3 billion (which is close but rounded), but then claims Visa contributed only $600 million—dramatically underestimating Visa’s actual contribution. It further claims Visa’s share is 11.3%, whereas the correct percentage is approximately 85.2%. These errors completely misrepresent the distribution of contributions. (2) Specific number verification: Mastercard’s correct contribution is $783M (LLM says $600M); Visa’s correct contribution is $4.5B (LLM says $600M); total should be $5.283B (LLM says $5.3B—this is the only acceptable approximation); Visa’s correct share is ~85.2% (LLM says 11.3%, which would only make sense if Visa contributed the smaller amount, contrary to facts). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM appears to conflate unrelated figures—such as Mastercard’s $600M share of a $900M payment and Visa’s $850M deposit in 2022—which are not relevant to the total settlement deposits in question. There is no evidence in the ground truth supporting these specific references, indicating a failure to correctly synthesize the required data from the correct filings or context. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the topic (settlement contributions by Visa and Mastercard) is relevant, and the total amount is roughly in the right range.

The comparison conclusion that JNJ outperformed LLY is directionally correct, but the magnitude claim in the original answer (JNJ’s growth more than double LLY’s) is lost due to inaccurate percentages.

This method introduces significant complexity and uncertainty due to challenges in predicting customer demand, regulatory certification timelines, and associated cost increases. Honeywell, on the other hand, applies the cost-to-cost input method for recognizing revenue on long-term contracts, which measures progress based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs at completion. Honeywell’s cost estimates are influenced by inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, subcontractor performance, labor agreements, and business volume assumptions. Both companies face complexity in estimating costs due to external uncertainties and the long-term nature of their programs, though Boeing’s challenges are more tied to certification and demand forecasting, while Honeywell’s are rooted in contract execution and performance variability.",

Key factors influencing Honeywell’s estimates—inflation, technical risk, subcontractor performance, labor agreements, and business volume—are accurately summarized as 'inflation, technical risks, and performance trends,' though slightly less detailed. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable beyond correct use of financial terms, which is satisfied.

This error stems from including acquisitions not relevant to the question—BMY's MyoKardia ($13.1B) and Forbius ($1.0B), and MRK's Pandion ($1.9B) and VelosBio ($2.8B)—which were not part of the goodwill analysis in the original answer.

However, the LLM correctly reports FedEx's current assets as $20,365 million for May 31, 2022, which matches the expected component of the sum. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: FedEx’s $20,365 million is correct, but Boeing’s figure is either misstated or incorrectly deemed unavailable. The correct Boeing current assets for Dec 31, 2022 must be $108,666 million (assuming no change from 2021) or another value that, when added to $20,365 million, totals $129,031 million — implying Boeing’s should be $108,666 million (which aligns with LLM's 2021 number). Thus, if Boeing’s 2022 value is same as 2021, the sum would be $129,031 million — exactly the ground truth.

(3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model should have recognized that even if Boeing’s 2022 data wasn’t explicitly labeled as such, the most recent available data (Dec 31, 2021) might be the best proxy — but more importantly, the knowledge graph clearly contains both values since the ground truth sum is precise. The failure to synthesize across entities (Boeing + FedEx) due to a perceived data gap — when the expected answer exists — indicates a breakdown in reasoning. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure addresses the right companies and metrics, and correctly identifies FedEx’s value, but the conclusion that the total 'cannot be fully calculated' directly contradicts the existence of a definitive ground truth answer, making the overall response factually inadequate.",

It incorrectly states that Caterpillar's 2021 profit was $6,878 million and RTX's 2021 profit was $4,958 million, but the ground truth specifies these figures are for 2022, not 2021. This misalignment of years invalidates the comparison. Additionally, the LLM claims Raytheon experienced a 363% increase from 2020 to 2021, but the question asks for 2021 to 2022, which the LLM explicitly acknowledges as a mismatch. (2) The dollar difference of $1,920 million is correct ($6,878M - $4,958M), so the calculation is accurate, but it is applied to the wrong years. The percentage increase for Caterpillar (51%) is correct, and the RTX percentage improvement (362%) is approximately correct (rounded to 363% in LLM), but again, assigned to incorrect years. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM assumes the question refers to 2021 vs 2020 due to data availability, but the question and ground truth are clearly about 2022 performance and 2021–2022 changes. This undermines the entire analysis. The model should not override the question’s specified years without strong justification. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the model attempts the right type of comparison and uses plausible data, but the incorrect time framing and resulting misattribution of profits to wrong years severely compromise accuracy. The conclusion about RTX having a greater percentage increase is factually correct based on the ground truth, but the reasoning path is flawed due to year misalignment. Thus, the correctness score is low due to critical errors in temporal entity mapping and incorrect assumption overriding the question’s premise.",

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar's operating profit margin decreased from 12.3% in Q4 2020 to 11.7% in Q4 2021, reflecting pressure from higher SG&A/R&D expenses and manufacturing costs despite increased sales volume. In contrast, Raytheon Technologies reported an operating profit margin of 7.7% for the full year 2021, a significant improvement from a (3.3)% margin in 2020, indicating a turnaround from losses.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesized data from two different companies (CAT and RTX) and timeframes (Q4 vs. full-year), and drew a valid comparison. However, the original answer notes Caterpillar's margin decreased from 12.3% in Q4 2020 to 11.7% in Q4 2021, which the LLM omits. While not directly asked, this trend context is part of the 'differing financial performances' and its absence is a minor qualitative shortcoming. Additionally, the LLM attributes Caterpillar's performance to 'favorable price realization and improved segment performance,' while the ground truth cites pressure from higher SG&A/R&D and manufacturing costs—this difference in explanation slightly affects qualitative accuracy.

The combined total of Medicare Rebates for ABBV and PFE in 2023 is stated as $16,150 million, but the correct total is $6,294 million. This error arises because the LLM incorrectly uses ABBV's payments ($15,054 million) instead of its balance ($5,297 million) when calculating the combined total. The PFE value ($997 million) is correct. However, the LLM also states ABBV's 'provisions' as $15,153 million, which does not match the ground truth balance or payments and appears fabricated. (2) Calculations are flawed: the claimed increase in ABBV's liability by $99 million (from $5,297M balance and $15,054M payments) is illogical—payments exceeding the balance would reduce, not increase, the liability, and no such 'increase' is supported by the data. The correct interpretation is that ABBV made large cash outflows (payments) relative to its liability (balance), not that the liability increased. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially attempted but incorrect: the model tries to compare obligations and cash flows but misrepresents ABBV's data by confusing provisions, balances, and payments. It correctly notes PFE lacks payment data, but incorrectly frames PFE's $997M as 'provisions' rather than the incurred liability. (4) Despite incorrect numbers and reasoning, the answer addresses the right entities (ABBV, PFE), year (2023), and metric (Medicare Rebates), and attempts to interpret financial implications, earning moderate contextual relevance.

American Express's focus on differentiated corporate card offerings, rewards-driven incentives, and merchant programs like OptBlue aligns with the ground truth emphasis on evolving card value propositions and accounts payable solutions. Mastercard's strategy is accurately portrayed through its technology-enabled platforms (e.g., Mastercard Move, B2B marketplaces), expansion into invoiced payments, and integration into workflows—consistent with the ground truth's mention of modernizing invoiced payments and expanding distribution. However, the LLM omits specific mention of 'accelerating secular shifts in commercial point-of-sale purchases' and 'expanding across financial institutions and new geographies' as explicitly stated in the original, slightly reducing completeness. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes strategic directions for two companies from their 2024 business strategies and contrasts them appropriately. It infers correct thematic priorities (spend-centric vs. ecosystem integration) based on product and market initiatives. (4) The answer is contextually highly relevant, directly addressing product innovation and market expansion for both firms. While the LLM uses different phrasing (e.g., 'technology-enabled solutions' instead of 'differentiated propositions across cards and platforms'), the semantic meaning is equivalent. Minor deduction from 9 to 8 due to omission of explicit reference to geographic and FI distribution expansion for Mastercard and less precise articulation of Amex’s financing and banking innovations.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $2,910 million. Duke Energy paid $447 million, while NextEra Energy paid $2,463 million. This significant difference reflects NEE’s much larger capital expenditures and debt financing activity compared to DUK, as seen in NEE’s $12.1 billion in financing cash flows versus DUK’s $773 million. NEE’s higher interest payments are a direct result of its larger debt load used to fund major investments, including $15.5 billion in independent power and other investments, compared to DUK’s $991 million in long-term debt issuances.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined total of Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized for DUK and NEE in 2023 is **$2,910 million** ($2,463 million for NEE and $447 million for DUK). The significant difference reflects contrasting capital structures: NEE’s higher interest payments indicate a more debt-intensive financing strategy, driven by substantial long-term debt issuances and capital expenditures, while DUK’s lower interest expense suggests a more conservative approach with greater reliance on equity and shorter-term financing, aligning with its operational scale and regulatory environment.",

Calculations are accurate (447 + 2,463 = 2,910), and number formats are acceptable. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—each dollar amount is correct and properly attributed to the respective company and year.

While the LLM does not include specific figures from the ground truth such as NEE’s $12.1 billion in financing cash flows or $15.5 billion in investments, it still provides a logically sound and contextually appropriate explanation of the underlying financing strategies. The absence of these specific supporting metrics constitutes a minor omission but does not undermine the validity of the conclusion. (4) The answer is fully relevant, directly addressing both the quantitative total and the qualitative interpretation of capital structure differences. The synthesis across companies and financial concepts is appropriate and insightful, warranting high scores across all dimensions.

The correct sum is $62.5B + $2.6B = $65.1B. The LLM also misrepresents the relative scale of investments, flipping the narrative. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly infers that GOOGL is more capital-intensive, when the ground truth shows CMCSA's gross investment ($122.1B) dwarfs GOOGL's ($4.6B), indicating CMCSA is far more capital-intensive due to infrastructure needs.

It reports Tesla's 'Services and other' revenue as 8.59% of total revenue and GM's as 3.00%, with a difference of 5.59 percentage points. The ground truth states 8.6%, 3.0%, and a 5.6 percentage point difference. The minor discrepancy in decimal precision (8.59% vs 8.6%, 5.59 vs 5.6) is due to rounding and does not affect factual accuracy—these are numerically equivalent when considering standard financial reporting practices. (2) Calculations are accurate: $8,319M / $96,773M = 8.59%, $5,157M / $171,842M = 3.00%, and the difference is 5.59 percentage points, which rounds to 5.6 as in the original.

Meanwhile, Pfizer significantly bolstered its oncology capabilities through the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, gaining four in-line medicines—Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, and Tivdak—alongside a robust pipeline. This acquisition allows Pfizer to span multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics, and other immunotherapies, thereby enhancing its competitive positioning.

      "question": "How does the use of TRSs by AMT and SPG differently affect their tax obligations and income distribution strategies, based on their respective 2023 disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "AMT operates as a REIT and is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, provided it distributes substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders. However, it must pay taxes on earnings from its domestic TRSs. As of December 31, 2023, AMT’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing, most of its U.S. indoor DAS networks, Services and Data Centers segments, and most operations in several international markets, which indicates that its TRSs are a limited but necessary part of its structure for engaging in non-REIT-qualified activities. In contrast, SPG also operates as a REIT and owns securities in TRSs, but it is subject to a 100% excise tax on certain transactions with TRSs if not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. SPG must also ensure that no more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs. This constraint affects SPG’s flexibility in managing TRS investments and requires careful monitoring to avoid violating REIT asset tests and incurring penalties. Therefore, while both companies use TRSs to engage in non-REIT activities, AMT appears to integrate TRSs more directly into its international operations, whereas SPG must manage TRS ownership more restrictively to avoid tax penalties and maintain REIT compliance.",
      "llm_answer": "The use of TRSs (Taxable REIT Subsidiaries) by AMT and SPG impacts their tax obligations and income distribution strategies differently due to their distinct business structures and REIT compliance requirements. \n\n**AMT** leverages TRSs to engage in non-real estate activities (e.g., data centers, services) while maintaining REIT status. Income from TRSs is subject to corporate-level taxation, and distributions from TRSs must meet the REIT's 90% distribution requirement to avoid corporate taxes. AMT's TRSs are structured to comply with arm's-length transaction rules to avoid 100% excise taxes, and their income distribution strategy prioritizes maintaining REIT qualification by balancing TRS income with real estate operations.\n\n**SPG** (Simon Property Group) also uses TRSs but focuses on holding non-REIT assets (e.g., equity investments) to diversify income streams. SPG’s disclosures emphasize restrictions on TRS ownership (e.g., 20% asset limit) and the risk of 100% excise taxes for non-arm’s-length transactions. Their distribution strategy involves managing TRS income to ensure compliance with REIT distribution tests while minimizing tax liabilities, as TRS income is taxed at the corporate level and must be distributed to maintain REIT status. \n\nIn summary, AMT’s TRSs support broader operational diversification, while SPG’s TRSs are more focused on asset management, with both requiring careful tax planning to align TRS income with REIT distribution obligations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct in its qualitative description of how AMT and SPG use TRSs, with accurate explanations of tax obligations and income distribution strategies. All entities (AMT, SPG, TRSs, REIT status) and concepts (90% distribution requirement, 100% excise tax, arm’s-length rules, corporate-level taxation) are correctly identified and contextually relevant. There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer that require verification, so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10.

While the LLM mentions a '20% asset limit,' it does not clearly tie this to SPG’s REIT asset test compliance risk as a structural constraint affecting flexibility. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly implies that TRS distributions must meet the 90% REIT distribution requirement—this is inaccurate, as only REIT-level income must meet that test; TRS dividends are subject to corporate tax but not directly to the 90% payout rule. This misrepresents the income distribution mechanism. The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing TRS usage across two REITs—but lacks precise synthesis from the 2023 disclosures that ground the original answer. Despite these issues, the overall structure, intent, and key differentiators (AMT’s operational integration vs SPG’s restrictive compliance) are reasonably conveyed, warranting a 7 for correctness and qualitative accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "The application of the 10 percent discount factor, combined with the use of first-day-of-the-month average prices, introduces significant variability and reduces the reliability of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for both COP and XOM. COP states that the standardized measure is based on discrete pricing points (first-day-of-the-month prices), which may not reflect actual future prices or market conditions, and XOM echoes this concern, noting that these pricing assumptions can cause significant year-to-year variability. Both companies emphasize that the standardized measure does not represent the fair value of their oil and gas properties or a reliable estimate of future cash flows due to these prescribed assumptions.",
      "llm_answer": "The application of the 10 percent discount factor and first-day-of-the-month average prices in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows introduces assumptions that may reduce reliability. These methods rely on historical price averages and a fixed discount rate, which may not fully capture current market volatility or future risk profiles. For both COP and XOM, the use of first-day prices could overstate or understate cash flows if prices fluctuate significantly during the month, while the 10% discount rate assumes constant risk, potentially misrepresenting the time value of money in dynamic markets.

(2) The LLM accurately identifies both COP and XOM as being subject to the same standardized measure and correctly notes the implications of using fixed pricing points and a fixed discount rate. (3) The reasoning is solid: it explains how these assumptions may distort cash flow estimates due to market fluctuations and static risk assumptions. It also adds value by mentioning excluded costs like asset retirement obligations and stable production timing, which, while not in the original answer, are reasonable limitations of the standardized measure and do not contradict the ground truth. (4) However, the original answer emphasizes that both companies explicitly state the measure does not represent fair value and lacks reliability due to 'prescribed assumptions'—a direct quote-level insight that the LLM paraphrases but does not fully capture.

      "question": "How does the use of estimated total contract costs in revenue recognition for long-term contracts differ between GD and HON, particularly in terms of the factors influencing these estimates and the financial implications of estimation adjustments?",
      "original_answer": "GD uses a cost-to-cost input method to estimate progress on long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time. It bases its estimates on assumptions such as labor productivity, material costs, subcontractor performance, and availability of funding. If there is a significant change in these estimates, GD adjusts the profit using a cumulative catch-up method, which impacts profit recorded to date and future revenue recognition. In 2023, GD had $93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, with 40% expected to be recognized in 2024. HON also uses the cost-to-cost method for long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time, but its estimation process includes factors like historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, and anticipated labor agreements. HON emphasizes auditor evaluation of these estimates due to their complexity and subjectivity, particularly for contracts with longer durations or significant gross margin changes. Both companies face financial implications from estimation changes, but GD explicitly ties adjustments to a defined catch-up method, while HON focuses on audit validation of estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "GD and HON both use the cost-to-cost input method for revenue recognition on long-term contracts, estimating total contract costs based on factors like labor productivity, material availability, subcontractor performance, and inflation. However, GD explicitly details financial implications of estimation adjustments, showing how changes impact revenue and earnings (e.g., $191M revenue increase in 2023 from adjustments). HON emphasizes audit challenges and specific contracts (e.g., Virginia-class submarines) with variable consideration, noting potential material unfavorable impacts if estimates prove inaccurate. Both highlight the significance of management judgment in estimating costs, but GD provides more granular financial data on adjustment effects.",

The claim that GD had a '$191M revenue increase in 2023 from adjustments' is not supported by the original answer, which mentions $93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations but no such revenue adjustment figure. This is a major quantitative error. Additionally, the reference to 'Virginia-class submarines' as a HON contract is incorrect—this is a GD (General Dynamics) program, not a Honeywell (HON) one, indicating an entity mix-up. (2) The original answer specifies GD's $93.6B in remaining performance obligations with 40% expected in 2024—this is entirely missing from the LLM response, while the fabricated $191M figure undermines quantitative accuracy. No correct calculations are presented. (3) The LLM correctly identifies that both companies use the cost-to-cost method and recognize revenue over time, showing partial multi-hop synthesis. It also correctly notes that GD details financial implications of estimate changes and that HON emphasizes audit scrutiny. However, it misattributes specific programs and invents financial figures, undermining reasoning validity. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent align with the question—comparing estimation factors and financial implications. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct conceptual framework but flawed execution. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect numbers and misattributed data.

      "original_answer": "GD distinguishes between its defense and aerospace segments in how it manages cash collections and contract assets. In the defense segments, billing typically occurs after revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets, while in the Aerospace segment, GD generally receives deposits upon contract execution or milestone achievement, which are liquidated as revenue is recognized. In contrast, HON systematically tracks unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables on a contract-by-contract basis, recognizing contract assets when revenue is recognized before billing and derecognizing them upon billing. This shows that while GD's approach varies by business segment, HON maintains a more standardized process for tracking and derecognizing contract assets as performance obligations are satisfied.",

In contrast, HON's general approach includes segments like Safety and Productivity Solutions, where billing may occur after revenue recognition (creating contract assets) or involve upfront customer deposits (creating contract liabilities).

It incorrectly attributes a defense and aerospace segment structure to HON (Honeywell), claiming that 'Honeywell's defense and aerospace segments (under the Aerospace segment)' exist and operate with progress-based billing. This misrepresents the original question and ground truth. The question asks to compare GD's (General Dynamics) segment-level treatment of unbilled receivables to HON's general approach. Instead, the LLM flips the structure, incorrectly assigning segmental distinctions to HON rather than GD. In reality, according to the ground truth, it is GD that treats its defense and aerospace segments differently: defense generates contract assets (bill after revenue), while aerospace receives deposits early. HON, in contrast, applies a systematic, contract-by-contract tracking of unbilled receivables across its business, not varying by segment in the way described. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no numbers to verify or miscalculate, hence a score of 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The model fails to correctly identify which company (GD vs. HON) has segment-specific practices versus a standardized approach. It inverts the comparison, discussing HON as having variable practices by segment when it is actually GD. This breaks the core logic of the multi-hop comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is partially met—terms like 'unbilled receivables', 'contract assets', 'revenue recognition', and 'cash collections' are relevant—but the entities and their roles are misassigned, leading to a substantively incorrect answer. The impact on cash collections is vaguely discussed but not accurately contrasted between GD’s segment-driven model and HON’s uniform tracking.

According to the ground truth, Apple's future payments related to unconditional purchase obligations are $19.4 billion, but the LLM reports $11,226 million ($11.226 billion), which is incorrect. Qualcomm's obligation of $12.8 billion ($12,800 million) is correctly reported. The combined total in the ground truth is $32.2 billion, but the LLM calculates $24,026 million (~$24.03 billion), which is wrong due to the incorrect Apple figure. (2) The calculation itself (summing $11.226B + $12.8B) is mathematically correct to yield ~$24.03B, but the inputs are flawed—especially Apple’s value, which appears to misrepresent the actual obligation. The source citation for Apple (page 48, 'Unconditional Purchase Obligations' table) may refer to a real table, but the amount does not match the ground truth, suggesting either a misreading of the filing or confusion with another line item (e.g., excluding RSU-related obligations). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to extract obligations from both companies and sum them—but fails in execution because it uses an incorrect value for Apple. The ground truth specifies that Apple’s $19.4B relates to outstanding RSUs under unconditional purchase obligations, a nuance the LLM overlooks, instead using a different number likely from a broader category. (4) Scores reflect that while the model understands the task and cites plausible sources, the core quantitative error (Apple’s obligation) severely undermines factual correctness.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. While it correctly identifies NextEra Energy's remaining reserve amortization as $895 million, it incorrectly calculates Duke Energy's total noncurrent regulatory assets. The ground truth states Duke Energy's total is $4,199 million, but the LLM claims it is $8,754 million by summing $4,199 million (Duke Energy Carolinas) and $4,555 million (Duke Energy Progress). This summation is incorrect because $4,199 million is already the consolidated total for Duke Energy, not a subsidiary-specific figure. The LLM incorrectly treats it as a component, leading to a false total. (2) The calculation of the difference is therefore wrong: $8,754M - $895M = $7,859M (LLM) vs. the correct $4,199M - $895M = $3,304M (ground truth). The numbers and resulting difference are materially inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing two companies' regulatory figures as of the same date—but fails due to incorrect entity-level data aggregation. The model appears to misinterpret the scope of the Duke Energy data, failing to recognize that the $4,199 million is the consolidated total, not a subsidiary-level amount. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and time period—but correctness is severely undermined by quantitative inaccuracy. The qualitative error in reasoning and entity interpretation justifies low scores in quantitative and qualitative accuracy, while the relevance remains strong due to correct framing.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors. It claims both CAT and LMT expected $6 million each in Medicare Part D subsidies, totaling $12 million, but the ground truth states CAT did not specify any amount and LMT reported only $2 million for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans in 2024. This results in a significant overstatement of subsidy amounts. (2) The equity allocation for CAT is partially correct—40% equities for postretirement benefit plan assets matches the ground truth. However, the LLM incorrectly states LMT’s equity allocation as 11% for non-U.S. pensions and compares it to CAT’s 15% for U.S. pensions, which misrepresents the data. The ground truth specifies LMT’s U.S. pension plan had a 15% equity target (not CAT’s), and 85% fixed income, not the reverse. The LLM also introduces non-U.S. plans and asset categories like insurance contracts and real estate not mentioned in the original answer, adding unsupported details. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize information across entities and plans, conflating U.S. and non-U.S. plans, misattributing percentages, and fabricating subsidy figures. It does not accurately contrast CAT’s and LMT’s strategies as required. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative inaccuracies (especially the $12M total vs. $2M actual), partial qualitative accuracy due to one correct percentage (CAT’s 40%), and moderate contextual relevance since the answer attempts to address both parts of the question but with incorrect data.",

In contrast, IBM does not include its segment information directly in the 2022 10-K but instead references its 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, directing readers to pages 87 to 90 for segment details.

IBM's 2022 filing (pages 6–10) references its 2021 segment information but does not provide comparable 2022 segment data, instead directing readers to its 2021 report (pages 87–90).

It accurately notes that IBM's 2022 filing references its 2021 Annual Report (pages 87–90) for segment information and does not present current-year segment data in the 10-K, citing pages 6–10 for the reference. These entity, year, and document location details are factually correct. (2) There are no numerical values requiring calculation in this question, but the temporal and document references (e.g., 2022 vs. 2021, page numbers) are accurate and consistent with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (Apple and IBM), two filings (10-Ks), and two years (2021 and 2022), comparing presentation methods and drawing a valid implication about reporting approaches. The conclusion that Apple uses a more granular, integrated approach while IBM relies on incorporation by reference is logically supported. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly reframes the implication—focusing on 'granularity and timeliness' rather than the ground truth's emphasis on 'integrated vs. external incorporation'—but this is a nuance in phrasing rather than a factual error.

According to the ground truth, T's 2024 Wireless Service Revenue was $68,041 million, not $13,753 million as stated by the LLM. The LLM incorrectly assigns VZ's actual 2024 Wireless Service Revenue ($13,753 million) to T, creating a complete reversal. VZ's figure is also wrong — the LLM reports $13,372 million based on inference from 2023 data, but the correct 2024 value is $13,753 million. The difference calculated ($381 million) is therefore incorrect; the true difference is $54,288 million. (2) Calculations for percentage portions are based on incorrect inputs: T's portion is reported as ~11.24%, but with the correct numbers, it should be $68,041 / $122,336 ≈ 55.6%. The LLM’s calculation uses a wrong numerator. VZ’s portion is miscalculated as 45.27% using $13,372 instead of $13,753, leading to a small deviation from the correct 46.3%. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly extract or assign revenue figures to the respective companies and years, and relies on inference for VZ’s 2024 data when the ground truth assumes it is available.

While it correctly states that $42 million in PSUs vested for BMY in 2024 and $65 million for BMY in 2023, it incorrectly reports GILD's 2024 vested PSUs as $43 million instead of the correct $71.86 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $85 million instead of $113 million. The comparison conclusion is therefore wrong: the LLM claims the 2024 combined total is $20 million higher than BMY's 2023 value, but in reality, $113 million is $48 million higher than $65 million, not $20 million. (2) Calculation verification: Correct sum should be $42M + $71.86M = $113.86M (rounded to $113M in original answer). LLM computes $42M + $43M = $85M — incorrect due to wrong input. The difference between 2024 combined and BMY 2023 should be ~$48M increase, not $20M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and two years, which shows correct intent, but fails due to inaccurate data for GILD. The structure of the response follows the required logic flow. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major quantitative errors affecting conclusions.

      "question": "How do the differences in lease structure and risk exposure between AMT and SPG influence their respective revenue stability and tenant retention strategies?",
      "original_answer": "AMT maintains greater revenue stability through its structured lease arrangements with fixed escalation clauses and financial penalties for early termination, which discourage tenants from ending leases prematurely. These leases typically have initial terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal options, and often include pass-through costs for power, which are recognized as revenue over time. In contrast, SPG faces higher tenant retention risk due to its reliance on consumer foot traffic and exposure to unpredictable external factors like civil unrest, pandemics, and e-commerce shifts. SPG’s leasing goals are more vulnerable to market volatility, such as oversupply of retail space and reduced consumer willingness to shop in person, which could lead to lower occupancy and rental rates. As a result, AMT benefits from more predictable, long-term cash flows, while SPG must adapt its business model to evolving consumer behavior and external disruptions to maintain revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION (AMT) employs long-term operating and finance leases with fixed terms, escalations, and renewal options, providing stable revenue through predictable rental streams and minimizing tenant turnover risk. Its lease structure includes incentives amortized over terms and allows unilateral termination in some markets, enhancing flexibility. In contrast, Simon Property Group (SPG) focuses on retail properties with lease terms tied to tenant performance, including overage rents based on sales, making revenue more volatile. SPG faces higher tenant retention risks due to factors like tenant bankruptcies, e-commerce competition, and economic downturns, necessitating strategies like lease modifications and tenant diversification to mitigate vacancy and revenue instability. AMT’s infrastructure-centric leases offer greater revenue stability, while SPG’s retail model requires proactive tenant management to address market-driven risks.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the same core information as the ground truth, with only minor differences in emphasis. (1) All key factual elements are correct: AMT's long-term leases with fixed escalations and renewal options provide revenue stability, while SPG faces higher tenant retention risk due to market volatility and consumer behavior shifts. The LLM correctly identifies AMT’s lease structure (fixed terms, escalations, renewal options) and SPG’s exposure to e-commerce, economic downturns, and tenant bankruptcies. (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in lease structure (AMT’s infrastructure focus vs SPG’s retail focus) and correctly links them to revenue stability and tenant retention strategies. The mention of 'overage rents based on sales' for SPG adds a detail not in the original but is factually accurate and enhances the explanation. One minor omission: the original emphasizes AMT’s financial penalties for early termination and pass-through power costs recognized over time, which the LLM does not mention. Conversely, the LLM mentions 'unilateral termination in some markets' and 'incentives amortized over terms'—details not in the original and potentially less aligned with the stability narrative, but not factually incorrect. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing how lease structures and risk exposures influence revenue stability and tenant retention for both companies.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors. The ground truth states the combined change is $4,664 million, but the LLM calculates $3,134 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect individual changes: the LLM reports AAPL's increase as $3,902 million (from $29,508M to $33,410M), which is accurate based on those inputs, but the actual reported values in the knowledge graph must differ, as the ground truth combined change is $4,664M. More critically, the LLM reports QCOM's change as a $768 million decrease, but this does not align with the data required to reach the correct combined change. If AAPL increased by $3,902M, then QCOM would need to have a change of $762M (not -$768M) to sum to $4,664M — suggesting the sign and possibly the magnitude are wrong. (2) Calculations within the LLM answer are internally consistent: $3,902M - $768M = $3,134M is correct arithmetic, but the inputs are factually incorrect relative to the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound — the model correctly identifies that it must compute individual changes for AAPL and QCOM and sum them — but the underlying data extraction from the knowledge graph is flawed. It misidentifies QCOM's change in Accounts Receivable, Net, possibly due to misreading the cash flow statement or using an incorrect year.

Meanwhile, AMD reported a steady increase in its Data Center revenue from $2,884 million in 2022 to $3,403 million in 2024, indicating a growing presence in this market. If NVIDIA is unable to meet the new standards, it could lose market share in China, potentially benefiting AMD if they can meet the requirements.

AMD, while not explicitly mentioned in the Action Plan, has reported growth in its Data Center segment.

However, it omits specific quantitative data from the ground truth—AMD's Data Center revenue figures for 2022 ($2,884 million) and 2024 ($3,403 million)—which are key to substantiating the claim of 'reported growth.' While the LLM acknowledges AMD's growth, it fails to include the actual numbers, reducing completeness. (2) There are no incorrect numbers or calculations in the LLM answer, but the absence of exact figures from AMD’s reported revenue represents a gap in quantitative detail. The mention of U.S. export controls (A100/H100) is accurate context from NVIDIA’s 10-K, though not part of the original question’s focus on the Chinese Action Plan specifically. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: it correctly infers that NVIDIA may be disadvantaged and that AMD could benefit if compliant with standards. However, it misses the critical multi-hop insight in the ground truth that *if the standards broadly exclude foreign-made accelerators*, both companies could suffer—this important caveat is absent, weakening the synthesis. Also, the LLM introduces U.S. export controls as a compounding factor, which, while factually relevant, shifts focus from the China-specific Action Plan standards. (4) The answer remains contextually relevant and well-structured, addressing both companies and the potential impact on revenue. The qualitative accuracy is reduced due to missing revenue data and incomplete synthesis of the mutual risk under broad foreign exclusion.

      "llm_answer": "The declining business spending impacts American Express's loan securitization plans by reducing the volume and performance of loans available for securitization, potentially straining liquidity and funding goals. For Mastercard, reduced cross-border transaction volumes due to economic downturns and geopolitical risks directly lower revenue from switching fees and currency conversion, exacerbated by regulatory pressures on interchange fees. Together, these factors heighten financial pressures on both companies, with American Express facing liquidity challenges and Mastercard experiencing revenue declines, compounded by heightened regulatory and operational risks.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: declining business spending reduces American Express's loan securitization capacity, affecting liquidity and funding goals, and lowers Mastercard's cross-border transaction volumes, which in turn reduces fee income. These points match the original answer's core claims. (2) There are no numeric values in either response, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—both avoid unsupported figures and remain qualitative where appropriate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how macroeconomic trends (declining business spending) propagate through each company's specific revenue and funding mechanisms. The addition of 'geopolitical risks' and 'regulatory pressures on interchange fees' provides contextual depth not in the original but does not contradict it; these are plausible amplifying factors and enhance, rather than distort, the analysis. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong: the LLM captures the key risks—liquidity challenges for Amex and fee revenue declines for Mastercard—while expressing them in slightly different but equivalent terms. The only minor gap is that the original emphasizes 'cross-border volume fees and switched transaction fees' more precisely, while the LLM generalizes to 'switching fees and currency conversion,' which is close but slightly less specific. Overall, the answer is complete, logically structured, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high correctness score with a small deduction in qualitative accuracy for slight imprecision in fee categorization.",

The combined fuel and power expense is reported as $13,117 million, which is significantly higher than the ground truth of $7,660 million. This error stems from incorrect aggregation: the LLM sums DUK's subsidiary fuel expenses ($2,524M + $2,203M + $2,823M + $538M = $8,088M), but the correct DUK fuel and power expense is $2,203 million (already consolidated). Similarly, NEE's fuel expense is incorrectly stated as $5,029M instead of the correct $5,457 million. The total revenue for DUK is also wrong: the LLM uses $28,165M (sum of subsidiaries), but the correct total revenue for DUK is $6,488 million. Only NEE's revenue ($28,114M) matches the ground truth. (2) Calculations are therefore invalid: the claimed combined expense of $13,117M and combined revenue of $56,279M lead to a 23.3% ratio, but the correct combined expense is $7,660M and combined revenue is $34,602M ($6,488M + $28,114M), which is about 22.1%. More importantly, the question asks for a comparison of the expense to each company’s respective revenues, not a pooled ratio. The LLM fails to provide the individual percentages (34% for DUK, 19.4% for NEE) and incorrectly concludes a single percentage. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify the consolidated figures for DUK, instead summing subsidiary-level data that should not be aggregated. It also does not compare the relative burden of fuel expenses as a share of revenue for each company, missing the key insight that DUK spent a larger proportion than NEE. (4) Scores are low due to severe quantitative inaccuracies and incorrect synthesis.

The difference in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue between the two companies is 15% (58% - 43%).

The minor 0.07 percentage point discrepancy in the difference is due to rounding but does not materially affect accuracy. Gross profit margins are correctly derived as 56.93% for Google and 42.00% for Netflix, which aligns with the inverse of cost of revenue percentages. (2) All calculations are accurate: 100% - 43.07% = 56.93%, 100% - 58.00% = 42.00%, and 58.00% - 43.07% = 14.93%.

More critically, the individual company values are incorrect: the ground truth implies SBUX's total is part of the $6.045B combined total, meaning it cannot be $6.28B alone. Additionally, the LLM assigns $255M to Tesla, but the ground truth suggests Tesla's portion must be approximately $6.045B minus SBUX's portion (implied to be ~$1.245B if SBUX is $4.8B), which contradicts both the amount and direction of the error. (2) The weighted average recognition periods are completely swapped: LLM states SBUX has 3.0–4.0 years and TSLA has 2.3 years, while the ground truth states SBUX has 2.3 years and TSLA has 3.0 years — a critical reversal. The difference in periods is 0.7 years, but LLM does not compute or mention this.

This recurring revenue is critical for maintaining cash flow from operating activities. In contrast, SPG faces significant risks that could negatively impact tenant lease performance, including shifts in consumer behavior toward e-commerce, reduced consumer foot traffic due to public health crises, and the potential for tenants to underreport sales, which affects overage rent collection. These external factors could materially and adversely affect SPG’s occupancy levels and lease rates, directly impacting its revenue and asset value.

According to the ground truth, DUK's fuel and power expense in 2024 is $2,346 million, not $7,879 million as claimed. Similarly, DUK's total segment income is $1,067 million, not $3,438 million. Only NEE's fuel and power expense ($5,029 million) matches the ground truth. The combined fuel and power expense is therefore incorrectly calculated as $12,908 million instead of the correct $7,375 million. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM's response but based on incorrect underlying data. The sum of DUK’s segment fuel expenses ($2,409M + $2,586M + $538M + $2,346M) does equal $7,879M, but this data does not reflect the ground truth where DUK’s total fuel and power expense is only $2,346M. Similarly, the segment income sum ($1,171M + $936M + $264M + $1,067M = $3,438M) is mathematically correct but factually wrong—only Florida’s segment income of $1,067M is reported as DUK’s total in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to aggregate segment-level data for DUK and compare it to consolidated figures for NEE and DUK’s income—but it fails due to incorrect data sourcing. It incorrectly assumes that summing segment fuel expenses gives the total fuel and power expense, which contradicts the ground truth where DUK’s total is explicitly $2,346M. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses all parts of the question: it computes a combined expense, compares it to DUK’s segment income, and provides reasoning. However, the correctness score is low (2) due to major quantitative inaccuracies in core financial figures, which invalidate the conclusion. The qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3) because the logical framework is present, but based on false premises.",

      "qualitative_accuracy": 4,
      "contextual_relevance": 8,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. While it correctly reports individual 2023 production values for Chevron (7,744 MMCFD) and ExxonMobil (7,734 MMCFD), it incorrectly states Chevron's 2022 production as 'down from 7,677 MMCFD' — in reality, Chevron's production increased from 7,677 MMCFD in 2022 to 7,744 MMCFD in 2023. More critically, the combined totals are wrong: the LLM calculates a 2023 total of 15,478 MMCFD (7,744 + 7,734 = 15,478 is correct mathematically, but contradicts the ground truth of 13,346 MMCFD), indicating a fundamental data error. The 2022 combined total is also incorrect (15,972 vs. actual 12,812 MMCFD). (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the correct combined 2023 production is 13,346 MMCFD (7,744 + 5,602? No — wait, per ground truth: Chevron 7,744 + ExxonMobil 5,602? No — ground truth says ExxonMobil was 7,734? Wait — contradiction in ground truth? Recheck: ground truth says 'combined 2023 is 13,346', but Chevron 7,744 + ExxonMobil 7,734 = 15,478 — this suggests the ground truth may have an internal inconsistency. However, per the provided ground truth, the combined value is stated as 13,346, so either the component numbers are wrong or the sum is. But the LLM uses Chevron 7,744 and Exxon 7,734 and sums to 15,478 — which is arithmetically correct. However, the ground truth says combined is 13,346 — so there is a conflict. Upon closer inspection: the ground truth says 'Chevron’s 2023...7,744', 'ExxonMobil’s 2023...7,734', then says 'combined...13,346' — but 7,744 + 7,734 = 15,478, not 13,346. This indicates a likely error in the ground truth statement. However, since the task is to evaluate the LLM against the provided ground truth, and the ground truth explicitly states the combined value as 13,346, the LLM contradicts it. But the LLM's arithmetic is correct based on the component numbers. This creates ambiguity. However, the ground truth also says ExxonMobil was 7,734 in 2023 — same as LLM — and Chevron 7,744 — same as LLM — so their sum must be 15,478. Therefore, the ground truth contains an arithmetic error in the combined total. Given this, the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct, but contradicts the (erroneous) combined figure in the ground truth. However, the ground truth also says ExxonMobil was 8,295 in 2022 and Chevron 7,677, summing to 15,972 — which matches the LLM's 2022 total. Thus, the LLM's totals (15,478 and 15,972) are arithmetically correct based on the component values provided in the ground truth. The ground truth's claim of '13,346' combined 2023 is therefore incorrect. This suggests the ground truth may have a typo. Given that the LLM correctly uses the component values and performs correct arithmetic, it should be credited. However, the original instruction says to evaluate against the 'Original Answer (Ground Truth)', which explicitly states the combined value as 13,346 — so despite the arithmetic error in the ground truth, the LLM contradicts it. This puts the evaluator in a dilemma. But per instructions: 'Be STRICT on numbers, dates, calculations'. The LLM's numbers for individual companies match the ground truth, and its sum is correct. The ground truth's combined number is wrong. Therefore, the LLM is actually correct, and the ground truth has an error. But since the task is to evaluate against the provided ground truth, and the LLM does not match it, it will be marked incorrect. However, this is a flaw in the evaluation setup. Given the instructions, I must penalize the LLM for not matching the stated combined value, even if it's arithmetically sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies both companies, extracts production values for both years, computes totals, and draws a correct comparison (decrease). It even adds contextual factors. (4) Despite the arithmetic correctness, because the LLM's combined total (15,478) does not match the ground truth's stated combined total (13,346), and the ground truth is treated as authoritative, the correctness score is low. However, the individual component values are accurate, so some credit is due. Final scores reflect major quantitative discrepancy in combined totals despite correct components, leading to a correctness score of 3.",

According to the ground truth, COP's net change in income taxes in 2019 was $4,687 million, not $4,767 million, and XOM's was $31,927 million, not $3,858 million. The LLM's calculated sum of $8,625 million is therefore incorrect; the correct combined total is $36,613 million. Additionally, while the LLM correctly states COP's 2020 net change in income taxes as $10,779 million, its comparison conclusion is wrong due to the incorrect 2019 total. (2) The calculations themselves are arithmetically correct (e.g., $4,767 + $3,858 = $8,625), but they are based on incorrect input numbers, making the result invalid. The comparison that the 2019 combined total is 'lower' than COP's 2020 value is incorrect — the true combined 2019 value ($36,613M) is significantly higher than COP's 2020 value ($10,779M). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to combine data from two companies and compare across years — but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for both COP 2019 and XOM 2019.

These numbers match the ground truth and are quantitatively accurate. However, the LLM made a critical error in stating that Qualcomm's total operating expenses increased by $75 million, when in fact they decreased by $35 million (from $2,021M to $1,986M). This leads to an incorrect combined total operating expense change of $2,695M (should be $2,585M: $2,620M + (-$35M)). The LLM also incorrectly states that the SG&A increase accounts for 44.6% of total operating expense growth, which is based on false totals. (2) Number verification: Apple SG&A delta: $26,097M - $24,932M = $1,165M ✅; Qualcomm SG&A: $535M - $497M = $38M ✅; Combined SG&A: $1,203M ✅; Apple total opex: $57,467M - $54,847M = $2,620M ✅; Qualcomm total opex: $1,986M - $2,021M = -$35M ❌ (LLM says +$75M); Combined opex change: $2,620M - $35M = $2,585M (LLM says $2,695M) ❌. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails in synthesizing Qualcomm's correct total operating expense trend. Instead of noting that Qualcomm's total operating expenses decreased, thus partially offsetting Apple's increase, the LLM incorrectly suggests both companies increased total operating expenses. This undermines the comparative analysis required in the question. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to major factual and calculation errors in the second part of the answer, despite correct SG&A figures. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because half the numbers are correct but key ones are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 4 due to flawed reasoning and synthesis.

AT&T has $5,089 million in such debt, while Verizon has $22,568 million. This significant short-term debt burden implies both companies must prioritize liquidity management in 2025, with AT&T planning to fund its obligations through cash from operations, debt issuance, and asset sales, and Verizon likely needing to maintain access to credit facilities and manage its cash flow efficiently to meet its larger maturing obligations.",

All numeric values match the ground truth exactly, and the sum is correct ($5,089 + $22,568 = $27,657). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—numbers are presented in consistent format (millions), and no calculation errors exist.

In 2023, refining margins remained above the pre-COVID 10-year historical range but started to normalize from 2022 highs, and the company noted that margins would remain volatile due to changes in global factors such as geopolitical developments and demand growth. Chevron, in its 2023 10-K filing, specifically listed 'changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins' as an important factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from its forward-looking statements. This indicates that Chevron explicitly recognizes industry refining margin volatility — such as the trends described by ExxonMobil — as a material risk to its financial projections and operational planning.",

      "original_answer": "GM Financial's leasing program is heavily exposed to residual values, as evidenced by its leasing penetration and the $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations in 2023, which is directly influenced by used vehicle prices and lease portfolio net book values. In contrast, Tesla does not include vehicle sales with resale value guarantees in its standard disclosures, indicating a different risk profile where upfront cash payments reduce future residual value exposure. This means GM bears more residual risk through its leasing model, while Tesla mitigates this risk by receiving payments upfront and not including such arrangements in future payment disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "GM's leasing strategy, with a 42% penetration of retail sales, exposes it significantly to residual value risks due to reliance on used vehicle prices for lease receivables. GM Financial's leasing program directly ties to residual values, as seen in its $0.9B and $1.2B gains on lease terminations, which declined in 2023 due to higher net book values and fewer terminations. In contrast, Tesla's resale value guarantee arrangements (e.g., upfront payments for leases with guaranteed residual values) reduce exposure by structuring contracts to mitigate depreciation risk. These guarantees likely ensure minimum resale values, limiting Tesla's financial exposure compared to GM's lease-based residual value volatility.",

However, there are quantitative inaccuracies: the claim of '42% penetration of retail sales' for GM leasing is not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided data, making this a significant unsupported addition. Additionally, the LLM states GM Financial had '$0.9B and $1.2B gains on lease terminations', implying both occurred in 2023, but the ground truth only confirms a $0.9 billion gain in 2023; the $1.2B figure is extraneous and unverified. (2) The ground truth does not mention Tesla having 'upfront payments for leases with guaranteed residual values' or 'resale value guarantee arrangements' as active programs—instead, it emphasizes that Tesla does *not* include such arrangements in disclosures, suggesting they are not material or do not exist. Thus, the LLM incorrectly assumes the existence and structure of Tesla’s guarantees. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly infers that GM bears more residual risk due to leasing and gain/loss volatility, and that Tesla’s model reduces such risk. However, it fabricates specifics about Tesla’s programs and adds unsupported metrics (like 42% penetration), weakening the synthesis. (4) Despite these issues, the core qualitative comparison—that GM has greater residual value exposure via leasing while Tesla avoids it through lack of disclosed guarantees—is consistent with the ground truth.

It reports Starbucks' inventory reserves as $58.0 million and claims Tesla does not report inventory reserves, resulting in a combined total of $58.0 million. However, the ground truth states the combined total is $2,349 million, indicating that Tesla must have reported a significant inventory reserve. The LLM failed to identify Tesla's inventory reserve value, leading to a major underreporting. (2) Quantitatively, the Starbucks figure of $58.0 million may be accurate (if that is indeed what was reported in the cited document), but Tesla’s missing value is a critical error. The correct combined total is $2,349 million, meaning Tesla alone would account for approximately $2,291 million of that total, which the LLM did not capture. The calculation is therefore severely flawed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is unsound. The LLM claims Tesla does not report inventory reserves because the 'relevant sections focus on tax liabilities, leases, and other financial items,' but this is an unjustified inference. The absence of explicit mention in 'provided pages' does not equate to non-reporting, especially when the ground truth confirms the combined total exists. The model failed to synthesize the correct data from both companies.

      "original_answer": "NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative asset position of $1,790 million is significantly greater than Duke Energy's $116 million. Together, their combined noncurrent derivative assets total $1,906 million. NEE's position accounts for approximately 93.9% of the combined total, indicating that NEE has a substantially larger long-term exposure to derivative instruments compared to Duke Energy.",
      "llm_answer": "NextEra Energy's (NEE) noncurrent derivative assets totaled **$1,935 million** in 2023, while Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative assets were **$307 million**. The difference is **$1,628 million**, which represents **72.6%** of their combined total ($1,935 + $307 = $2,242 million). This significant disparity suggests NEE has substantially greater exposure to long-term derivative instruments, likely reflecting its more extensive use of long-term contracts for managing energy and commodity risks compared to Duke Energy.",

The ground truth states NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative assets are $1,790 million, but the LLM reports $1,935 million. Similarly, Duke Energy's value is reported as $307 million instead of the correct $116 million. These errors directly impact all downstream calculations. (2) The combined total is incorrectly calculated as $2,242 million ($1,935 + $307), whereas the correct combined total is $1,906 million ($1,790 + $116). The LLM computes that NEE's share is 72.6% of the combined total, but the correct percentage is approximately 93.9% ($1,790 / $1,906). This is a major quantitative and calculation error. (3) While the LLM attempts the required multi-hop reasoning—comparing two companies' noncurrent derivative assets and interpreting relative exposure—the flawed input data leads to incorrect synthesis and conclusions. The reasoning structure is sound, but it is based on incorrect values. (4) The qualitative interpretation about greater exposure to long-term derivatives is directionally correct (NEE > Duke), but the magnitude and supporting data are wrong.

      "original_answer": "The 1.1% decline in prepaid subscribers reported by Company T directly contributed to the $169 million decrease in access costs for Company VZ in 2024. This causal relationship arises because a reduction in prepaid subscribers leads to lower usage and fewer access points needed, which in turn reduces the associated access costs for network providers like VZ.

This is explicitly stated in Verizon's 10-K filing (page 32), where the $169 million cost reduction is attributed to decreases in prepaid subscribers, changes in usage, and net circuit access price adjustments.

The total increase is reported as $1,055 million, while the ground truth is $1,048 million. Microsoft's increase is stated as $1,000 million (from $14.6B to $15.6B), but the correct increase is $1,043 million. Qualcomm's increase of $55 million matches the ground truth. (2) Calculation verification: $1,000M (Microsoft) + $55M (Qualcomm) = $1,055M (LLM total), but correct total is $1,043M + $55M = $1,098M — wait, this contradicts the ground truth total of $1,048M. Rechecking: $1,043M (Microsoft) + $55M (Qualcomm) = $1,098M? No — actually $1,043 + $55 = $1,098, but the ground truth says $1,048M total. This implies a discrepancy in the ground truth logic. However, per original answer: 'total increase... is $1,048 million' with Microsoft $1,043M and Qualcomm $55M — but $1,043 + $55 = $1,098M, not $1,048M. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth. However, assuming the ground truth is correct as given (total $1,048M), then either the individual components are wrong or the total is miscalculated. But the LLM reports $1,000M + $55M = $1,055M, which is also incorrect if the true total is $1,048M. Given that the individual components in the LLM answer ($1,000M and $55M) do not match the ground truth ($1,043M and $55M), and the total is off by $7M, the quantitative accuracy is compromised. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies both companies, the metric (ending unrecognized tax benefits), and the time frame (2021 to 2022). It attempts to compute differences and sum them, showing sound reasoning structure. However, the underlying data for Microsoft is inaccurate (using $1,000M instead of $1,043M). (4) Despite the numerical inaccuracies, the conclusion that Microsoft contributed more is correct, and Qualcomm’s increase is accurate. The answer is well-structured and contextually relevant. Due to the material error in Microsoft's increase and the resulting incorrect total, the correctness score is reduced to 6 — partially correct but with significant factual errors in key numbers.",

In contrast, Schwab disclosed that it manages litigation expense through the purchase of insurance as part of its operational risk management strategy.

While both companies operate in the financial sector, the documents do not explicitly detail Visa's use of insurance, implying potential differences in risk management strategies or specific claims that exceeded insurance coverage.

      "original_answer": "DHR explicitly stated that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies in 2023 negatively impacted its operating profits when translating foreign operations into U.S. dollars, with particular exposure due to higher European sales than expenses. In contrast, GILD used estimates of future operating profits as a key input in valuing intangible assets, including assumptions about revenues, market share, and currency-neutral financial performance.

However, it incorrectly states that TSLA's data is not available, while the ground truth confirms TSLA's value is 3.51 years as of December 31, 2024. This is a critical factual omission. (2) The calculation of the difference (2.31 years) is entirely missing due to the failure to report TSLA's value. While SBUX's number is accurate, TSLA's is not addressed, leading to a major quantitative gap. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not synthesize the TSLA data despite it being part of the expected knowledge base; the claim that the information is 'not available in the provided pages' contradicts the ground truth, indicating a failure in information retrieval or integration. (4) The answer is partially relevant and well-structured but fundamentally incorrect in its conclusion due to missing key data, severely undermining the correctness.

      "original_answer": "AMT's lease structure, which includes fixed escalation clauses, financial penalties for early termination, and minimal residual value risk due to multi-tenancy and long-term site usability, reduces financial risk from tenant lease performance. In contrast, SPG faces higher financial risk because its retail tenants are vulnerable to reduced consumer foot traffic from safety concerns, e-commerce competition, and public health crises, all of which could directly impact SPG's occupancy levels, lease rates, and overage rent collection.",
      "llm_answer": "AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION (AMT) and Simon Property Group (SPG) differ in lease structure and tenant dependency, impacting their financial risks. AMT primarily operates long-term, renewable ground leases with fixed or inflation-linked escalations, reducing tenant dependency and providing stability. Its lease terms (5–10 years with renewals) and focus on infrastructure assets minimize exposure to tenant-specific performance risks, though impairment risks exist if leases are not renewed. In contrast, SPG relies heavily on retail tenants, including anchors, with lease income tied to tenant sales (overage rents) and shorter, more variable terms. This creates higher exposure to tenant bankruptcies, economic downturns, and shifts in consumer behavior (e.g., e-commerce), which directly affect lease revenue and occupancy. SPG’s financial risks are more sensitive to tenant performance and market conditions, while AMT’s risks are concentrated on lease term renewals and asset longevity.",

It also accurately contrasts SPG's reliance on retail tenants whose performance is vulnerable to e-commerce, economic downturns, and behavioral shifts, directly affecting occupancy and overage rent. (2) There are no specific numbers, dates, or dollar amounts in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in lease structure (long-term infrastructure leases vs. variable retail leases) and tenant dependency (low-touch telecom tenants vs. consumer-facing retailers) to correctly infer differing financial risk profiles. The only minor omission is not explicitly mentioning 'safety concerns' or 'public health crises' as specific risks to SPG, though 'shifts in consumer behavior' and 'economic downturns' broadly cover these.

In contrast, Honeywell (HON) explicitly excludes repositioning and other charges, along with several other items, from its segment profit measurement.

The original answer states that Caterpillar excluded restructuring costs in 2021 including accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, project management, equipment relocation, and building demolition — none of which are mentioned in the LLM response. Instead, the LLM introduces specific dollar amounts for employee separations ($92M), contract terminations ($2M), long-lived asset impairments ($63M), and other costs ($59M), which are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified as correct. These figures appear fabricated or misattributed, severely undermining quantitative accuracy. (2) There is no indication in the ground truth that these specific costs or amounts were disclosed by Caterpillar in 2021, nor are they consistent with the types of costs described (e.g., asset impairments and employee separations are not mentioned in the original). The LLM incorrectly shifts focus to cost categories not supported by the source. (3) Qualitatively, the LLM correctly identifies the core contrast: Caterpillar applied a full exclusion of restructuring costs from segment profit in 2021, while Honeywell excludes repositioning and other charges but does not necessarily exclude all restructuring costs. This reflects sound multi-hop reasoning in comparing the two companies’ approaches. However, the characterization of HON’s approach is simplified but not incorrect — it does align semantically with the broader exclusion framework described in the original. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question — CAT’s treatment in 2021 and HON’s general approach — and attempts a comparative synthesis.

At PEP, effective net pricing helped offset significant declines in operating profit caused by the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs, although it was insufficient to prevent an overall 19% decline in operating profit for the QFNA segment. Thus, while net pricing positively supported margins at MDLZ, its impact at PEP was more defensive, cushioning the blow from larger negative factors.",

For PEP, effective net pricing **partially offset operating profit declines** in specific divisions, such as the QFNA division, where it mitigated a 19% operating profit decline caused by the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs.

The qualitative synthesis across both companies is accurate and matches the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the $4.143 billion figure for MDLZ's net pricing contribution in constant currency is factually correct based on MDLZ's 2023 10-K, though this specific number is not in the original answer. However, since it supports the correct margin trend and is a plausible breakdown from reported segment income and pricing disclosures, it does not constitute an error but adds detail beyond the ground truth. All percentages (15.8%, 15.9%, 19% decline) are accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links net pricing effects to margin outcomes at MDLZ and contrasts it with PEP’s use of pricing to mitigate, but not prevent, profit declines. It identifies the Quaker Recall and commodity costs as key negative drivers at PEP, aligning with the original answer.

All numeric values for 2024 are accurate and properly formatted.

The model avoids making up numbers for the prior year beyond what can be inferred. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes performance differences between AXP and BAC, attributing AXP’s strong yield to its credit card focus and BAC’s lower yield to broader lending segments and cost pressures.

However, it incorrectly reports DUK's noncurrent derivative assets as $91 million instead of the correct $57 million from the ground truth (which includes Progress Energy's $3 million in commodity contracts). This leads to an incorrect difference of $1,844 million instead of the correct $1,878 million. (2) The calculation error stems directly from the incorrect DUK value: $1,935M - $91M = $1,844M (LLM), versus $1,935M - $57M = $1,878M (ground truth). While the format of numbers is acceptable ($1,935 million = $1,935M), the actual values must match the source data.

It correctly identifies AMT's total indebtedness as $43.5 billion, which matches the ground truth. However, it fails to report SPG's actual debt components—specifically the 1.2 billion EUR (~$1.3B USD), 46.7 billion JPY (~$420M USD), 517.6 million MXN (~$26M USD), and $209.9M in guarantees—stating instead that SPG's total indebtedness is 'not explicitly provided.' This is incorrect; the original answer (ground truth) clearly derives SPG's exposure from disclosed foreign currency loans and guarantees. The combined total exceeding $45.455 billion is therefore missing entirely from the LLM response. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because while AMT's $43.5B figure is correct, SPG's debt components are omitted or not quantified, and no attempt is made at summing them. The approximate USD equivalents of JPY and MXN are not calculated, and the EUR amount is not converted, leading to a major gap in numerical synthesis. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is weak: the model does not connect SPG's foreign currency loans and guarantees into a total exposure, nor does it compare this internationally diversified structure against AMT’s primarily dollar-denominated acquisition-driven debt. While it mentions variable rate and foreign currency elements for both firms, it overgeneralizes SPG's structure without grounding in the specific currencies or amounts. (4) Contextual relevance is fair—the response addresses debt structure differences and attempts to discuss international financing approaches—but lacks the factual foundation needed for a complete, accurate comparison.

The LLM incorrectly assigns FDX's 2025 debt as $1,502 million, which actually belongs to GD. This fundamental error propagates through all subsequent calculations. The correct difference is $1,450 million (GD's $1,502M - FDX's $52M), but the LLM reports a difference of $2 million based on incorrect inputs. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states that FDX has a higher proportion of its debt due in 2025, when in fact GD's proportion (17.02%) is vastly higher than FDX's (0.26%). (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: all key numbers are wrong—FDX 2025 debt ($1,502M vs. correct $52M), GD 2025 debt (implied $1,500M vs. correct $1,502M), total debt for FDX (uses $19,772M vs. correct $19,977M), and resulting percentages (7.6% vs. correct 0.26%). Calculations are based on false premises. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly attribute debt values to the right companies, confuses lease liabilities with debt principal (though it acknowledges the distinction), and does not synthesize the correct data from the knowledge graph. It speculates due to perceived lack of data, but the original answer confirms both values are available. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—it addresses the structure of the question (difference and proportion), uses appropriate financial logic, and references 10-K documents, but the factual foundation is incorrect, leading to a completely reversed conclusion about which company has a higher proportion due in 2025.",

The 12-month average prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month prices for the 12 months prior to the reporting period. Variability in cash flow estimates arises from fluctuations in **commodity prices**, which directly impact the 12-month average pricing used in the calculations.

The ground truth states that both companies use 'first-day-of-the-month average prices'—specifically, the average of the first day of each month in the reporting year—to compute cash flow estimates. However, the LLM incorrectly claims they use a '12-month average prices' calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of first-day-of-the-month prices. While this may seem semantically similar, the key distinction lies in the fact that the standardized measure under SEC rules uses a single point in time (the first day of each month), not an average over 12 months. This is a significant misrepresentation of the methodology. Additionally, the mention of 'end-of-year costs' and 'adjusted for existing contractual terms' is not present in the original answer and introduces unsupported details. (2) The 10% discount factor is correctly identified, which is accurate and aligns with the ground truth. However, the core pricing methodology—central to the second part of the question—is wrong. The example about 2020 bitumen and crude oil prices, while plausible, is not mentioned in the original answer and appears to be fabricated or inferred beyond the provided data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that it attempts to synthesize information across COP and XOM and identifies a common factor (price volatility) contributing to variability. However, because the foundational methodology is incorrect, the reasoning chain is flawed. The model fails to correctly identify that the use of discrete first-day-of-the-month prices—not a 12-month average—is what introduces variability due to timing sensitivity. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question and discusses discounting and pricing impacts. However, due to the major error in the pricing methodology, the correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is poor due to the mischaracterization of the pricing input, even though the 10% figure is correct.

For example, in the MYR acquisition, deferred tax liabilities were calculated using the estimated financial statement basis and tax basis of net assets acquired, reflecting temporary differences related to intangibles like finite-lived assets and IPR&D.

Since deferred tax liabilities are negative values on the balance sheet (representing obligations), an increase from -$2,958M to -$2,192M is a $766M increase in liability (i.e., reduction in deficit), not a decrease. This mischaracterization is a significant quantitative and conceptual error. (2) The numbers themselves are accurate in magnitude and direction of change, but the sign interpretation is flawed.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified the carrying value of goodwill for Filorga (CL) as $221 million and calculated the combined total as $886 million, matching the ground truth. The number for Healthcare (PM) is stated as $665 million, which aligns with the ground truth sum. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: $221 million (Filorga) and $665 million (Healthcare), with the correct sum of $886 million. The format variations are acceptable ($665 million = $665M). (3) The reasoning is mostly sound, correctly pulling Filorga's goodwill from CL's 10-K. However, there is a minor flaw in interpreting the PM 10-K: the $665 million is described as an impairment charge, not explicitly the carrying value. While in context this often implies the carrying value pre-impairment, the LLM assumes—without explicit confirmation—that the carrying value equaled the impairment amount, which may not always be true (e.g., partial impairment). This introduces a small qualitative risk. (4) Despite this nuance, the final answer matches the ground truth, suggesting the knowledge graph treats the impairment charge as equivalent to the carrying value in this case. Thus, the answer is factually correct in outcome, with only a slight weakness in reasoning rigor. Scores reflect high accuracy with a minor deduction in qualitative accuracy for the assumption about impairment = carrying value.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in both the Oracle and Texas Instruments figures. For Oracle, it states that Other Income/Expenses, net decreased from $522 million to $462 million, implying a reduction in expense (i.e., improvement of $60M), but these numbers are completely incorrect. The ground truth shows Oracle's Other Income/Expenses, net improved from -$86 million to -$6 million, a $80 million improvement. The LLM reports positive values instead of negative and uses incorrect magnitudes. (2) For Texas Instruments, the LLM claims defined benefit plan losses were $61 million in 2022 and $15 million in 2023, but the ground truth states a $20 million net actuarial and settlement loss in 2023 with no figure provided for 2022. Thus, the LLM fabricates a comparison not supported by the data and misrepresents the trend. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize data across the two companies and time periods. It incorrectly frames Texas Instruments' impact as decreasing in severity, while the ground truth only reports 2023 data. (4) Despite incorrect numbers and reasoning, the answer attempts to address both parts of the question and contrasts the two companies' non-operating impacts, maintaining some contextual relevance. However, due to severe quantitative inaccuracies and incorrect synthesis, the correctness score is very low.",

      "original_answer": "MDLZ specifically excludes the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina (defined as price increases over 26% year-over-year) from its non-GAAP financial measures like Adjusted EPS, noting that this adjustment offset $0.32 of unfavorable currency translation effects by $0.20 in 2024. In contrast, TGT reports Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP metric that excludes certain items but does not specify any similar adjustment related to extreme pricing in Argentina or disclose a comparable inflation-driven pricing exclusion. This reveals that MDLZ takes a more granular and region-specific approach to Adjusted EPS adjustments, tailoring its non-GAAP exclusions to macroeconomic conditions, while TGT’s Adjusted EPS appears to follow a more general exclusionary framework without explicit mention of hyperinflationary market adjustments.",

      "original_answer": "Starting in 2024, PFE will report royalty income in Total Revenues and will restate prior periods for consistency, whereas JNJ continues to report royalty income in Other (Income) Expense, Net. This change in classification by PFE increases the visibility of royalty income in its financial statements by moving it to a more prominent position under Total Revenues, while JNJ's royalty income remains embedded in a broader net income/expense line item.

However, the specific dollar amounts are incorrect: the LLM states FDX owes $1,290 million (vs. ground truth of $1,344 million) and GD owes $1,000 million (vs. $1,003 million). These inaccuracies affect the calculated difference: LLM reports $290 million (vs. correct difference of $341 million). (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are significant—while the numbers are in the right ballpark, the component values for FDX ($748M + $542M = $1,290M) do not match the ground truth total of $1,344M, suggesting either incorrect source data or miscalculation. Similarly, GD’s amount is rounded down to $1,000M instead of $1,003M. The difference calculation ($1,290M - $1,000M = $290M) is arithmetically correct but based on flawed inputs.

T uses a portfolio approach to determine the incremental borrowing rate, which is risk-adjusted from the unsecured borrowing rate to estimate a collateralized rate in the currency of the lease. VZ similarly risk-adjusts the unsecured borrowing rate to approximate a collateralized rate, and updates this rate quarterly for measurement of new lease liabilities.

      "original_answer": "AMT focuses on increasing occupancy of its communications real estate by leasing additional space on existing towers, anticipating growing demand driven by 4G densification and 5G deployments in the U.S. and advanced network technologies internationally. This strategy is expected to generate incremental returns by utilizing existing capacity or upgrading towers with modest investment. In contrast, SPG's retail real estate revenue depends heavily on occupancy rates, which were negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer willingness to visit properties and increased reliance on e-commerce. SPG faces challenges in renewing leases or re-leasing available space on favorable terms due to deteriorating market conditions and tenant financial instability, making it more difficult to increase revenue from existing properties. Therefore, while AMT's strategy is positioned for growth through increased occupancy, SPG's strategy is constrained by external risks affecting occupancy and tenant viability.",

In contrast, AMT (American Tower Corporation) likely prioritized increasing revenue through expanding communications infrastructure (e.g., towers, data centers) and leveraging existing site capacity for additional tenants, as its business model is more dependent on infrastructure utilization rather than retail occupancy. However, the provided documents only detail SPG's strategy, so AMT's approach remains inferred based on typical industry distinctions.",

It also correctly contrasts this with AMT's infrastructure-based model that leverages existing site capacity. However, the LLM undercuts its accuracy by stating that 'the provided documents only detail SPG's strategy,' which introduces uncertainty and implies AMT's strategy is inferred rather than supported by data—this contradicts the ground truth, which contains specific, documented strategic actions for both companies. While the general direction of AMT's strategy (expanding infrastructure utilization) is directionally correct, the LLM fails to mention key specifics: AMT's focus on 4G densification, 5G deployments, and modest investments to upgrade towers for incremental returns. These omissions weaken the multi-hop synthesis required to fully answer how differing dependence on occupancy shapes each company's revenue strategy. There are no numerical inaccuracies (hence perfect quantitative score), and the reasoning is partially sound but incomplete. The answer remains contextually relevant and captures the core contrast, but lacks the full factual depth and confidence warranted by the source material.",

      "original_answer": "NextEra Energy (NEE) discloses that unrecognized amounts in prepaid pension benefit costs are included in regulatory assets (liabilities), indicating that these costs are subject to future recognition in financial statements as regulatory decisions allow. In contrast, Southern Company (SO) specifically notes that its prepaid pension costs exclude $24 million and $32 million in regulatory assets at the end of 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to unamortized amounts from Southern Company Gas' postretirement benefit plans prior to its acquisition. This shows that while both companies report prepaid pension costs, Southern Company explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from these figures, reflecting a more segmented approach to regulatory asset reporting post-acquisition. As a result, the two companies apply different reporting treatments for regulatory components tied to prepaid pension benefit costs, with SO maintaining a more detailed exclusion of regulatory assets.",

In contrast, SO consolidates unrecognized amounts into **net regulatory assets/liabilities** (e.g., $203 million in 2023), reflecting a more integrated approach where these amounts are directly tied to regulatory cost recovery mechanisms.

It incorrectly states that NextEra Energy (NEE) reports $221 million in unrecognized losses in regulatory assets in 2023 and that Southern Company (SO) has $203 million in net regulatory assets/liabilities in 2023. These figures are not present in the ground truth and contradict the original answer, which specifies that SO excluded $24 million and $32 million in regulatory assets related to postretirement benefit plans in 2023 and 2022, respectively. NEE’s $221 million figure and SO’s $203 million figure are entirely fabricated or misattributed. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: no dollar amounts in the LLM answer match the ground truth. The original answer focuses on SO excluding specific amounts from prepaid pension costs due to acquisition-related accounting, but the LLM invents different numbers and contexts. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in that it attempts to contrast two regulatory reporting models—one separating AOCI and regulatory assets (NEE) versus an integrated model (SO)—but this framework is not supported by the ground truth. The original answer does not mention AOCI or amortization for NEE, nor does it state that SO consolidates into net regulatory assets/liabilities. Instead, the key distinction is that SO explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from prepaid pension costs post-acquisition, while NEE includes unrecognized amounts in regulatory assets. The LLM fails to identify this critical nuance and misrepresents both companies’ practices. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses regulatory asset reporting differences in pension accounting, which is relevant, but the incorrect data and mischaracterized practices severely undermine factual correctness. Due to major factual and quantitative errors, the correctness score is low at 3, with correspondingly low quantitative accuracy (2) and moderate qualitative accuracy (4) due to plausible but incorrect reasoning.",

      "original_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production, which results in a more revenue-aligned expense pattern. In contrast, Netflix expenses participations and residuals in line with an accelerated amortization pattern, expecting more upfront viewing, with over 90% of a content asset amortized within four years. This leads to Netflix recognizing a larger portion of expenses earlier in the product life cycle compared to Disney, which adjusts expenses dynamically based on ongoing revenue performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney amortizes individually monetized content expenses based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues), spreading expenses proportionally to revenue recognition over the product life cycle. In contrast, Netflix uses an accelerated amortization method for content assets, recognizing higher expenses upfront due to anticipated upfront viewing, which front-loads expense recognition.

(1) All factual elements are correct: Disney uses a revenue-based amortization method tied to the ratio of current to estimated remaining total revenues, aligning expenses with revenue recognition. Netflix employs an accelerated amortization pattern due to expected upfront viewing, leading to front-loaded expenses. (2) There are no numeric inaccuracies; although the LLM does not explicitly state 'over 90% of a content asset amortized within four years' (a specific quantitative point in the original), it correctly describes the accelerated nature of Netflix's model without contradicting this fact.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly contrasting two companies' amortization approaches and their impact on expense timing across the product life cycle.

This leads to an incorrect combined total: the LLM calculates $506M - $104M = $402M, whereas the correct sum is $506M - $65M = $441M. The Amgen figure ($506 million) is correct. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM's incorrect inputs but are factually wrong due to the use of incorrect source data. The arithmetic of $506M - $104M = $402M is accurate, but based on false premises.

How might analysts interpret the difference in debt valuation approaches between CL and PM in terms of financial reporting conservatism and interest expense recognition?",
      "original_answer": "Analysts may interpret CL's reporting, where the carrying value of long-term debt ($8,239 million) exceeds its fair value ($7,862 million), as indicative of debt issued at a premium or a decline in market interest rates, which increases the fair value of fixed-rate debt. This suggests CL's financial reporting reflects a more conservative approach by maintaining a higher carrying value on the balance sheet. In contrast, PM's fair value step-up adjustment for inventories ($146 million) and the $(107) million purchase price adjustment amortized into interest expense suggest that PM's debt was initially recorded at a discount post-acquisition, leading to higher interest expense recognition over time. This indicates PM's approach reflects the impact of acquisition accounting on interest costs, which may affect earnings volatility. Therefore, the difference in valuation approaches reflects contrasting capital structure strategies and reporting conservatism, with CL showing a market-based valuation decline and PM experiencing acquisition-driven expense increases.",

In contrast, Philip Morris (PM) recognizes a $107 million purchase price adjustment for debt, amortized as incremental interest expense, which directly impacts its interest expense recognition.

It correctly identifies Colgate's carrying value ($8,239 million) and fair value ($7,862 million) of long-term debt and notes that the carrying value exceeds fair value. However, it mischaracterizes this as a sign of 'market concerns about future interest rate risks or creditworthiness,' which contradicts standard interpretation: when carrying value > fair value, it typically means debt was issued at a premium or market rates have risen, not falling — the ground truth correctly identifies this as potentially due to declining market interest rates increasing the fair value of fixed-rate debt. This is a key conceptual error. (2) For Philip Morris, the LLM incorrectly refers to a '$107 million purchase price adjustment for debt' — the ground truth specifies a $(107) million amortized adjustment (i.e., negative, indicating a discount), which the LLM misrepresents as positive. This flips the economic meaning: a negative adjustment implies debt was recorded at a discount, increasing interest expense over time, but the LLM fails to clarify the sign or direction correctly. Additionally, the $146 million inventory step-up is completely omitted, breaking the multi-hop synthesis required. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in linking fair value differences to conservatism and interest expense recognition, but it misattributes causality and omits acquisition accounting context critical to PM’s case. The conclusion that CL 'may understate interest expenses' is speculative and not supported by the data provided; CL does not amortize fair value differences into interest expense under GAAP, so this is not a conservatism issue. (4) Quantitative accuracy is moderate: dollar amounts for CL are correct, PM’s $107 million is directionally wrong (sign error), and the inventory step-up is missing. Qualitative accuracy suffers due to flawed logic and omission of key multi-hop elements (inventory step-up, acquisition accounting). Contextual relevance is high — the response stays on topic and attempts the correct comparison.

      "original_answer": "Duke Energy Corporation paid $202 million and NextEra Energy, Inc. paid $1,034 million in cash for interest, net of amount capitalized, in 2023. Combined, they paid $1,236 million. Duke's capital expenditures were $961 million, while NextEra's were $9,302 million, making their combined capital expenditures $10,263 million.

This total is significantly lower than their respective capital expenditures for the year: **NextEra's capital expenditures were $9,302 million**, and **Duke Energy's were $961 million**.

      "question": "How does the allocation of production overhead in capitalized content costs differ between Disney and Netflix, based on their amortization strategies and content monetization models?",
      "original_answer": "Disney allocates production overhead to capitalized content costs for produced films and television content, and amortizes these costs based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for content monetized individually, such as theatrical films or titles sold to third parties. For group-monetized content (e.g., content used on DTC services or Linear Networks), Disney amortizes the costs based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line pattern. In contrast, Netflix also capitalizes production overhead for produced content and amortizes it over the shorter of the contractual window or estimated period of use (typically up to ten years), using an accelerated basis driven by expected viewing patterns. Netflix's amortization is not tied to revenue ratios but rather to viewing behavior, with over 90% of a title's cost typically amortized within four years. This reflects a difference in monetization focus: Disney aligns amortization with revenue realization, while Netflix aligns it with consumption patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney and Netflix differ in their amortization strategies and content monetization models. Disney allocates production overhead to capitalized content costs and amortizes them based on the content's monetization strategy: **individual** (e.g., theatrical releases or third-party licenses) use revenue-based amortization tied to estimated remaining revenues, while **group** assets (e.g., DTC streaming) are amortized using projected usage, often accelerated. Netflix, in contrast, amortizes capitalized content costs (including production overhead) over the shorter of the contractual window or 10 years, using an **accelerated basis** aligned with its subscription-based model, which monetizes content as a group. Disney’s approach emphasizes revenue ratios for individual assets and usage patterns for group assets, while Netflix’s fixed-period amortization reflects its aggregated, subscription-driven monetization.",

(1) It correctly identifies that Disney uses revenue-based amortization (ratio of current to ultimate revenues) for individually monetized content (e.g., theatrical films, third-party licenses) and projected usage (often accelerated or straight-line) for group-monetized content like DTC or linear networks. It also correctly states that Netflix amortizes over the shorter of contractual term or 10 years using an accelerated basis aligned with viewing patterns. (2) There are no numeric values in the LLM answer, but the original answer includes the 'over 90% within four years' metric for Netflix—this specific quantitative benchmark is missing in the LLM response, which prevents a perfect score. However, the mention of 'accelerated basis' and alignment with viewing behavior implies this pattern, so the omission is minor.

The sum of $506M + $12M = $518M is calculated accurately. (2) However, the comparison statement contains a minor but notable error: the LLM claims the sum ($518 million) is '$1 million less' than Amgen’s provision for income taxes ($519 million), which is factually correct in arithmetic but contradicts the original answer’s conclusion that the sum is 'greater than' the provision. This is a logical inconsistency because $518M is actually $1 million less than $519M, meaning the correct comparison should be that it is slightly less, not greater. Therefore, the original answer appears to have an error in logic or typo, while the LLM answer provides the mathematically accurate comparison. Upon fact-checking, $518M < $519M, so the LLM's statement is quantitatively and logically correct, whereas the ground truth contains a factual error in its conclusion.

It added insightful context by comparing amortization to interest expenses—TSLA ($415M amortization vs $89M interest) and HD ($250M vs $127M)—which, while not in the original answer, is a reasonable qualitative extension supported by typical lease accounting principles. This enhances the analysis without contradicting the ground truth. (4) The core answer fully addresses both parts of the question: the quantitative total and the strategic implication.

It also appropriately highlights risks such as disallowed costs, refunds, and earnings impact, which align with the ground truth. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM adds a reference to a 'critical audit matter regarding rate regulation risks'—a detail not present in the original ground truth. While plausible and contextually relevant, this specific framing is an addition not directly supported by the provided truth. Otherwise, the answer is semantically equivalent, comprehensive, and highly relevant. Hence, a score of 9/10 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, with full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

      "original_answer": "The combined value of Wireless Licenses for T and VZ in 2024 is $159,612 million ($2,999 million for T and $156,613 million for VZ). T amortizes its wireless licenses over a weighted-average life of 21.6 years, having accumulated $696 million in amortization by 2024, which suggests a more conservative approach to asset value retention. In contrast, VZ reports its wireless licenses at nearly full value with no accumulated amortization disclosed, indicating a potentially indefinite life or a different accounting policy, which may signal stronger long-term value retention for its licenses.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined value of Wireless Licenses held by AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) in 2024 is **$281,688 million** ($156,613 million for AT&T and $125,075 million for Verizon). AT&T amortizes its Wireless Licenses over a weighted average life of 21.6 years, reducing their book value over time. In contrast, Verizon’s Wireless Licenses are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and are not amortized, preserving their carrying value longer. This difference implies Verizon’s licenses may retain higher long-term value compared to AT&T’s, which face gradual value erosion due to amortization.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in the quantitative values. It reports a combined value of $281,688 million, which is incorrect. The correct combined value is $159,612 million ($2,999 million for T and $156,613 million for VZ). The LLM swapped the values between T and VZ and used an incorrect value for Verizon (VZ), stating $125,075 million instead of $156,613 million, and incorrectly assigned $156,613 million to AT&T (T), which actually holds only $2,999 million in wireless licenses. This results in a grossly inflated total. (2) The calculation of the combined value is therefore also wrong: $156,613 + $125,075 = $281,688 million is mathematically correct but based on incorrect inputs. The correct sum is $2,999 + $156,613 = $159,612 million. (3) On qualitative reasoning, the LLM correctly identifies that AT&T amortizes its licenses over 21.6 years and that Verizon does not amortize, treating them as indefinite-lived, which aligns with the ground truth's implication about value retention. This part of the multi-hop reasoning—linking amortization policy to long-term value retention—is sound and contextually appropriate. (4) Entity identification is partially correct: T and VZ are correctly interpreted as AT&T and Verizon, and the years and metrics (amortization practices) are correctly attributed in terms of policy, though not in financial magnitude. The contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent of the response match the question, but the severe numerical inaccuracies—especially the reversal and misassignment of license values—undermine the correctness score. Due to these critical quantitative errors, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low, despite reasonable qualitative logic.",

The LLM blurs the distinction by implying MO uses undiscounted cash flows for long-lived assets, which is not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth. (2) All numeric values (10% discount rate, 2% growth rate) are accurate and correctly attributed to MO. No dollar amounts or dates are incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies and compares their impairment testing approaches and outcomes.

However, AT&T does amortize its wireless licenses in Mexico over a 25-year average economic life. In contrast, Verizon (VZ) treats its wireless licenses as indefinite-lived intangible assets and also does not amortize them, testing them annually for impairment. The difference in amortization policy means that AT&T recognizes periodic depreciation expense for its Mexican licenses, which affects earnings, while Verizon does not record any amortization expense for its licenses. This results in differing financial impacts on asset valuation and income statements, with AT&T experiencing a gradual reduction in asset value over time for Mexican licenses, while Verizon’s wireless license values remain on the balance sheet unless impaired.",

AT&T amortizes its Mexican wireless licenses over 25 years, while Verizon’s wireless licenses (primarily FCC-issued) are indefinite-lived and tested using discounted cash flow and market approaches. The financial impact on asset valuation depends on impairment tests: both companies’ 2024 assessments concluded fair value exceeded carrying value, resulting in **no impairment charges**.

The LLM reverses the causal logic. (2) For DIS, the LLM mentions increased costs due to 'cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar' and 'ICC tournaments', which are not mentioned in the ground truth. Instead, the actual data shows a 1% increase in total programming costs driven by Hulu's $317M increase (from $8,265M to $8,582M), partially offset by decreases in Disney+. These specific numbers are completely missing in the LLM answer, failing the quantitative accuracy check. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing CMCSA and DIS cost trends—but relies on incorrect drivers (cricket, timing shifts) rather than the correct synthesis of event absence (CMCSA) vs. streaming cost increases (Hulu). (4) The contextual relevance is high as it addresses sports programming costs and streaming expenditures for both companies, but the qualitative accuracy is reduced by incorrect causal explanations and missing quantitative details. The absence of any numbers for DIS's cost changes severely undermines the answer's correctness despite capturing a directional trend (increase vs. decrease).",

(1) On quantitative accuracy: There are no explicit numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) in either the ground truth or LLM answer, so no numeric errors are present—this aspect is neutral, hence scored as 10. (2) However, the qualitative accuracy is low: The LLM incorrectly attributes 'Supercharging' and 'after-sales services' as core revenue generators in GM's Automotive Segment, which is not supported by GM's 10-K. GM’s Automotive Segment revenue primarily comes from vehicle sales and transactions with GM Financial (e.g., wholesale financing, leasing), not Supercharging (a Tesla offering) or extensive after-sales services. Conversely, the LLM incorrectly downplays Tesla's broader automotive services—Tesla’s 10-K explicitly includes services, used vehicle sales, Supercharging, and regulatory credits as part of Automotive revenue, which the LLM omits or mischaracterizes. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: The LLM conflates GM’s joint venture contributions (correctly mentioned) with a broader service model that GM does not claim in its 10-K, while failing to recognize that Tesla’s Automotive Segment is more diversified than just 'electric vehicles and regulatory credits.' Additionally, the LLM incorrectly implies that services like Supercharging are not part of Tesla’s Automotive Segment, when they are. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses the comparative structure and identifies relevant companies and segments, but misattributes revenue sources, leading to an incorrect synthesis. The core distinction—GM’s reliance on captive financing via GM Financial versus Tesla’s integrated direct sales, services, and regulatory credits—is missed entirely. Thus, while some surface-level facts (e.g., China JVs for GM) are correct, the fundamental business model differences are misrepresented, warranting a mid-low correctness score.",

The combined decrease in total current assets is reported as $2,705 million, while the ground truth is $2,750 million. This $45 million difference likely stems from rounding or data extraction variation, but it is small relative to the total. All other numbers are accurate: Costco's decline of $1,633 million and Altria's $1,072 million are correct, and Costco's $3,794 million drop in cash and cash equivalents matches the ground truth. (2) Calculations: The sum of Costco's ($1,633M) and Altria's ($1,072M) declines should be $2,705M, which the LLM correctly computes. However, the ground truth states $2,750M, indicating a possible error in the source data used for the ground truth or a minor data inconsistency. Given that the component values are consistent with the LLM's total, the LLM's calculation is internally sound. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is excellent: the LLM correctly identifies and synthesizes data across two companies (Costco and Altria), compares a sub-component (cash at Costco) to the total current asset decline at another company (Altria), and draws the correct qualitative conclusion that Costco's cash drop exceeds Altria's total decline. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more detail (providing absolute values for current assets), and the reasoning and entity identification (tickers, metrics, years) are flawless.

Similarly, the LLM reports the combined fair value for securities maturing after 5 through 10 years as $9,447 million, while the correct value is $3,337 million. These errors affect both the absolute values and the comparative analysis.

For the 5–10 year range, the LLM reports $6,110 million (Company C) and $3,337 million (PYPL), summing to $9,447 million, but the correct combined value is $3,337 million—indicating that the LLM may have double-counted or misattributed PYPL’s value as a sum rather than a component. The calculation of '10.6 times higher' is based on incorrect totals and is therefore invalid.

The combined total receivables are stated as $985M in the LLM answer (implied sum), but ground truth is $266M ($127M + $139M), and the LLM fails to compute or mention the correct combined percentage of affiliated receivables (87.3% of $133M — note: $133M appears to be a typo in the original answer; correct sum is $266M, so 43.6% — but the original answer claims $116M out of $133M, which is inconsistent).

(2) For Disney, the LLM correctly reports Hulu’s 4% cost increase from $8,265 million to $8,582 million and Disney+’s 3% decrease from $5,694 million to $5,499 million, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it introduces a new claim—Disney’s total programming costs increased by 1% from $13,959 million to $14,081 million—which requires summing Hulu and Disney+ costs. While $8,265 + $5,694 = $13,959 and $8,582 + $5,499 = $14,081 is mathematically correct, the original answer does not mention this total or percentage change, making this an unsupported inference. (3) The reasoning about Disney reallocating investment toward Hulu and reducing Disney+ spending is consistent with the ground truth and shows sound multi-hop synthesis. However, the claim that Comcast’s reduction was due to 'cost-efficiency measures' and 'film cost impairments' contradicts the original explanation—Comcast’s cost decrease was attributed to external disruptions (Writers Guild and SAG strikes), not internal restructuring. This misrepresents the cause and strategy. (4) Despite correct identification of entities (Comcast, Disney, Hulu, Disney+, 2023), the inclusion of fabricated numbers and incorrect causal reasoning severely undermines factual accuracy. The answer is contextually relevant and addresses all parts of the question, but the quantitative inaccuracies and flawed reasoning about Comcast’s strategy justify a low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "The combined value of non-cash additions related to lease financing for Chevron and ExxonMobil in 2024 is $3,869 million. Chevron reported non-cash additions of $2,205 million for right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified lease liabilities, while ExxonMobil disclosed non-cash additions of $1,664 million in its reconciliation of consolidated assets. Both companies include these non-cash additions as part of their broader capital investment strategies, with Chevron explicitly linking these additions to operating and finance leases, and ExxonMobil incorporating them into its total additions to property, plant, and equipment. This demonstrates a shared emphasis on leveraging lease financing as a capital-efficient method to support asset growth in the energy sector.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined non-cash additions related to lease financing for Chevron and ExxonMobil in 2024 totaled **$4,490 million**. Both companies disclosed non-cash additions of **$2,245 million** each (comprising $2,205 million for operating leases and $40 million for finance leases). This reflects their strategic use of lease financing to expand operations without significant upfront cash outlays, aligning with capital investment strategies that prioritize liquidity management and asset flexibility. Lease financing enables both firms to acquire critical assets (e.g., drilling rigs, terminals) while maintaining financial agility, consistent with their focus on long-term growth and operational efficiency in the energy sector.",

The LLM also misattributes identical figures to both companies, which contradicts the original data. (3) While the multi-hop reasoning framework is present—linking lease financing to capital investment strategies—the synthesis is flawed due to incorrect data.

JNJ's 2021 Immunology revenue is reported as $16.75 billion (close to the true $16.8 billion), which is acceptable within rounding, but LLY's figures are severely incorrect: LLM reports $3.36 billion in 2021 (vs. actual $1.88 billion) and $2.46 billion in 2020 (vs. actual $1.37 billion). This misrepresents LLY’s revenue and growth trajectory.

In contrast, Tesla does not disclose a present value for its operating leases and instead reports gross lease receivables of $4,577 million.

The reasoning and qualitative assessment are sound and align with the ground truth. (2) However, the LLM answer fails to include any of the specific quantitative figures provided in the original answer: HD’s present value of $6,183 million, total lease payments of $7,095 million, imputed interest of $912 million, and Tesla’s gross lease receivables of $4,577 million. These omissions significantly reduce quantitative accuracy, as the question specifically references 2022 operating lease obligations and the original answer relies on precise data from that year. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is conceptually correct—the model synthesizes the difference in accounting treatment and correctly infers that this limits comparability. However, it does not demonstrate use of actual disclosed numbers from both companies, which is central to the ground truth answer. (4) The correctness score is 7 because the core explanation is accurate and the conclusion is valid, but the absence of specific numbers from both companies limits completeness and factual richness.

In 2021, COP reported a net book value of $52 billion for proved oil and gas properties and recorded $7.0 billion in DD&A expense. XOM also uses the unit-of-production method to amortize acquisition costs of proved properties, based on total proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes. This shared method highlights a similar dependence on proved reserve estimates to determine asset value depletion, though COP emphasizes internal engineering judgment while XOM outlines a more structured policy tied directly to production volumes.",

ExxonMobil (XOM) employs the same unit-of-production method for amortizing acquisition costs of proved properties, as stated in its 10-K. Both companies align their DD&A calculations with proved reserves, though XOM may use straight-line depreciation for certain assets if the unit-of-production method does not equitably allocate costs.

(2) While no incorrect numbers are stated (so no factual errors), the absence of the $52B and $7.0B figures—critical to assessing the scale and impact of reserve estimates on DD&A for COP in 2021—results in a partial failure on quantitative completeness. The LLM does not fabricate numbers but fails to include them. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: it correctly synthesizes that both companies use the unit-of-production method and links this to reliance on reserve estimates.

The LLM incorrectly sums both Available-for-Sale (AFS) and Held-to-Maturity (HTM) securities for Company C ($30,123M + $26,782M = $56,905M), but the ground truth indicates only $28,517M as the correct 'after 10 years' fair value for Company C.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies (DUK and SO), extracts the correct metric (receivables from affiliated companies) and compares it to total current assets for each in 2021, as required. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor rounding in DUK’s percentage. This does not affect factual correctness, as 6.3% is standard rounding of 6.35%. All entities, years, and metrics are correctly identified. The slight loss in qualitative accuracy is due to not explicitly stating the unrounded 6.35%, but this is not necessary for correctness. Overall, the answer is highly accurate, complete, and relevant.",

More critically, the LLM claims DIS's Theme Parks revenue is not available in the provided documents, which contradicts the ground truth that includes DIS's $1,096 million (10.0%) growth, meaning the data was accessible. The combined revenue of $16,488 million is completely omitted. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: while $8,947 million may align with CMCSA's 2023 revenue (if inferred from growth), no calculation of combined revenue is attempted, and DIS's revenue and growth figures are dismissed despite being part of the ground truth. The growth percentages (18.6% and 10.0%) are not mentioned at all. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not synthesize data across both companies, incorrectly asserting DIS data was missing.

JNJ's oncology revenue was $14.5 billion in 2021, showing a 17.6% increase compared to the prior year, driven by strong sales of DARZALEX, ERLEADA, and IMBRUVICA. LLY's oncology revenue was $3.0288 billion in 2021, showing a smaller growth rate of approximately 8.5% compared to the prior year (calculated from $2.7921 billion in 2020).

LLY's growth was more modest, fueled by Verzenio, Cyramza, and Tyvyt, but faced challenges from patent expirations and biosimilar competition, particularly with REMICADE.

The combined revenue is therefore approximately $17.5 billion, close to the exact $17.5288 billion. The growth rates are mostly accurate: LLM reports 17.6% for JNJ (exact match) and 8.4% for LLY, whereas the ground truth is ~8.5% (calculated from $2.7921B in 2020 to $3.0288B in 2021), a negligible difference likely due to rounding. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high: all major figures are correct or very close; only LLY's revenue is slightly rounded down, and growth rate is off by 0.1 percentage points. The sum of revenues is not explicitly stated but can be inferred. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes oncology revenues from two companies in the same year, compares growth dynamics, and attributes drivers appropriately. It correctly identifies JNJ's key drugs (DARZALEX, ERLEADA, IMBRUVICA) and notes competitive pressure, aligning with context. For LLY, it correctly highlights Verzenio and Cyramza as growth drivers but incorrectly mentions REMICADE, which is not an oncology drug and not part of LLY's portfolio (it's JNJ's immunology drug). This is a minor factual error in drug attribution. (4) Despite this minor error, the overall reasoning, entity identification (except REMICADE), and synthesis are strong. The answer addresses both parts of the question: total revenue (implicitly) and growth dynamics. Wording differs but meaning is semantically equivalent. Scores reflect high accuracy with a small deduction in quantitative and qualitative scores due to the slight revenue rounding and incorrect mention of REMICADE.",

This approach may impact the accuracy of fair value estimates and influence DHR's U.S. and non-U.S. pension contribution requirements of $10 million and $48 million, respectively, in 2022. In contrast, MDT values private equity investments using year-end net asset values of partnerships, with unfunded commitments totaling $204 million as of April 29, 2022, and an estimated liquidation period of one to 15 years. MDT’s methodology may affect its ability to rebalance asset allocations closer to targets over the intermediate term, especially given the strong equity performance during the fiscal year. Therefore, DHR’s reliance on market-based adjustments and MDT’s use of NAV practical expedient create different liquidity profiles and contribution planning assumptions for their retirement benefit plans.",

Medtronic (MDT) values private equity investments using net asset value (NAV) based on fund managers' inputs, which may incorporate discounted cash flows, market multiples, or third-party appraisals. This approach impacts the funded status of pension plans, as lower fair values could increase deficits, requiring higher contributions to meet obligations. Conversely, more conservative valuations might reduce liquidity, necessitating earlier contributions.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies and omissions. It fails to report the specific valuation methodologies used by DHR as stated in the ground truth—DHR uses market multiples, third-party appraisals, or quoted prices with adjustments based on operating results, not unspecified 'details.' The LLM incorrectly claims that DHR's methodology is not detailed, when in fact it is clearly outlined in the original answer. For MDT, while it correctly identifies the use of NAV, it misses the critical detail that MDT uses year-end NAV as a practical expedient and omits the $204 million in unfunded commitments as of April 29, 2022, and the 1–15 year liquidation period, which are central to liquidity implications. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM omits all key numbers: DHR’s U.S. ($10M) and non-U.S. ($48M) pension contributions, MDT’s $204M unfunded commitments, and the specific date (April 29, 2022). These are major omissions that undermine the answer’s accuracy. No calculations are attempted, but the failure to report required figures results in a very low quantitative accuracy score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The question requires comparing how differing valuation methods (DHR’s market-based adjustments vs. MDT’s NAV practical expedient) affect liquidity and contribution requirements. The LLM fails to make this comparison correctly, misrepresents DHR’s approach, and does not link MDT’s long liquidation period or unfunded commitments to constrained rebalancing, as stated in the ground truth. It also incorrectly suggests that lower valuations increase contributions without acknowledging DHR’s actual contribution figures. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer discusses valuation impact on pension funding, which is relevant—but due to factual errors and missing multi-hop synthesis, it does not fully or accurately address the question. The conclusion lacks the nuanced contrast present in the original answer regarding how each firm’s method creates different liquidity and planning assumptions.",

The directional trends are accurate: Capital One's rate increased (implied by 'higher rate' and context), and PayPal's decreased from 7.2% in 2023. 2) All numeric values (5.88%, 4.5%) are correct. The 2023 PayPal rate (7.2%) is accurately referenced in the LLM answer, even though not repeated in the original answer, confirming correct multi-hop retrieval. Calculations for differences are accurate. 3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes contrasting credit trends: Capital One's deterioration is linked to the Walmart Program Termination removing loss-sharing, a valid contextual factor.

      "original_answer": "The combined total cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized, for Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) in 2023 is $3,009 million. In 2022, the combined total was $1,921 million. This represents an increase of $1,088 million, or 56.6%, in interest payments between the two companies from 2022 to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined total of cash paid for interest, net of capitalized amounts, for Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) and NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) in 2023 was **$2,991 million** ($528 million for DUK and $2,463 million for NEE). This compares to **$1,921 million** in 2022 ($546 million for DUK and $1,375 million for NEE), reflecting an increase of **$1,070 million** year-over-year.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the companies (DUK and NEE), the metric (cash paid for interest, net of capitalized amounts), and the years (2022 and 2023), which shows strong entity and contextual accuracy. It also correctly reports the 2022 combined total as $1,921 million, matching the ground truth. However, the 2023 combined total is reported as $2,991 million, while the ground truth is $3,009 million—a discrepancy of $18 million. This error stems from incorrect individual values: the LLM states DUK paid $528 million and NEE $2,463 million in 2023, but the correct values (from the knowledge graph) must sum to $3,009 million (actual: DUK $546M, NEE $2,463M → $3,009M). Thus, DUK’s 2023 interest payment is understated by $18 million. The calculated year-over-year increase is $1,070 million, but the correct increase is $1,088 million. The percentage increase (56.6%) is missing from the LLM answer, though the absolute change is approximately correct. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the $18M error in DUK’s 2023 interest payment, which cascades into the total and delta calculations. While $1,921M for 2022 is correct, the 2023 total and difference are off. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly identifies the need to sum across two companies and two years and performs a year-over-year comparison. The logic and structure are appropriate. (4) Scores reflect mostly correct reasoning and context, with a moderate penalty on quantitative accuracy due to material (but not major) numerical errors. The answer is semantically close but not fully factually accurate.",

      "question": "How do the audit procedures used by Deloitte & Touche LLP to assess the recoverability of regulatory asset balances at Duke Energy (DUK) compare to the procedures used for Southern Company Gas (SO), and what specific regulatory uncertainties were evaluated in both audits that could impact future financial recoverability?",
      "original_answer": "In both audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP evaluated the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by inquiring about changes in regulatory orders and comparing recorded balances to independently developed expectations. At Duke Energy (DUK), auditors performed trend analyses and obtained management representations asserting the probability of recovery. For Southern Company Gas (SO), auditors extended these procedures by reading regulatory orders from multiple states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia), inspecting regulatory filings for intervenor challenges, and testing the completeness and accuracy of capitalized project costs. The regulatory uncertainties evaluated for SO included the risk that the Commissions might not approve full recovery of incurred costs or invested capital, and potential future rate reductions or refunds, which could significantly impact financial recoverability.",
      "llm_answer": "Deloitte & Touche LLP used similar audit procedures for both Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Company Gas (SO) to assess regulatory asset recoverability, focusing on evaluating management's controls, reviewing regulatory orders, and inspecting filings. However, SO's audit included additional steps to evaluate intervenor challenges to capital project costs, while DUK emphasized trend analysis and disclosures. Both audits addressed uncertainties related to regulatory commissions potentially disallowing costs, requiring refunds, or limiting rate recovery, with SO's procedures incorporating more detailed scrutiny of specific project costs and regulatory proceedings.",

It correctly identifies that both audits involved reviewing regulatory orders and filings, with DUK emphasizing trend analysis and SO including additional scrutiny of intervenor challenges and project costs. The regulatory uncertainties—such as disallowed costs, refunds, and limited rate recovery—are accurately summarized. However, the LLM omits specific details present in the original answer: (1) the explicit mention that SO's audit involved reading regulatory orders from four specific states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, Virginia), and (2) the fact that auditors tested the completeness and accuracy of capitalized project costs at SO, which is a key procedural difference. While the LLM notes 'more detailed scrutiny,' it lacks this precise element. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect, hence 10), and the reasoning is sound and contextually relevant.

      "question": "How does the high proportion of fixed-price contract revenue for Boeing (86% in 2021) compound the financial risks described by Lockheed Martin regarding fixed-price development programs, particularly in light of cost estimation challenges and potential losses?",
      "original_answer": "Boeing derived 86% of its revenue in 2021 from fixed-price contracts, which exposes it to cost overruns and estimation risks. Lockheed Martin explicitly states that fixed-price contracts, especially for complex development programs, increase financial risk because cost and timing are difficult to estimate, often leading to losses. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin notes that bidding on cost-reimbursable development work with follow-on fixed-price production options increases the risk of lower margins or losses because contractors must estimate production costs before development is complete. Given Boeing’s heavy reliance on fixed-price contracts, this exposure significantly amplifies the financial risks Lockheed Martin describes, particularly in environments where cost estimation is inherently uncertain and inflationary pressures may further compress margins.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's 86% fixed-price contract revenue in 2021 amplifies financial risks tied to cost estimation challenges and potential losses, as highlighted by Lockheed Martin. Fixed-price contracts require upfront pricing with limited renegotiation, exposing Boeing to significant margin compression or losses if development programs face unforeseen technical, schedule, or cost overruns. This aligns with Lockheed Martin's concerns about the inherent volatility of fixed-price development programs, where inaccurate cost projections and performance uncertainties can lead to financial setbacks, as Boeing's historical losses on such contracts demonstrate. The lack of flexibility to adjust pricing exacerbates these risks, particularly in complex programs where cost overruns are common.",

      "original_answer": "Cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Adobe's products could lead to customer loss due to security concerns, as stated in their 2022 10-K filing, which mentions that 'actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and systems may harm our reputation or lead to claims against us, and could lead some customers to stop using certain products or services.' Similarly, IBM's 2022 10-K filing notes that 'if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers... could be impacted.' Both companies face risks where reputational damage from security or brand issues could reduce customer retention, thereby weakening their competitive positioning in the Information Technology sector. If both companies experience reputational damage simultaneously, the cumulative effect could be a shift in customer preference toward more secure or trusted competitors.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe's cybersecurity vulnerabilities risk customer retention by undermining trust in product security, potentially leading to reduced renewals, lost customers, and competitive disadvantage. IBM's brand reputation risks, such as damage from cybersecurity incidents or ethical controversies, could similarly erode customer confidence and loyalty. Combined, these factors may weaken both companies' competitive positioning in the IT sector by increasing churn, reducing market share, and heightening vulnerability to reputational harm in an industry where security and trust are critical differentiators.",

(1) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default since no numbers were misstated. (2) The LLM correctly identifies both Adobe's cybersecurity vulnerabilities and IBM's brand reputation risks as threats to customer retention, aligning with the 2022 10-K disclosures cited in the original answer. While the LLM does not quote the filings verbatim, it accurately captures the cause-effect logic: security flaws erode trust, which increases churn. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—linking each company's distinct risk (security vs. brand) to customer retention and then synthesizing their combined impact on competitive positioning—is sound and well-executed. The conclusion that both companies may face increased vulnerability to competitors due to eroded trust matches the original answer’s implication. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit citation to the 2022 10-K filings, which were mentioned in the ground truth. However, the substance is correct, and the omission does not constitute a factual error, so the correctness score is reduced slightly to 9 for incomplete provenance context.

      "question": "How does the volatility in 2024 refining margins, which both Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) depend on, influence their respective earnings given ExxonMobil's specific mention of a decrease in refining margins to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year historical range and Chevron's emphasis on the sensitivity of its forward-looking statements to changes in refining, marketing, and chemicals margins?",
      "original_answer": "Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) both highlight the importance of refining margins in influencing their earnings. According to Chevron's 2024 10-K filing, changes in refining, marketing, and chemicals margins are among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil specifically notes that its Energy Products segment earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins, which decreased in 2024 to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010–2019). This decline in refining margins would directly impact ExxonMobil’s earnings, as refining margins are a function of the difference between raw material costs and product prices, which are influenced by global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and other market dynamics. Since both companies depend on refining margins, the volatility in this financial metric affects their earnings outlooks, with ExxonMobil experiencing a measurable decline in margins that would constrain profitability, while Chevron's forward-looking projections become more uncertain due to this sensitivity.",
      "llm_answer": "The volatility in 2024 refining margins significantly impacts both Chevron and ExxonMobil's earnings. ExxonMobil's refining margins fell to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year historical range, reducing Energy Products earnings by $6,280 million due to supply outpacing demand, while Chevron's earnings were similarly hurt by weaker margins, with refining margin declines accounting for a $6.28 billion drag. Both companies emphasize the sensitivity of their financial performance to refining, marketing, and chemicals margins, with Chevron explicitly noting the uncertainty in forward-looking guidance tied to margin fluctuations. This volatility underscores the direct link between refining margin stability and their profitability.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer introduces specific dollar figures—$6,280 million and $6.28 billion—that are not present in the original answer or ground truth. There is no mention in the ground truth of any numerical earnings impact (in dollars or percentages) for either ExxonMobil or Chevron due to refining margin changes. These fabricated numbers severely undermine factual accuracy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low because the model invents precise financial impacts without basis in the provided truth. While $6.28 billion and $6,280 million are numerically equivalent, their presence is entirely unsupported by the source material. The ground truth only states that ExxonMobil’s margins declined to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010–2019), with no associated dollar impact. Chevron’s sensitivity is noted qualitatively, not quantitatively. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that both companies depend on refining margins, that ExxonMobil noted a decline to the middle of the pre-COVID range, and that Chevron emphasizes sensitivity in forward-looking statements. It synthesizes the connection between margin volatility and earnings impact appropriately. However, the addition of false quantitative claims breaks the chain of factual correctness. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses the core issue—how refining margin volatility affects earnings for both firms—and correctly references the relevant segments and disclosures. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct entity and concept identification but penalized for unsupported inferences.

      "original_answer": "CAT reported accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits of $2,757 million in 2023, while UNP reported accrued wages of $50 million in the same year. This significant difference suggests that CAT likely has a much larger workforce or different payroll timing compared to UNP, which could impact their respective short-term liabilities and cash flow management.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in accrued wages between Caterpillar (CAT) and Union Pacific (UNP) in 2023 reflects significant disparities in their employee compensation structures and operational scales. CAT's accrued wages for Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) were **$2,757 million** in 2023, while UNP reported **$61 million** for accrued wages. This vast gap is primarily due to CAT's larger workforce and broader operations, as ME&T is a major manufacturing and equipment business with extensive global operations. UNP, a railroad company, has a smaller workforce and lower compensation costs. The documents do not explicitly mention payroll cycle timing differences, but the scale of operations and employee base likely drives the disparity.",

However, it reports UNP's accrued wages as $61 million, whereas the original answer states $50 million, making this a factual error. This discrepancy affects the quantitative accuracy significantly. (2) The numbers for CAT are accurate, but the UNP figure is incorrect—$61M vs $50M is a material difference in the context of accrued liabilities and impacts the validity of the comparison. No calculations were required, but the comparison hinges on accurate values. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that the difference likely stems from CAT's larger workforce and broader operational scale compared to UNP, which aligns with the ground truth's interpretation. It appropriately avoids asserting payroll timing differences due to lack of explicit evidence. The multi-hop synthesis between two companies’ financial disclosures is logically handled. (4) Despite the incorrect UNP number, the overall interpretation and qualitative analysis remain reasonable and relevant.

This led to an incorrect total operating cash flow of $308 million instead of $223 million. Consequently, the difference was miscalculated as $168 million instead of the correct $253 million. (2) Number verification: Lease assets sum is correct ($266M + $210M = $476M). Operating cash flows: NVDA $154M is correct, but TXN is wrong (reported $154M vs. true $69M); correct sum is $154M + $69M = $223M, not $308M. Difference should be $476M - $223M = $253M, not $168M.

      "original_answer": "Johnson & Johnson reported $7,011 million in Neuroscience revenue for 2021, while Eli Lilly reported $614.8 million in U.S. Neuroscience revenue and $1,283.7 million in Outside U.S. Neuroscience revenue for a total of $1,898.5 million in 2021. Johnson & Johnson’s Neuroscience revenue increased by 7.1% from 2020 to 2021. Eli Lilly’s total Neuroscience revenue decreased from $487.3 million (U.S.) + $1,344.0 million (Outside U.S.) = $1,831.3 million in 2020 to $1,898.5 million in 2021, representing a 3.7% increase.

      "question": "How did changes in benchmark interest rates impact both GM's financial revenue and SBUX's interest rate hedging strategy in 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GM experienced a $1.7 billion increase in finance charge income and a $0.3 billion increase in investment income, both primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates. However, this also led to a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense due to higher effective interest rates on debt. Meanwhile, Starbucks reported that changes in fair value due to benchmark interest rates affected $350 million of its August 2029 notes, which were hedged using interest rate swaps. Therefore, while GM benefited from higher interest rates on income-generating assets, it faced higher financing costs, and SBUX actively managed interest rate exposure through hedging instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "The changes in benchmark interest rates in 2023 impacted GM's financial revenue by increasing finance charge income due to higher effective yields on its portfolio, but also raising interest expense on debt, which reduced EBT-adjusted results. For SBUX, the provided documents do not include information about its interest rate hedging strategy, as the relevant sections (Notes 11 and 12) focus on deferred revenue, equity, and share repurchases, with no mention of hedging activities.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect and incomplete. It correctly notes that higher benchmark interest rates increased GM's finance charge income and interest expense, but it fails to provide any of the specific quantitative figures from the ground truth: a $1.7 billion increase in finance charge income, $0.3 billion in investment income, and $1.8 billion increase in interest expense. These omissions severely undermine factual accuracy. For SBUX, the LLM incorrectly claims that no information about hedging is available, when the ground truth explicitly states that $350 million of Starbucks' August 2029 notes were hedged using interest rate swaps, with fair value changes tied to benchmark rates. This is a major factual omission. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low because the answer includes no numbers at all, missing all key dollar amounts ($1.7B, $0.3B, $1.8B, $350M) and failing to support its claims with data. Even approximate values are absent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to synthesize information across GM and SBUX as required. It does not connect benchmark rate changes to both GM’s net financial revenue impact and SBUX’s hedging strategy. Instead, it dismisses SBUX’s data availability without justification, indicating a failure in information retrieval or integration. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the general topic—interest rate impacts on GM and SBUX—but fails on execution, especially for SBUX. The mention of EBT-adjusted results and document sections not covering hedging is speculative and unsupported, further reducing accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "The combined 2023 year-end balance of Accrued Wages for Caterpillar Inc. and Union Pacific Corporation is $2,807 million. This is calculated by summing Caterpillar's Accrued Wages, Salaries and Employee Benefits of $2,757 million and Union Pacific's Accrued Wages of $50 million.

Caterpillar Inc.'s Accrued Wages balance alone was **$2,757 million**, meaning the combined total is **exactly double Caterpillar's individual balance**.

The combined 2023 year-end Accrued Wages balance is stated as $5,514 million, but the ground truth is $2,807 million. This incorrect total stems from the false assumption that Union Pacific's Accrued Wages equals Caterpillar's ($2,757 million), when in fact Union Pacific's balance is $50 million. The claim that the combined total is 'exactly double' Caterpillar's balance is therefore incorrect. (2) Caterpillar's individual balance of $2,757 million is correct, but Union Pacific's is misrepresented. The correct sum is $2,757M + $50M = $2,807M, not $5,514M. The percentage contribution of Caterpillar (98.2%) is omitted and replaced with an incorrect doubling narrative. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: while the model identifies the correct metric and year for Caterpillar, it fabricates Union Pacific's value instead of retrieving the correct $50 million figure. There is no evidence of proper synthesis across the two companies' filings. (4) Scores reflect that one key number (Caterpillar's balance) is correct, but the core calculation and comparative analysis are fundamentally wrong, severely undermining the answer's validity.

However, it fails entirely on the NVDA portion, claiming no data is available when the ground truth states that the combined remaining authorization is $19.24 billion. This implies NVDA’s remaining authorization must be $9.14 billion ($19.24B - $10.10B), which the model did not report or infer. Additionally, the LLM states no information is available about NVDA’s repurchase spending from January 31, 2022, through March 17, 2022, while the ground truth clearly states $1.75 billion was spent—this critical fact is missing. (2) Quantitatively, only the $10.10 billion for TXN is correct; the failure to report $9.14 billion for NVDA and $1.75 billion spent results in major omissions. Calculations were not attempted, and the sum of $19.24 billion was not derived or mentioned. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model should have retrieved NVDA’s authorization and repurchase activity from filings covering the relevant period and combined it with TXN’s data. Instead, it defaulted to 'no information' rather than synthesizing across documents.

It falsely attributes ORCL's gross value of $17,258 million to ADBE's *net* value, reversing both the company and the metric (gross vs net). The correct combined net value is $18,758 million ($2,030M for ADBE + $21,536M for ORCL), but the LLM claims $17,258 million as ADBE's net value, which is factually wrong. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: ADBE's actual net value is $2,030 million, not $17,258 million; ORCL's net value is $21,536 million, which the LLM claims is unavailable. The sum is therefore completely off. The LLM incorrectly treats ORCL's gross investment ($17,258M) as ADBE's net value, indicating a fundamental data misattribution. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly extract, assign, or synthesize data for either company.

Duke Energy reported $202 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities, while NextEra Energy reported $2,909 million.

NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities totaled **$2,909 million**, while Duke Energy's amounted to **$234 million**. The significant disparity reflects NEE's greater exposure to long-term derivative obligations, driven by its extensive use of derivatives for hedging commodity prices, interest rates, and foreign currency risks.

The LLM's calculation of $2,909M (NEE) + $234M (DUK) = $3,143M is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but the input value for Duke Energy is incorrect. (2) The number for NextEra Energy ($2,909 million) is correct and matches the ground truth. However, the Duke Energy figure is off by $32 million, which leads to an incorrect combined total.

In contrast, LMT warns that a $100 million increase in environmental liabilities would result in an $87 million probable future recovery and a $13 million charge to earnings, indicating potential for increasing liability exposure depending on regulatory changes.

The ground truth states that Boeing's initial liability decreased from $652 million in 2020 to $11 million in 2021—a reduction of $641 million—not $789M to $742M as claimed by the LLM. Additionally, the LLM falsely claims that LMT had a $47 million reduction in environmental liabilities, which contradicts the ground truth: LMT did not report a reduction but instead disclosed that a $100 million increase in liabilities would lead to an $87 million probable recovery and a $13 million charge, indicating potential liability growth. (2) All key numbers are wrong: Boeing’s figures are off by hundreds of millions, and LMT’s exposure is misrepresented as a realized reduction rather than a forward-looking sensitivity scenario. The $47 million figure appears fabricated and is not supported by the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails completely. The question asks for a comparison between Boeing’s actual liability trend and LMT’s potential exposure trend. The LLM incorrectly treats both as having realized reductions, missing the core contrast: Boeing reduced its liability significantly while LMT faces possible future increases. It also invents parallelism where none exists.

However, this was offset by a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense on debt, also driven by higher benchmark interest rates. On the other hand, Starbucks actively hedges against changes in benchmark interest rates using interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to mitigate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. This shows that while both companies are exposed to benchmark interest rate fluctuations, GM experiences both positive and negative financial impacts, whereas Starbucks proactively manages its exposure through hedging instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "Changes in benchmark interest rates impact General Motors (GM) and Starbucks through increased interest expenses and hedging strategies. For GM, higher rates elevate interest costs on debt, as seen in GM Financial's 2023 EBT-adjusted decline due to a 1.6% rise in the effective interest rate (from 3.1% to 4.7%), driven by higher benchmark rates and increased debt outstanding. GM hedges using interest rate swaps and treasury locks to mitigate this risk. For Starbucks, rising rates could reduce the fair value of long-term debt (a 100-basis-point increase would decrease fair value by $943 million) and increase financing costs.

The LLM instead claims a 1.6% rise in effective interest rate (from 3.1% to 4.7%) and references an 'EBT-adjusted decline' in GM Financial, which is not in the original answer and contradicts the positive income impacts. These numbers and effects are not supported by the ground truth. (2) The Starbucks quantitative claim that a 100-basis-point increase would reduce debt fair value by $943M is not present in the original answer and appears fabricated. The original does not quantify the economic impact of rate changes on Starbucks' debt value or financing costs—only that they hedge using swaps and treasury locks. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in identifying that both companies are exposed to benchmark rates and use similar hedging instruments, but the LLM incorrectly attributes hedging activity to GM, which is not mentioned in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "COP calculates its standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows using 12-month average prices, assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions, which may not reflect future volatility. XOM notes that extended low prices could reduce capital spending and affect partners' ability to fund joint projects, thereby impacting proved reserves. Together, these approaches suggest that while COP's methodology smooths price volatility, it may mask the longer-term effects of sustained low prices, which XOM explicitly identifies as a risk that could reduce both the level and timing of proved reserves. This creates a potential misalignment in how each company accounts for price volatility in reserve estimation.",
      "llm_answer": "The reliance on 12-month average prices by both companies smooths short-term price volatility but may understate the impact of extended low prices. For ExxonMobil (XOM), proved reserves are particularly sensitive to prolonged low prices, which can reduce capital spending and partners' funding capacity, delaying development of proved undeveloped reserves. This sensitivity, combined with the 12-month average pricing methodology, risks overestimating reserves during extended low-price periods, as the averaging period may not fully capture long-term price declines. Under volatile conditions, this joint reliance could lead to less reliable reserve estimates for both companies, as extended low prices may not be adequately reflected in the 12-month average, affecting the accuracy of future cash flow projections and development timelines.",

      "original_answer": "Charles Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities decreased from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021, yet interest revenue from these securities increased from $1,560 million to $4,537 million due to a significant rise in average balances from $58,181 million to $253,555 million. This contributed to the overall net interest revenue growth from $6,113 million in 2020 to $8,030 million in 2021, a $1,917 million increase. BNY Mellon, in its 10-K, highlights that it monitors net interest revenue closely as part of its financial outlook and risk management, noting its sensitivity to market trends such as interest rates and asset composition.

However, growth in interest-earning assets, securities lending revenue, and the acquisition of TD Ameritrade offset this decline. BNY Mellon (BK) would find this trend strategically relevant because Schwab's experience highlights the sensitivity of net interest revenue to interest rate fluctuations and prepayment risks in AFS portfolios.

This misrepresents both the starting and ending yield values. Additionally, the LLM claims net interest margin declined from 1.62% to 1.45%, and that interest revenue declined due to lower yields—both of which contradict the ground truth: interest revenue from AFS securities actually increased from $1,560M to $4,537M, and total net interest revenue grew from $6,113M to $8,030M. The LLM incorrectly frames the yield decline as a headwind to revenue growth, when in reality, the massive increase in average balances (from $58,181M to $253,555M) more than offset the lower yield, driving strong revenue growth.

(4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses BNY Mellon’s strategic interest in net interest revenue sensitivity, which is relevant, and correctly infers that BNY would learn from Schwab’s experience.

(3) The reasoning about the inverse relationship between discount rates and projected benefit obligation is sound and reflects correct multi-hop understanding of pension accounting principles. The structure of the response addresses both counterfactual scenarios asked in the question—what would happen if each company used the other’s rate. (4) Despite correct conceptual reasoning and relevance to the question, the severe numerical inaccuracies severely limit factual correctness. The answer fails on quantitative accuracy but maintains moderate qualitative accuracy due to correct logic and entity identification (DHR, MDT, Non-U.S. Pension Benefits, 2022, PBO).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative values. It states Capital One's net charge-off rate was 2.10%, but the ground truth is 0.19%. This leads to an incorrect difference of 2.4 percentage points instead of the correct 4.31 percentage points (PayPal's 4.5% minus COF's 0.19%). The direction of the comparison is correct (COF lower than PYPL), but the magnitude is severely off. (2) The calculation of the difference is based on incorrect inputs: 4.5% - 2.10% = 2.4%, which is mathematically correct but factually wrong due to the incorrect starting value. The correct difference is 4.5% - 0.19% = 4.31 percentage points. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Capital One cited lower net charge-offs in its office real estate portfolio as the reason for the decrease, which matches the ground truth. This shows accurate synthesis of the causal explanation. However, the failure to report the correct rate for Capital One undermines the multi-hop comparison. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question—comparative rate difference and reason for decrease—and uses appropriate financial terminology. The structure and intent are correct, but the core numerical data is inaccurate, leading to a low correctness and quantitative accuracy score.

      "original_answer": "Duke Energy reports $91 million in Noncurrent Derivative Assets, while NextEra Energy reports $1,790 million for the same metric. This substantial difference indicates that NextEra Energy maintains a much larger portfolio of long-term derivative instruments, which are typically used to hedge against market risks such as commodity price fluctuations and interest rate changes. In contrast, Duke Energy’s smaller position suggests a more conservative or limited use of such instruments for long-term risk mitigation. While neither company explicitly states its risk management philosophy in these terms, the disparity in scale implies that NextEra Energy may be taking a more expansive approach to managing long-term financial exposures through derivatives.",
      "llm_answer": "The significant difference in Noncurrent Derivative Assets between Duke Energy ($91M) and NextEra Energy ($1,790M) reflects their distinct risk management strategies. NextEra Energy's substantially larger noncurrent derivative assets ($1,790M) indicate a more aggressive use of derivatives to hedge long-term energy commodity risks, such as power and gas price volatility, through complex instruments like forwards, options, and full requirements contracts. These instruments rely heavily on unobservable inputs (e.g., implied volatilities, correlations) to manage exposure in dynamic markets, aligning with its diversified energy operations and market-driven trading activities. \n\nIn contrast, Duke Energy's smaller noncurrent derivative assets ($91M) suggest a more conservative approach, focused on managing specific risks like foreign currency and interest rate exposure through simpler instruments. Its derivatives are primarily tied to foreign currency contracts and interest rate hedges, with less emphasis on energy commodity derivatives, reflecting a narrower risk profile and regulatory focus on stable, long-term operations. This divergence underscores NextEra's active risk mitigation in volatile energy markets versus Duke Energy's targeted, less extensive use of derivatives.",

No calculations were required, but the comparison in scale is correctly emphasized. (2) The answer is complete, addressing the core question about how the difference reflects distinct risk management approaches.

While the ground truth does not specify derivative types or inputs, the LLM's inferences are plausible and enhance the explanation without introducing factual errors.

All other factual elements are correct and semantically aligned.

This led to an incorrect year-over-year comparison: the LLM reported an increase of $9 million, whereas the actual increase is $1 million ($86M - $85M). (2) Number verification: 2023 values are accurate; 2022 individual values are correct but sum is wrong—$59M + $18M = $77M is mathematically correct but contradicts the ground truth which states the combined 2022 cost was $85M. This suggests a potential data inconsistency or error in the knowledge graph, but since the ground truth explicitly states the combined 2022 cost as $85M, the LLM's calculation from component values conflicts with the provided truth.

The individual components for MDT are correctly cited, but the synthesis is flawed.

However, it incorrectly reports Charles Schwab's (SCHW) amount as $698 million instead of the correct $45 million. The LLM appears to have misinterpreted or incorrectly summed the components under 'Refreshed FICO score - Less than 620' on page 92, possibly including both First Mortgages and Home Equity loans when only a specific subset (or different categorization) should have been considered. (2) The calculation of the total is therefore incorrect: $2,156M + $698M = $2,854M (LLM) vs. the correct $2,156M + $45M = $2,201M. This is a significant numerical error affecting the final result. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is pulled from both BAC and SCHW 10-Ks and refers to the correct metric and time period (December 31, 2022). However, the synthesis fails due to incorrect data extraction from SCHW’s filing, undermining the conclusion. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and timeframe, and cites specific pages. However, due to the major quantitative error in one of the two key inputs and the resulting incorrect total, the overall correctness score is reduced to 4. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the reasoning structure is logical but based on flawed data extraction.",

      "original_answer": "CAT adjusts its GAAP results for pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains/losses, which affects its non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA calculation. This adjustment is specific to CAT and is not included in UNP's Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation, where UNP adjusts EBITDA by subtracting 'Other income, net' and adding 'Interest on operating lease liabilities.' As a result, CAT's Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to UNP's $11,458 million Adjusted EBITDA because the two companies apply different exclusions and adjustments to arrive at their respective non-GAAP measures.",

This adjustment is part of CAT's non-GAAP reconciliation, whereas UNP's Adjusted EBITDA of $11,458 million does not include similar adjustments for pension and OPEB items.

(1) It correctly identifies that CAT excludes pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains/losses from its Adjusted EBITDA, specifically noting a $97 million loss in 2023. While the original answer does not include the $97M figure, this detail is factually consistent with CAT's 2023 filing and adds precision without contradicting the ground truth. (2) The quantitative accuracy is high—$97M is correct per CAT’s 10-K, and no calculation errors are present. The format is appropriate. (3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes multi-hop information: it contrasts CAT’s adjustment methodology (excluding pension/OPEB items) with UNP’s Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation, which does not include such adjustments, and concludes that comparability is affected due to differing non-GAAP adjustments. This matches the core logic of the original answer. (4) The LLM adds slightly more detail (the $97M loss) than the original, but this enhances rather than detracts from accuracy. The only minor point is that the original emphasizes UNP’s specific adjustments ('Other income, net' and 'Interest on operating lease liabilities'), which the LLM omits—this is a small completeness gap but does not undermine the overall correctness. Semantic equivalence is maintained, and the answer fully addresses the comparability issue. Hence, a score of 9 is warranted—excellent but not perfect.",

      "original_answer": "For AMT, competitive pressures from data center providers with greater financial resources and lower operating costs could force lease rate reductions to retain or attract customers, especially as a significant percentage of leases expire annually. Additionally, the adoption of new technologies like 5G or small cell networks could reduce demand for traditional tower-based services, further decreasing lease rates. For SPG, the risk of oversupply in the trade areas where their retail properties operate could similarly reduce market rents. Both companies face adverse effects on lease rates, but through different mechanisms—AMT through technology and competition, and SPG through real estate market dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "AMT's data center business faces competitive pressures from rivals with greater financial resources, lower costs, and pre-existing customer relationships, which could force AMT to reduce rental rates or lose customers. Technological shifts, such as advancements in satellite services or small cell networks, may also decrease demand for tower-based infrastructure, further pressuring lease rates. In contrast, SPG's retail properties are exposed to reduced market rents due to oversupply in trade areas, exacerbated by e-commerce growth and shifting consumer preferences, which directly impact occupancy and rental income. While both face lease rate pressures, AMT's risks stem from technological disruption and competitive dynamics, whereas SPG's are tied to retail market oversupply and evolving consumer behavior.",

SPG faces reduced market rents due to oversupply in trade areas, compounded by e-commerce and changing consumer behavior. These match the original answer's emphasis on technology/competition for AMT and real estate market dynamics for SPG. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present.

The ground truth states that the combined total is $16,899 million, composed of $16,576 million in revolving loans from Bank of America (BAC) and $323 million in HELOCs amortized cost basis from Charles Schwab (SCHW). However, the LLM incorrectly reports BAC's revolving loans as $66,986 million by adding $50,410 million (credit card) and $16,576 million (HELOCs), which double-counts or misclassifies the revolving loan category. The original answer only references $16,576 million for BAC revolving loans with FICO >= 740, so the LLM introduces an unsupported $50,410 million credit card figure not mentioned in the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM reports Charles Schwab’s HELOCs amortized cost basis as $5,402 million, which is vastly higher than the correct $323 million. (2) Calculations are mathematically correct within the LLM's own numbers ($66,986 + $5,402 = $72,388), but the inputs are factually wrong. The correct sum should be $16,576 + $323 = $16,899 million.

The LLM rounds these to $7.5B and $9.5B, which is acceptable, but it incorrectly states VZ's short-term debt increased from $6.8B to $7.5B — this data is not present in the original answer and appears fabricated. The ground truth does not provide VZ's exact short-term debt figures, so introducing specific numbers undermines accuracy. (2) Calculations: The LLM implies a $0.7B increase for VZ, but since no such numbers are in the original, this is an unsupported addition. T's increase is approximately correct in magnitude ($2.01B actual, LLM implies ~$2B), so partial credit is due. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly synthesizes that T relies more directly on short-term financing while VZ uses structured, secured mechanisms involving receivables and segregated accounts — though it omits mention of restricted cash and segregated accounts, a key part of VZ's strategy that buffers general liquidity. This omission reduces completeness.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the numbers for Duke Energy. According to the ground truth, Duke Energy's accounts payable to affiliated companies decreased by $26 million (from -$42 million in 2023 to -$68 million in 2024), but the LLM incorrectly reports a decrease from $135 million to $67 million, resulting in a -$68 million change. This is a major quantitative error. Southern Company's numbers are correct: a decrease from $89 million to $75 million, a net change of -$14 million. (2) The calculation of the combined net change is mathematically correct based on the LLM's incorrect inputs: -$68 million + -$14 million = -$82 million. However, using the correct values from the ground truth, the combined net change should be -$26 million (DUK) + -$14 million (SO) = -$40 million, not -$82 million. The original answer states the combined net change is $14 million, which appears to be an error in sign interpretation or arithmetic in the original answer itself—however, based on the provided ground truth, the expected answer is $14 million, which does not match the arithmetic of the stated changes. There is an inconsistency in the original answer: if both companies decreased by $26M and $14M respectively, the combined net change should be -$40M, not $14M. Despite this, the LLM uses entirely incorrect input data for Duke Energy, so it cannot be credited. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the LLM identifies both companies, extracts year-over-year changes, and attempts to sum them—but it fails at data retrieval for Duke Energy. (4) Due to major numerical inaccuracies in Duke Energy's accounts payable figures and the resulting incorrect total, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. The qualitative reasoning and contextual relevance are acceptable because the structure and intent align with the question.",

      "question": "What is the difference in the total depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses between ConocoPhillips (COP) and Chevron Corporation (CVX) in 2024, and how does this difference compare to their respective total costs and expenses for the same year?",
      "original_answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) reported total depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses of $9,599 million in 2024, while Chevron Corporation (CVX) reported $4,973 million in the same period. This results in a difference of $4,626 million. COP's total costs and expenses for 2024 were $43,281 million, while CVX's were $46,167 million. Therefore, the difference in depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses represents approximately 10.7% of the difference in their total costs and expenses ($4,626 million / ($46,167 million - $43,281 million)).",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in total depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses between ConocoPhillips (COP) and Chevron Corporation (CVX) in 2024 is **$7,683 million** (CVX: $17,282 million vs. COP: $9,599 million). This difference represents **17.7% of COP's total costs and expenses** ($43,281 million) and **4.38% of CVX's total costs and expenses** ($175,286 million), highlighting that COP's DD&A expense is a larger proportion of its total costs compared to CVX.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. It incorrectly states Chevron's (CVX) depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense as $17,282 million, whereas the ground truth is $4,973 million. This leads to a completely wrong difference in DD&A expenses: $7,683 million (CVX - COP) instead of the correct $4,626 million (COP - CVX). The LLM also reverses the comparison direction, implying CVX has higher DD&A than COP, when in fact COP's DD&A is significantly higher. (2) The total costs and expenses for CVX are grossly misstated as $175,286 million instead of $46,167 million, which invalidates the percentage calculations. The LLM claims the DD&A difference represents 17.7% of COP's total costs and 4.38% of CVX's, but these percentages are based on incorrect inputs and are therefore meaningless. The correct analysis should compare the $4,626 million DD&A difference to the $2,886 million difference in total costs and expenses (CVX - COP), yielding approximately 10.7% as stated in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify and synthesize the required financial figures across both companies and does not compute the relative significance of the DD&A difference in the context of total costs. (4) Despite these severe inaccuracies, the answer attempts to address both parts of the question—difference in DD&A and its comparison to total costs—so it retains partial contextual relevance. However, due to pervasive numerical and logical errors, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.",

      "question": "What percentage of Danaher's Biotechnology segment sales in 2024 were made in Western Europe, and how does this geographic overlap compare to Gilead's overall revenue contribution from the same region?",
      "original_answer": "Danaher's Biotechnology segment generated 34% of its 2024 sales in Western Europe. Gilead reported that 25% of its total 2024 revenue came from Western Europe. This comparison shows that Danaher's Biotechnology segment has a stronger geographic presence in Western Europe relative to Gilead's overall regional contribution, indicating potentially greater market penetration or operational focus in that region for Danaher's Biotechnology business.",

However, it incorrectly claims that Gilead's Western Europe revenue contribution is not available in the documents, when in fact the ground truth states that Gilead reported 25% of its total 2024 revenue from Western Europe. This omission prevents the required comparison. (2) Quantitatively, the only number provided (34%) is accurate, and no calculations were needed beyond that. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM does not synthesize the second part of the comparison—Gilead’s 25% regional contribution—despite this being part of the original answer. The model should have accessed and used that data to make the geographic overlap comparison as the question demands. (4) While the first part is factually correct, the failure to include a key data point and perform the comparative analysis significantly undermines the answer's completeness and reasoning quality, warranting a moderate correctness score of 4.

The difference of $2,032 million is accurate. However, the percentage calculation is slightly off: the LLM states 'approximately 7.5%' while the correct value is 7.6% (2,032 / 26,914 ≈ 0.0755 → 7.6%). Additionally, the LLM incorrectly references '8.0% of net revenue' in parentheses, which is irrelevant and confusing. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high—only the percentage is slightly inaccurate due to rounding or calculation error. Dollar amounts and difference are correct. (3) The reasoning is mostly sound but flawed in asserting that TXN's 2022 data is missing; the ground truth treats $134M as the correct comparative figure, so the model's uncertainty undermines confidence despite using the right number. This reflects a failure in multi-hop synthesis confidence or data interpretation. (4) Contextual relevance is strong—the answer addresses both parts of the question and attempts precise calculation.

This satisfies the quantitative requirement with full accuracy. 2) The percentage is correctly cited with no calculation or formatting issues—'14%' is consistent across both answers. 3) The LLM expands on the significance by noting the material adverse effect on key divisions (FLNA, QFNA, PBNA), which is a reasonable inference from the ground truth's mention of reliance across divisions and concentrate sales to bottlers supplying Walmart. While the original answer emphasizes the supply chain mechanism (concentrate sales to bottlers), the LLM focuses on the risk of customer loss and strategic partnership value. Both convey the significance of the relationship, though the LLM adds slightly more forward-looking risk language not explicitly in the ground truth. 4) The entity identification (PEP, Walmart, Sam's Club, 2023) and financial metric (consolidated net revenue) are accurate. The answer fully addresses both parts of the question: the percentage and the illustration of significance. The reasoning is sound and represents a valid multi-hop synthesis.

MET's interest benefit of $4 million is included in other expenses and reflects its overall liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which could increase or decrease in the next 12 months due to potential U.S. federal tax legislation or regulatory changes.

      "original_answer": "For BKNG, indirect taxes increased general and administrative expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher travel transaction taxes and digital services taxes, which were driven by improved revenue performance. For GM, indirect taxes contributed to liabilities through potential retrospective recoveries and adjustments tied to unique events, such as recent Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting salaried workers in GMI. These differing business factors—BKNG's tax exposure from transaction-based growth and GM's legal and settlement-related tax impacts—show how indirect taxes influence each company's financial obligations through distinct operational and regulatory channels.",

For BKNG, higher indirect taxes (e.g., travel transaction taxes, digital services taxes) in 2021 were driven by revenue growth and increased transaction volumes, directly raising G&A expenses. The expansion of services like Booking.com and improved travel demand post-pandemic amplified taxable activity. For GM, potential settlement liabilities related to indirect taxes stem from retrospective adjustments, such as resolving disputes over past tax recoveries (e.g., Korea Supreme Court decisions) or settlements for tax-related claims. These liabilities reflect ongoing legal or regulatory scrutiny of historical tax positions, influenced by evolving tax laws and compliance requirements.",

GM's potential settlement liabilities tied to retrospective tax adjustments, particularly referencing Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting salaried workers at GMI, are correctly identified.

These gains and losses are part of the annual pension expense and can materially affect financial results due to significant management judgment involved. In contrast, WMT reports 'other (gains) and losses' as a separate line item in the income statement, with amounts of $1,538 million in 2023 and $3,027 million in 2024, directly impacting income before taxes. While PEP's 'other gains and losses' are embedded in pension expense and reflect long-term liability assumptions, WMT's line item represents more immediate, potentially one-time financial impacts.",

Additionally, WMT's pension-related gains/losses may also be presented in other comprehensive income (e.g., minimum pension liability adjustments), separating their impact from operating performance.

Additionally, the LLM incorrectly implies that WMT's 'other (gains) and losses' line item is not tied to pension expenses, whereas the ground truth does not specify disconnection from pensions, only that it is a direct income statement item impacting income before taxes. The LLM also introduces the concept of 'minimum pension liability adjustments' and OCI presentation for WMT without confirmation from the original answer, adding unsupported inference. While the core contrast in financial statement presentation (embedded in expense vs. separate line item) is partially correct, the lack of numbers and slight misrepresentation of WMT’s treatment reduce factual accuracy.

MetLife, on the other hand, uses past experience both prospectively and retrospectively in its pricing of insurance products — evaluating historical performance to set future premium rates and to recoup or distribute gains and losses based on prior years' results.

In contrast, MetLife incorporates historical data in pricing insurance products by evaluating past experience to adjust premium rates and manage risks, including mortality, expenses, and investment returns.

The LLM correctly identifies that Bank of America applies historical data to long-term investment and liability-matching strategies (mentioning cash flow matching with Aa-rated bonds), and that MetLife uses past experience in mortality, expenses, and investment returns to adjust premiums and manage risk. (2) There are no numbers, dates, or financial figures in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense—however, the absence of fabricated or incorrect metrics supports a score of 10. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between the two companies' use of historical data in different financial domains (pension asset returns vs. insurance pricing) and synthesizes their strategic applications accurately. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the LLM slightly omits the explicit mention of MetLife’s use of past experience both prospectively *and retrospectively*—particularly the aspect of recouping or distributing gains/losses based on prior results, which is a key nuance in the ground truth.

More critically, the percentages are wrong: the LLM claims DUK's interest expense is 16.8% of CapEx and NEE's is 11.1%, but the ground truth states 128% for DUK and 12.8% for NEE. These errors suggest miscalculations—158/939 ≈ 16.8% and 1,034/9,302 ≈ 11.1%—meaning the model likely reversed the correct values. (2) The capital expenditure figures ($939M for DUK, $9,302M for NEE) are correct, and the combined interest total is accurate, but the breakdown and derived percentages are not. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to compare interest expense to CapEx for both companies and synthesizes across entities—but the flawed input values and incorrect ratio logic undermine the conclusion.

The synthesis across companies and financial impacts is logical and well-structured. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in all key aspects, with slightly different emphasis (e.g., margin contraction, regional drivers) but no factual errors.

      "question": "How did the increase in interest expense from NVDA's $5.00 billion debt issuance in June 2021 influence their other income (expense), net, and how might this impact TXN's financial flexibility if they were to issue similar debt under comparable market conditions?",
      "original_answer": "The $5.00 billion note issued by NVDA in June 2021 led to a $52 million increase in interest expense (from $184 million in fiscal year 2021 to $236 million in fiscal year 2022). This increase in interest expense reflects the direct cost of borrowing. However, NVDA also reported $107 million in income from 'Other, net' in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by unrealized gains from investments in non-affiliated entities. This suggests that while the debt issuance increased financial costs, NVDA was able to offset some of that burden through investment gains. If TXN were to issue similar debt, they would face comparable interest costs, which could constrain financial flexibility by diverting funds from operations or capital investments. TXN’s ability to manage this burden would depend on their capacity to generate offsetting income streams, such as from investment gains or operational efficiencies, as NVDA did.",
      "llm_answer": "The increase in NVDA's interest expense from the $5.00 billion debt issuance in June 2021 primarily impacted their net income, as interest expense rose to $236 million in fiscal 2022 (from $184 million in 2021). This increase did not directly affect \"Other Income (Expense), Net,\" which was driven by unrealized gains from investments ($107 million in 2022). For TXN, issuing similar debt under comparable market conditions would increase interest expenses, potentially reducing net income and cash flow. However, TXN’s financial flexibility would depend on their liquidity (e.g., $21.21 billion in cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 30, 2022) and access to capital markets, as highlighted in their 10-K. Higher debt obligations could strain financial flexibility if interest rates rise or cash flow declines, but their strong liquidity position may mitigate this risk.",

It also accurately notes the $107 million in 'Other, net' income in fiscal 2022 from unrealized gains. These numbers match the ground truth exactly, with correct fiscal years and dollar amounts. (2) All calculations are accurate: the $52 million increase in interest expense is correctly implied by the before-and-after figures. The LLM correctly separates interest expense from 'Other Income (Expense), Net,' clarifying that the latter was not directly affected by the debt issuance but instead driven by investment gains—this aligns with the ground truth's distinction. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects NVDA's debt issuance to higher interest costs, distinguishes this from other income sources, and then applies the logic to TXN by assessing their financial flexibility. It appropriately infers that similar debt would increase TXN's interest expenses and affect cash flow and net income. It adds relevant context from TXN’s 10-K (their $21.21 billion in cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 30, 2022), which strengthens the analysis of TXN’s capacity to absorb such debt. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that TXN would need to generate offsetting income streams (like NVDA’s investment gains) to maintain flexibility—this nuance from the original answer is slightly underemphasized. However, the mention of liquidity and access to capital markets serves a similar purpose. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and contextually complete, warranting a high score.",

According to the ground truth, the difference in total lease cost changes between Costco and Philip Morris is $109 million. However, the LLM states Costco decreased by $90M and Philip Morris increased by $45M, implying a difference of $135M ($90M - (-$45M) = $135M), which is incorrect. Additionally, the percentage changes are wrong: the LLM reports a 13% decrease for Costco and an 11.17% increase for Philip Morris, whereas the ground truth states both companies had decreases—8.7% for Costco and 6.7% for Philip Morris. Thus, the LLM incorrectly claims Philip Morris had an increase when it actually had a decrease. (2) The dollar amounts and percentages do not match the ground truth. The correct lease cost change difference is $109M, not $135M. The percentage decreases are 8.7% and 6.7%, not 13% and -11.17%. These errors affect both the magnitude and direction of change for Philip Morris. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The model fails to correctly synthesize the lease cost changes across both companies and misidentifies the nature of Philip Morris’s change (increase vs. actual decrease). It also miscalculates or misreports the percentage changes, undermining the comparative analysis. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and metric (lease costs) over the correct time period (2023 to 2024), and attempts the required comparison. However, due to major quantitative and qualitative errors, especially reversing the direction of Philip Morris’s lease cost change and overstating percentages, the correctness score is very low.",

The LLM misrepresents the direction of change for RTX and uses approximate values (rounding $599M to $600M). Additionally, the difference in changes is calculated as $122M instead of the correct $123M ($722M - $599M), likely due to rounding. (2) While the core calculation for EMR is accurate, RTX's values are both directionally and numerically incorrect: the original answer specifies a decrease, but the LLM says an increase. The starting value for RTX is also misrepresented as negative (-$2,958M and -$2,359M), whereas in the ground truth, these are positive liabilities.

Chevron (CVX) saw a **186.3% increase** in NGL prices, rising from $9.97 in 2020 to $28.54 in 2021, as reported in its consolidated operations.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. The ground truth states that ConocoPhillips (COP) had an 89.0% increase in NGL price, but the LLM reports 88.9%, which is close but not exact. More critically, the LLM reports Chevron's (CVX) increase as 186.3%, while the ground truth is 162.8%—a substantial deviation. Additionally, the LLM cites specific dollar amounts: $23.27 to $43.97 for COP and $9.97 to $28.54 for CVX. Recalculating these: (43.97 - 23.27) / 23.27 ≈ 88.9%, which matches the LLM's percentage, but if the ground truth is 89.0%, this may be a rounding difference. However, for CVX: (28.54 - 9.97) / 9.97 ≈ 186.3%, which contradicts the ground truth of 162.8%, indicating either incorrect source data or misattribution. (2) The numbers do not align with the verified knowledge graph. The LLM’s use of $9.97 and $28.54 for CVX suggests a different data source or error in extraction, as a 162.8% increase from $9.97 would result in ~$26.21 in 2021, not $28.54. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to compare percentage increases for both companies across the same time period and draws a valid qualitative conclusion (CVX increase higher than COP). However, the synthesis is based on incorrect underlying data for CVX. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both companies, the correct metric (NGL price per barrel), and time frame (2020 to 2021). Entity identification is correct (COP, CVX, NGLs, years). The qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct structure but flawed data. Correctness score is low due to major error in CVX percentage, which affects the core comparison.",

      "original_answer": "BKNG concluded that no impairment indicators were present for its long-lived assets and goodwill as of December 31, 2021, despite prior impairments in 2020 related to OpenTable and KAYAK due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests BKNG expected a recovery trajectory in its forecasted cash flows for those assets. GM Financial also identified no impairment indicators in its leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, despite a potential future decline in used vehicle prices, which were still expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. Thus, both companies relied on forward-looking assumptions—BKNG on recovery in travel and restaurant reservation monetization, and GM on residual vehicle values—to justify the absence of impairment indicators, even though the nature of their assets and market risks differed significantly.",
      "llm_answer": "The absence of impairment indicators for BKNG's intangible assets and GM Financial's leased vehicle portfolio in 2021 reflected differing financial assumptions and market conditions. For GM Financial, strong used vehicle prices (due to low new inventory) supported residual value estimates, reducing depreciation expenses and avoiding impairment. In contrast, BKNG’s intangible assets (e.g., OpenTable and KAYAK) were assessed using cash flow projections and market multiples, which, despite pandemic-related challenges in 2020, showed recovery optimism by 2021, leading to no impairment. GM Financial’s reliance on market-driven residual values versus BKNG’s forward-looking cash flow assumptions highlighted divergent risks: GM’s exposure to used vehicle price volatility versus BKNG’s reliance on recovery timelines and profitability growth rates post-pandemic.",

      "original_answer": "Chevron's proved reserves are concentrated with approximately 86% located in OECD countries, which are typically characterized by stable regulatory environments and strong governance frameworks. This geographic concentration likely reduces Chevron's exposure to political and regulatory risks compared to ExxonMobil, which manages a more globally dispersed portfolio of reserves, including both consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. ExxonMobil explicitly notes that its reserves estimates are subject to regulatory changes, fiscal and commercial terms, government policies, and consumer preferences, which vary significantly across jurisdictions. Therefore, ExxonMobil’s broader and less concentrated reserves base likely increases its exposure to geopolitical and regulatory volatility compared to Chevron’s more OECD-focused reserves position.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's higher concentration of proved reserves in OECD countries (86%) compared to ExxonMobil's broader geographic diversification reduces Chevron's exposure to regulatory and political risks in non-OECD regions, which often face greater instability. ExxonMobil's diversified approach, including significant reserves in non-OECD areas like Africa and Asia, exposes it to higher regulatory and political risks in those regions, though its OECD focus also provides some stability.

There is no mention in the ground truth that ExxonMobil has 86% of reserves in OECD countries, making this a fabricated or misattributed statistic. This error fundamentally undermines the conclusion that both companies have similar risk profiles. While the LLM correctly identifies that OECD concentration reduces political and regulatory risk and that broader geographic dispersion increases such risks, the erroneous attribution of identical 86% OECD exposure to ExxonMobil invalidates the comparative analysis. The reasoning is otherwise logically structured and contextually relevant, showing understanding of how geographic concentration affects risk.

(2) Quantitatively, the LLM does not contradict any numbers but omits key figures from the ground truth: the 10% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth rate used by MO in its discounted cash flow model.

BAC employs quantitative models to estimate expected prepayments, adjusting the contractual maturity of loans based on historical prepayment data, economic outlook (e.g., interest rates, unemployment), and borrower-specific factors like credit scores and loan-to-value (LTV) ratios. For commercial loans, prepayment adjustments are integrated into cash flow forecasts, while for nonperforming loans, prepayment assumptions influence collateral valuation. \n\nMetLife, on the other hand, pools mortgage loans by risk characteristics and applies estimated lifetime loss rates adjusted for prepayments and extensions. It uses historical experience and economic forecasts (e.g., growth, inflation) to estimate prepayment rates, with adjustments to contractual terms for prepayment expectations. For agricultural loans, historical prepayment data is used, while commercial loans incorporate both prepayment and extension adjustments based on economic cycles and loan profiles. \n\nIn summary, BAC emphasizes detailed quantitative modeling with granular factors, while MetLife integrates prepayment adjustments within risk-based pooling and historical loss rate frameworks.",

(1) Key correct elements: BAC uses quantitative modeling with granular factors (credit scores, LTV, economic outlook), while MET pools loans by risk characteristics and adjusts loss rates for prepayments and extensions. Both are described as incorporating economic forecasts, which aligns with the ground truth. (2) There are no numeric values to verify (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts), so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10 since no numbers are misstated. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that BAC applies adjustments at a more granular, loan-level segmentation across portfolios, whereas MET applies them at the portfolio segment level. The mention of collateral valuation for nonperforming loans in BAC and use of historical data in MET further supports accurate qualitative synthesis. (4) Minor omission: the original answer specifies BAC's use of 'months since origination' and 'geography' as modeling inputs, which the LLM answer does not explicitly mention. Also, MET’s adjustment for 'past events' is underemphasized. These are minor contextual details that do not undermine the overall correctness. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent. Thus, correctness is 9 (not 10) due to slight incompleteness in granular input factors and emphasis on past events, but all major factual and conceptual components are accurately conveyed.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several inaccuracies in key numeric values. The combined 2023 cost is stated as $2,193 million, but the ground truth is $2,237 million (sum of $593M for DUK and $1,644M for SO). The LLM incorrectly reports SO's 2023 cost as $1,600 million instead of $1,644 million, leading to an incorrect total. While DUK's 2023 cost ($593M) and 2022 cost ($1,276M) are correct, SO's 2022 cost is given as $3.0 billion ($3,000M), whereas the ground truth is $2,994 million—close but not exact. (2) Calculations: The percentage decrease for DUK is correctly calculated (from $1,276M to $593M is a 53.5% drop), but SO's decrease is miscalculated: from $2,994M to $1,644M is a $1,350M drop, or ~45.1%, not 46.7%. The LLM uses $1.6B and $3.0B, which introduces rounding errors. The combined total is off by $44 million due to incorrect input values. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is generally sound—the model identifies both companies, the correct metric (natural gas cost), and performs year-over-year comparisons for both entities and aggregates them. However, the synthesis fails due to incorrect data points for SO. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses all parts of the question: total cost, individual costs, and YoY changes. The qualitative reasoning about DUK's larger percentage decline due to a smaller base is logically sound, though not required in the ground truth. Scores reflect partial correctness: quantitative accuracy is penalized for key number errors and miscalculations; qualitative and contextual scores are higher due to correct structure and reasoning framework.",

In contrast, RTX's disclosures are more aggregated, focusing on total pension obligations, funded status, and major events (e.g., mergers, plan changes) affecting liabilities, with less detailed breakdown by region.

However, the LLM fails to include the specific quantitative figures from the ground truth—EMR's 2022 U.S. Net Periodic Pension Expense of $(3) million and Non-U.S. of $5 million—which are critical to fully answering the question. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly implies that RTX provides some level of regional or component-level disclosure (e.g., 'less detailed breakdown by region'), whereas the ground truth states RTX only mentions the existence of a section title without disclosing any actual figures or breakdowns at all, making its reporting far less transparent than implied. (2) No actual numbers from EMR or RTX are provided in the LLM answer, and no mention is made of the 2022 data point, which is central to the original answer. This is a significant omission in quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly infers differing transparency practices based on disclosure depth—but it misrepresents RTX's disclosure as being merely 'aggregated' rather than entirely absent of numerical breakdowns, which undermines the accuracy of the comparison.

The original answer states GM faced 'significantly higher immediate financial risk,' whereas the LLM argues Booking.com faced more 'concrete' risk and GM had 'lower relative financial exposure' due to existing accruals and low excess liability. This misrepresents the intent of the question, which focuses on the magnitude of contingent liability risk, not just unaccrued risk.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—synthesis between two companies is attempted—but fails because the model did not correctly retrieve or acknowledge Altria’s 2022 employee count, breaking the comparative analysis. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to one major factual error (missing Altria’s 2022 data) leading to an incorrect combined total and flawed comparison. Quantitative accuracy is 6 because Costco’s numbers are correct but Altria’s change and the final sum are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to flawed entity-time pairing for Altria and incorrect reasoning about data availability. Contextual relevance is 8 because the structure and intent align well with the question, despite factual inaccuracies.",

These values are factually accurate and properly calculated. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts and the resulting $736 million difference are correct, with no arithmetic or data errors. Format usage ($771 million) is acceptable and consistent with standard reporting. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is largely sound — the model correctly links BlackRock’s CET1 capital level to the 'well capitalized' threshold defined under Prompt Corrective Action (referencing American Express’s filing as the source of that threshold), and connects the definition of CET1 capital to American Express’s regulatory disclosures. It correctly notes that American Express provides the definition (adjustments for ineligible goodwill, intangible assets, deferred tax assets), which aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM slightly overreaches by referencing 'BTC' (BlackRock's subsidiary) and implying the data reflects a subsidiary-level filing, which is not mentioned or supported in the ground truth. This introduces a minor inaccuracy in entity interpretation. (4) Despite this small qualification, the answer is highly accurate, complete, and contextually appropriate. The core multi-hop synthesis — comparing BlackRock’s CET1 to a regulatory threshold defined in American Express’s disclosures — is correctly executed. The wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence. Thus, correctness is reduced by one point due to the unsubstantiated reference to BTC, but all key facts and calculations remain intact.",

This error stems from incorrect individual company changes: Google's change is reported as $5,347 million instead of the correct $3,201 million improvement (from -$7,603M to -$4,402M), and Verizon's change is correctly stated as $485 million improvement, but the LLM misattributes this to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) rather than Total Comprehensive Income (Loss). (2) The unrealized gains contribution is completely incorrect: the LLM claims unrealized losses on cash flow hedges contributed -$463 million, whereas the ground truth states Google had a $2,512 million increase in unrealized gains on investments and Verizon had a $536 million unrealized gain on fair value hedges—both positive contributions. The LLM confuses cash flow hedges with fair value hedges and reports increasing losses instead of gains. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize Total Comprehensive Income changes across both companies and misidentifies the relevant components (e.g., mixing up Other Comprehensive Income changes with Total Comprehensive Income). It also fails to correctly attribute the drivers of change, citing incorrect hedge types and directions of change.

In contrast, GM accrued $2.8 billion in warranty recall campaign liabilities, including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt recall, and estimated its reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be insignificant, indicating a higher degree of certainty in its obligations.

The ground truth specifies Booking.com's reasonably possible loss as €20 million ($22 million) for French VAT, with no accrual for Italian VAT (€154 million / $175 million) and Turkish assessments (813 million TRY / $61 million). The LLM answer omits all these specific figures and instead vaguely references 'VAT-related contingencies' without citing any numbers, claiming they are 'not explicitly detailed'—which contradicts the original answer’s specificity. For GM, the ground truth states a $2.8 billion accrual for warranty recall liabilities, including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt, with 'insignificant' additional loss beyond that. The LLM incorrectly refers to '$2.8B for the Chevrolet Bolt recall'—this is wrong because only $2.0 billion of the $2.8 billion total was for the Bolt. This is a major quantitative error. (2) Calculations and numbers are not accurately reflected: the LLM misattributes the full $2.8B to the Bolt recall, inflating the specific obligation, and fails to report any of Booking.com’s disclosed exposure amounts. No correct calculations can be verified due to missing or incorrect data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing the nature of contingent liabilities between a tax-based uncertainty (Booking.com) and a product recall with high certainty (GM)—but it fails to synthesize the actual data from both companies. The conclusion that GM’s liabilities are more predictable and Booking.com’s involve greater uncertainty aligns semantically with the ground truth, but it is based on flawed or missing evidence. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses the comparative nature of contingent obligations and attempts the correct conceptual contrast. However, due to severe deficiencies in quantitative accuracy and incomplete fact reporting, the correctness score is low.

The average discount rate for MDT in 2022 is approximately 4.36% (midpoint of the range). This leads to a difference of about 1.66 percentage points (4.36% - 2.7%). A higher discount rate, as used by MDT, implies a lower present value of future pension obligations, suggesting that MDT's pension liabilities may be valued lower than DHR's for 2022, assuming similar future cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in the average discount rate for U.S. Pension Benefits between DHR and MDT in 2022 reflects potential differences in their pension liability valuations because a higher discount rate reduces the present value of future pension obligations, thereby lowering the reported liability. For Medtronic (MDT), the 2022 U.S. Pension Benefits discount rate increased compared to 2021 (from 2.3% to 4.23–4.48%), leading to a net actuarial gain due to higher discounting of future benefits. This would result in a lower pension liability for MDT compared to a company (e.g., DHR) with a lower discount rate, assuming similar assumptions. However, without DHR's specific 2022 discount rate data, a direct comparison cannot be made.

For BLK, the mention of accrued compensation and other liabilities as offsetting factors is consistent, but the characterization of a net negative impact from operating assets and liabilities contradicts the ground truth, which states BLK had a decrease compared to prior years but does not quantify it or state the direction of impact as clearly negative in absolute terms. The LLM adds unsupported details like depreciation and noncash expenses, which are not in the original and may be contextually plausible but are not part of the verified answer. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses both companies and the role of operating assets/liabilities, but the severe numerical inaccuracies — especially the 6x overstatement of AXP’s cash flow — severely undermine factual correctness. Multi-hop synthesis fails due to reliance on an incorrect primary figure for AXP, leading to an invalid aggregate. Thus, the correctness score is low despite some structural and conceptual alignment.",

      "original_answer": "NFLX disclosed that its Allowance for Credit Losses was not material as of December 31, 2023, indicating minimal risk in collecting receivables, likely due to its subscription-based model with recurring revenue and low credit risk from individual members. In contrast, T reported an ending balance of $756 million in its Allowance for Credit Losses for 2023, showing a significant provision for potential credit losses. This difference reveals that T faces higher credit risk, possibly due to business-to-business receivables with longer payment terms or higher exposure to economically sensitive customers. NFLX’s minimal allowance suggests a more stable and predictable cash flow, while T’s larger allowance reflects a more cautious financial strategy in managing credit exposure.",

Verizon, on the other hand, faces increased borrowing costs and reduced financing availability due to exposure to market rate fluctuations.

This omission of precise figures and maturities severely undermines quantitative accuracy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the LLM fails to report any of the specific dollar amounts or expiration dates that are central to the original answer.

However, it misses the explicit link between Verizon’s significant reliance on external financing and the resulting risk during business downturns as stated in the ground truth. For Google, the failure to acknowledge the known structure of its credit facilities breaks the multi-hop synthesis required—instead, it defaults to a lack-of-information claim, which contradicts the provided truth. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the general theme of market rate exposure and borrowing costs for both companies, but fails to deliver the specific, data-driven comparisons required by the question.

This leads to an incorrect combined net income of $8,390 million (vs. correct $8,319 million), and thus an incorrect comparison. (2) Calculations: Dividend sum is correct: $1,498 + $6,490 = $7,988 million. Net income sum is wrong: $5,915 + $2,475 = $8,390 (LLM) vs. correct $5,844 + $2,475 = $8,319 million. The difference affects the final comparison — LLM states dividends are 95.2% of net income, which may be approximately correct under its numbers, but the ground truth shows dividends ($7,988M) were exceeded by net income ($8,319M) by $331M, meaning payout ratio was ~96.0%.

Verizon, on the other hand, estimates standalone selling prices for wireless devices as their retail price excluding subsidies or discounts, and for wireless service as the price offered to customers on month-to-month contracts. Both companies use these standalone selling price estimates to allocate transaction prices between services and equipment in bundled contracts, which directly affects the timing and pattern of revenue recognition—Google recognizes revenue ratably over the contract term for subscription-based services, while Verizon recognizes equipment revenue at the point of delivery and service revenue over the enforceable contract term.",

For Google, SSPs for devices are based on retail prices without subsidies, while service SSPs reflect month-to-month rates without fixed-term obligations. Verizon similarly determines SSPs as standalone prices without promotional discounts. Revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on these SSPs, with recognition patterns tied to service delivery timelines (e.g., ratably for subscriptions, over contract terms for devices).

It accurately states that SSPs are derived from standalone offerings and that recognition aligns with fulfillment. However, it incorrectly swaps the specifics: it claims Google bases device SSPs on retail prices without subsidies, while the ground truth states this for Verizon, not Google. Conversely, the LLM says Google uses month-to-month rates for service SSPs, but the original answer does not specify Google’s service pricing method in those terms—only that it uses prices charged to customers. The LLM also generalizes Verizon’s approach without clearly distinguishing that Verizon uses retail price excluding subsidies for devices and month-to-month prices for service, which is a key differentiator. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default since no numbers are misstated.

However, the LLM slightly conflates the nature of the risk: the original answer distinguishes that Chevron faces direct earnings impact while ExxonMobil faces asset devaluation risk via impairments; the LLM treats both as facing similar impairment-related risks, slightly blurring this distinction. (4) Despite this nuance, the core message—that margin declines threaten both companies’ financial stability through impairments and profitability—is semantically equivalent and contextually appropriate. The answer is relevant, well-reasoned, and factually accurate on key points, warranting a high score with minor deduction for incomplete differentiation of risk types.",

      "original_answer": "Oracle highlights that its hardware products are marketed and sold through both indirect channels and its direct sales force, with sales and marketing expenses largely personnel-related, including variable compensation earned by its sales force. Texas Instruments emphasizes a stronger shift toward direct customer relationships, with about two-thirds of its revenue coming directly from customers in 2021. TI also notes that transactions on TI.com grew to about 10% of its revenue, and the company has invested in e-commerce enhancements, localized online experiences, and inventory consignment programs. Oracle benefits from direct sales through variable compensation tied to performance, while TI gains broader market reach, better customer insight, and a structural cost advantage through its direct engagement strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's hardware sales rely on a mix of direct and indirect channels, with the document noting that direct sales efforts are part of their strategy to emphasize cloud-based technologies and de-emphasize nonstrategic hardware products. However, specific financial benefits from this approach are not explicitly highlighted in the provided pages. In contrast, Texas Instruments strategically invests in direct customer relationships, with two-thirds of its revenue generated through direct sales channels (e.g., TI.com) and investments in e-commerce and customer engagement tools. These efforts are tied to operational benefits such as stronger market reach, improved customer insights, and increased sales opportunities, though financial metrics specific to these initiatives are not detailed in the excerpts.

It also correctly notes TI's investment in e-commerce (TI.com) and customer engagement tools. However, the LLM introduces a claim not present in the original answer — that Oracle’s cloud and license business has 67% margins compared to 60% for hardware — which, while potentially true, is not part of the provided ground truth and represents an unsupported inference. This affects factual accuracy. (2) Quantitatively, the 'two-thirds' figure for TI’s direct revenue is accurate and matches the ground truth. The 10% revenue from TI.com is missing in the LLM answer, which is a minor omission. The margin figures (67% vs 60%) are not in the original answer and cannot be verified from the given context, constituting a quantitative overreach. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts Oracle’s mixed sales model with TI’s direct focus and links direct engagement to operational benefits. However, it fails to mention Oracle’s variable compensation tied to performance — a key financial benefit highlighted in the original — while incorrectly inferring margin advantages from direct sales via cloud business, which was not stated. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, addressing both companies and the strategic and operational aspects of their sales approaches.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in both quantitative values and breakdowns. According to the ground truth, AXP had a $5,065 million increase in accounts payable and other liabilities in 2023 (not $5,265M as stated), and BLK had a $375 million increase in other liabilities (not $731M). The LLM incorrectly breaks down AXP's change into accounts payable (+$976M) and other liabilities (+$4,289M), which is unsupported by the ground truth and sums to an incorrect total. Similarly, BLK's breakdown into accounts payable (+$177M) and other liabilities (+$856M) is factually wrong—the ground truth only mentions a $375M increase in other liabilities with no mention of accounts payable separately. (2) The combined 2023 net change should be $5,065M (AXP) + $375M (BLK) = $5,440M, but the ground truth states $5,274M, suggesting slight discrepancies possibly due to exact line items; however, the LLM’s total of $5,265M + $731M = $5,996M is still significantly off. More critically, the ground truth explicitly states the combined 2023 change is $5,274M, which the LLM fails to match. Additionally, the LLM does not compare 2023 values to 2022 values correctly: it omits that AXP’s 2022 increase was $8,815M and BLK had a $481M *decrease* in 2022, which is crucial context. Instead, the LLM appears to report 2023 changes only, misrepresenting the year-over-year comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly extract and synthesize data across AXP and BLK filings for both 2022 and 2023, and does not compute the correct combined totals or trends. It introduces granular breakdowns (e.g., accounts payable vs. other liabilities) not present in the original answer and unsupported by the knowledge graph. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and general metric, but the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine correctness.

According to the ground truth, CVX reported a deficit of $13,493 million and XOM $1,245 million, totaling $14,738 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states that CVX's deficit was $1,245 million (same as XOM), and further claims both companies had identical ABO ($14,511M) and plan assets ($13,266M), which is factually wrong. (2) The calculation of individual deficits is incorrect for CVX: $14,511M - $13,266M = $1,245M is accurate, but this data was wrongly attributed to CVX when it belongs to XOM. The model swapped or duplicated XOM's data for CVX. The total combined deficit is therefore miscalculated as $2,490M instead of the correct $14,738M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed because the model did not correctly synthesize data from the two separate companies — it used the same numbers for both, indicating a failure in entity-specific data retrieval or differentiation.

However, it states that AXP's data is not available in the provided documents, which contradicts the ground truth that a combined value of $132 million exists for both AXP and COF. This implies AXP must have contributed $55 million ($132M - $77M) to the increase, meaning the data should have been accessible. The LLM fails to report this, leading to an incomplete and incorrect final answer. (2) The calculation for COF is correct, but the overall combined increase is not provided as required. The absence of AXP's data in the response results in a major factual gap. (3) The reasoning is internally logical—given the assumption that AXP's data is missing—but fails the multi-hop requirement to synthesize across both companies' filings. The model should have either located AXP's carryforward values or inferred them if implied elsewhere. The failure to do so breaks the chain of required synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the response addresses the metric and companies correctly and attempts the right calculation for COF. However, the correctness score is low due to the critical omission of AXP's contribution, which renders the final answer factually incorrect despite partial accuracy.",

The 2022 difference is correctly calculated as $8,653 million (14,645 - 5,992), and the 2023 difference as $8,817 million (13,618 - 4,801). (2) However, the LLM states that the difference 'increased by $164 million', which is factually incorrect—the difference increased from $8,653 to $8,817, which is an increase of $164 million in absolute terms, but the original answer interprets this as a 'change of -$164 million' likely referring to the reduction in the gap from Duke's perspective relative to prior year trends or regulatory context. But strictly numerically, the absolute difference increased by $164 million, so the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct. Upon closer inspection, the original answer says the difference 'decreased from $8,653 million to $8,817 million', which is numerically incorrect—$8,817 is greater than $8,653—so the original answer contains a factual error in directionality. Therefore, the LLM answer is actually quantitatively and logically correct.

The intercompany agreements involving Gulf Power (with entities like Alabama Power and Mississippi Power) referenced in Southern Company's 10-K indicate Gulf Power participated in shared infrastructure and operational contracts prior to the merger, but these agreements no longer applied as Gulf Power was fully integrated into FPL's single ratemaking entity structure in 2022.",

Intercompany agreements, including cost recovery clauses, allowed Gulf Power to pass through costs and revenues to NEE, impacting cash flows and net income.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several inaccuracies. Most critically, it states that Gulf Power was part of NEE in 2021 and merged in January 2022, but the ground truth confirms Gulf Power ceased to exist as a separate segment effective January 1, 2022, after being fully merged into FPL—this timing is partially correct but mischaracterized. However, the LLM incorrectly implies the merger occurred in 2021, stating 'after the 2021 merger', which is factually wrong. The net income figure of $271 million for Gulf Power in 2021 is not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified; thus, it is likely fabricated or misattributed. (2) Quantitatively, the $271 million figure is unsupported and likely incorrect. The date of the merger is misaligned—while January 1, 2022, is correct, the framing around a '2021 merger' introduces confusion and inaccuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to recognize that intercompany agreements with Southern Company subsidiaries (e.g., Alabama Power, Mississippi Power) were historical and no longer applied in 2022, as Gulf Power was fully integrated into FPL. It incorrectly suggests these agreements had ongoing impact on NEE’s regulated operations in 2022. The answer also misattributes the structure by implying Gulf Power still operated under NEE with intercompany cost pass-throughs in 2022, when in fact it was fully absorbed into FPL’s single ratemaking entity. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the structural integration and regulatory context but does so with incorrect timelines, unverified financials, and flawed implications about ongoing intercompany dynamics. Due to major factual and reasoning errors, especially regarding the existence and financials of Gulf Power in 2022 and its relationship with Southern Company entities, the correctness score is low despite some structural understanding.",

The net decrease is calculated as $8,045 million, but the correct net decrease is $7,191 million. These calculation errors are substantial and materially affect the answer's accuracy. (2) Oracle's numbers are correct: beginning $30,098M and ending $21,383M.

This reverses the operational responsibility, which is a significant detail in utility joint ownership structures. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly refers to Plant Daniel as a 'coal-fired facility'—this is not confirmed in the ground truth and introduces unsupported information. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts a divestiture (capital recycling) with joint ownership (shared stewardship), capturing the strategic distinction.

However, the quantitative values are partially incorrect: the ground truth states 3M's Adjusted Operating Margin was 22.6%, but the LLM reports 21.1%, which is inaccurate. UPS's margin is correctly reported as 9.0%. (2) The calculated difference is therefore also incorrect: 22.6% - 9.0% = 13.6 percentage points (correct), but the LLM calculates 21.1% - 9.0% = 12.1 percentage points, which is based on an incorrect input. This is a significant error in a financial comparison where precision matters. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model retrieves the correct metric for both companies and performs the comparison and difference calculation appropriately. The logic and structure of the answer are correct, showing proper synthesis across entities. (4) Despite the reasoning being valid, the correctness score is reduced due to the incorrect primary figure for 3M.

It reports CMCSA's 'Other Costs and Expenses' as $52,639 million, which is incorrect; the ground truth is $27,355 million. This error stems from misinterpreting segment-level costs (Connectivity & Platforms, Business Services Connectivity) as 'Other Costs and Expenses', which is not supported by the knowledge graph. The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM calculates $52,639M + $53,794M = $106,433M (not stated), whereas the correct sum is $81,149 million. META's 2024 'Other Costs and Expenses' ($53,794 million) and YoY increase ($3,463 million from $50,331 million) are correct. However, CMCSA's YoY change is reported as $7,641 million increase, which is inaccurate; the correct increase is from $26,923 million to $27,355 million, or about 1.6%, as correctly stated in the original answer. The LLM fails to report this percentage and instead uses an incorrect dollar amount based on flawed aggregation. (2) Calculations: The LLM's addition of segment costs is internally consistent but based on wrong metric mapping. META's calculation is accurate. The combined total is not explicitly computed in the LLM answer, further reducing completeness. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across companies and years but fails on CMCSA due to incorrect identification of the financial metric. It confuses segment expenses with consolidated 'Other Costs and Expenses', breaking the reasoning chain. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4) due to major numerical and metric errors, though META data is accurate. Quantitative accuracy is 4 due to one correct company's data but major error in CMCSA. Qualitative accuracy is 5 because reasoning structure is logical but based on incorrect data. Contextual relevance is high (8) as the answer addresses all question parts with appropriate framing, despite factual flaws.",

      "original_answer": "MetLife's preferred stock dividends of $195 million in 2021 directly reduce the net income available to common shareholders, which was $6,353 million in that year. This highlights the financial obligation companies in the financial sector face in maintaining preferred dividend payments. Meanwhile, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) discloses several risk factors, such as regulatory constraints, capital adequacy requirements, and the potential impact of economic weakness or cybersecurity incidents, which could materially affect its ability to generate sufficient earnings and maintain dividend payments. Together, these factors imply that while preferred dividends are a binding obligation, broader operational and regulatory risks at firms like BK could constrain their ability to sustain such payments, thereby affecting the stability of shareholder returns across the financial sector.",
      "llm_answer": "MetLife's net income available to common shareholders is reduced by preferred stock dividends, as shown in its 2021 consolidated statements of operations ($6,353M after $195M in preferred dividends). Bank of New York Mellon's risk factors highlight that its ability to pay dividends could be constrained by regulatory requirements and its obligation to pay preferred stock dividends, which takes precedence over common shareholder distributions.

These figures are accurately presented with acceptable formatting ($6,353M = $6,353 million). No calculation errors are present. (2) All entities—MetLife and Bank of New York Mellon (BK)—are correctly identified, and the relevant financial metrics (preferred dividends, net income available to common shareholders) and their implications are accurately discussed.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that preferred dividends reduce income available to common shareholders (MetLife) and links this to BK’s risk factors around dividend constraints due to regulatory and financial obligations. It appropriately infers that this creates reduced flexibility and potential instability in shareholder returns across the financial sector. (4) While the LLM answer captures the core implication about stability of shareholder returns and correctly emphasizes the precedence of preferred dividends and regulatory risks, it omits specific mention of BK’s additional risk factors such as capital adequacy requirements, economic weakness, and cybersecurity incidents—though it does reference 'regulatory requirements' broadly.

AT&T’s significantly higher interest payments indicate a more leveraged capital structure, likely driven by large-scale investments (e.g., infrastructure, spectrum, and the FirstNet agreement), reflecting a strategy to finance growth through debt despite higher financial obligations.

This leads to a total interest payment of $8,054.5 million, which is grossly incorrect—the correct total is $691,874,000. The error likely stems from a unit confusion (millions vs. thousands). (2) Calculations are completely wrong: $684.5 million + $7,370 million = $8,054.5 million is mathematically correct based on the wrong inputs, but the actual sum should be $684.5M + $7.37M = $691.87M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model misidentifies the relative scale of interest payments. It incorrectly concludes that AT&T has a much higher interest burden, reversing the actual relationship: Netflix pays ~93x more than AT&T, not the other way around. This undermines the entire strategic interpretation. (4) The qualitative analysis is therefore inverted and incorrect: the model claims Netflix has a 'conservative debt strategy' due to 'lower interest expense', but Netflix actually has a much higher interest payment. Conversely, it portrays AT&T as highly leveraged based on a fabricated number, when in reality AT&T’s low interest payment may reflect debt refinancing, asset sales, or a mature capital structure. The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to address both parts of the question and discusses debt strategies, but the conclusions are based on false data.

In contrast, Meta's content costs are embedded within broader cost of revenue and tied to infrastructure and partner arrangements, reflecting its ad-based and platform-driven monetization model.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The final combined total of $10,625 million matches the ground truth, but the individual components are incorrect. Adobe's reported long-term deferred revenue is stated as $145 million (from 2021), while Cisco's is $10,480 million (2022). However, according to the knowledge graph, the correct split should be Adobe: $1,145 million and Cisco: $9,480 million (summing to $10,625 million). The LLM incorrectly attributes $145 million to Adobe, which is off by a factor of 10. (2) The calculation of the sum is numerically correct ($145M + $10,480M = $10,625M), but it is based on incorrect inputs, making the result coincidentally aligned with the ground truth. The fiscal year mismatch for Adobe (using 2021 data when 2022 was required) further undermines quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model attempts to retrieve and combine data from both companies, but it fails to provide the correct 2022 figure for Adobe, indicating a failure in entity-year alignment. The note acknowledges the discrepancy but does not correct it or explain why 2021 data is being used. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the question structure and provides a clear synthesis attempt. However, the qualitative and quantitative accuracy scores are low due to the significant error in Adobe's reported value and the incorrect fiscal year usage, which critically undermine the correctness despite the numerically matching total.",

      "question": "Considering the $10 billion multi-year investment by CMCSA in premium sports content distribution rights, including exclusive NFL and NBA games through 2034, and META's explicit acknowledgment that Reels monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories products, how might the shift in digital advertising pricing baselines impact CMCSA's ability to sustain premium CPMs for linear TV sports advertising over the term of their content agreements?",
      "original_answer": "CMCSA's $10 billion investment in exclusive sports content distribution rights (including NFL Sunday Night Football and NBA games through 2034) depends on maintaining premium CPMs for linear TV advertising. However, META's shift toward Reels—a format that explicitly monetizes at lower rates than traditional Feed and Stories products—could establish a new baseline for digital advertising pricing. If advertisers reallocate budgets toward lower-cost digital formats like Reels while reducing spending on premium linear TV sports advertising, CMCSA may face pressure to lower CPMs or increase volume to recoup their content investment. This dynamic could challenge the financial returns from CMCSA's long-term sports rights agreements.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in digital advertising pricing baselines, exemplified by META's lower Reels monetization compared to Feed/Stories, may pressure CMCSA to lower premium CPMs for linear TV sports advertising. As digital platforms increasingly dominate ad spend with lower effective rates, advertisers may prioritize cost-effective options, potentially eroding the premium pricing power of linear TV. However, CMCSA's exclusive sports content (e.g., NFL, NBA through 2034) could sustain higher CPMs due to perceived value in live, time-sensitive sports audiences. The risk lies in balancing content costs with declining ad revenue if digital trends further compress pricing across all platforms.",

(1) All key facts are correct: CMCSA's $10 billion investment in premium sports rights (NFL, NBA) through 2034 and META's lower Reels monetization are correctly referenced. No numeric inaccuracies—dollar amounts and years match the original. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $10 billion figure and 2034 end date are correctly stated, and no calculations were required beyond accurate representation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links META's lower ad pricing on Reels to potential downward pressure on digital ad baselines, then connects this to possible advertiser budget shifts away from premium linear TV, threatening CMCSA's CPMs. It also appropriately acknowledges the counterweight of exclusive live sports content in preserving pricing power. (4) The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly state that META's shift could 'establish a new baseline' for digital pricing—a subtle but important causal link in the original—but this does not undermine the overall correctness.

      "original_answer": "The combined net change in income taxes for COP and XOM in 2024 is $42,577 million. COP reported a net change in income taxes of $(14)$ million for 2024, indicating a slight negative adjustment, while XOM reported a significant positive adjustment of $42,591 million.

This reflects differences in their tax-related adjustments: XOM's larger negative adjustment (-$3,756 million) likely stems from significant changes in discounted future income tax provisions, possibly due to tax rate adjustments or reserve valuation shifts, while COP's smaller negative adjustment (-$79 million) suggests less pronounced tax-related changes in its standardized measure calculations.",

The ground truth states that the combined net change in income taxes for COP and XOM in 2024 is $42,577 million, with COP at $(14)$ million (slight negative) and XOM at $42,591 million (large positive). In contrast, the LLM claims the combined value is $3,835 million, with both companies having negative adjustments (COP: -$79M, XOM: -$3,756M), which contradicts the ground truth. All numbers are wrong, including the individual and combined values. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer (sum of -$79M and -$3,756M = -$3,835M) is arithmetically correct but based on false inputs. The correct sum per ground truth is $42,591M + (-$14M) = $42,577M, which the LLM does not reflect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails completely: the model incorrectly identifies the direction (negative vs positive), magnitude, and entities' values. It fabricates tax-related explanations (e.g., 'discounted future income tax provisions', 'reserve valuation shifts') not present in the original answer and unsupported by the provided truth.

PepsiCo, while also citing the pandemic as a key factor in its impairment assessments, did not report any specific impairment charges related to it. Instead, PepsiCo emphasized its use of discounted cash flow models and qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets. The difference in outcomes stems from the specific exposure of Filorga's business model to pandemic-related restrictions, whereas PepsiCo's broader portfolio and internal forecasting did not trigger impairment charges during the same period.",
      "llm_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's Filorga reporting unit experienced a direct impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to reduced consumer mobility and channel-specific declines (duty-free, travel retail, pharmacy), which triggered an interim impairment test and resulted in a $204 million trademark impairment charge. PepsiCo, while considering macroeconomic factors like the pandemic in its qualitative impairment assessments, did not report specific pandemic-related impairments for its indefinite-lived intangible assets, as its other reporting units' fair values exceeded carrying values. The pandemic's influence on Colgate-Palmolive was more directly tied to operational and market-specific disruptions, whereas PepsiCo's impairment factors included broader macroeconomic considerations without material pandemic-driven charges.",

It accurately contrasts this with PepsiCo's approach, noting that while the pandemic was considered in impairment assessments, no specific charges were reported. The final carrying value of $588 million for Filorga is omitted, but all other key facts are present and correct. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $204 million impairment charge is correctly stated, and no incorrect numbers are introduced.

The years (2021 for Adobe, 2022 for Cisco) are not mentioned in the LLM answer, but the percentages themselves are correct and contextually sufficient given that the question focuses on strategy rather than strict year-over-year comparison.

      "original_answer": "DUK reported a Salary Increase range of 3.50% - 4.00% for each of the years 2021 through 2023, while NEE reported a specific Salary Increase of 4.90% for 2023. The higher salary increase assumption at NEE implies a faster-growing benefit obligation compared to DUK, which could lead to a larger liability on NEE's financial statements if other actuarial assumptions (like discount rate and employee demographics) are held constant. This contrast in salary increase assumptions suggests that NEE may be recognizing a more aggressive growth in employee compensation, which would increase the present value of pension obligations more significantly than under DUK's more moderate and consistent assumptions.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in reported salary increase assumptions between DUK and NEE in 2023 affects their employee benefit obligation valuations as follows: DUK used a consistent range of 3.50%–4.00% for salary increases, reflecting uncertainty and leading to a broader estimate of future benefits. In contrast, NEE reported a single value of 4.90% for 2023, which is higher than DUK's range. A higher salary increase assumption directly increases the projected benefit obligation (PBO) because future benefits are tied to higher salaries.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The ground truth states that the combined percentage change in the debt to capital ratio from 2023 to 2024 for COP and XOM is -1.0 percentage points, not -18.29% as claimed. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly asserts that both companies had a debt to capital ratio of 13.4% in 2024, while the ground truth clearly states that COP had a 27% ratio and XOM had 13.4% in 2024 — meaning COP did not have a lower ratio than XOM; in fact, XOM did. (2) The calculations provided by the LLM are based on false premises: it assumes both companies had a 2023 ratio of 16.4% and 2024 ratio of 13.4%, which contradicts the ground truth. The term 'combined percentage change' refers to the sum of the individual changes in percentage points (not percent changes), which the LLM misunderstood entirely. For example, if COP changed from 27% to 27% (no change) and XOM from 14.4% to 13.4% (-1.0 pp), the combined change would be -1.0 pp — matching the ground truth. The LLM instead computed percentage changes incorrectly and applied them uniformly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly identify or differentiate the debt to capital ratios for the two companies across years, conflated percentage point changes with relative percent changes, and failed to compare the correct 2024 values to determine which company had the lower ratio. (4) Due to pervasive factual errors, miscalculations, and misinterpretation of the metric, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are near zero. The contextual relevance is slightly higher only because the answer addresses the right companies and metric, albeit with wrong data.",

At HD in 2023, the total value of stock options exercised was $79.7 million (743,000 shares at an average price of $106.96 per share).

According to the ground truth, NKE's stock option exercise value was $421 million in 2022 and $432 million in 2023, totaling $853 million over the two years. The LLM incorrectly reports $61 million for 2022 and $152 million for 2023, summing to $213 million—less than a quarter of the correct total. For HD in 2023, the correct value is $79.7 million (based on 743,000 shares at $106.96), but the LLM states $152 million, which is nearly double the correct amount. (2) Calculations are also incorrect: the LLM claims NKE’s combined total is $61 million higher than HD’s 2023 value, but with correct numbers, the difference is $853M - $79.7M = $773.3M. The LLM’s calculation uses incorrect inputs and thus yields a wrong comparison. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies the entities (NKE and HD) and the relevant metric (stock options exercised) and attempts the multi-hop comparison across companies and years, the reasoning is undermined by completely inaccurate data. The structure of the response follows the required logic—aggregating NKE over two years and comparing to HD in 2023—but the synthesis is based on false values. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, time periods, and metric, and attempts the correct comparative analysis. However, due to severe quantitative errors, the correctness and accuracy scores are very low.

      "original_answer": "AMT's tenant leases, which include fixed escalation percentages or inflationary index-based rent increases, along with financial penalties for early termination, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream by discouraging tenants from terminating leases prematurely. This contrasts with SPG's exposure to leasing risks from e-commerce growth and public health crises, which can reduce consumer foot traffic, lower tenant performance, and result in store closures or underreported sales. AMT's lease structure could serve as a risk mitigation strategy for SPG if applied, as it would reduce the impact of tenant turnover and rent volatility caused by these external threats.",
      "llm_answer": "AMT's tenant leases, structured with fixed escalation percentages and penalties for early termination, mitigate leasing risks for SPG by ensuring stable rental income streams and reducing vacancy risks. Fixed escalations provide predictable revenue growth, offsetting potential declines in tenant sales due to e-commerce growth or public health crises. Penalties for early termination discourage tenants from vacating during downturns, preserving occupancy and minimizing re-leasing costs. These features enhance lease stability, aligning with SPG's need to manage risks from retail tenant defaults, market shifts, and economic disruptions.",

(1) All key elements are accurately addressed: fixed escalation percentages ensure predictable rent growth, early termination penalties reduce tenant churn, and these features collectively mitigate leasing risks SPG faces from e-commerce and public health crises. There are no incorrect numbers, dates, or entities—this is a qualitative question without specific numeric values, so quantitative accuracy is scored based on absence of numerical errors (score 10). (2) The answer is complete, covering both structural aspects of AMT's leases and their relevance to SPG's risk exposure. It correctly synthesizes the multi-hop relationship between AMT's lease design and SPG's vulnerability to external shocks. (3) Reasoning is sound: it logically connects lease stability mechanisms to reduced turnover and revenue volatility, aligning with the original answer’s core argument. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly mention 'inflationary index-based rent increases' (only 'fixed escalation percentages'), slightly narrowing the scope compared to the original, hence qualitative accuracy is 9.

      "original_answer": "XOM invested $26.3 billion in capital and exploration expenditures in 2023 to support the development of new fields and mitigate natural field decline through disciplined investments. Meanwhile, COP achieved a reserve replacement rate of 123% in 2023, driven by development drilling, extensions, discoveries, and purchases. This indicates that while both companies focus on sustaining production through new field development, XOM emphasizes large-scale capital investment in a diverse portfolio, whereas COP highlights successful reserve additions through a mix of exploration and acquisitions. The combined evidence suggests differing strategic emphases: XOM prioritizes proactive investment in future capacity, while COP emphasizes effective reserve management and replacement efficiency.",

These figures are critical quantitative elements and are accurately reported. The mention of XOM’s 2024 planned investment of $23–25 billion is additional context not in the original answer but does not contradict it and is consistent with forward-looking statements in SEC filings, so it does not reduce accuracy. (2) All numbers, dates, and percentages are correct and properly attributed. No calculation errors are present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer connects XOM’s capital spending strategy to its focus on new field development and links COP’s reserve replacement performance to its production sustainability approach. It correctly contrasts XOM’s capital-intensive, infrastructure-focused strategy with COP’s emphasis on reserve replacement via organic growth and acquisitions. The synthesis across two companies and their respective strategies is logically coherent and aligns with the ground truth. (4) While the LLM answer uses slightly different phrasing—such as 'diversified growth and acquisitions' versus 'successful reserve additions through a mix of exploration and acquisitions'—the semantic meaning is equivalent. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly downplays XOM’s emphasis on 'disciplined investments' and 'mitigating natural field decline' mentioned in the original, but captures the core strategic contrast.

According to the ground truth, ExxonMobil's decrease in undeveloped acreage occurred specifically in the 'Other Americas' region, with net acreage declining from 11,548 thousand acres in 2023 to 6,381 thousand acres in 2024. However, the LLM incorrectly reports global net undeveloped acreage as decreasing from 41,019 to 33,577 thousand acres, which does not match the ground truth data. These numbers are entirely different in magnitude and scope, indicating a failure in data retrieval or synthesis. (2) The calculation of a decrease (41,019 to 33,577) implies a reduction of ~7,442 thousand acres, but this is irrelevant since the numbers themselves are incorrect. The actual reduction in 'Other Americas' net acreage was 11,548 - 6,381 = 5,167 thousand acres. The LLM’s numbers do not reflect the correct entity (regional vs. global), time frame, or metric. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning about ExxonMobil's strategic reduction and ConocoPhillips' inclusion of undeveloped acreage in proved reserves is partially sound. The LLM correctly identifies that ConocoPhillips includes undeveloped acreage in its proved reserves reporting and interprets this as a signal of long-term development focus, which aligns with the ground truth. It also correctly infers differing strategic approaches—ExxonMobil optimizing holdings, ConocoPhillips emphasizing future growth. However, the multi-hop synthesis fails because the ExxonMobil data is factually wrong, undermining the comparison. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses all parts of the question: changes in acreage, comparison to ConocoPhillips, and implications for future production. The structure and intent are appropriate, hence a higher relevance score. However, due to major quantitative errors, the correctness score is low despite reasonable interpretation.",

The question asks for the direction of the trend between the two companies' rates in the prior year (i.e., 2021 to 2022). While FDX decreased from 6.75% to 6.50% in that period, LMT’s rate did not change from 2021 to 2022—it had already declined from 7.00% to 6.50% in 2021 and remained flat.

      "original_answer": "AMT generates over $60 billion in non-cancellable tenant lease revenue due to long-term contracts with wireless carriers and a 3% average annual rent escalation, combined with a 3% churn rate, which ensures consistent revenue growth and low cash flow volatility. In contrast, SPG faces significant uncertainty in tenant leasing due to risks like oversupply reducing market rents, e-commerce competition impacting occupancy rates, and safety concerns affecting consumer foot traffic. These factors expose SPG to higher tenant turnover and lower leasing demand, making its revenue outlook more volatile compared to AMT’s stable and predictable revenue base.",
      "llm_answer": "AMT's lease dependency on a small number of large tenants (e.g., AT&T, Verizon) and lower churn rates (3% in 2023) provide greater revenue stability due to long-term contracts with escalations and high renewal rates. In contrast, SPG's retail-focused model faces higher churn risk from tenant bankruptcies, retail closures, and e-commerce disruption, leading to greater revenue volatility.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies key qualitative differences between AMT and SPG regarding lease dependency, churn risk, and revenue stability. It accurately states AMT's 3% churn rate (matching ground truth) and correctly contrasts AMT's long-term, escalator-backed contracts with SPG's exposure to retail sector risks like e-commerce disruption and tenant bankruptcies. However, the LLM omits the ground truth's specific figure of 'over $60 billion in non-cancellable tenant lease revenue' for AMT, which is a material quantitative point directly supporting revenue stability. (2) The only numeric value provided—AMT’s 3% churn rate—is correct and matches the ground truth. No calculations are required, but the absence of the $60B+ non-cancellable revenue figure reduces quantitative completeness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that AMT’s telecom tower model with long-term carrier contracts leads to stable revenue, while SPG’s mall-based retail REIT model faces higher volatility due to structural retail challenges. The logic connecting lease structure, churn, and revenue outlook is coherent and aligns with the ground truth. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing the comparative impact on revenue stability and tenant demand. The omission of the $60B+ non-cancellable revenue weakens completeness but does not undermine the core correctness.

      "original_answer": "NVIDIA experienced a 64.9% overall gross margin in fiscal year 2022, up from 62.3% in fiscal year 2021. This improvement was primarily driven by a higher-end mix within Graphics, which saw its gross margin increase. However, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced a gross margin decline due to a shift in product mix. Texas Instruments' Embedded Processing revenue and operating profit increased in 2022 primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Given that both companies operate in the semiconductor space and serve overlapping markets (e.g., automotive, industrial, and computing), NVIDIA's product mix shift and margin dynamics could signal market demand changes that may create opportunities for Texas Instruments to capitalize on or face increased competition in embedded processing applications.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA's shift in product mix between its Graphics and Compute & Networking segments in fiscal year 2022 led to differential gross margin impacts, with the Compute & Networking segment experiencing a margin decline due to a product mix shift toward lower-margin offerings (e.g., hyperscale and vertical industry sales).

It also correctly frames the competitive dynamics in overlapping markets. However, it omits key quantitative details from the ground truth: NVIDIA's overall gross margin of 64.9% in FY2022 (up from 62.3% in FY2021) and the fact that the Graphics segment saw margin expansion due to a higher-end product mix. These numbers are central to the 'differential gross margin impacts' asked in the question. (2) The LLM answer contains no specific numbers related to NVIDIA's margins or year-over-year changes, which are present and critical in the original answer. While it qualitatively references margin decline in Compute & Networking, it fails to quantify it or mention the Graphics segment margin improvement. This results in a significant gap in quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links NVIDIA's segment-level margin shifts to potential implications for Texas Instruments in overlapping markets (automotive, industrial, computing), and infers plausible competitive or strategic opportunities.

      "original_answer": "The discontinuation of LIBOR could increase borrowing costs and negatively impact financial performance for both MetLife and BNY Mellon. MetLife specifically notes that differences between LIBOR and alternative reference rates may impact the value and return on financial instruments, investments, and interest rates on debt, which could increase costs or reduce returns. BNY Mellon highlights that increased funding and borrowing costs could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

      "llm_answer": "The discontinuation of LIBOR may increase borrowing costs and financial risks for both MetLife and BNY Mellon. For BNY Mellon, reliance on LIBOR-based instruments could lead to valuation declines, higher collateral requirements, and uncertainty in transitioning to alternative rates, potentially increasing costs and reducing liquidity.

However, since ADBE's value is wrong, the sum is incorrect: $1,372M + $1,529M = $2,901M (correct), whereas the LLM computes $709M + $1,529M = $2,238M.

The impact on CAT’s 2022 vs 2021 net periodic benefit cost is misrepresented: the ground truth says the $168M expected increase in 2022 *excludes* mark-to-market effects, implying volatility is stripped out, while the LLM fabricates a narrative of reduced losses or offsetting gains driving a drop to $121M, which is unsupported. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to some relevant context (mention of mark-to-market impacts on pension costs, correct company focus) but major factual and directional errors in numbers and accounting treatment. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to invented figures. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) — the structure of comparison is present but logic flawed.

      "original_answer": "NFLX stated that accrued participations and residuals were not material as of December 31, 2021, indicating the amount had a negligible impact on its financial position. In contrast, T reported accrued participations and residuals of $2,966 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented a significant portion of its total accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($50,661 million). This shows that while NFLX considered the liability immaterial, T had a quantifiably substantial obligation in this category, suggesting differing scales or structures of content-related liabilities between the two companies.",

In contrast, T (AT&T) reports accrued participations and residuals as part of its \"Accounts payable and accrued liabilities\" ($2,966 million in 2021), but does not explicitly address their materiality. While the amounts are listed, they are relatively small compared to other liabilities (e.g., $30,756 million in accounts payable), suggesting they are **not material** for AT&T either.

It also correctly reports T's (AT&T's) accrued participations and residuals amount of $2,966 million as of the same date. However, the LLM incorrectly concludes that this amount was 'not material' for AT&T based on its relative size compared to other liabilities, which contradicts the ground truth. The original answer emphasizes that $2,966 million was a significant portion of T's total accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($50,661 million), representing about 5.85%, and explicitly states it was a 'significant' obligation. The LLM's assertion that the amount is relatively small compared to '$30,756 million in accounts payable' is factually incorrect — the correct total is $50,661 million per the ground truth, suggesting the LLM either misremembered or mischaracterized the data. (2) Quantitative accuracy is mostly correct: the $2,966 million figure for T is accurate, and the date (2021) is correct. However, the comparison figure of $30,756 million for accounts payable is wrong — the correct total is $50,661 million, which undermines the validity of the materiality assessment. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the model correctly retrieves individual facts about NFLX and T, it fails to synthesize them correctly. It incorrectly infers that because AT&T didn’t explicitly label the item as material, and because it appears small relative to an incorrect benchmark, it must be immaterial. This contradicts the ground truth, which uses the actual magnitude and proportion to conclude materiality for T. The model also misses the key contrast: NFLX explicitly states immateriality, while T reports a large quantified amount that implies materiality through disclosure. (4) Correctness is scored at 4 due to major errors in interpretation and use of incorrect supporting data, despite accurate retrieval of core numbers. Quantitative accuracy is 8 because the primary dollar amounts and dates are correct, but contextual totals are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to flawed reasoning and misinterpretation of materiality.

In contrast, UnitedHealth Group's 2023 acquisitions showed **~467% of goodwill relative to net identifiable assets** ($10.121 billion goodwill / $2.166 billion net assets).

This level of detail does not appear in HD's filing according to the ground truth. Similarly, while NKE does reference ROIC as a performance measure and includes a calculation as of May 31, 2024, and 2023, the LLM invents a precise formula (EBIT adjusted for taxes, specific denominator components) that is not confirmed in the ground truth.

(2) There are no actual numbers, dates, or calculations in the ground truth to verify quantitatively beyond the mention of May 31, 2024, and 2023 for NKE’s ROIC data, which the LLM does not reference accurately in context. The LLM introduces financial formulas without any numerical values, so quantitative accuracy cannot be established. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM fabricates detailed definitions and calculations for both companies rather than reporting what is actually stated in the filings. It incorrectly asserts that both companies provide specific formulas and treat ROIC as non-GAAP, which is not confirmed in the ground truth.

However, the LLM claims NVDA records unrealized gains and losses on marketable equity investments in 'other income (expense), net,' directly affecting operating income—this contradicts the original answer and misrepresents NVDA's actual disclosure. For TXN, the LLM correctly identifies that unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are recorded in AOCI, net of taxes, and that credit losses impact operating income and expense (OI&E). However, it introduces non-marketable equity investments, which were not mentioned in the ground truth and shifts focus away from the core comparison. (2) There are no explicit numerical values in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not heavily applicable; however, the absence of materiality qualification for NVDA is a critical omission. The LLM implies active recognition of unrealized items for NVDA, which is factually incorrect per the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the LLM fails to recognize that the key difference lies in materiality: NVDA’s unrealized items are immaterial, while TXN’s are systematically accounted for in AOCI and OI&E. Instead, the model fabricates a detailed accounting policy for NVDA that contradicts the source. It also adds information about non-marketable investments for TXN not present in the ground truth, introducing noise. (4) Correctness is low (3/10) due to the central factual error about NVDA.

It correctly identifies Nike's ROIC as 46.5% for the period ending May 31, 2022, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it fails to provide General Motors' actual ROIC value and incorrectly states that GM does not report ROIC, when in fact the ground truth specifies GM's ROIC-adjusted is part of a combined total of 49.4%.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct—Nike’s 46.5% is accurate, but the combined ROIC of 49.4% is not reported, and no attempt is made to derive or state it. The absence of GM’s numeric contribution undermines the quantitative response. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires combining ROIC values from two companies and interpreting how their definitions reflect capital structure differences. While the LLM attempts qualitative interpretation—correctly noting GM’s focus on debt/liabilities and Nike’s asset-light model—it fails to base this on actual reported definitions from the data, instead inferring plausible but unverified formulas (e.g., 'EBIT adjusted for taxes divided by invested capital' for Nike is not confirmed in the ground truth).

      "question": "How does the failure of subsidiary REITs to qualify as REITs impact both AMT's and SPG's ability to maintain compliance with REIT income and asset tests, and what financial consequences could each company face under these scenarios?",
      "original_answer": "If subsidiary REITs fail to qualify as REITs, both AMT and SPG would face significant financial and compliance consequences. For AMT, the ownership of shares in such subsidiary REITs would fail to be qualifying assets under REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains from the subsidiary would no longer count toward the 75% gross income test. This could materially affect AMT’s ability to maintain its own REIT status. Additionally, AMT would economically bear the federal income tax, penalties, and interest incurred by the subsidiary REIT. For SPG, failure of its subsidiary REITs to qualify would similarly disrupt its REIT compliance, particularly regarding income sourcing and asset composition, and could result in corporate-level taxes and a 4% nondeductible excise tax if distributions fall short. Both companies face liquidity constraints and reduced flexibility in executing their business strategies due to the mandatory distribution requirements tied to REIT status.",
      "llm_answer": "If subsidiary REITs fail to qualify as REITs, both AMT and SPG would face significant compliance and financial risks. **AMT** would lose the ability to rely on subsidiary REITs for qualifying assets (e.g., dividends or gains from subsidiaries would no longer count toward the 75% gross income test), potentially causing AMT to fail REIT income/asset tests. This could result in corporate-level taxation at regular rates, 4% excise taxes on undistributed income, and reduced cash flow, undermining distributions and growth. **SPG** would similarly face corporate tax liabilities, loss of REIT status, and inability to meet asset tests (e.g., non-qualifying assets from subsidiaries exceeding limits), leading to higher taxes, reduced liquidity, and potential disqualification. Both companies risk losing tax benefits, increasing costs, and harming shareholder returns.",

(1) All key facts are correct: loss of qualifying asset treatment, failure of 75% gross income test, risk of corporate-level taxation, 4% excise tax, reduced liquidity, and impact on distributions. The answer correctly identifies that dividend income and gains from non-qualifying subsidiaries would not count toward REIT income tests, and that both companies could lose REIT status. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 75% gross income test and 4% nondeductible excise tax are correctly cited with no numerical errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM synthesizes implications across REIT compliance (income and asset tests), financial consequences (taxes, cash flow), and strategic impacts (distributions, growth). The only minor omission is that the original answer specifies AMT would 'economically bear' the subsidiary's taxes, penalties, and interest—this nuance is implied but not explicitly stated in the LLM response, slightly reducing completeness. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent: every part of the question is addressed with precise, relevant information. Overall, the LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth with only a slight gap in depth regarding AMT's economic burden from subsidiary taxes.",

While it correctly states Colgate-Palmolive's projected cash expenditures ($180M–$216M), it grossly misstates PepsiCo's restructuring cash expenditures. The ground truth reports $2M in 2021 and $2M in 2020, totaling $4M, but the LLM claims $256M in 2021 and $255M in 2020, totaling $511M — a 127x overstatement. This invalidates the comparison and conclusion. (2) Calculations: Colgate’s range is correctly derived as 90% of $200–$240M pre-tax charge, which is accurate. However, the sum of PepsiCo’s expenditures is completely wrong — $256M + $255M = $511M is factually incorrect per the knowledge graph. The correct sum is $2M + $2M = $4M. The comparison that Colgate’s expenditures are 'significantly lower' is therefore false; in reality, Colgate’s lower bound ($180M) is 45x higher than PepsiCo’s $4M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and multiple years, fulfilling the structural requirement of multi-hop reasoning, but the synthesis is based on incorrect data. The logic flow is sound (projected vs. actual, comparison of magnitudes), but garbage-in-garbage-out undermines validity. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to critical factual inaccuracy in core numbers. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because only Colgate’s numbers are right; PepsiCo’s are entirely wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the model identifies the correct entities and intent to compare, but reasoning fails on false premises. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) — the answer addresses the right question structure, uses appropriate terminology, and attempts correct synthesis, just with wrong data.",

According to the ground truth, BAC's Trading Account Assets are $284,325 million, not $3,510 million as stated in the LLM answer. The value of $3,510 million actually corresponds to BAC's 'Trading liabilities' in 2024, not assets—this is a critical misinterpretation of the data. C's Trading Account Assets are correctly cited as $6,971 million in 2024. However, the LLM incorrectly assumes C's 2023 value is $6,971 million, while the ground truth states it was $11,350 million. Thus, both the prior-year value and the comparison are wrong. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs: the sum $3,510M + $6,971M = $10,481M is mathematically correct but uses invalid data. The correct total is $284,325M + $6,971M = $291,296M. The claimed increase of $3,510M is incorrect; the actual change is a decrease in C's assets from $11,350M to $6,971M (a drop of $4,379M), though the combined total is still much higher due to BAC's large asset base. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly extract BAC's Trading Account Assets, confuses liabilities with assets, and does not accurately retrieve C's prior-year value. It also relies on an unsupported assumption that consolidated VIEs data reflects total Trading Account Assets.

In contrast, UPS holds a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at both fixed and floating interest rates, exposing it to interest rate risk.

It also accurately notes that CAT uses present value of expected cash flows, collateral value, or market prices for impaired loans—additional detail not in the original answer but factually consistent and plausible, so not penalized. However, the description of UPS’s interest rate risk exposure is less precise: the ground truth specifies that UPS’s finance receivables accrue income at both fixed and floating rates, creating interest rate risk, but the LLM omits this key point and instead implies the risk stems from external market shifts without clarifying the internal mix of rate types. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—score of 10 is justified as there are no errors in numbers, percentages, or calculations. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts CAT’s valuation methodology with UPS’s risk management practices. However, it inaccurately lists 'forward contracts' and 'options' as the instruments UPS uses, whereas the ground truth specifies 'interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, and other derivative instruments'—'forward contracts' and 'options' are not equivalent and may not be the primary tools for managing interest rate risk in this context. The mention of sensitivity analysis is accurate and adds relevant context, though not part of the core question. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies and the contrast between valuation and risk management.

Additionally, the LLM claims GD's 2022 data is unavailable, but the question asks for a comparison between 2021 and 2022 for EMR versus GD in the same period; the ground truth clarifies that GD's data only goes through 2021, so the comparison is inherently asymmetric, but the LLM misrepresents the available data. (2) The quantitative error in GD's rate (2.84% vs. correct 2.54% in 2021) affects accuracy. The EMR numbers are correct.

The reclassification practices of both companies affect the ability to directly compare their operating income growth because each company modifies its historical data differently to align with current reporting standards, making cross-company comparisons more complex without adjusting for these reclassifications.",
      "llm_answer": "The reclassification of prior period amounts by ACN (Accenture) involved reorganizing geographic markets (e.g., moving Middle East/Africa to EMEA), which adjusted 2023 figures to align with the 2024 reporting structure. This ensures comparability by standardizing segment presentations. TXN also reclassified prior-period amounts to conform to 2023 reporting, though specific details are not provided. These adjustments improve comparability by aligning historical data with current classifications, but the exact impact on operating income growth depends on the nature of each company's reclassifications.",

However, it omits key quantitative details from the ground truth: ACN's reclassification specifically impacted operating income growth by $786 million or 9% for fiscal 2024 vs. 2023, a critical figure that directly addresses the question. This number is entirely missing in the LLM response, significantly reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) No calculations are attempted or misstated, but the absence of the $786 million and 9% figures—central to the original answer—means the LLM fails to provide the core data needed to assess the actual impact on comparability. (3) The reasoning is sound in recognizing that reclassifications affect comparability and that both companies adjusted prior periods, but it does not synthesize the multi-hop insight that ACN’s reclassification directly quantifies the effect on operating income growth while TXN’s does not, making cross-company comparison complex without adjustments. This nuanced contrast is underdeveloped. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer stays focused on reclassifications and their effect on comparability, but the lack of specific financial impact data limits correctness. The qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct entity and concept identification (ACN, TXN, reclassification, segment alignment), but incomplete synthesis of the comparative implications.",

      "original_answer": "VZ reported a decrease of $82 million in customer premise equipment costs due to lower volumes sold, treating these costs as operating expenses that directly reduced current period profitability. In contrast, CMCSA capitalizes customer premise equipment costs associated with installation as part of property and equipment, spreading the expense over the asset's estimated useful life rather than recognizing it immediately. This results in different financial impacts: VZ's approach lowers current expenses and potentially short-term profitability, while CMCSA's capitalization defers costs to future periods through depreciation.",
      "llm_answer": "Verizon (VZ) expenses customer premise equipment costs as incurred, recognizing the full cost in its income statement when volumes decline, while Comcast (CMCSA) capitalizes such costs as assets on its balance sheet, depreciating them over their 6-year useful life.

This core conceptual distinction is accurately conveyed and directly addresses the question. (2) However, the LLM answer introduces a specific useful life of '6 years' for CMCSA's CPE assets, which is not present in the original answer or ground truth. The ground truth only states 'estimated useful life' without specifying duration, so this added precision is unsupported and constitutes a quantitative inaccuracy. Additionally, the $82 million reduction in costs for VZ, explicitly stated in the original answer, is omitted in the LLM response, representing a missing quantitative detail. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that two companies in the same sector treat similar operational expenses differently, with implications for financial statements and profitability timing. The logic behind immediate expensing vs. capitalization and depreciation is well articulated. (4) Despite the unsupported '6-year' claim and omission of the $82M figure, the LLM captures the essential contrast in accounting policies and their financial impact. Hence, the correctness score is 8 (minor omissions and one unsupported number), quantitative accuracy is 7 (missing $82M, added unverified 6-year life), qualitative accuracy is 9 (strong reasoning and correct entity identification), and contextual relevance is 10 (fully on-topic and responsive).",

BKNG's net cash used in financing activities is correctly stated as $1.2 billion. (2) The calculation is based on incorrect inputs: the LLM computes $1.2B - $0.9B = $0.3B, but since GM actually provided $2.6B (not used $0.9B), the correct difference is $2.6B + $1.2B = $3.8B.

However, it incorrectly states that General Dynamics' (GD) 2022 data is not available, when in fact the ground truth includes GD's 2022 unvested shares as 532,142. The LLM mistakenly relies on December 31, 2021 data and fails to locate or acknowledge GD's 2022 fiscal year-end figure, which should have been accessible in the relevant 10-K. (2) The individual numbers cited (1,272,000 and 532,142) are quantitatively accurate and sum to the correct total of 1,804,142 per the ground truth. However, the LLM does not perform this sum nor confirm the total, and incorrectly concludes that GD's data is missing. This undermines the quantitative accuracy despite correct inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly identifying EMR’s data and attempting to locate GD’s—but fails at full synthesis by not confirming GD’s 2022 number, resulting in an incomplete answer.

However, the LLM claims XOM's crude oil revenue is 'not explicitly provided' and thus not calculable, which contradicts the ground truth. This leads to a completely incorrect assessment of the data availability and synthesis. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly reports COP's total revenue as $56,141 million (likely confusing it with another figure or company), whereas the ground truth states $8,203 million, leading to an erroneous proportion calculation of 0.26% instead of the correct ~1.74% ($143M / $8,203M). (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the combined revenue is not calculated at all, XOM's crude oil revenue is falsely reported as missing, and COP's total revenue is wrong by a large margin. Only COP's crude oil revenue of $143 million is correct.

In contrast, Lockheed Martin's pension-related cash flow fluctuations, including a $1.0 billion contribution in 2020, highlighted liquidity management focused on pension obligations, with pension adjustments and contributions significantly impacting net earnings and cash flows, demonstrating sector-specific priorities in addressing long-term liabilities versus operational expansion.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies FedEx's $6.9 billion cash balance at May 31, 2022, and Lockheed Martin's $1.0 billion pension contribution in 2020—both key quantitative facts from the ground truth. The mention of FedEx's $6.8 billion capital expenditures in 2023 aligns with the original answer’s reference to capital expenditures and planned stock buyback, though the exact $1.5 billion stock repurchase figure is omitted. This is a minor omission but does not distort the overall accuracy. (2) All numbers and dates are factually correct and match the ground truth or are consistent with it—$6.9 billion cash balance (FedEx, May 31, 2022), $1.0 billion pension contribution (Lockheed Martin, 2020). No calculations are required, and all numeric references are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes liquidity use across two different industrial companies, correctly contrasting FedEx’s focus on growth and shareholder returns (capex, dividends, buybacks) with Lockheed Martin’s focus on pension obligations affecting cash flows. The reasoning captures the sector-wide theme of differing liquidity strategies based on strategic priorities. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with slightly different phrasing but full preservation of meaning. The only minor gap is the absence of the specific $1.5 billion stock buyback figure, which slightly reduces completeness but does not affect correctness. Thus, high scores across all dimensions are justified, with a 9 on correctness due to this small omission.",

However, it incorrectly states ExxonMobil's bitumen price as $49.64 per barrel, while the ground truth confirms both companies had the same price of $42.15 per barrel. This leads to a false price difference of $7.49, which does not exist.

The original answer explicitly states that the price per barrel is identical, so no price difference should be reported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly compares production volumes and prices between the two companies — but fails in synthesizing the correct pricing data, undermining the core comparison. The conclusion that volume difference is larger than price difference is misleading because the price difference is zero, not $7.49. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to major factual error in pricing data, despite correct volume figures and reasoning structure.

While AVGO's income from continuing operations in fiscal year 2023 is correctly stated as $14,082 million and QCOM's operating income in fiscal year 2024 is correctly given as $10,071 million, the LLM incorrectly reports QCOM's income from continuing operations in fiscal year 2024 as $10,336 million instead of the correct $10,110 million from the ground truth. This leads to an incorrect total combined income of $24,418 million instead of $24,192 million. The difference compared to QCOM's operating income is then miscalculated as $14,347 million instead of the correct $14,121 million. (2) Calculations: The correct sum is $14,082 + $10,110 = $24,192; the LLM computes $14,082 + $10,336 = $24,418 — this is off by $226 million. The correct excess over QCOM's operating income is $24,192 - $10,071 = $14,121; the LLM reports $24,418 - $10,071 = $14,347 — off by $226 million.

Schwab, on the other hand, bases its fair value measurements for interest rate swaps on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve, considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract.

AIG uses market-observable interest rates and internal models that incorporate credit spreads, yield curves, and structural factors (e.g., collateral types, prepayment rates, and weighted average coupons) for liabilities like securities sold under agreements to repurchase and embedded derivatives. Schwab relies on market-based inputs such as quoted prices, yield curves, and third-party pricing services for interest rate swaps, focusing on coupon rates of fixed and floating legs.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct and aligns well with the ground truth in terms of the core methodologies used by AIG and Schwab for estimating fair value of liabilities involving coupon rates. (1) Both companies are accurately identified, and the answer correctly states that AIG uses market-observable interest rates along with yield curves and structural factors (e.g., collateral types, prepayment rates, weighted average coupons), particularly for repurchase agreements. This matches the original answer's emphasis on market-observable rates and yield curves. Schwab’s use of spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve, with attention to fixed and floating coupon legs in interest rate swaps, is also correctly captured, though the LLM uses slightly broader phrasing (e.g., 'quoted prices, yield curves, third-party pricing services') rather than explicitly naming 'spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve'. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored 10 by default as no numbers are incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly differentiates the two companies’ approaches and synthesizes the role of coupon rates in each context. However, the LLM adds detail not present in the ground truth—such as 'credit spreads' and 'third-party pricing services'—which, while plausible, are not confirmed in the original knowledge base. It also emphasizes 'credit risk adjustments' for AIG and 'third-party validation' for Schwab, which are interpretive expansions. (4) Despite these additions, the semantic meaning remains consistent with the original answer: both firms use coupon rates, AIG focuses on broader market observables and structural factors, and Schwab centers on swap-specific dual-leg dynamics.

According to the ground truth, GILD's 2019 foreign income was $1,048 million, not a foreign loss of $309 million. This error fundamentally undermines the quantitative accuracy. The difference between AMGN and GILD's foreign income is stated as $3,719 million in the ground truth ($4,767M - $1,048M), but the LLM does not compute or mention this difference at all, failing a core part of the question. (2) The calculation for AMGN's proportion (52.2%) is correct and matches the ground truth.

      "question": "AIG's 2024 10-K highlights its need to maintain sufficient capital levels to support its insurance operations, including its major operating companies like National Union and Lexington. Schwab's 2024 10-K states that its capital management strategy includes a target common dividend payout of 20% to 30% of net income and reports a consolidated capital ratio of 6.8%. How does Schwab’s reported capital ratio influence its ability to maintain its dividend payout range, and what does this suggest about the relationship between capital ratios and financial flexibility for firms like AIG and Schwab operating under different regulatory capital requirements?",
      "original_answer": "Schwab’s 2024 consolidated capital ratio of 6.8% indicates a relatively strong capital position, which supports its ability to maintain a dividend payout targeting 20% to 30% of net income. This capital buffer allows Schwab to balance returns to shareholders with maintaining sufficient liquidity, especially in light of potential future needs such as migrating IDA balances onto its balance sheet. For AIG, maintaining sufficient capital is tied to its ability to underwrite insurance and manage risk through entities like National Union and Lexington, which are subject to insurance regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, capital ratios directly affect financial flexibility—Schwab uses its capital to support dividends and strategic balance sheet decisions, while AIG must ensure capital adequacy to sustain underwriting activities and meet regulatory thresholds.",
      "llm_answer": "Schwab’s reported capital ratio of 6.8% (adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio) provides the financial flexibility to sustain its target dividend payout range of 20%–30% of net income, as higher capital levels allow for excess capital distribution without compromising regulatory compliance. This highlights that firms like Schwab, operating under banking regulations, can leverage robust capital ratios to balance dividend commitments with capital preservation. In contrast, AIG’s insurance operations require maintaining sufficient capital to meet stringent regulatory requirements for solvency and operational stability, which may limit dividend flexibility compared to Schwab’s capital-optimized structure. The relationship underscores how regulatory frameworks shape capital management priorities: Schwab’s focus on liquidity and leverage ratios enables dividend consistency, while AIG’s emphasis on risk-based capital ensures operational resilience.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: Schwab’s 2024 capital ratio of 6.8% and dividend payout target of 20%–30% of net income are accurately reported. No calculations were required, and the figures match the original answer exactly. (2) The LLM correctly identifies both companies (Schwab and AIG), their respective capital metrics, and the relevant context—Schwab’s dividend policy and capital flexibility, AIG’s need for capital to support underwriting via National Union and Lexington. The mention of 'adjusted Tier 1 Leverage Ratio' adds specificity not in the original but is consistent with Schwab’s regulatory framework and does not contradict the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two different 10-Ks, compares capital usage under different regulatory regimes (banking vs. insurance), and draws a valid contrast in financial flexibility. It correctly infers that higher capital ratios enable dividend stability for Schwab, while AIG’s capital is more tightly constrained by solvency requirements. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention Schwab’s potential future liability from migrating IDA balances—a detail in the original that supports the need for capital flexibility. While this contextual nuance is omitted, the core reasoning about capital and dividends remains intact.

      "original_answer": "Netflix (NFLX) experienced a decrease in net cash provided by financing activities by $2,387 million in 2021 due to the absence of debt issuances compared to $1,002 million in proceeds from debt issuance in 2020. In contrast, AT&T (T) actively issued $19,032 million in debt during 2021, which significantly increased its cash inflows from financing activities. This divergence in debt strategy shows that while T leveraged debt to strengthen its liquidity or fund operations, NFLX relied on other financing mechanisms or existing cash reserves, which contributed to a more constrained cash flow position in the same year.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix (NFLX) had no debt issuances in 2021, leading to lower cash inflows from financing activities compared to 2020, as noted in its 10-K. This, combined with stock repurchases and debt repayments, resulted in a net cash outflow from financing activities. In contrast, AT&T (T) issued $19,032 million in debt, significantly increasing its cash inflows from financing activities. This debt issuance provided AT&T with liquidity to meet obligations, while NFLX relied more on operational cash flow and reduced debt repayment to manage its cash position.

According to the ground truth, HD reported an expense of $201 million (i.e., -$201 million) and SBUX reported income of $122.8 million, resulting in a combined total of $323.8 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states HD's figure as $2,120 million and calculates a combined total of $2,242.8 million, which is over 6x higher than the correct value. This indicates a severe quantitative inaccuracy. (2) The SBUX figure of $122.8 million is correct and matches the ground truth, but HD's figure is completely wrong. The LLM references 'page 34' and '$2.1 billion', suggesting it may have misread or misinterpreted a different financial metric (possibly total interest expense or a reconciliation of changes), but this does not align with the actual 'Interest Income and Other, Net' value. The calculation of the combined total is therefore incorrect. (3) The reasoning about how the line item contributes to earnings before taxes is partially sound—interest income increases earnings, expense decreases it—but it fails to correctly apply this logic due to the wrong numbers. The mention of 'interplay with operating income' adds unnecessary vagueness. (4) The entities (HD, SBUX, fiscal 2024, 'Interest Income and Other, Net') and the general structure of the response are accurate and relevant, so contextual relevance is moderate. However, the massive numerical error in HD's figure and the resulting incorrect sum severely undermine the answer’s correctness and reliability.

Instead, the LLM computes a net difference of $45M by subtracting the increase from the decrease ($90M - $45M), implying COST's reduction was $45M larger than PM's increase. This misinterprets the required comparison.

The LLM computes the difference as $5,803 million ($5.96B - $0.157B), while the correct difference per ground truth is $5.843 billion ($6.0B - $0.157B). (2) Number/calculation verification: Using LLM's inputs: $5,960M - $157M = $5,803M is mathematically correct, but based on slightly inaccurate input. Ground truth uses $6,000M - $157M = $5,843M. The $40M gap in Boeing's CFO suggests a possible rounding or data extraction error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The model correctly synthesized data across Boeing’s 2023 operating cash flow, FedEx’s loss carryovers, and Boeing’s 2022 tax refund — demonstrating sound multi-hop logic. All entities and years are correctly attributed. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness scored 8 due to the minor but material financial figure inaccuracy; otherwise, the answer is complete and well-reasoned. Quantitative accuracy is 8 due to the $40M discrepancy in Boeing’s CFO. Qualitative accuracy is 9 — reasoning and entity identification are perfect, only limited by input data precision. Contextual relevance is 10 — fully addresses all parts of the question with appropriate focus.",

The difference in foreign income ($4,851M - (-$309M) = $5,160M) is also correct. However, the interpretation of this difference is flawed. The LLM states that the $5,160M difference is 76.9% of AMGN's total income before taxes ($5,160 / $6,701 ≈ 76.9%) and 62.4% of GILD's ($5,160 / $8,278 ≈ 62.4%), but this comparison is not meaningful or requested in the question. The original answer correctly analyzes foreign income as a percentage of each company's total income before taxes: 72.4% for AMGN ($4,851M / $6,701M) and 3.7% offset for GILD ($309M / $8,278M). The LLM fails to provide this correct contextual analysis. (2) All provided numbers are quantitatively accurate, including the sum and difference. Calculations for the percentages the LLM does report are mathematically correct, but they answer a different (and incorrect) question. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is correctly pulled for both companies and years—but the synthesis is flawed. Instead of analyzing foreign income relative to each company’s own total income before taxes (as required), it compares the difference in foreign income to each company’s total income, which distorts the intended comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the same entities and time frame and attempts quantitative comparison, but the qualitative inaccuracy in reasoning and misinterpretation of the required comparison significantly reduces correctness. Hence, correctness score is 6: partially correct with significant errors in interpretation and reasoning.",

      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) reported a decrease in its net charge-off rate by 49 basis points to 0.00% in 2021, primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in its energy loan portfolio. This reflects an improvement in credit performance and economic conditions, especially in the energy sector, compared to 2020. In contrast, PayPal (PYPL) defines its net charge-off rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily balance of those receivables. While COF's metric reflects a specific improvement in a core loan segment (energy), PYPL's definition emphasizes a structural, formulaic approach focused on merchant credit risk without factoring in fraud, indicating differing risk management frameworks and portfolio compositions between the two financial institutions.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One's net charge-off rate decreased from 2.4% in 2020 to 0.37% in 2021, driven by improved performance in its energy loan portfolio, which contributed to lower credit losses. In contrast, PayPal's net charge-off rate for merchant loans fell from 18.9% in 2020 to 4.7% in 2021, reflecting pandemic-related charge-offs in 2020 and subsequent improvements in merchant performance, though it remained higher than Capital One's rate. Both companies define net charge-off rates as the ratio of net credit losses to average loan balances, but PayPal's metric is influenced by merchant-specific risks and macroeconomic volatility, while Capital One's is tied to portfolio diversification and sector-specific recovery.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Capital One's (COF) net charge-off rate decreased to 0.00% in 2021 from a prior year rate (implied to be higher in 2020), with a 49 basis point decrease. However, the LLM claims COF's rate dropped from 2.4% in 2020 to 0.37% in 2021, which contradicts the ground truth. There is no mention of a 2.4% or 0.37% rate in the original answer, nor is a 49 basis point drop consistent with a 2.03 percentage point decline (from 2.4% to 0.37%). Additionally, the LLM introduces PayPal's net charge-off rates (18.9% in 2020 to 4.7% in 2021), which are not present in the original answer and are therefore unsupported. The ground truth does not provide any specific numerical values for PayPal's net charge-off rate, only its definition and treatment. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM fabricates precise percentages for both companies and years that do not appear in the ground truth. The claimed 49 basis point decrease in COF's rate is inconsistent with the LLM's own numbers (a 203 basis point drop). PayPal's numbers are entirely invented. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing definitions and drivers of net charge-off rates—but fails on multi-hop synthesis. The original answer contrasts COF's sector-driven improvement with PYPL's structural definition, but the LLM incorrectly assumes comparable numerical trends and performance. It also misrepresents both companies' approaches by implying comparable metrics when the ground truth emphasizes definitional and structural differences. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the LLM addresses the right companies, time frame, and concept (net charge-off rate), and attempts a comparative analysis. However, the qualitative accuracy is low due to incorrect data and misrepresentation of PYPL's reporting practices. The correctness score is low (3) because the core factual claims—especially the numerical data—are incorrect, undermining the entire response despite some structural coherence.",

However, the LLM introduces a specific figure for PYPL's 'merchant loan charge-off rates (4.7%)' that is not present in the original answer or implied by the provided context. This number is unsupported by the ground truth and constitutes a factual overreach, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) While COF's 0.37% rate is accurately cited, the introduction of a precise 4.7% charge-off rate for PYPL without source confirmation violates quantitative integrity. The original answer only states that PYPL excludes fraud losses but does not provide an alternative charge-off percentage. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is largely sound: the LLM correctly infers that differing definitions reflect different risk management philosophies—COF emphasizing low realized losses and PYPL separating fraud from credit risk. It also appropriately links COF’s performance to its consumer banking segment and underwriting practices, which is consistent with the knowledge graph. The synthesis across entities (COF vs. PYPL) and risk frameworks is logical and adds depth. (4) Despite the unsupported statistic, the core qualitative insight about contrasting credit risk management approaches—COF focusing on credit quality and loss mitigation, PYPL isolating fraud as operational risk—is semantically equivalent to the ground truth. The answer remains contextually relevant and analytically rich, but the inclusion of an unverified numerical claim prevents a higher correctness score.",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—both values are correct, and while the LLM does not explicitly calculate the 255x ratio (231,733,000 / 907 ≈ 255.5), it correctly frames AIG's portfolio as 'significantly larger in magnitude,' which is factually sound. (3) The reasoning is mostly sound: the LLM correctly infers that AIG’s larger portfolio implies greater exposure to fair value fluctuations due to scale. It also notes COF’s smaller AOCI change may indicate lower volatility, though it appropriately qualifies that percentage volatility cannot be assessed without COF’s total portfolio size. However, it misses the explicit comparative insight from the ground truth that COF’s change, while smaller in absolute terms, reflects relative sensitivity—this nuance is downplayed. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: magnitude comparison and implications for exposure to fair value fluctuations.

      "original_answer": "DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased by $656 million from 2020 ($5,775 million) to 2021 ($5,909 million). NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets were impacted by reserve amortization adjustments related to accrued asset removal costs, which reflected changes in regulatory ROE targeting under the 2016 rate agreement. These adjustments were recorded as increases or decreases to noncurrent regulatory assets or liabilities. The combined impact of these changes indicates that both companies experienced regulatory-driven balance sheet adjustments, with DUK showing a direct increase in noncurrent regulatory assets while NEE's changes were more dynamic due to amortization reversals and accruals.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors. According to the ground truth, DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased by $134 million in the LLM answer, but the correct increase is $134 million — wait, no: the ground truth states an increase from $5,775 million in 2020 to $5,909 million in 2021, which is a $134 million increase. However, the original ground truth in the prompt says the increase was $656 million, which is incorrect based on the math: $5,909M - $5,775M = $134M. This suggests the ground truth may have a typo. Despite this, the LLM claims NEE had a $430 million decrease due to reserve amortization, but the ground truth does not provide a specific dollar amount for NEE’s change — only a qualitative description of amortization adjustments tied to regulatory ROE targeting and accrued asset removal costs. The LLM invents a precise $430M decrease not present in the original answer. The combined net decrease of $296M is therefore also fabricated. (2) Quantitative accuracy fails because while DUK’s $134M increase aligns with correct calculation from the provided numbers (even if the ground truth claims $656M), the $656M figure contradicts the arithmetic of the stated values. This creates ambiguity. However, the LLM incorrectly asserts a $430M decrease at NEE with no support in the original data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM attempts to compare DUK and NEE and compute a net impact, but the original answer emphasizes that NEE’s changes were dynamic (both increases and decreases due to amortization reversals and accruals), not a single directional $430M decrease. Thus, the LLM oversimplifies and misrepresents NEE’s regulatory asset changes. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate — the answer addresses the right companies, time frame, and concept (noncurrent regulatory assets and reserve amortization), and attempts a comparison and combined impact. However, due to invented figures and incorrect synthesis, the qualitative and correctness scores are low. The core issue is that the LLM fabricates a specific numerical impact for NEE not present in the ground truth and miscalculates the combined effect as a net decrease, while the original emphasizes different types of regulatory adjustments without quantifying NEE’s net change.",

The UPS portion correctly identifies the $3.3 billion pre-tax ($2.5 billion after-tax) gain in 2021 due to the American Rescue Plan Act, but adds a $2.1 billion actuarial gain from a divestiture not mentioned in the ground truth, introducing an unsupported detail. (2) Quantitative accuracy is mostly correct: $56 million (Emerson) and $3.3 billion pre-tax (UPS) are accurate, with correct years (2023 and 2021). However, the additional $2.1 billion gain for UPS lacks corroboration in the ground truth and appears to be an overstatement or hallucination. The after-tax figure of $2.5 billion for UPS is omitted in the LLM answer, reducing quantitative precision.

The percentage growth for Meta is calculated as (69,380 - 46,751) / 46,751 ≈ 48.4%, which rounds to 48% in the ground truth. The minor discrepancy (48.4% vs 48%) is due to rounding and is acceptable under semantic equivalence.

It accurately states SBUX's North America operating margin contracted by 90 basis points to 19.8%. These numbers match the ground truth exactly. However, the LLM introduces additional granular detail not present in the original answer—specifically, attributing margin pressure to wage investments (150 bps), deleverage (150 bps), promotions (100 bps), and offsets from pricing (220 bps) and efficiencies (150 bps). While this level of breakdown may be factually plausible, it goes beyond the original answer, which summarized these factors without specific bps attribution. This introduces potential overprecision not supported by the ground truth. (2) All numeric values related to sales performance and margin changes are correct. The calculation implied by SBUX’s sales change (4% ticket increase partially offsetting 5% transaction decline leading to 2% sales drop) is logically sound.

In contrast, the LLM incorrectly frames these contracts as risk-mitigating and stabilizing, when in fact they represent material market risk due to their size and potential volatility. This is a critical qualitative error in reasoning. (2) Quantitatively, the $486 gain and the context of 2022 for Emerson are accurate (allowing for the fact that the gain may have been reported in 2022 from a transaction in late 2021). The LLM omits the specific $6.8 billion figure for GD’s notional amount, which reduces completeness, but does not fabricate numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM incorrectly synthesizes the risk implications: while Emerson’s gain improved its financial position (correctly noted), GD’s contracts increased, not decreased, financial volatility. The conclusion that both actions 'collectively reduced financial volatility' is factually wrong. (4) Correctness is scored at 4 due to major errors in interpretation despite correct entity and number identification. Quantitative accuracy is high (9) because numbers are not misstated. Qualitative accuracy is low (4) due to flawed logic and risk characterization. Contextual relevance is moderate (7) as the answer addresses the right companies and general topic but misrepresents a key financial dynamic.",

      "original_answer": "Altria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The benefit is measured as the largest amount greater than 50% likely of being realized. PepsiCo, on the other hand, focuses on internal controls and procedures to identify uncertain tax positions, involving tax professionals to evaluate the company's tax structure, transactions, and interpretations of tax law, particularly transfer pricing arrangements. PepsiCo also monitors for new information such as tax examination progress or new tax laws that could affect unrecognized tax benefits. This indicates that while Altria emphasizes a quantitative threshold (more than 50% likelihood of realization), PepsiCo emphasizes procedural rigor and continuous reassessment based on evolving legal and regulatory inputs.",
      "llm_answer": "Altria and PepsiCo differ in their treatment of uncertain income tax positions, reflecting contrasting approaches to recognizing financial benefits and managing liabilities. Altria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain tax positions only when it is **more likely than not** (greater than 50% probability) that the position will be sustained, using a threshold-based approach. This emphasizes upfront recognition based on technical merits and probabilistic assessments. In contrast, PepsiCo’s approach involves **subjective judgments** and **ongoing reassessment** of unrecognized tax benefits, incorporating new information such as tax examinations, legal changes, or settlements. This highlights PepsiCo’s focus on dynamic adjustments to liabilities, whereas Altria’s method prioritizes initial recognition with a conservative threshold, potentially leading to more stable but less responsive liability management.",

(1) It correctly states that Altria uses a 'more likely than not' threshold (greater than 50% probability), which aligns with the ground truth's 'more likely than not' and 'largest amount greater than 50% likely of being realized' criteria. This reflects precise quantitative and qualitative understanding. (2) The LLM accurately represents PepsiCo’s approach as involving ongoing reassessment based on new information such as tax examinations, legal changes, and settlements—consistent with the original answer’s emphasis on monitoring for new tax laws and examination progress. (3) While the original answer highlights PepsiCo’s procedural rigor and involvement of tax professionals in evaluating tax structure and transfer pricing, the LLM summarizes this as 'subjective judgments' and 'ongoing reassessment,' which is semantically valid but slightly less specific. However, this does not detract from the overall correctness. (4) The synthesis across both companies is logical and directly addresses the question about differing approaches to recognizing benefits and managing liabilities. The comparison between Altria’s threshold-based, conservative recognition and PepsiCo’s dynamic, continuously updated approach is well-reasoned and contextually appropriate. Minor point: the term 'subjective judgments' is not explicitly in the original and slightly reframes PepsiCo’s method, but it is a reasonable interpretation. No numeric errors; all factual elements are correct. Thus, the answer earns a 9 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, with full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

      "original_answer": "ACN reclassified prior period amounts due to the movement of Middle East and Africa market units into the EMEA geographic market, which affected the presentation of operating income by region, such as a 9% increase in overall operating income and specific changes in EMEA driven by foreign exchange rates and cost reductions. Meanwhile, INTC adjusted all prior-period amounts in its goodwill footnote to reflect changes in operating segments, reallocating goodwill among reporting units based on relative fair value. Both companies modified historical financial reporting to align with current segment structures, enhancing comparability and performance evaluation across periods, though through different financial mechanisms—ACN through geographic market realignment and INTC through goodwill reallocation.",

ACN reclassified Middle East and Africa to EMEA, reclassifying prior-period amounts to conform to the new geographic market reporting, ensuring consistency in segment performance analysis.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: while no specific percentages or dollar amounts are repeated in the LLM answer (e.g., the 9% increase in operating income mentioned in the original), the absence of numerical errors and the correct use of financial terms (e.g., 'reclassifying prior-period amounts', 'relative fair value') maintain factual integrity. The omission of the 9% figure and foreign exchange/cost reduction details is a minor completeness gap but does not undermine the correctness.

(4) Semantic equivalence is strong: the LLM captures the intent and factual basis of the original answer, using slightly different phrasing (e.g., 'enhance transparency and comparability' vs. 'enhancing comparability and performance evaluation').

The combined total should be $1,278 million; the LLM calculates $909 million based on incorrect and outdated data. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on wrong inputs: $276M + $441M = $717M, not $909M—so even the arithmetic is flawed. The claimed difference of $633 million is therefore also incorrect.

It states the combined total is $56, which is incorrect—the correct total is $3.36 billion ($56 million from Emerson + $3.3 billion from UPS). The LLM incorrectly claims UPS did not recognize any mark-to-market gain in 2023 and instead attributes the $3.3 billion gain to 2021, which contradicts the ground truth stating it was recognized in UPS's 2023 fiscal year. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the sum is wrong, the timing of UPS's gain is incorrect, and the magnitude of Emerson's gain is understated (though $56 million is mentioned, it lacks proper units and context). The $3.3 billion figure is acknowledged but misdated. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails—while the model identifies both companies and some context around equity investment and pension adjustments, it fails to correctly synthesize the information across the two entities in the correct fiscal year. The claim that UPS’s gain occurred in 2021 breaks the multi-hop logic required for the 2023 fiscal year comparison.

Therefore, the combined impact of the FDII deduction on the effective tax rates of AVGO and CSCO in 2022 was -3.9%. In 2021, AVGO reported an FDII deduction impact of -3.1%, and CSCO reported an impact of -4.2%. Thus, the combined impact in 2021 was -7.3%.

It states that the combined FDII impact on AVGO and CSCO in fiscal 2022 was -3.9%, which incorrectly attributes CSCO's entire impact to the combined total while ignoring AVGO's 0.0% impact. While the -3.9% figure for CSCO alone is correct, the combined impact should be -3.9% (0.0% + (-3.9%)), which the model gets right numerically but for the wrong reason—failing to acknowledge AVGO's lack of FDII deduction. More critically, the LLM claims the combined impact in 2021 was -4.2%, but the ground truth states it was -7.3% (-3.1% from AVGO and -4.2% from CSCO). The model incorrectly uses only CSCO’s 2021 impact instead of summing both companies. (2) Calculation verification: 2022 combined impact = 0.0% (AVGO) + (-3.9%) (CSCO) = -3.9% — correct value but incorrect reasoning. 2021 combined impact = (-3.1%) + (-4.2%) = -7.3% — LLM incorrectly reports -4.2%, a major error. The year-over-year comparison should show a decrease in tax benefit from -7.3% to -3.9%, a reduction of 3.4 percentage points, not 0.3 as implied. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The model fails to properly synthesize data across both companies and both years. It appears to conflate CSCO’s individual impact with the combined impact for both years, missing AVGO’s contribution in 2021 and its absence in 2022. This indicates a failure in entity-specific tracking and cross-year, cross-company aggregation. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major quantitative and reasoning errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (3/10) because one of two key totals is wrong and the comparison is flawed. Qualitative accuracy is low (3/10) due to incorrect synthesis and logic.

This difference reflects their capital structures: AbbVie’s higher diluted share count likely stems from more dilutive securities (e.g., stock options, convertible bonds) or equity financing, whereas CVS Health’s lower count suggests a more conservative capital structure with fewer dilutive instruments, potentially relying more on debt or stable equity issuance.",

Similarly, CVS Health is reported as 1,329 million by the LLM versus the correct value of 1,314 million. The calculated difference is therefore 448 million shares in the LLM answer, whereas the correct difference is 359 million, resulting in an error of 89 million shares. These discrepancies are substantial and materially affect the quantitative conclusion. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM's incorrect numbers (1,777 - 1,329 = 448), but since the input figures are wrong, the result is invalid.

COP, in contrast, discloses its global average production cost per BOE as part of its supplementary data but does not break it down regionally.

This contrasts with COP's global production cost disclosures, where Europe's higher costs ($36.37) are offset by lower-cost regions like the U.S. and Canada/Other Americas ($19.94), resulting in a weighted global average of $10.63.

While it correctly states XOM's production costs in Canada/Other Americas ($22.47) and Europe ($31.79), it incorrectly claims XOM's global average cost is $12.15, which contradicts the ground truth (no such number provided) and is implausible given the regional averages. More critically, the LLM fabricates COP's regional cost data: it states COP has European costs of $36.37 and Canada/Other Americas at $19.94, and a global average of $10.63 — none of which appear in the ground truth. The original answer explicitly states that COP does not disclose regional cost breakdowns, only a global average, making these specific regional figures entirely invented. (2) Calculations are also flawed: the claimed global average of $10.63 for COP cannot be verified and is likely incorrect given that even its lowest regional cost ($19.94) is higher than this supposed global average, which is mathematically impossible unless weighted by production volumes — but no such data is provided or cited. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly assumes COP provides regional cost disclosures, when the ground truth emphasizes the lack of such granularity. It thus draws a false comparison between XOM's regional cost differences and COP's non-existent regional data. The correct reasoning should have highlighted that while XOM allows regional profitability analysis due to granular disclosures, COP does not permit such analysis.

      "question": "How did the change in the Net Charge-Off Rate for Capital One's Credit Card business in 2021 impact its financial performance, and how does PayPal's definition of Net Charge-Off Rate suggest this metric might influence its own credit risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) experienced a 198 basis point decrease in its Net Charge-Off Rate to 1.90% in 2021, which contributed to a $8.2 billion decrease in the Provision for Credit Losses, resulting in a benefit of $902 million due to strong credit performance. This improvement indicates better loan recovery or fewer defaults, which enhances profitability and reduces risk. PayPal (PYPL), on the other hand, defines its Net Charge-Off Rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily loan balance. This definition implies that PYPL’s credit risk exposure is directly tied to the performance of its merchant loan portfolio, and a higher Net Charge-Off Rate would signal increased credit deterioration and potential financial loss.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One's Net Charge-Off Rate for its Credit Card business decreased from 3.93% in 2020 to 1.90% in 2021, reflecting improved credit performance and reduced provisions for credit losses. This reduction significantly boosted its net income, as the provision for credit losses shifted from a $6.979 billion expense in 2020 to a $902 million benefit in 2021. \n\nPayPal's definition of the Net Charge-Off Rate (excluding fraud losses) aligns with Capital One's approach, but its 2021 rate of 4.3% (vs. 2.4% in 2020) suggests higher credit risk exposure, as elevated charge-offs indicate greater delinquency and loss potential. This metric directly influences PayPal's risk management by highlighting vulnerabilities in its consumer and merchant loan portfolios, particularly amid macroeconomic uncertainties.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several inaccuracies in numbers and misattributes data not present in the ground truth. While it correctly states Capital One's 2021 Net Charge-Off Rate as 1.90%, it introduces a 2020 rate of 3.93% which is not in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. The ground truth mentions a 198 basis point decrease but does not specify the prior year's exact rate. The LLM also claims the 2020 provision was $6.979 billion, which is not supported by the ground truth—it only states that the 2021 benefit was $902 million and that there was an $8.2 billion decrease in the Provision for Credit Losses. The LLM incorrectly frames this as a shift from a $6.979B expense to a $902M benefit, implying a total change of ~$7.88B, which does not match the $8.2B figure. Additionally, the LLM introduces PayPal's 2021 Net Charge-Off Rate as 4.3% (vs. 2.4% in 2020), which is entirely absent from the ground truth—no such numbers were provided for PayPal. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are significant: unsupported percentages, fabricated year-over-year comparisons, and incorrect dollar figures undermine factual reliability. The only correct numbers are Capital One’s 1.90% rate and the $902 million benefit, both of which align with the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly infers that a declining charge-off rate improves financial performance via lower provisions, and it appropriately connects PayPal’s definition to credit risk exposure. However, it fails the multi-hop requirement by inventing PayPal’s charge-off rates instead of acknowledging they were not provided, thus synthesizing non-existent data. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant and captures the conceptual link between charge-off rates and financial performance/credit risk. The qualitative reasoning about risk management and macroeconomic sensitivity is reasonable, even if unsupported by specific data. Hence, correctness is penalized heavily for factual overreach, but qualitative and contextual scores remain moderate due to logical structure and relevance.",

      "original_answer": "AIG reported $1,200 million in securities collateral pledged to them as of December 31, 2023, while COF reported $13 million in securities collateral pledged under master netting agreements as part of their derivative liabilities. The difference between these amounts is $1,187 million. In terms of net exposure, COF reported a net exposure of $2,322 million after accounting for all collateral, while AIG’s disclosure does not include a net exposure figure but highlights a significant amount of collateral held. This contrast suggests different collateral management strategies or risk exposures in their derivative and repurchase agreements.",
      "llm_answer": "The reported value of securities collateral pledged by AIG as of December 31, 2023, is **$13 million** (from derivative liabilities under master netting agreements), while COF pledged **$549 million** in securities under repurchase agreements. This reflects a **$536 million difference**. AIG’s net exposure to collateralized arrangements is **$2,322 million**, whereas COF’s net exposure is **$1,648 million**, indicating COF’s higher collateralization reduces its net exposure more significantly.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in both quantitative values and entity assignments. It incorrectly states that AIG reported $13 million in securities collateral pledged, when in fact AIG reported $1,200 million pledged *to them* (not by them), and attributes $549 million to COF under repurchase agreements, while the ground truth states COF reported only $13 million in securities collateral pledged under master netting agreements. The calculated difference of $536 million is therefore incorrect; the correct difference is $1,187 million. Additionally, the LLM reverses the net exposure figures: it assigns $2,322 million to AIG and $1,648 million to COF, but the original answer states COF’s net exposure is $2,322 million and AIG does not report a net exposure figure. (2) Number verification: AIG collateral held: $1,200M (correct in truth, wrong in LLM); COF pledged: $13M (correct in truth, LLM says $549M); difference: $1,187M (LLM says $536M — incorrect); net exposure: only COF reports it as $2,322M (LLM flips this and invents a number for AIG). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to correctly identify which company reported which value, misattributes collateral types (repurchase vs. derivative liabilities), and draws incorrect conclusions about collateral management strategies based on false data. It also misunderstands directionality — AIG holds collateral, whereas COF pledges it. (4) Scores justified: correctness is low (2/10) due to pervasive factual and directional errors; quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) with most numbers wrong; qualitative accuracy is slightly better (3/10) because the structure of comparison is present, though logic is based on false premises; contextual relevance is moderate (6/10) as the answer attempts the right type of analysis but with incorrect data.",

      "original_answer": "CMCSA reported a decrease in the amortization of software in 2024, which partially offset the overall increase in consolidated depreciation and amortization expense driven by higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets (e.g., $2.7 billion in 2024 from such assets). In contrast, T disclosed a consistent increase in amortization of network software, reaching $3,076 million in 2024, indicating sustained investment in software supporting its network infrastructure.

Additionally, the LLM falsely claims that T (AT&T) reported the same amortization figures as CMCSA ($3,076M vs $3,023M), which is unsupported by the original answer and factually wrong—T’s $3,076 million is accurate, but CMCSA’s software amortization trend was downward, not upward. (2) The numbers are grossly inaccurate: the LLM fabricates a $53M increase for CMCSA and falsely aligns CMCSA’s figures with T’s, when the original answer emphasizes a *decrease* for CMCSA and an *increase* for T. The $3,076M figure for T is correct, but attributing the same trajectory to CMCSA is false. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails completely: instead of contrasting CMCSA’s cautious software investment with T’s sustained network software investment, the LLM incorrectly concludes both companies have identical patterns. This misrepresents the core comparison and leads to an invalid conclusion about capital investment.

This misrepresents both the amount and the fiscal year. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states that INTC's reduction was from $3.9 billion in 2022 to $0 in 2023, while the ground truth confirms the $3.9 billion balance was from the prior year to 2023 (i.e., 2022), but the key point is INTC had $0 in 2023, which is correct.

It accurately reports the 89% franchised ratio for International Operated Markets and 98% for International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate. All percentages are factually correct and properly attributed. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no calculation errors, and all figures match the original answer exactly. Format (percentage with bold emphasis) does not affect correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes franchising percentages across three segments (U.S., International Operated, and International Developmental Licensed), correctly compares them, and draws a logical conclusion about McDonald's global franchising strategy. The observation that the U.S. rate is 'slightly lower than the highly franchised Developmental Licensed Markets but higher than the International Operated Markets' reflects accurate comparative analysis. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with added contextual insight (strategic balance between mature and growth markets) that enhances, without distorting, the factual content.

      "original_answer": "For KO, volume-based incentive programs are a component of variable consideration, which is estimated and included in net operating revenues upon completion of performance obligations. KO considers factors like customer sales volumes and discount rates in estimating this variable consideration. For PM, volume-based incentives are treated as reductions of revenue and are recorded as sales occur, based on estimates of customer target achievement. These estimates directly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized for both companies, though each uses a different method for incorporating these incentives into financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "KO recognizes variable consideration from volume-based incentive programs as part of net operating revenues by estimating the probable outcomes of these programs, incorporating factors like customer sales volumes, pricing, and discount rates. This estimation impacts revenue recognition timing and amount. For PM, trade promotion costs related to volume-based incentives are estimated using historical utilization rates and customer performance likelihood, affecting the recognition of these costs as expenses. Both companies rely on assumptions and judgments to account for these programs, with KO adjusting revenue and PM adjusting expenses based on their respective estimation methodologies.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is mostly correct in terms of factual content and context, with accurate qualitative descriptions of how KO and PM handle volume-based incentive programs. For KO, it correctly identifies that variable consideration is estimated and included in net operating revenues, based on factors like sales volumes and discount rates, which aligns with the ground truth. The statement that this affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition is also accurate. For PM, the LLM correctly notes that estimates are used and that these relate to customer performance, but introduces a material inaccuracy: it describes PM's treatment as affecting 'trade promotion costs' recorded as expenses, whereas the ground truth states that PM treats volume-based incentives as reductions of revenue (not as expenses), which directly impacts revenue recognition. This is a significant conceptual difference in accounting treatment—revenue reduction vs. expense recognition—that changes the financial statement impact. While the LLM mentions PM's use of estimates, it mischaracterizes the accounting classification. There are no numerical values in the question or answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense, but all non-numerical facts (e.g., methods, factors) are otherwise accurately represented. The reasoning is sound for KO and partially correct for PM, but the failure to correctly identify PM’s revenue reduction approach (instead of expense accrual) undermines the qualitative accuracy. The answer remains contextually relevant and addresses both companies and the core issue of recognition, hence a score of 7/10 for correctness.",

However, it incorrectly formats the dollar amounts as 'million' when the original values are already in dollars (e.g., '$1,659,140 million' is wrong — should be just '$1,659,140'). This introduces a massive scale error (off by a factor of 1 million), severely impacting quantitative accuracy. The combined total is not explicitly stated in the LLM answer, though it can be inferred; the ground truth specifies $6,827,140, which is correct. (2) The percentage for ACN is reported as 59.9% versus the ground truth 60.0% — a minor rounding difference likely due to intermediate calculation precision, which is acceptable. QCOM's 56.1% matches exactly. However, the presentation of financial figures with 'million' appended to already-reported-in-dollars amounts is a critical error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, retrieves net PPE, gross PPE, and accumulated depreciation, and computes the ratios appropriately. It compares the two companies as required. (4) Despite strong qualitative reasoning and contextual relevance, the quantitative inaccuracies — especially the erroneous 'million' unit — reduce the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores.

This increase put upward pressure on total costs, likely compressing operating margins unless offset by revenue growth. In contrast, T saw a $395 million decrease in Other Cost of Revenues due to a change in accounting estimate that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs, which improved their operating margin by reducing current-period expenses. These contrasting trends reflect GOOGL’s strategic investments and restructuring while T optimized accounting policies to enhance margin performance.",

For GOOGL, while the $5.2B increase and $479M severance charge are correct, the LLM introduces unsupported details like 'reduced depreciation' and specific cost breakdowns not in the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the T cost change is wrong in sign and amount ($553M increase vs. $395M decrease), and the implication that T’s costs increased due to amortization misrepresents the accounting change that *reduced* expenses. The claim of a $13.2B increase in GOOGL operating income is not in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided data.

In contrast, McDonald's opts to use the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) companies as its peer group for comparison, citing its global operations and market significance, which align with other large multinational DJIA constituents. As a result, McDonald's shareholder return performance is evaluated against a group of large, globally relevant companies rather than just restaurant peers, which could make its relative performance appear different than if it had used a narrower industry index.

McDonald's, however, compares its returns to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) companies (page 26), which includes large-cap, diversified firms, reflecting its global operations and size. This divergence in peer groups means their performance metrics are evaluated against different benchmarks, limiting direct comparison.

The sum 335 + 732 = 1,067 MMBOE is correct in the ground truth; the LLM's sum of 335 + 1,100 = 1,435 is incorrect due to the wrong input. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly identifies both companies (COP and XOM), the relevant metric (proved undeveloped reserves from extensions and discoveries), and the year (2023). It also attempts to explain the contribution to reserve growth and provides context (e.g., Willow and Nuna projects for COP, Guyana for XOM), which adds qualitative value. However, the incorrect data for XOM undermines the synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right concepts and provides useful background. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct structure and reasoning but flawed data. Quantitative accuracy is low due to major errors in XOM's reserves and the total. Correctness score is 4 because while some facts are right, the central numerical claim is wrong, and the multi-hop synthesis fails on a key component.",

      "original_answer": "ACN adjusts its tax liabilities or assets quarterly based on changing facts and circumstances, such as audit progress or statute expirations, and acknowledges that final determinations could materially differ from estimates, impacting income tax provision, net income, or cash flows. QCOM, on the other hand, participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process for tax years prior to fiscal 2021, aiming to resolve all issues with the IRS before filing its federal return, which may reduce the likelihood of unexpected tax liabilities. If both companies were to face unexpected tax liabilities not accounted for in their estimates, ACN would likely record adjustments to its tax liabilities in the period the new information arises, while QCOM may experience a larger-than-anticipated reversal of previously recorded tax liabilities, both affecting their financial statements significantly but through different mechanisms.",
      "llm_answer": "ACN's quarterly adjustment of tax liabilities allows for more frequent updates to reflect new information, potentially smoothing the impact of unexpected tax liabilities across periods. In contrast, QCOM's IRS Compliance Assurance Process emphasizes pre-filing resolution of tax issues, which may lead to more accurate initial estimates but could result in larger adjustments if unresolved issues arise post-filing.

(1) It correctly identifies ACN's quarterly adjustment policy and QCOM's use of the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP), noting that CAP aims for pre-filing resolution, which aligns with the ground truth. The impact on financial statements—ACN smoothing adjustments versus QCOM potentially facing larger, concentrated adjustments—is semantically equivalent to the original answer's point about ACN recording adjustments when new information arises and QCOM possibly reversing previously recorded liabilities. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; however, the absence of any incorrect numbers supports a score of 10. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes multi-hop information—ACN’s accounting policy from its 10-K and QCOM’s participation in CAP—and draws a logical comparison on how each company would respond to unexpected liabilities. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that QCOM’s participation was for tax years prior to fiscal 2021, nor does it specify that ACN acknowledges material differences could affect income tax provision, net income, or cash flows—details present in the ground truth. While the essence is conveyed, these omissions prevent a perfect qualitative score.

      "original_answer": "AIG recognizes the portion of fair value changes attributable to its own credit risk in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income), while Morgan Stanley incorporates credit risk metrics assigned during borrower evaluation into its allowance for credit losses. Additionally, Morgan Stanley actively mitigates credit risk through collateral provisions, guarantees, and hedging activities, whereas AIG’s disclosure focuses on the accounting treatment of credit risk impacts.",

It uses internal models, collateral, and a Credit Risk Management Department to monitor exposures, with a focus on provisioning for commercial real estate and corporate loans. Morgan Stanley incorporates credit risk metrics such as credit spread sensitivity, interest rate risk sensitivity, and loss scenarios for investments, managing credit risk via credit limits, collateral, and stress testing. While AIG emphasizes loan-specific provisioning and credit loss allowances, Morgan Stanley integrates credit risk into broader market risk frameworks, including derivative exposures and investment portfolio stress testing.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect on the core accounting treatment of credit risk changes in financial statements. The ground truth states that AIG recognizes changes in fair value due to its own credit risk in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income), which is a specific accounting policy under US GAAP (e.g., ASC 820 or ASC 815). This key point is entirely missing from the LLM response. Instead, the LLM incorrectly frames AIG’s approach around loan loss provisioning and net charge-off ratios, which relate to counterparty credit risk, not the company’s own credit risk impact on liabilities. Similarly, for Morgan Stanley, the ground truth specifies that it incorporates credit risk metrics from borrower evaluation into its allowance for credit losses — a specific allowance methodology — but the LLM response discusses credit spread sensitivity and stress testing in trading portfolios, which is broader and misses the precise link to allowance calculation. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; no errors in numbers or calculations are present, hence a score of 10. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks for a comparison of how each firm accounts for changes in credit risk (specifically, the accounting impact of their own credit risk on fair value), but the LLM conflates this with general credit risk management practices. It fails to distinguish between accounting for one’s own credit risk (a fair value accounting issue) versus managing counterparty credit risk (a risk management issue). This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the question’s intent. (4) While the LLM provides relevant context about risk management strategies (e.g., collateral, stress testing), it misses the key accounting distinction that defines the original answer. The contextual relevance is moderate because the content is related but does not address the specific accounting treatments asked.

      "original_answer": "Google's 'Other Cost of Revenues' increased by $11.9 billion from 2021 to 2022, driven by device costs, compensation expenses, and depreciation, and continued to rise in 2023 due to content acquisition costs for YouTube and compensation expenses, including $479 million in employee severance charges. This indicates a growing pressure on Google's cost structure from content and labor-related expenses. AT&T's disclosure reveals that amortization costs related to customer contract acquisition and fulfillment—primarily included in 'Selling, general and administrative' and 'Other cost of revenues'—suggest a different composition of operational expenses focused on customer acquisition rather than content and labor. This comparison highlights distinct cost drivers within the communication services sector: Google faces rising content and compensation costs, while AT&T's operational expenses are significantly shaped by customer acquisition amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, Google's **\"Other Cost of Revenues\"** increased by $11.9 billion year-over-year, driven by higher content acquisition costs (e.g., YouTube) and compensation expenses, including $479 million in severance charges.

While Google’s costs reflect content and labor, AT&T’s amortization reflects recurring expenses from long-term contracts and asset depreciation.

However, the original answer specifies that the $11.9 billion increase occurred from 2021 to 2022, not year-over-year in 2023 as the LLM incorrectly states. This is a significant factual error in timing. Additionally, the LLM mentions that 'depreciation expenses decreased due to extended asset lifetimes,' a detail not present in the ground truth and potentially misleading, as the original answer does not mention a decrease in depreciation. 2) Quantitatively, the $11.9B and $479M figures are accurate in value but misattributed in time frame—the $11.9B increase is from 2021–2022, not 2022–2023. No calculation errors, but the temporal misalignment affects factual correctness. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly contrasts Google’s cost drivers (content, labor) with AT&T’s amortization of customer acquisition costs, highlighting sector-specific operational expense structures. The synthesis between the two companies and the interpretation of differing cost compositions is logically sound and adds contextual insight. 4) Despite the timing error, the answer remains contextually relevant and provides a meaningful comparative analysis of operational expenses in the communication services sector. The core insight about differing cost drivers (content/labor vs. customer acquisition amortization) is preserved, warranting high marks for qualitative and contextual accuracy.

However, it incorrectly calculated PM's change in 'Earnings Reinvested in the Business' as $1,444 million, when the correct increase is $2,068 million (from $31,638 million to $33,082 million). This is a significant numerical error. (2) The calculation for PM is wrong: $33,082M - $31,638M = $1,444M is incorrect; the correct difference is $1,444M only if the numbers were different, but in fact $33,082 - $31,638 = 1,444 is mathematically false — the correct difference is $1,444M? Wait: 33,082 - 31,638 = 1,444? Let's compute: 33,082 - 31,638 = (33,082 - 31,600) = 1,482; 1,482 - 38 = 1,444 — actually, 31,638 + 1,444 = 33,082 — so the arithmetic is correct. But wait: the ground truth says PM increased by $2,068 million? That contradicts the provided numbers. There is a conflict in the ORIGINAL ANSWER: from $31,638M to $33,082M is an increase of $1,444M, not $2,068M. Therefore, the ORIGINAL ANSWER contains a calculation error. The LLM's calculation of $1,444M is actually correct based on the stated values. However, the ground truth claims a $2,068M increase, which is inconsistent with the provided starting and ending values. This suggests an error in the ground truth. Given that, the LLM's quantitative answer is correct. Then the total change across both companies in the original answer is $2,539M + $2,068M = $4,607M, but if PM only increased by $1,444M, the true total should be $3,983M. The LLM does not compute the total change, but instead compares KO's change to PM's, stating KO's was $1,095M higher — $2,539M - $1,444M = $1,095M — which is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly extracted and compared data for two companies across two years, computed differences, and made a valid comparison. (4) Despite the discrepancy in the ground truth's calculation for PM, the LLM's numbers and logic are internally consistent and mathematically accurate based on the values it used. Therefore, the LLM answer should be considered correct. However, since the evaluation must follow the ground truth as authoritative — even if it contains an error — and the ground truth states PM's change is $2,068M, the LLM is marked as incorrect on that point. This leads to a reduced correctness score. Given this conflict, the fairest assessment is that the LLM performed accurate calculations, but deviates from the provided (erroneous) ground truth. Still, per instructions, we must score against the ground truth. Thus: quantitative accuracy is penalized because it does not match the stated $2,068M in the original answer, even though that number is likely wrong. Final scores reflect this tension: high contextual relevance and qualitative reasoning, but lower quantitative accuracy due to mismatch with ground truth, despite likely being actually correct.",

(2) Number verification: COF's allowance: correct ($11,430M). PYPL's end-of-year allowance: incorrect (LLM says $487M, should be $201M). PYPL's beginning allowance: not mentioned in LLM answer, but implied to be $431M if decrease is $56M, which contradicts the ground truth of $483M. Calculations: both the difference and the change are wrong due to incorrect inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: the model attempts to synthesize across entities (COF and PYPL) and time points (beginning and end of 2021), but fails due to incorrect data aggregation for PYPL. It incorrectly adds consumer and merchant loans as if both were allowances, when only $201M is reported as the total allowance. (4) Correctness score is low (3) due to major quantitative errors in both parts of the answer. Quantitative accuracy is 3 because most numbers and calculations are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 4 because the model understands the structure of the question and the need to compare and calculate changes, but applies incorrect data. Contextual relevance is 8 because the answer addresses the right companies, time frame, and metric type, even if the values are wrong.",

      "original_answer": "Accenture's total cash outlay for dividends in 2022 was $2,457,306, while Qualcomm paid $3,212 in dividends during the same period. This indicates that Accenture allocated significantly more capital to dividend payments compared to Qualcomm, which focused more heavily on stock repurchases ($3,129) as part of its capital return strategy. The data suggests that Accenture prioritized consistent cash returns to shareholders through dividends, whereas Qualcomm balanced its shareholder returns more evenly between dividends and share buybacks.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, Accenture's total cash outlay for dividends was approximately **$2.46 billion**, while Qualcomm's dividend payments were **$3.21 billion**. This suggests Qualcomm prioritized higher dividend payouts compared to Accenture, which balanced dividends with significant share repurchases ($3.13 billion). Accenture's strategy emphasized a mix of dividends and buybacks to return capital, whereas Qualcomm focused more on direct shareholder distributions through dividends.",

The original answer states that Accenture paid $2,457,306 (approximately $2.46 million, not billion) in dividends, while Qualcomm paid $3,212 (approximately $3.21 thousand). The LLM incorrectly reports these as $2.46 billion and $3.21 billion—off by a factor of nearly 1,000. This is a critical quantitative error. (2) The numbers are not only wrong but reversed in magnitude: the LLM claims Qualcomm paid more in dividends than Accenture, which contradicts the ground truth where Accenture’s dividend payout was over 750 times larger. Additionally, the LLM misattributes Accenture’s share repurchases as $3.13 billion, but the original answer states Qualcomm did $3,129 in repurchases (likely $3.129 billion), further swapping the companies’ buyback figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM concludes Qualcomm prioritized dividends and Accenture used more buybacks, which is the opposite of the truth. The original answer clearly states Accenture focused on dividends while Qualcomm balanced dividends with buybacks. The LLM fails to correctly synthesize the capital return strategies due to incorrect data attribution. (4) Despite the severe factual and quantitative inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the question’s structure, discusses capital return strategies, and attempts comparison.

This led to a core sales growth (non-GAAP) of 23.0% for DHR and an organic growth rate of 15% for TMO. The difference in the impact of acquisitions/divestitures between the two companies was therefore -21.5 percentage points, and the difference in their organic growth rates was 8 percentage points.",

TMO's core sales growth was 23.0%, with acquisitions/divestitures contributing a more significant negative impact of -7.5% on total sales growth.

The calculation of the difference in organic growth (8.0 points) is numerically correct but based on wrong values. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize the impact of acquisitions/divestitures for both companies, misrepresenting DHR’s large negative impact as nearly neutral and TMO’s positive contribution as negative.

      "original_answer": "AIG's deconsolidation of Corebridge in the second quarter of 2024 resulted in Corebridge being presented as discontinued operations in AIG’s Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss), with all prior periods restated accordingly. This means that Corebridge's results are no longer included in AIG’s ongoing operations and are instead reported separately as discontinued operations. In contrast, PYPL's 2024 10-K filing indicates that its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) are included as part of the standard financial statement package and does not disclose any such deconsolidation or reclassification during the year. Therefore, PYPL’s Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) reflect continuous operations without any material restructuring like AIG’s.",

However, the LLM claims Netflix's Trade Receivables were 'not material' and reports AT&T's Trade Receivables as $3,943 million, which is incorrect. These numbers do not match the ground truth and suggest confusion with different line items or misinterpretation of AT&T's receivables breakdown. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports AT&T's total as $3,943 million (over 7x higher than the correct $554 million), and omits Netflix's $606 million entirely by labeling it 'not material.' The final combined total of $3,943 million is therefore completely incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the question requires summing disclosed Trade Receivables from two companies, but the LLM failed to extract the correct values from either source.

For PFE, this represents a **significant increase** from a prior-year net cash used of **$14,834 million** (2022), driven by proceeds from long-term debt issuance and reduced dividend payments. For TMO, the net cash flow from financing activities decreased slightly to **$-3,622 million** in 2023, compared to **$-2,810 million** in 2022, reflecting higher dividend payments and debt repayments.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no errors in dollar amounts, signs, or years. Format variations (e.g., $22,444 million vs $22.444B) are acceptable and semantically equivalent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (PFE and TMO) and two years (2023 and 2022), compares changes over time, and draws valid conclusions about the direction and magnitude of change. The explanation of PFE's turnaround and TMO's slightly increased outflow aligns with the ground truth. The only minor issue is that the LLM states PFE's 2022 value as 'net cash used of $14,834 million' without the negative sign, though the phrasing 'net cash used' correctly implies outflow, so this is a stylistic but not factual error. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the combined 2023 value and the contrast with prior-year changes. The qualitative accuracy is slightly docked only because the explanation of drivers (e.g., 'reduced dividend payments' for PFE) goes beyond the ground truth, which does not include causal explanations—this introduces unverified detail, though it is plausible.

This meets quantitative accuracy standards. (2) The qualitative response on Lowe's risk disclosure captures the core idea from the original answer: that reliance on third-party vendors poses a risk of operational disruptions and financial impact if vendors fail or cannot be replaced quickly. While the LLM adds 'cyberattacks' as a specific example not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth, this is a reasonable inference from general risk disclosures and does not contradict the source. The key elements — vendor failure, inability to perform, and difficulty replacing them — are all present in substance.

The ground truth states $680 million (based on a 10% movement on $6.8 billion in contracts), but the LLM incorrectly reports $197 million, which is factually wrong and significantly understates the exposure. This error undermines the core comparison. Additionally, the LLM cites '2021' for General Dynamics' estimate, while the original answer does not specify a year, making the inclusion of 2021 potentially speculative or incorrect. Emerson's $181 million loss is correctly stated. (2) The calculation implied in the ground truth—10% of $6.8 billion = $680 million—is accurate and verifiable, but the LLM's $197 million figure has no apparent basis in the provided data and suggests a failure in data retrieval or calculation. (3) The reasoning framework is sound: the LLM correctly distinguishes between a realized operational loss (Emerson) and a hypothetical market risk (General Dynamics), and it appropriately contrasts one-time vs. recurring risk types. This shows correct multi-hop synthesis in terms of conceptual understanding and risk categorization. (4) Despite correct entity identification (Emerson, General Dynamics) and relevant financial concepts (pretax loss, exchange/interest rate exposure), the severe numerical inaccuracy in a key figure (General Dynamics' $197M vs. $680M) drastically reduces factual correctness.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from both companies and both years is correctly synthesized to assess the combined reserve position. The conclusion that the combined reserves decreased due to XOM's larger decline outweighing COP's increase is logically valid.

      "original_answer": "ACN's effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 was 24.0%, which was 0.9% higher than the adjusted 23.1% rate it would have been without the prior year tax benefits. Meanwhile, ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits increased from $201 million in 2020 to $289 million in 2021, representing an increase of $88 million. Therefore, the increase in ACN's effective tax rate due to the absence of prior year tax benefits was 0.9%, while ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits grew by $88 million over the same period.",

For ADBE, the unrecognized tax benefits increased by **$88 million** from 2020 to 2021 (from $201 million to $289 million).

It correctly states ACN's effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 as 24.0% and accurately reports ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits increase from $201 million in 2020 to $289 million in 2021, a $88 million increase. However, it incorrectly calculates the counterfactual for ACN's tax rate. The ground truth states that ACN's rate would have been 23.1% without prior year tax benefits, making the difference 0.9 percentage points (24.0% - 23.1%). Instead, the LLM compares 24.0% to ACN's actual 2021 rate of 22.8%, claiming a 1.2 percentage point increase due to lower benefits, which misrepresents the required counterfactual comparison. (2) The $88 million increase for ADBE is correctly calculated and matches the ground truth. However, the ACN tax rate difference is based on a factual error: using year-over-year change instead of the adjusted rate without prior year benefits. This leads to an incorrect comparison between a 1.2% increase (which is not the correct metric) and the $88 million increase. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information from both ACN and ADBE is retrieved and synthesized—but the reasoning fails at the critical step of interpreting 'what the rate would have been without prior year tax benefits.' The model substitutes this with a year-over-year comparison, which does not answer the intended question. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies and both parts of the question, but the quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies—especially the incorrect basis for the tax rate difference—reduce the correctness score significantly.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative values. It reports a combined total of $1.179 billion, whereas the ground truth is $979 million. Specifically, the LLM incorrectly states that Johnson & Johnson recorded a $0.4 billion ($400 million) total charge for M710, combining a full and partial impairment. However, the ground truth indicates a $200 million partial impairment in 2023 and a $200 million full impairment in 2024, totaling $400 million — this part is numerically correct, but the phrasing 'recorded a $0.4 billion charge' is misleading as it implies a single or cumulative figure without clarifying it spans two years and two separate events. However, the Merck charge of $779 million for MK-7264 in 2023 is correctly reported. The sum of $400M (J&J) + $779M (Merck) = $1.179B is mathematically correct based on the LLM's inputs, but since the J&J total is double the actual $200M total (which should be only $200M in 2024 after a prior $200M in 2023 — but the 2023 charge was not for M710), there is a critical error in asset-year alignment. The ground truth states J&J recorded a $200M partial impairment in 2023 and a $200M full impairment in 2024 — but crucially, the 2023 charge was not for M710; rather, the 2024 charge was the full impairment of M710. The LLM conflates the timing and nature of the charges, implying both were related to M710 when only the 2024 charge was explicitly for M710. (2) The calculation is based on incorrect attribution: $400M (J&J) + $779M (Merck) = $1.179B is accurate arithmetically, but the inputs are wrong — J&J’s total IPR&D charges for M710 should be $200M (only in 2024), not $400M. Thus, the correct sum is $200M + $779M = $979M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly identifies both companies, assets, years, and the regulatory cause for Merck’s impairment (FDA Complete Response Letter). It also correctly links the charges to financial risks in late-stage development. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the J&J impairment timeline and amount per asset, incorrectly aggregating two $200M charges as both being for M710 when only the 2024 one was. (4) The contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both parts of the question: total charges and their implication for financial risk. The qualitative reasoning about regulatory setbacks and cash flow impacts is sound and aligns with the ground truth. However, due to the major quantitative error in the total ($1.179B vs $979M) stemming from incorrect charge attribution, the correctness score is significantly reduced. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect figures; qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct entities and reasoning framework; contextual relevance is high as the structure and intent match the question.",

      "original_answer": "FedEx incurred $278 million in business realignment costs in 2022, which were specifically tied to workforce reductions in Europe and were managed through a structured program with expected future costs of approximately $420 million through fiscal 2023. These costs were directly linked to operational restructuring and were disclosed with specific estimates and timelines. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's approach to loss contingencies focuses on legal proceedings, where reserves are established based on U.S. GAAP assessments of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. Lockheed Martin does not provide specific dollar amounts for these contingencies, indicating uncertainty in predicting the materiality of potential costs, especially due to evolving legal and regulatory environments. This reflects a more conservative and reactive strategy for managing unpredictable liabilities compared to FedEx's proactive and quantifiably planned approach to known restructuring costs.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx's $278 million 2022 business realignment costs reflect a proactive strategy to streamline operations and integrate acquisitions (e.g., TNT Express), prioritizing structural efficiency through upfront workforce reductions and severance expenses. In contrast, Lockheed Martin manages uncertain liabilities like legal and environmental contingencies by establishing U.S. GAAP-based reserves, focusing on probabilistic assessments and incremental accruals rather than large one-time costs.

While plausible, these details introduce unsupported specifics. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: $278 million in 2022 is accurately cited, and no incorrect calculations are made. The LLM does not attempt to quantify Lockheed Martin’s reserves, correctly reflecting the absence of specific dollar amounts in the original.

In contrast, ADBE recognizes consulting revenue on a time-and-materials or relative performance basis, meaning it earns revenue progressively as services are delivered, reducing the risk of unrecovered costs from sudden cancellations. This difference in contract duration and revenue recognition timing means ACN is more vulnerable to abrupt revenue shortfalls, while ADBE's approach aligns revenue with service delivery and mitigates financial impact from late-stage cancellations.",

In contrast, ADBE's subscription model recognizes revenue ratably over time, spreading revenue recognition across the contract term. This reduces exposure to cancellations because revenue for the period already served is already recognized, even if the contract is terminated.

This mischaracterization affects the reasoning about why ADBE is less exposed.

The question asks for the combined Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized by both DUK and NEE in 2021, but the LLM answer only includes DUK data and explicitly states that NEE data is missing. However, the ground truth includes both companies, meaning the LLM failed to incorporate NEE’s data, leading to an incomplete and incorrect total. While the DUK-specific numbers cited ($586M + $335M = $921M) are numerically correct and match the total in the ground truth, this appears coincidental because the ground truth total of $921M is for both DUK and NEE combined, not DUK alone. Therefore, the LLM incorrectly attributes the full $921M to DUK entities only, which contradicts the ground truth composition. (2) The calculation of 12.59% (~12.6%) is accurate only if the total interest and operating cash flows for both firms are considered. The LLM computes this percentage using only DUK’s data, yielding the same percentage by coincidence due to using a subset of the full picture, but the reasoning is flawed. Without NEE’s data, the percentage cannot be correctly derived unless both numerator and denominator are proportionally scaled—which they are not. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is unsound because the model fails to retrieve or synthesize data for NEE, a required entity. The note about missing NEE documents suggests data incompleteness, but since the ground truth exists, the model should have accessed it. This breaks the multi-hop requirement to aggregate across both companies. (4) Despite these critical errors, the answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, using correct financial terminology and proper calculation methods.

The ground truth states EMR reported $32 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports $130 million. This leads to an incorrect difference calculation. (2) The LMT cash contribution amount is correct at $990 million. However, the difference calculation uses the wrong EMR value: $990M - $130M = $860M is mathematically correct but based on incorrect input data. The correct difference should be $990M - $32M = $958M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly identifies that the comparison requires retrieving pension contributions from LMT and defined contribution expense from EMR, then computing the difference. However, the failure to retrieve the correct EMR figure undermines the synthesis.

      "original_answer": "JNJ records accruals for legal proceedings and product liability claims based on management's judgment and actuarially determined estimates, with self-insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. Claims exceeding insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In contrast, MRK accrues for legal contingencies when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, with a portion of the accrual actuarially determined, factoring in past experience, reported claims, and estimates of claims not yet reported. MRK also specifically accounts for defense costs, with reserves of $225 million as of December 31, 2024, based on factors such as trial costs, case progression, and legal strategy. These differences reflect variations in risk management strategies and litigation exposure between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "JNJ and MRK differ in their accrual strategies for legal contingencies. **MRK** uses actuarial methods and factors like trial outcomes, legal strategy, and environmental site assessments to determine accruals for product liability and environmental liabilities, with reserves for legal defense costs based on anticipated trial costs and case progression. **JNJ** relies on management judgment and actuarial estimates for legal proceedings, with accruals tied to the probability of loss and self-insurance considerations.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer captures some correct elements but contains notable inaccuracies and omissions. It correctly identifies that MRK uses actuarial methods and considers legal strategy and case progression, and that JNJ relies on management judgment and actuarial estimates. However, it incorrectly introduces 'environmental site assessments' and 'environmental remediation costs' as factors for MRK, which are not mentioned in the ground truth and are not part of MRK's legal contingency accrual factors in the 2024 disclosures. The ground truth specifies MRK’s defense cost reserves as $225 million as of December 31, 2024—this specific figure is missing in the LLM answer, a significant omission. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM does not include any incorrect numbers (so no false figures), but it fails to report the $225 million defense cost reserve for MRK, which is a key quantitative detail in the original answer. This omission reduces quantitative accuracy despite no outright errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM distinguishes between JNJ and MRK and attributes actuarial methods to both—but misattributes environmental factors to MRK’s legal accruals, which reflects a category error. The synthesis is incomplete, as it does not mention MRK’s inclusion of estimates for claims not yet reported or that both companies accrue when liabilities are probable and reasonably estimable. JNJ’s use of a wholly-owned captive insurance company (self-insurance) is mentioned in the ground truth but only vaguely referenced as 'self-insurance considerations' in the LLM answer, lacking specificity. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the response addresses the comparative accrual strategies and influencing factors. However, due to the introduction of incorrect factors (environmental) and the omission of key details (MRK’s $225M reserve, JNJ’s captive insurer structure, MRK’s handling of unreported claims), the qualitative and overall correctness scores are reduced. The answer is partially correct but lacks full fidelity to the source disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "Emerson's 2022 margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points due to slightly dilutive effects from price less net material inflation and higher freight and other inflation, despite leverage from increased sales and cost reduction savings. In contrast, General Dynamics' defense segments saw margin performance influenced by contract mix and performance adjustments, where profitability changes stemmed from shifts in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work and updates to cost estimates on long-term contracts. This highlights a divergence in margin drivers: EMR's margins were pressured by external inflationary factors and internal pricing strategies, while GD's margins were shaped by internal contract selection and evolving cost estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson's 2022 margin performance was influenced by favorable price-cost dynamics (price less net material inflation) and inflationary pressures (higher freight costs), partially offset by cost reduction actions and leverage on higher sales. In contrast, General Dynamics' defense segments were impacted by contract mix (shifting toward higher-margin work as new contracts matured) and cost adjustments tied to production volume and performance variances on long-term contracts, with margins driven by changes in contract mix and operational efficiency rather than direct price-cost inflation.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the key factors affecting Emerson's 2022 margin performance—price-cost dynamics, inflation (especially freight), and cost reduction efforts—but omits the specific quantitative impact stated in the ground truth: a 0.6 percentage point decrease in margin. This is a significant omission affecting quantitative accuracy. The answer inaccurately describes price-cost dynamics as 'favorable' when the ground truth states they were 'slightly dilutive,' which misrepresents the direction of the impact. For General Dynamics, the LLM correctly identifies contract mix and cost adjustments as key drivers, aligning with the ground truth, though it adds 'operational efficiency' and 'production volume' not emphasized in the original, potentially introducing minor overinterpretation. (2) The ground truth specifies a 0.6 pp margin decline for Emerson; the LLM fails to include this number, reducing quantitative accuracy. No calculations are incorrect per se, but the absence of the key metric limits precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is generally sound—linking Emerson’s external inflationary and pricing pressures with GD’s internal contract and cost estimate dynamics—but the mischaracterization of price-cost as favorable versus dilutive shows a flaw in reasoning synthesis. The contrast in margin drivers is partially captured but weakened by the incorrect directional assessment for EMR. (4) Despite the omission of the 0.6 pp decline and the misstatement on price-cost impact, the answer addresses both companies, correct years, and correct segment (GD defense), showing strong contextual relevance and entity accuracy. The qualitative reasoning is mostly accurate but not fully aligned with the ground truth’s emphasis on EMR’s margin pressure versus GD’s performance adjustments. Hence, correctness is reduced to 7 due to missing key data and a directional error, though core concepts are present.",

      "original_answer": "Adobe recognizes revenue from consulting contracts either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts, which provides more immediate and predictable revenue recognition. In contrast, Accenture faces risks due to the short duration of many of its consulting contracts (often less than 12 months), with some allowing termination on as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue volatility and unpredictability. This contrast in contract structure and duration means Adobe has greater revenue predictability from its consulting services, while Accenture must manage a higher risk of sudden revenue loss and client retention challenges.",

(1) All key facts are correct: Adobe recognizes consulting revenue on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee (performance-based) basis, providing predictable recognition; Accenture faces risks from short-duration contracts (often <12 months) and termination with as little as 30 days' notice, leading to revenue volatility. These points match the original answer exactly in substance. (2) There are no numeric inaccuracies—duration (<12 months), termination notice (30 days), and fiscal year (2022) are all correctly cited or implied. Format variations are acceptable and do not affect meaning. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Adobe’s more predictable revenue model with Accenture’s exposure to cancellation risk, and infers the financial implication—greater predictability for Adobe vs. uncertainty for Accenture. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'relative performance basis' for fixed-fee contracts (uses 'performance over time', which is semantically similar but slightly less precise), and omits the explicit link to 'client retention challenges' for Accenture.

      "original_answer": "COST actively uses forward foreign-exchange contracts valued at $1,212 million in 2024 to hedge against foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations, particularly for U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures by its international subsidiaries. These contracts are not speculative and are used to economically mitigate exchange risk, although they do not qualify for hedge accounting. In contrast, PM's 2024 operating income variance shows a $205 million favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations, indicating that exchange rate movements had a measurable effect on its financial performance. This implies that while COST proactively hedges to reduce such impacts, PM experienced a direct financial benefit from currency movements, suggesting differing exposures or hedging strategies between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "COST uses forward foreign-exchange contracts to hedge against foreign currency fluctuations impacting U.S. dollar inventory expenditures by international subsidiaries. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, and unrealized gains/losses are immaterial. In PM's 2024 operating income variance, the **currency variance** reflects a **$3 million negative impact** (listed as \"Currency\" in the variance table), indicating foreign exchange movements reduced operating income. This differs from other variances like \"Cost/Other\" ($456 million), which includes factors such as amortization, charges, and operational costs, but not the direct hedging effect of forward contracts.

The calculated difference in the LLM answer is 4.5 percentage points, but the correct difference is 10 percentage points (25.0% - 15%).

In contrast, ADBE does not report a specific dollar amount for consulting revenue but explains that it recognizes consulting revenue either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts.

This satisfies quantitative accuracy. However, the qualitative description of ACN's revenue recognition method is incorrect—ACN does not mention using the 'cost-to-cost method' in the original data; instead, it reports consulting revenue as a total figure and measures performance via new bookings growth (24% USD, 28% local currency), which the LLM omits entirely. The LLM incorrectly introduces a specific accounting method (cost-to-cost) not present in the ground truth for ACN. In contrast, the description of ADBE’s revenue recognition (time-and-materials or relative performance for fixed-fee contracts) is accurate and aligns with the original answer. (2) All numbers are correct: $37.9 billion is accurately cited. No calculations were required. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—while the model correctly identifies ADBE’s methodology from its disclosures, it fabricates ACN’s use of the cost-to-cost method, which is not supported by the source.

The original answer emphasizes that ACN provides a quantitative snapshot (total revenue and booking growth), whereas ADBE explains methodology—this key contrast is lost in the LLM response. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to accurate numbers and partial correctness on ADBE, but significant error in attributing an unsupported revenue recognition method to ACN.

However, the net difference is incorrectly calculated as -3.5% (DHR minus TMO), whereas the question asks for the net difference between the two effects, which is the absolute difference in their impacts: 3% - (-0.5%) = 3.5%. The sign error in the net difference reduces quantitative accuracy slightly. (2) All numbers are factually correct: -0.5% for DHR and +3% for TMO are accurate. The calculation of the net difference is the only error: while the arithmetic (–0.5 – 3 = –3.5) is mathematically correct if interpreted as DHR minus TMO, the context implies the magnitude of the difference between the two contributions, which the ground truth states as 3.5% (i.e., how much greater TMO’s contribution was than DHR’s). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly pulls data from two different companies (DHR and TMO) for the same year (2021) and compares the effects of M&A on growth.

More critically, the core comparison in the question is misinterpreted. The original answer states that MRK's oncology-driven sales growth outpaced the negative impact of foreign exchange by 5 percentage points (e.g., if FX was -3%, oncology growth was +2%, netting +5 ppts), while JNJ's overall sales increased by 4.3%. The LLM instead claims MRK's oncology growth outpaced FX by 25 percentage points (22% growth vs 3% FX drag) and compares this to JNJ's 6.5% growth excluding FX, which is not supported by the ground truth. The ground truth does not mention '22%' or '6.5%' or '3 percentage points FX impact'—these numbers are invented.

In contrast, XOM's proved undeveloped reserves declined from 4,631 MMBOE at the end of 2022 to 4,389 MMBOE at the end of 2023.

These numbers match the ground truth exactly. However, the LLM omits COP's starting balance (2,042 MMBOE) and ending balance (2,344 MMBOE), which are critical for fully assessing the net trend. While the direction (increase) is implied, the exact magnitude of growth in PUDs is not quantified in the LLM answer.

(2) All provided numbers for COP are accurate, and no incorrect calculations are made. However, the absence of XOM’s specific starting and ending values reduces quantitative completeness.

It also accurately reflects that Mastercard (MA) excluded only a 'minimal amount,' consistent with the original answer. All entities (COF, MA, 2021), metrics (anti-dilutive awards, diluted EPS), and time periods are correct. (2) The numeric value '26,000' is a precise match to '26 thousand' in the ground truth, and the qualitative description of MA's 'minimal amount' is preserved accurately. No calculations were required, but the comparison is correctly framed. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis: the model infers that COF’s higher exclusion suggests a larger share-based compensation structure (e.g., RSUs, performance shares), while MA’s minimal exclusion implies fewer such awards or a different structure favoring non-dilutive instruments. This interpretation aligns with and expands upon the ground truth without introducing inaccuracies. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing how the difference in excluded awards reflects variations in share-based payment structures.

Both companies would experience financial pressure, though AIG has partial mitigation through volatility-index-linked rider fees, while Blackstone lacks explicit offset mechanisms in its disclosed risk factors.",
      "llm_answer": "A sustained equity market downturn would reduce AIG's fee income from variable annuities, as account values tied to equity markets decline. However, AIG's hedging costs—driven by equity volatility—would increase, partially offset by rider fees linked to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX). For Blackstone, while the provided documents lack explicit market sensitivity disclosures, its fee-based revenue model (reliant on market activity) would likely face pressure from reduced asset values and lower fee income, as noted in AIG's partnership context. The interplay of these factors could strain both companies' financial positions, with AIG's hedging offsets providing some mitigation.",

(1) It accurately identifies that a sustained equity market downturn would reduce AIG's fee income due to declining variable annuity account values and increase hedging costs, partially offset by VIX-linked rider fees. It also correctly notes that Blackstone's fee-based revenue would be pressured by reduced market activity and asset values. (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors in this regard. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects AIG's fee sensitivity and hedging dynamics with Blackstone's market-dependent revenue model. However, the LLM incorrectly states that 'the provided documents lack explicit market sensitivity disclosures' for Blackstone, whereas the ground truth confirms such disclosures exist in Blackstone's filings. This is a minor but notable inaccuracy in qualitative synthesis. Additionally, the LLM references 'AIG's partnership context' as a source for Blackstone's exposure, which is not clearly supported or explained, introducing some ambiguity. (4) Despite these minor issues, the core financial mechanisms and comparative impact are correctly conveyed, with appropriate contextual relevance and semantic equivalence to the original answer.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Intel recorded a $2.2 billion charge and Oracle a $4.7 billion charge, totaling $6.9 billion. However, the LLM reports $2,291 million ($2.291 billion) for Intel and $4,700 million ($4.7 billion) for Oracle, summing to $6,991 million ($6.991 billion), which exceeds the correct total by $91 million. The Oracle figure is correct in dollar terms ($4.7 billion = $4,700 million), but Intel’s charge is overstated (should be $2,200 million, not $2,291 million). (2) The calculations are based on incorrect inputs: $2,291M + $4,700M = $6,991M is mathematically correct, but the source numbers do not match the ground truth. The correct sum should be $2,200M + $4,700M = $6,900M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly identifies that it must extract litigation charges from both Intel (VLSI-related, 2021) and Oracle (unspecified, 2022) and combine them. However, it fails in accurate data retrieval, likely due to citing incorrect values from document pages (e.g., page 43 and 46), which do not align with the verified knowledge graph data. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses the right companies, years, and types of litigation charges. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the structure and logic are correct, but factual retrieval is flawed. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect numeric values affecting the final total. Correctness score is reduced significantly because financial figures must be precise, and a $91M discrepancy in a $6.9B total represents a material error in a financial context.",

This discrepancy arises from an incorrect sum of $478M (CRM) + $125M (TXN) = $603M, when the correct sum is $597M. The individual values for CRM ($478M) and TXN ($125M) are accurate and match the ground truth, so entity and metric identification are correct. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the arithmetic error in summation: $478M + $125M = $603M is mathematically correct, but the ground truth states the combined impact is $597M, implying either a data discrepancy or a misstatement in the original answer. However, since the evaluation must align with the provided ground truth, the LLM's calculation contradicts the expected result, suggesting either a source data error or a synthesis mistake. Given that the component values match the ground truth but the sum does not, and assuming the ground truth's total is authoritative, the LLM fails in final calculation accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is correctly attributed to CRM and TXN from their respective 10-Ks, and the synthesis across companies and metrics (accounts payable and accrued expenses impacting cash flow from operations) is logically structured. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—the answer addresses the exact question, uses correct fiscal year (2024), correct companies (CRM, TXN), and correct financial concept. The only flaw is the numerical inconsistency in the total, which significantly affects correctness.

      "original_answer": "Costco's policy on repurchased shares involves retiring them in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. This affects its diluted net income per share calculation because the treasury stock method is used to account for potentially dilutive common shares, such as those subject to RSUs, by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding. In contrast, Philip Morris provides a quantitative disclosure of the issued, repurchased, and outstanding shares without specifying a retirement policy or its implications on earnings per share calculations. Therefore, Costco's detailed policy on share retirement and its impact on diluted EPS contrasts with Philip Morris's more general disclosure about repurchased shares.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's policy on repurchased share retirement reduces the number of shares outstanding, which directly impacts diluted net income per share by decreasing the denominator in the calculation. Repurchased shares are retired and not reissued, so they are excluded from both basic and diluted EPS computations. In contrast, Philip Morris's disclosure focuses on share-based compensation awards (e.g., RSUs and PSUs) and their impact on diluted EPS, but does not explicitly link repurchased shares to diluted EPS adjustments.

The LLM answer downplays this quantitative aspect and instead shifts focus to equity awards, which is related but not precisely the contrast in the original answer.

      "original_answer": "Google's content acquisition costs involve payments to third-party content providers for licensing video and other content distributed on YouTube and Google Play, where fees are based on revenues generated or a flat fee. This reflects a platform-centric model where Google leverages external content to drive engagement and monetization through advertising and distribution. In contrast, Netflix's cost of revenues is dominated by amortization of content assets, which includes expenses related to content acquisition, licensing, and production, such as payroll, stock-based compensation, and production costs. This highlights Netflix's vertically integrated model, where it invests heavily in acquiring and producing exclusive content to monetize directly through subscriptions.

      "original_answer": "Emerson reported salaries and wages expenses of $2.9 billion in 2022, while General Dynamics reported a salaries and wages liability of $236 million as of December 31, 2022. This indicates that Emerson had a significantly higher financial obligation toward employee compensation compared to General Dynamics during the same fiscal year.",

However, General Dynamics' deferred tax liability related to salaries and wages in 2022 was $236 million (as noted in GD_10k_2022.pdf, page 66). This comparison does not directly reflect actual salaries and wages expenses or liabilities for either company, as the figure pertains to deferred tax assets/liabilities rather than cash flow or accrued obligations.

It correctly identifies General Dynamics' figure of $236 million but mischaracterizes it as a 'deferred tax liability related to salaries and wages' rather than a direct salaries and wages liability. This is a critical factual error. (2) The number for General Dynamics ($236 million) is accurate in amount but incorrect in context—page 66 of GD's 10-K reports accrued salaries and wages as a liability, not a deferred tax item. The LLM misinterprets the nature of the financial metric, undermining quantitative and qualitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM does not correctly identify or compare the two financial figures as required. Instead of comparing Emerson’s expense to GD’s liability—both valid indicators of compensation obligations—it dismisses the comparability based on a misreading of the GD filing. (4) The conclusion that 'both companies had similar deferred tax positions' is unsupported and irrelevant, as no such data about Emerson’s deferred taxes was presented.

XOM recognized $3.4 billion in after-tax impairment charges in 2023, primarily related to the idled Upstream Santa Ynez Unit assets, and an additional $0.6 billion charge related to an Upstream equity investment.

XOM's $3.4 billion impairment charge is correctly reported, and while the LLM omits the additional $0.6 billion related to the equity investment, it does mention 'an equity investment' in passing, suggesting partial awareness. (2) Calculations are accurate: $7,325M - $5,206M = $2,119M ≈ $2.1B. The XOM impairment figure is cited correctly as $3.4B. The only minor quantitative shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention of the $0.6B charge, though it is not falsely denied. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly compares COP’s reduction in unproved properties to XOM’s impairment charges, attributes them to strategic and operational factors respectively, and draws a valid contrast in asset management strategies. It correctly infers that COP’s decline may reflect strategic shifts or lower development plans, aligning with the ground truth’s 'strategic shift or natural depletion.' For XOM, it links impairments to idled assets and regulatory challenges, consistent with the Santa Ynez Unit context. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addresses the comparison and strategic implications. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the partial omission of XOM’s total impairment scope ($3.4B + $0.6B), which slightly affects completeness. However, since the primary charge is emphasized and the secondary is only briefly noted in the ground truth, the LLM answer remains substantially accurate.

However, for Procter & Gamble, the LLM inaccurately states that growth was driven by 'market expansion, innovation, and higher pricing' with 'mid-single-digit organic sales growth' and mentions performance in Europe and declines in Greater China—information not present in the ground truth and irrelevant to the North America focus. The ground truth specifies P&G’s growth was due to favorable product mix (premium paste and power brushes) and higher pricing—more specific and different from 'market expansion' or 'innovation.'

However, it misses a key qualitative distinction highlighted in the original answer: TXN acknowledges the *potential* for product claims to exceed the price of its products, indicating a broader theoretical exposure compared to CRM's consistently minimal risk. This nuance in risk disclosure—TXN recognizing a higher ceiling for possible claims—is absent in the LLM response, which instead frames the two companies as having 'comparable low exposure' without qualifying that TXN's potential exposure could be structurally larger.

It reports Intel's 2022 litigation charges as $4,713 million, which is incorrect; the ground truth is $2,291 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $9,413 million instead of the correct $7,291 million. Oracle's litigation charges of $4,700 million are correctly reported. Intel's 2020 litigation charges of $67 million are accurately cited. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM's sum ($4,713M + $4,700M = $9,413M) is mathematically correct based on its numbers but uses an incorrect value for Intel. The correct sum is $2,291M + $4,700M = $6,991M (rounded to $7,291 million in the original answer—note: there appears to be a minor discrepancy in the original answer’s arithmetic; $2,291 + $4,700 = $6,991, not $7,291, suggesting a possible typo in the ground truth). However, the LLM’s use of $4,713M for Intel is unsupported and significantly off. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model identifies the need to combine Intel and Oracle 2022 charges and compare them to Intel’s 2020 charges—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Intel 2022. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the structure and intent align with the question, and Oracle and Intel are correctly identified with the right metric and years. However, the severe numerical inaccuracy in a core figure (Intel 2022 litigation) undermines the correctness. The qualitative reasoning is acceptable but based on faulty input data. Final scores reflect mostly incorrect quantitative output with correct entity and temporal alignment.",

      "original_answer": "Comcast's Studios segment programming and production costs decreased in 2023 due to lower costs associated with content licensing sales, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages, while Disney's total programming and production costs slightly increased by 1% to $13.959 billion in 2023. This reflects that both companies were affected by industry-wide challenges, with Comcast experiencing cost reductions due to halted production activity while Disney absorbed slightly higher costs despite similar pressures, indicating varied strategic responses to the same external disruptions.",

Comcast's Studios segment saw a **9.3% decrease in programming costs** due to lower content licensing sales, partly driven by the **Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages**, which reduced production delays and content availability. Conversely, Disney's programming costs in the Media segment decreased due to similar work stoppages, but **sports programming costs rose** from timing shifts related to events like the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

It states that Comcast's Studios segment saw a '9.3% decrease in programming costs'—this specific percentage is not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided original answer, making it a fabrication or unsupported precision. More critically, the LLM claims Disney's programming costs 'decreased' due to work stoppages and that 'sports programming costs rose' from timing shifts like the 2022 FIFA World Cup. This contradicts the ground truth, which states Disney's total programming and production costs *increased* by 1% to $13.959 billion in 2023. The LLM incorrectly frames Disney’s cost trend, reversing the direction of change. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: while $13.959 billion is not mentioned in the LLM response, the 1% increase for Disney is omitted entirely, and the 9.3% figure for Comcast is unsupported. The absence of Disney’s key dollar amount and misrepresentation of its cost trajectory constitute major quantitative errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model recognizes that work stoppages (Writers Guild and SAG) affected both companies and attempts to link industry-wide challenges to cost changes. However, it fails to correctly synthesize the contrasting outcomes: Comcast reduced costs due to halted production, while Disney’s costs rose slightly despite similar pressures. Instead, the LLM incorrectly suggests both saw decreases, undermining the core comparative insight. (4) Contextual relevance is fair—the response addresses work stoppages, content availability, and production costs, staying on topic. However, due to significant factual and directional errors in financial trends, especially for Disney, the overall correctness score is low.

      "original_answer": "Foreign exchange rate fluctuations affect Amazon's effective tax rate due to changes in the relative value of foreign earnings in jurisdictions with varying statutory tax rates, and they impact Nike's international sales when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. Dollar, reducing the dollar value of Nike's foreign currency-denominated sales. Amazon specifically notes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are among the factors that could significantly affect its effective tax rates. Nike states that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Both companies are exposed to FX risk, but the financial impact manifests differently: for Amazon, it affects tax liabilities, while for Nike, it directly affects reported revenues and earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "Fluctuations in foreign exchange (FX) rates impact Amazon's tax liabilities and Nike's international sales through currency translation effects. For Nike, a stronger U.S. Dollar (USD) reduces the USD value of foreign currency-denominated sales and earnings, lowering reported revenues and potentially increasing tax liabilities in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. Conversely, a weaker USD boosts reported revenues, increasing taxable income and tax obligations. For Amazon, FX volatility affects consolidated financial results by altering the USD value of international sales and expenses. A stronger USD reduces reported net sales and operating expenses, while a weaker USD increases them. Both companies hedge FX exposures, which mitigates volatility but also limits the positive impact of a weaker USD on revenues and earnings. These mechanisms directly influence their financial results and tax liabilities through revenue translation and intercompany balance remeasurement.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several correct elements but introduces significant inaccuracies in the qualitative reasoning, particularly regarding the mechanisms of FX impact on Amazon's tax liabilities and Nike's tax implications. The original answer correctly states that FX fluctuations affect Amazon's effective tax rate due to changes in the relative value of foreign earnings across jurisdictions with different tax rates. However, the LLM incorrectly suggests that FX changes affect Nike's tax liabilities in lower-rate jurisdictions, which is not supported in the ground truth and misrepresents Nike's exposure. The ground truth emphasizes that FX affects Nike's reported sales and earnings through translation, not tax liabilities. Conversely, the LLM correctly identifies that a stronger USD reduces the dollar value of foreign-denominated sales for Nike, which aligns with the original answer. For Amazon, the LLM incorrectly frames the FX impact as affecting consolidated sales and expenses rather than specifically linking it to tax liabilities via foreign earnings translation across tax jurisdictions. The original answer clearly separates the mechanisms: tax impact for Amazon, revenue/earnings translation for Nike. The LLM conflates these and misattributes tax effects to Nike. (2) There are no numeric values in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default since no numbers are present or misrepresented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—both companies and the general FX risk are correctly identified, and the direction of FX impact (stronger USD reducing foreign sales value) is correct for Nike. However, the synthesis fails in accurately assigning the financial mechanism (tax vs. revenue) to each company. The LLM incorrectly applies tax implications to Nike and misses the specific tax mechanism for Amazon related to jurisdictional earnings mix. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses FX effects on both companies and discusses translation and hedging. However, due to the misattribution of tax effects and incorrect reasoning pathways, the qualitative accuracy is low.

This indicates that tax-exempt income lowered MET's overall tax liability. In contrast, COF adjusts its Commercial Banking revenue and yields to a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and applicable state taxes to account for investments that generate tax-exempt income, which is a proactive reporting methodology rather than a retrospective adjustment.

      "question": "How did the changes in unbilled receivables for EMR from 2021 to 2022 compare with GD's disclosure of its expectations for collecting receivables, and what does this imply about the timing of revenue realization on long-term contracts?",
      "original_answer": "EMR's unbilled receivables increased significantly from $528 million in 2021 to $1,399 million in 2022, indicating a large buildup of revenue recognized but not yet billed. GD disclosed that it expected to collect substantially all of its year-end 2021 receivables during 2022, which suggests that its revenue realization cycle for long-term contracts is more advanced, with receivables being collected shortly after recognition. This contrast implies that EMR may be facing a longer delay between revenue recognition and cash collection compared to GD.",
      "llm_answer": "EMR's unbilled receivables (contract assets) increased from $528 million in 2021 to $1,399 million in 2022, reflecting a significant rise in revenue recognized before billing, likely due to long-term contracts. GD disclosed expectations to collect substantially all of its 2021 year-end receivables during 2022, aligning with revenue realization timing. This implies both companies recognize revenue over time on long-term contracts, but EMR's sharper increase in unbilled receivables suggests a more pronounced shift in revenue recognition timing, possibly influenced by acquisitions or contract terms.",

These numbers match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—both values for EMR are correct, and the comparison in magnitude (significant increase) is accurate. There are no calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts EMR’s growing unbilled receivables (indicating delay between recognition and billing) with GD’s expectation of prompt collection, implying different revenue realization timing. It appropriately infers that both use over-time revenue recognition on long-term contracts, which aligns with the context. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM adds a speculative element—'possibly influenced by acquisitions or contract terms'—which is not in the ground truth and slightly extends beyond the provided data. While plausible, this weakens the qualitative accuracy slightly. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent: the answer addresses both parts of the question—comparison of changes in unbilled receivables and implications for revenue realization timing—and synthesizes information across EMR and GD correctly. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and highly relevant, warranting a 9/10 due to the minor speculative addition.",

Conversely, the LLM claims that Procter & Gamble does not define Organic Sales Growth in the provided pages and lacks detail on its use, which directly contradicts the ground truth stating that P&G explicitly defines and uses it for at-risk compensation. This misattribution reverses a key differentiator between the two companies. The answer also introduces 'Core EPS' and 'sustainability' as proxies, which are not mentioned in the original answer and represent unsupported inferences. Contextually, the response addresses the general topic but fails to correctly synthesize the multi-hop comparison: it misses the core distinction that P&G ties Organic Sales Growth to management compensation while Colgate does not.

The original answer does not include any numerical return assumptions, so including specific percentages undermines factual accuracy. (2) Completeness: The LLM incorrectly states that Salesforce's documents 'do not detail specific impacts' of investment mix changes, which directly contradicts the original answer stating that CRM explicitly notes such impacts. This omission and misrepresentation of the source information severely weaken the response. (3) Entity accuracy is mostly correct—CRM and TXN are properly identified, and the discussion of pension assumptions for TXN aligns broadly with the topic. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop synthesis fails because the LLM negates one half of the comparison (CRM’s exposure) while adding unverified details for TXN. The original answer establishes that both companies are affected by investment mix shifts—CRM through actual returns on its portfolio, TXN through actuarial assumptions. The LLM undermines this symmetry with incorrect claims about data availability for CRM. (5) Semantic equivalence is not achieved due to the denial of CRM's exposure and the introduction of unsupported numerical data for TXN.

It correctly reports TMO's fair value of plan assets ($1,302 million) and implies a deficit, but incorrectly states the combined deficit as $584 million — which appears to be TMO's individual deficit (calculated as $1,552M - $1,302M), not the combined DHR and TMO total. The ground truth states the combined deficit is $771 million. The LLM claims DHR's data is unavailable, but the ground truth includes DHR's fair value of plan assets ($521 million) and implies its deficit can be derived, meaning the information should have been accessible. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the combined deficit is wrong because it only uses TMO’s data and omits DHR entirely. The calculation for TMO’s deficit is accurate ($1,552M - $1,302M = $250M), but this is not the $584M cited — which contradicts even its own numbers. There is a clear inconsistency: the LLM says TMO’s deficit is $584M, but the math from its cited obligations and assets doesn’t support that. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the question requires combining Non-U.S. Pension Benefits data for both DHR and TMO in 2021. The LLM does not retrieve or use DHR’s data, breaking the synthesis requirement. It also does not compute or compare the combined deficit correctly. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate — it addresses the structure of the question (deficit and fair value comparison) and correctly identifies TMO’s asset value, but fails on completeness and correctness for DHR, leading to a fundamentally incorrect conclusion. The claim that DHR’s data is 'not provided' contradicts the ground truth, suggesting a retrieval or reasoning failure.",

(3) The reasoning is flawed in the qualitative sense: while it correctly cites GD’s disclosure, it incorrectly concludes GE lacks explicit data, failing to synthesize across both companies’ filings.

      "question": "How do the capitalization policies for tenant allowances and improvements at SPG, as applied to asset efficiency and useful life extension, interact with AMT's use of cash flows for maintenance and improvements, and what does this imply about their respective strategies for sustaining asset value?",
      "original_answer": "SPG capitalizes improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset, indicating a focus on long-term asset enhancement. AMT, on the other hand, uses cash flows to fund maintenance and improvements, communications site and data center construction, and managed network installations, suggesting a more operational and growth-oriented approach. The interaction implies that SPG emphasizes capital efficiency and asset longevity through selective capitalization, while AMT prioritizes ongoing investment in infrastructure to sustain and grow its operations.",
      "llm_answer": "SPG capitalizes tenant allowances and improvements, amortizing them over lease terms to extend asset useful life and improve efficiency, aligning with its strategy to sustain asset value through long-term cost allocation. AMT, meanwhile, uses cash flows directly for maintenance and improvements, reflecting a focus on operational sustainability through immediate reinvestment. This implies SPG prioritizes asset value preservation via capitalized expenditures, while AMT emphasizes liquidity-driven maintenance to support ongoing operations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and captures the core distinctions between SPG and AMT's strategies as described in the ground truth. (1) All factual elements are correct: SPG capitalizes tenant allowances and improvements when they extend useful life or improve efficiency, and amortizes them over lease terms—this aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on long-term asset enhancement and capital efficiency. AMT uses cash flows for maintenance, improvements, and infrastructure buildouts (communications sites, data centers), which the LLM correctly interprets as operational reinvestment. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes SPG’s capitalization policy with its strategic focus on asset longevity and contrasts it with AMT’s use of cash flows for ongoing operations and growth. The only minor omission is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'growth-oriented approach' or 'managed network installations' as in the original, but the essence of AMT’s strategy is preserved. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing how capitalization policies and cash flow usage interact and what they imply about each company’s strategy. Wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence. Thus, the correctness score is 9—very close to perfect, with only slight room for more completeness in describing AMT’s specific investment areas.",

It incorrectly states that Salesforce's accrued expenses and other liabilities are $911 million, which is actually Texas Instruments' value; Salesforce's correct amount is $372 million. The operating lease obligation for Salesforce ($3,162 million) is correct. For Texas Instruments, the LLM claims lease data is unavailable, but the ground truth confirms TXN's operating lease liabilities as $3,320 million. Thus, the LLM fails to provide the necessary data for comparison. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: one out of four numbers is correct (only Salesforce's lease liability), and the $911 million is misattributed to both companies. Calculations for ratios (11.8% and 27.4%) are entirely missing due to incorrect inputs and missing data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the question requires comparing two companies' liabilities relative to lease obligations using data from both. The LLM incorrectly asserts data is missing for TXN when it should have been available, preventing proper synthesis. It also confuses the accrued expenses between the two firms, indicating a failure in entity-metric mapping. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses the right metrics and companies, and attempts a comparison, but due to factual inaccuracies and missing data, the conclusion is invalid.

      "original_answer": "NFLX's 'Other Cost of Revenues' increased by $376 million in 2023, primarily due to higher expenses associated with content acquisition, licensing, and production. This reflects a strategy of investing more heavily in content to support growth. In contrast, T's 'Other Cost of Revenues' decreased by approximately $395 million due to an accounting policy change that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs. This change indicates a cost management strategy focused on spreading expenses over a longer period, reducing short-term cost impact.

The combined percentage increase is not calculated in the LLM answer, but the question asks for the 'combined percentage increase,' which the model fails to compute or define clearly.

      "question": "What is the difference in the total contractual obligations between NFLX and T, and how does the composition of their obligations (specifically content obligations for NFLX and long-term debt obligations for T) contribute to this difference?",
      "original_answer": "The total contractual obligations of NFLX amount to $42,541,407, while those of T total $337,473. This results in a difference of $42,203,934. A significant portion of NFLX's obligations comes from content obligations at $21,713,349, which is more than double T's largest category, long-term debt obligations at $146,064. This highlights that NFLX's much larger content obligations are a key driver of the overall difference in contractual obligations between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "The total contractual obligations for NFLX (Netflix) are approximately **$42.5 billion**, primarily driven by **content obligations** (e.g., content acquisition, licensing, and production), while AT&T (T) has **$337.5 million** in total contractual obligations, dominated by **long-term debt**. The stark difference arises because NFLX’s business model requires substantial upfront investments in content creation and licensing, whereas AT&T’s obligations are largely debt-related. NFLX’s content obligations (e.g., $21.7 billion) far exceed AT&T’s debt obligations ($17.7 billion), reflecting the divergent nature of their core operations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numbers. While it correctly identifies that NFLX has much higher total contractual obligations than T, it reports NFLX's total as ~$42.5 billion (which matches the ground truth of $42,541,407,000 when converted), it incorrectly states T's total obligations as $337.5 million instead of $337,473 (i.e., ~$0.337 million), overstating T's obligations by over 1,000 times. This leads to a completely incorrect interpretation of the scale of difference. The difference is stated implicitly but not calculated, and the claim that NFLX’s content obligations exceed AT&T’s debt obligations is false: the LLM claims AT&T’s debt is $17.7 billion, but ground truth shows only $146,064 (~$0.15 million), making this a major factual error. (2) Number verification: NFLX total: $42.5B ≈ $42,541,407,000 — acceptable rounding. NFLX content obligations: $21.7B ≈ $21,713,349,000 — acceptable. T total obligations: LLM says $337.5M, truth is $337,473 (~$0.34M) — off by 1000x. T long-term debt: LLM says $17.7B, truth is $146,064 — again off by orders of magnitude. These are catastrophic quantitative errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that content obligations drive NFLX's liabilities and debt drives T's, which is qualitatively sound reasoning. It also contrasts business models appropriately. However, due to the massive numerical inaccuracies, the synthesis fails — the conclusion that NFLX’s content obligations exceed T’s debt is trivially true only because T’s obligations are tiny, but the LLM presents it as a large-vs-large comparison, which misrepresents reality. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to mostly incorrect numbers despite some correct qualitative insights. Quantitative accuracy is 3 due to multiple severe numerical errors. Qualitative accuracy is 6 because the conceptual understanding of business models and obligation types is reasonable. Contextual relevance is 8 because the answer addresses all parts of the question and is well-structured, even if factually flawed.",

      "question": "How does the difference in depreciation methods for property and equipment between HD and MCD affect their long-term asset management strategies?",
      "original_answer": "HD uses the straight-line method for depreciating buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment over their estimated useful lives, while MCD also uses the straight-line method but specifies different useful life ranges—buildings up to 40 years, leasehold improvements based on the lesser of asset life or lease terms, and equipment between 3 to 12 years. This difference in depreciation policy specificity allows MCD to adjust asset valuations more dynamically based on economic and technological changes, potentially influencing when asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation occur. HD's approach, by contrast, appears more static, which may limit flexibility in responding to rapid changes in asset utility. These differing methods reflect contrasting long-term asset management strategies: HD emphasizes consistency, while MCD emphasizes adaptability.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in depreciation methods and useful lives between HD and MCD impacts their long-term asset management strategies. HD uses straight-line depreciation with longer useful lives (e.g., buildings: 5–45 years, equipment: 2–20 years) and quarterly impairment reviews, allowing for slower asset replacement cycles and more conservative expense recognition. MCD also uses straight-line depreciation but with shorter equipment lives (3–12 years) and annual impairment testing at the market level, reflecting faster technological changes and more frequent asset turnover. HD’s longer lives and proactive quarterly assessments may preserve cash flow and reduce write-offs, while MCD’s shorter lives and market-level impairment testing align with its global operations and rapid renewal cycles, influencing capital expenditure timing and asset optimization.",

It also accurately captures the strategic implications—HD's consistency versus MCD's adaptability—showing sound qualitative understanding. However, there are discrepancies in the numeric details: the ground truth does not specify useful life ranges for HD (e.g., 5–45 years for buildings, 2–20 years for equipment), whereas the LLM answer introduces these exact ranges, which are not present in the original answer. This is a factual overreach, as the ground truth only states HD uses straight-line without specifying life ranges. Conversely, MCD’s useful lives (3–12 years for equipment, up to 40 years for buildings) are partially accurate, though the LLM omits leasehold improvements being based on the lesser of asset life or lease term, a key detail in the original. (2) The LLM introduces new quantitative claims (e.g., quarterly impairment reviews for HD, annual market-level testing for MCD) that are absent in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided information, reducing quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong—linking depreciation methods to asset management strategies like capital expenditure timing and asset turnover—and the synthesis between method, useful life, and strategic outcome is logical and relevant. (4) Despite the unsupported numbers and missing detail on leasehold improvements, the core reasoning about strategic differences (consistency vs. adaptability) is preserved, warranting a 7 for correctness. Quantitative accuracy is penalized due to unsupported ranges and testing frequencies. Qualitative accuracy remains high due to correct conceptual framing.

Instead, the model misattributes the $12 million figure to MDT's pension plan assets, which is a different financial context and entity. This reflects a failure in entity disambiguation and multi-hop synthesis: the model did not correctly associate the $12 million real estate impact with CVS.

While the numbers mentioned are accurate in isolation (i.e., $238M and $12M for pension assets), their application to the wrong entities and failure to combine them as required leads to a substantially incorrect overall answer.

Instead, the LLM vaguely references 'different divisor (e.g., sales quantities or varying conversion factors)' and notes 'without explicit XOM data, the exact disparity remains inferred,' which undercuts the factual basis provided in the original answer.

It incorrectly states that DHR's projected benefit obligation (PBO) for Non-U.S. Pension Benefits increased from $1,486 million in 2020 to $1,552 million in 2021, while the ground truth reports a decrease from $1,366 million to $1,125 million—a $241 million reduction. These numbers are not only wrong but contradict the actual trend. Additionally, the LLM attributes this PBO data to TMO instead of DHR, failing a critical entity distinction. (2) The discount rate difference is correctly calculated: TMO used 0.95% in 2020 and 1.45% in 2021, a 0.50 percentage point increase—this part is accurate. However, the PBO figures cited are entirely inconsistent with the ground truth, and the implied calculation of a $66 million increase in PBO is false when the correct change is a $241 million decrease. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model fails to correctly associate PBO data with DHR rather than TMO. The question asks for a comparison between TMO’s discount rate change and DHR’s PBO change—two different companies. The LLM incorrectly merges TMO’s actuarial gains with DHR’s PBO data, misrepresenting both entities and undermining the synthesis. (4) While the general qualitative point about pension liability sensitivity to interest rates is conceptually sound, it is applied to incorrect data and misattributed entities. The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent align with the question, but factual accuracy is severely compromised, warranting a low correctness score.",

However, it fails to report Tesla's depreciation and amortization expense of $2,122 million, instead stating that the data is 'not explicitly provided.' This is incorrect—the ground truth indicates Tesla's deferred tax liability related to depreciation and amortization is $2,122 million, which in context reflects the scale of its depreciation and amortization expense. The LLM misinterprets the absence of an explicitly labeled 'depreciation and amortization' line item and does not infer from the provided deferred tax liability figure, which the knowledge graph treats as a proxy for the expense in this context. (2) The combined total should be $2,504 million ($382M + $2,122M), but the LLM does not compute or mention this sum, missing a key part of the question.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains multiple critical factual and logical errors. First, it incorrectly states that Boeing's net contract assets decreased from $556 million to $484 million, implying a $72 million reduction, but the ground truth only mentions a $317 million decrease in unbilled receivables — there is no mention of net contract asset levels or their change from $556M to $484M in the original data. Similarly, for Emerson, the LLM fabricates identical net contract asset figures ($556M to $484M), which are not present in the ground truth. The ground truth states Emerson’s unbilled receivables increased by $146 million, contributing to an increase in net contract assets — not a decrease. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: Boeing’s unbilled receivables change is correctly calculated in the original as $8,634M → $8,317M = -$317M, which the LLM misrepresents as a $72M impact on net contract assets with fabricated base values. Emerson’s increase of $1,599M - $1,453M = +$146M is completely misrepresented as a $72M reduction in net contract assets. The final difference in changes is stated as zero, but the correct value is $317M (Boeing reduction) + $146M (Emerson increase) = $463M. The LLM’s calculation is therefore entirely incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: instead of linking changes in unbilled receivables to net contract asset movements using actual data, the model invents matching net contract asset figures for both companies with identical values and directions, contradicting the opposing movements described in the ground truth. It also mislabels Emerson’s data as moving from 2023 to 2024, while the question and truth are focused on 2023 changes (2022 to 2023). (4) Scores are low due to pervasive factual errors, incorrect calculations, fabricated numbers, and flawed logic.

However, COP does not disclose a specific dollar amount for its low-carbon investments. In contrast, XOM provides a concrete figure of $0.9 billion invested in its Low Carbon Solutions business in 2024, specifically targeting carbon capture and storage, lithium, and carbon-free hydrogen projects. This contrast indicates that while both companies are investing in low-carbon technologies, XOM is making a more quantifiably directed financial commitment to these initiatives, whereas COP's investment appears to be ongoing but less specifically itemized, suggesting a potentially broader or less mature allocation of resources toward low-carbon solutions.",

In contrast, ExxonMobil (XOM) integrates low-carbon initiatives into broader capital spending, with $4.9 billion in 2024 allocated to Product Solutions (including low-carbon projects) but maintaining a larger emphasis on traditional upstream oil and gas investments. XOM’s environmental expenditures ($9.0 billion in 2024) and capital spending ($27.6 billion in 2024) highlight a balanced approach, prioritizing both operational efficiency and gradual low-carbon adoption, while COP’s disclosures suggest a more aggressive, cost-intensive shift toward low-carbon technologies.",

According to the ground truth, COP does not disclose a specific dollar amount for low-carbon investments, but the LLM incorrectly states that COP allocated $0.8 billion to equity investments in LNG and low-carbon projects. This figure is entirely fabricated. Similarly, the LLM claims XOM allocated $4.9 billion to Product Solutions and $9.0 billion to environmental expenditures in 2024—none of which appear in the ground truth. The only correct quantitative detail in the ground truth is that XOM invested $0.9 billion in its Low Carbon Solutions business, which the LLM completely misses. (2) All key numbers in the LLM answer are incorrect: $0.8B (COP low-carbon), $4.9B (XOM Product Solutions), $9.0B (XOM environmental), and $27.6B (XOM capital spending) are not supported by the original answer and contradict it. The ground truth specifies only XOM’s $0.9B investment and notes COP’s lack of specific disclosure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The LLM incorrectly infers that COP has a more aggressive low-carbon strategy based on non-existent spending figures, while portraying XOM’s approach as more integrated but less focused—opposite to the ground truth, which shows XOM making a specific, quantifiable commitment while COP’s investments are less itemized. The reasoning is built on false premises. (4) Despite incorrect facts, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the strategic comparison between COP and XOM regarding low-carbon investments and attempts to interpret financial disclosures.

These numbers are off by an order of magnitude. (2) Calculations are wrong for TXN: $836M - $799M = $37M, but the actual values are ~$29M and ~$22M, so the LLM used incorrect source data. The CRM calculation is correct in amount and direction. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing two companies' changes in accrued compensation to infer management approaches—but fails due to reliance on incorrect data. The conclusion about CRM focusing on cost control aligns with the ground truth, but the claim that TXN is making 'higher labor expenses tied to operational expansion' is unsupported by the real data, which shows a modest $7M increase from a small base.

Similarly, Philip Morris (PM) faces currency-related risks in Russia and Ukraine, where it derived 6% of its total net revenues from Russia and 1% from Ukraine in 2024. PM highlights that geopolitical instability from the war in Ukraine and sanctions could increase exposure to currency fluctuations, which may raise operational costs and reduce demand for its products.

These numbers are not minor variations but represent material overstatements. (2) The calculation and sourcing of '9% of shipments' and '2% from Ukraine' have no basis in the original answer and introduce false precision. The original answer does not mention shipment percentages or revised revenue shares, making these figures incorrect.

However, several of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory, or contractual restrictions that limit their ability to provide such payments. These restrictions include local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements tied to Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Similarly, Wells Fargo’s subsidiary banks are restricted under federal law from transferring funds or assets to the Parent or its nonbank subsidiaries in excess of 10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for any single affiliate and 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates. These limitations, combined with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length transaction terms, constrain the ability of both Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo to reallocate capital internally, thereby reducing flexibility in managing liquidity and capital during periods of financial stress or regulatory scrutiny.",

Similarly, Wells Fargo's subsidiary banks face federal restrictions on transferring funds to the parent company, such as limits on covered transactions (e.g., loans to affiliates) and capital distribution requirements under the FRB.

This omission affects quantitative accuracy. The LLM mentions the OCC's Consent Order and FRB capital distribution requirements, which are contextually relevant but not explicitly stated in the ground truth, potentially introducing extraneous detail. While the reasoning is logically sound and the synthesis across both companies is appropriate, the LLM does not mention Citigroup’s inter-affiliate arrangements tied to its resolution plan or local regulatory stress test requirements, which are key elements in the original answer.

This increase indicates a shift in the timing and volume of advance payments received from customers. In contrast, General Dynamics explicitly describes the role of customer advances in shaping revenue recognition timing, particularly in their defense and aerospace segments. In defense, customer advances are less common, and billing typically follows revenue recognition, creating contract assets. However, international contracts sometimes result in customer advances before revenue is recognized, creating contract liabilities. In aerospace, General Dynamics often receives deposits upon contract execution and milestone achievements, which are later liquidated as revenue. Therefore, while Caterpillar's customer advances grew modestly, General Dynamics highlights a more structured and segment-specific impact of these advances on financial reporting timing.",

The LLM uses $36,762M (Comcast 2023) and $12,983M (Disney 2023), which sum to $49,745M, but the correct sum implied by the ground truth must be based on different (or corrected) input values. (2) The calculation of the percentage increase (5%) is accurate and matches the original answer. However, the sum of the two costs is off by $610 million, which is a significant numerical error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly identifying the need to sum costs across two companies for 2023 and then compute Disney’s year-over-year percentage change. The logic and structure are correct, but the factual inputs or arithmetic appear flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate financial terminology. Due to the major quantitative error in the total cost figure, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are reduced, but the qualitative reasoning and relevance remain strong.",

      "original_answer": "Disney reported a 26% increase in advertising revenue from impressions, driven by the launch of the ad-supported Disney+ service domestically in December 2022 and internationally starting in November 2023, as well as increased cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar, including two ICC tournaments compared to one in the prior year. Alphabet disclosed changes in monetization metrics for Google Network revenues, which are impression- and cost-per-impression-based, but did not provide specific growth percentages or drivers for impression volume growth. This makes a direct performance comparison between Disney's impression growth and Alphabet's impression monetization metrics impossible, though both companies highlight impressions as a key advertising revenue driver.",

The original answer explicitly states that Alphabet did not disclose specific growth percentages or drivers for impression volume growth. This makes the -5% figure entirely fabricated and invalidates the core comparison.

(2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: $963 million for COST’s retirement expenses and $91 million for PG’s variable lease costs (implied from knowledge graph context, though not explicitly in the original answer—however, since this figure is consistent with known PG disclosures and does not contradict the ground truth, it is acceptable).

The total combined amount is therefore incorrect: LLM reports $11,808 million, while the correct total is $13,509 million. Additionally, the LLM claims both companies had the same net cash used in financing activities ($6,555 million), but COF's was actually $7,030 million.

      "original_answer": "CVS provides a detailed breakdown of how it classifies and manages its current investments, including specific methodologies for debt securities, equity securities, and mortgage loans. It explains that debt securities are classified as current or long-term based on contractual maturities or the intent to sell within twelve months, and it outlines a structured process for evaluating credit-related impairments and non-credit-related losses. This indicates a more structured and market-sensitive approach to managing investment risk and liquidity. In contrast, MDT references 'current investments' only in the context of its overall liquidity and flexibility, stating that its cash, cash equivalents, current investments, and credit facilities will satisfy its current and future obligations. MDT does not specify the composition or management methodology of its current investments, suggesting a more generalized reliance on liquidity without the same level of detail or risk segmentation as CVS. This difference reflects that CVS adopts a more granular and proactive strategy for managing investment-related liquidity risks, while MDT emphasizes broad financial strength and flexibility without elaborating on specific investment management practices.",
      "llm_answer": "CVS emphasizes liquidity management through substantial cash reserves ($8.196 billion as of 2023), a $3.5 billion credit facility, and flexible classification of current investments (e.g., short-term debt securities and cash equivalents), reflecting a proactive approach to maintaining financial flexibility and minimizing liquidity risk. In contrast, MDT focuses on maintaining strong credit ratings (A/A-1) and a robust credit facility with extension options, highlighting a strategy reliant on creditworthiness and structured debt management to ensure liquidity. CVS’s emphasis on liquid assets and immediate access to capital underscores a more conservative liquidity risk posture, while MDT’s reliance on credit ratings and facility terms reflects a confidence in its financial stability to access funds when needed.",

These figures may be factually accurate in context but were not part of the knowledge graph's supported answer, making their inclusion unsupported. MDT's credit ratings (A/A-1) and details about its credit facility are also absent from the original answer and introduce unverified specifics. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct in format but not fully verifiable; while dollar amounts and ratings are plausibly formatted, they are not confirmed by the ground truth, which focuses on qualitative differences in disclosure rather than specific financial figures or ratings. (3) The reasoning diverges significantly from the multi-hop synthesis required: the original answer contrasts CVS’s detailed classification methodology (e.g., debt/equity securities, impairment evaluation) with MDT’s generalized reference to current investments within liquidity. The LLM instead shifts focus to cash reserves, credit facilities, and credit ratings—emphasizing financing tools over investment classification practices. This misaligns with the core of the question, which asks about how management and classification of *current investments* reflect differing approaches. The LLM conflates liquidity sources (credit lines, ratings) with investment management practices, failing to address CVS’s structured segmentation of securities or MDT’s lack of disclosure on investment composition. (4) While the LLM captures a high-level contrast in liquidity philosophy (CVS as conservative/asset-focused vs MDT as creditworthiness-focused), it misses the key distinction in *how each company discusses the management and classification* of current investments. The original answer hinges on transparency and granularity of investment risk segmentation—CVS provides it, MDT does not. This critical qualitative difference is overshadowed by the LLM’s introduction of external financial data.

In contrast, Goldman Sachs recognizes foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies directly in earnings, without specifying a particular expense line item.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and captures the essential difference in treatment of foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses between BlackRock and Goldman Sachs as per their 2024 10-K filings. (1) It correctly states that BlackRock includes these gains/losses in 'general and administrative expenses,' which aligns with the ground truth. For Goldman Sachs, it accurately notes recognition 'in earnings,' though it adds a nuance about 'consolidated statements of comprehensive income for translation adjustments'—a detail not in the original answer. However, this does not contradict the ground truth, as translation adjustments (which are part of other comprehensive income) are distinct from remeasurement gains/losses (which hit earnings directly); the LLM slightly conflates the two concepts but correctly emphasizes that Goldman Sachs does not specify a particular line item. (2) There are no numeric values to verify, so quantitative accuracy is满分. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies' accounting policies and draws a valid comparison. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and directly addresses the question. The minor deduction in qualitative accuracy is due to the slight conflation of translation adjustments (OCI) with remeasurement gains/losses (P&L), which could mislead if interpreted strictly, but the core point about differing presentation—specific line item vs. general earnings recognition—remains correct. Overall, the answer is factually strong and semantically equivalent to the ground truth with only minor imprecision.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts is $70 million for Duke Energy and $500 million for NextEra Energy, resulting in a total of $570 million. This significant difference suggests that NextEra Energy has a much larger long-term risk exposure tied to commodity contracts compared to Duke Energy, indicating a more aggressive hedging strategy or greater involvement in commodity markets.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts as of December 31, 2020, is **$1,406 million** ($1,199 million for NextEra Energy (NEE) and $207 million for Duke Energy). NEE's significantly higher noncurrent liabilities ($1,199 million) reflect a more aggressive long-term hedging strategy, with substantial commitments to fixed-price contracts that lock in future commodity prices, exposing the company to greater price risk over extended periods. In contrast, Duke Energy's lower noncurrent liabilities ($207 million) suggest a more conservative approach, possibly prioritizing short-term flexibility or diversification in hedging instruments, thereby reducing long-term exposure. This divergence highlights contrasting risk management priorities: NEE's focus on securing stable costs through long-term contracts versus Duke Energy's emphasis on minimizing long-term obligations.",

The combined total is therefore $570 million, not $1,406 million. These discrepancies are significant and materially alter the conclusion. (2) The calculations are incorrect due to reliance on wrong base figures. The LLM reports a total of $1,406 million, which does not match the correct sum of $570 million. Even allowing for format variations, the numbers are not equivalent. (3) While the LLM attempts multi-hop reasoning by comparing the two companies' risk exposure based on their liabilities, the analysis is built on false data, rendering the logic unsound. The conclusion about NEE having a more aggressive hedging strategy may align qualitatively with the ground truth, but it is based on incorrect magnitudes and thus cannot be considered accurate reasoning.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key numbers. The combined amortization is stated as $3,903 million, but the ground truth is $3,783 million. This discrepancy arises because CVS's amortization is reported as $2,025 million instead of the correct $1,905 million. While ABT's amortization ($1,878 million) is correct, the error in CVS's value leads to an incorrect total. Additionally, the LLM uses $8,516 million as CVS’s operating earnings, which contradicts the ground truth calculation of $16,313 million (earnings before taxes, derived from operating income + interest expense - other income). The ground truth explicitly defines this adjusted figure as the relevant metric for comparison, but the LLM uses a different (and incorrect) figure without justification. (2) Calculations: The sum $1,878M + $2,025M = $3,903M is arithmetically correct, but based on wrong input data. The comparison percentages are not computed in the LLM answer, whereas the original answer correctly calculates that the combined amortization represents 54.3% of ABT’s earnings and 54.7% of CVS’s, showing deeper quantitative analysis. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM fails to properly synthesize the correct financial figures across entities and calculations. It does not replicate the necessary adjustment for CVS’s operating earnings (adding interest expense and subtracting other income), indicating a failure in multi-hop logic. It also incorrectly implies that the combined amortization is lower than both companies’ operating earnings, which may be true numerically even with correct data, but the magnitude and proportion (over half of operating earnings) is misrepresented due to incorrect inputs. (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant—addressing all parts of the question, identifying the correct companies and year, and attempting the right type of comparison. However, due to major quantitative inaccuracies and flawed reasoning in deriving CVS’s earnings and amortization, the correctness score is low.

      "original_answer": "Costco (COST) experiences a direct positive impact on net sales growth from rising gasoline prices due to increased sales volume, although this comes at the expense of a lower gross margin percentage. In contrast, Procter & Gamble (PG) attributes a 4% increase in net sales growth specifically to price changes across its product categories, indicating a strategic reliance on pricing power to drive revenue. This comparison reveals that while both companies are influenced by pricing dynamics, COST's pricing sensitivity is tied to volume and external market forces (like fuel prices), whereas PG actively leverages pricing strategy as a lever to influence sales growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's gasoline price changes directly impact net sales growth, as higher prices boost traffic and sales (e.g., a 1% gasoline volume increase added $400M to net sales), but lower prices negatively affect sales ($917M impact in 2024). However, Costco prioritizes member value and traffic over margin maximization in gasoline, which has a lower gross margin percentage. In contrast, Procter & Gamble (PG) emphasizes pricing as a core driver of net sales growth and margin improvement, with higher pricing (e.g., 4% price increases in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care) directly boosting sales and gross margins. PG's business model relies on pricing power to offset costs and maintain profitability, while Costco uses gasoline pricing as a traffic driver, reflecting divergent strategies: PG focuses on pricing to enhance margins, whereas Costco leverages ancillary services to drive volume, even at the expense of short-term margins.",

This qualitative comparison aligns well with the ground truth. However, the LLM introduces specific dollar figures ($400M from 1% gasoline volume increase, $917M impact in 2024) and mentions '4% price increases in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care' that are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. These additions introduce quantitative inaccuracies. (2) The original answer states PG had a 4% increase in net sales growth due to price changes overall, but does not specify 4% price increases in particular segments—this is a misrepresentation. The $400M and $917M figures are absent in the ground truth and appear fabricated or misattributed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure—correctly identifying that COST’s model links gasoline pricing to volume and traffic while PG uses pricing as a strategic lever—but the inclusion of unsupported numbers undermines factual reliability.

Meanwhile, Comcast's Studios segment recognizes content licensing revenue 'when the content is delivered and available for use' with approximately 'half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue' remaining in deferred revenue at any given time. This creates a timing mismatch where Netflix must pay cash upfront for content production but receives revenue over time, while Comcast receives payments over the license term but recognizes revenue only after delivery, highlighting different liquidity and revenue recognition challenges in the content creation industry.",

Netflix incurs significant cash expenditures for content (e.g., $17.469 billion in 2021) well in advance of revenue recognition, leading to lower free cash flow due to high upfront costs and amortization gaps. In contrast, Comcast recognizes revenue for licensed content when it is delivered and available for use, often aligning with payment terms spread over the license period. This creates a mismatch where Comcast may face delayed cash inflows relative to revenue recognition, while Netflix struggles with liquidity pressure from large upfront investments.

It also correctly states that SPG capitalizes construction-related expenses, including interest during construction, which aligns with the original answer. However, the LLM introduces a significant factual error by claiming SPG had $587.6 million in construction-in-progress in 2022 and $760.2 million in 2023—these numbers are not present in the original answer or implied by it, and thus represent an unsupported addition. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high for the AMT figures (correct to the decimal and year), but the SPG construction-in-progress numbers are fabricated or misattributed, which undermines trust in the data synthesis. (3) The reasoning is flawed in its conclusion: while both companies may capitalize construction costs, the original answer emphasizes that AMT's declining accrued liabilities suggest reduced obligations or settlements, not necessarily aggressive capitalization. The LLM incorrectly infers that lower accrued expenses imply more aggressive capitalization, which is not directly supported—accruals and capitalization are distinct accounting treatments. The original answer contrasts SPG’s deferral of costs (capitalization) with AMT’s reduction in liabilities, possibly indicating differing development phases or strategies, not alignment in approach. The LLM misinterprets the implication, suggesting alignment where the ground truth implies contrast. (4) Correctness is partially compromised due to the incorrect SPG financial figures and flawed logic in drawing conclusions about financial treatment. Quantitative accuracy is high except for the invented CIP numbers. Qualitative accuracy suffers due to incorrect multi-hop reasoning and misinterpretation of accounting implications.

The ground truth states RTX's 2024 segment operating profit is $6,339 million, but the LLM reports $6,538 million—a material difference of $199 million. The combined total is therefore incorrect: LLM reports $14,074 million vs. the correct $13,875 million. Additionally, the LLM states RTX’s margin is 8.1% and UPS’s is 8.28%, but the ground truth reports RTX at 9.2% and does not provide UPS’s margin—making the LLM’s comparative margin analysis factually unsupported. (2) Calculations: The sum of $6,538M (RTX) + $7,536M (UPS) = $14,074M is arithmetically correct, but based on incorrect inputs. The UPS profit figure ($7,536M) matches the ground truth and is accurate. However, RTX’s profit and margin are both wrong, undermining quantitative reliability. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM attempts to explain business strategies, which aligns with the question, but does so using incorrect data and misattribution. It claims UPS has a higher margin than RTX, which contradicts the ground truth (RTX 9.2% vs. UPS unspecified but implied lower). The explanation of UPS’s international segment margin (17.77%) and U.S. Domestic (7.19%) is not present in the ground truth and appears fabricated. Similarly, attributing lower margins at RTX to Pratt & Whitney is speculative and not in the original answer.

The combined present value of lease liabilities after subtracting imputed interest is reported as $23,145.4 million, but the ground truth is $19,909.4 million. This discrepancy arises because the LLM assigns $13,726.4 million to MCD and $9,419.0 million to HD, whereas the correct values from the knowledge graph must sum to $19,909.4 million. Additionally, HD's imputed interest percentage is stated as 16.6%, but the correct value is 12.9% — a notable deviation. MCD’s percentage (29.4%) is correctly reported. (2) Calculation verification: The LLM claims HD’s imputed interest is $1,874M from $11,293M in total lease payments. $1,874 / $11,293 ≈ 16.6%, which matches its stated percentage but contradicts the ground truth of 12.9%. Similarly, MCD: $5,718.6 / $19,445.0 ≈ 29.4% — this calculation is accurate and matches the ground truth. However, the present value figures used for HD and MCD do not align with the correct values that would produce the true combined total of $19,909.4 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The model correctly identifies the need to compute present value after imputed interest for both companies and compare the percentage of imputed interest relative to total lease payments. It structures the response appropriately and attempts synthesis across two companies and multiple financial metrics. However, due to incorrect underlying data, the final conclusion about MCD having higher financing costs, while directionally correct, is based on flawed inputs for HD. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is scored 4 due to major numerical inaccuracies in the core result and one incorrect percentage. Quantitative accuracy is 4 because only MCD’s percentage is correct; HD’s numbers and the total are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 5 — reasoning structure is sound and entities are correctly identified, but synthesis fails due to incorrect data.

However, the LLM claims the combined value is $112,031 million and that it is less than CVS's total cost of $266,871 million, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) The individual numbers used by the LLM are incorrect or misaligned with the knowledge graph: ABT 2024 cost of products sold is stated as $20,584M, but this sum (from cost excluding amortization + amortization) does not align with the expected value in the context where the correct combined total should be part of a $110,153M sum with CVS's segment. More critically, the LLM reports CVS's total cost of products sold as $266,871M (sum of Health Services and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness), but the ground truth states that the total is $110,153M — meaning the LLM has either confused 'cost of products sold' with another metric or used incorrect segment data. The figure $91,447M for CVS’s Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment may be plausible, but when added to $20,584M gives $112,031M, which still does not match the correct total of $110,153M.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key financial figures. The ground truth states the combined segment operating profit is $13,136 million, but the LLM reports $11,948 million. This discrepancy arises because the LLM assigns $3,561 million to RTX and $8,387 million to UPS, whereas the correct values from the knowledge graph are $4,749 million for RTX and $8,387 million for UPS (summing to $13,136 million). RTX's operating profit is thus significantly understated. (2) The calculation of UPS's proportion is accurate: $8,387 / $90,958 ≈ 9.22%, which aligns closely with the ground truth's 9.1% (minor rounding difference acceptable, but 9.22% vs 9.1% is within tolerance). However, RTX's margin is calculated as 5.17% ($3,561 / $68,920), while the correct margin per ground truth is 6.7%, based on the correct profit of $4,749 million and revenue of $70,880 million (not $68,920). The LLM uses incorrect revenue and profit figures for RTX, invalidating the margin. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM attempts to compute combined profit, individual margins, and compare them—but fails due to incorrect input data. It correctly identifies the need to calculate percentages and compare them, showing understanding of the task. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses all parts of the question, uses appropriate financial terminology, and follows logical structure. However, due to major quantitative errors in core financial inputs (RTX's profit and revenue), the correctness score is low. These are not minor discrepancies but material misstatements affecting conclusions. Final scores reflect mostly incorrect numbers (quantitative accuracy 3), partially sound reasoning (qualitative 4), full relevance (8), and overall correctness dragged down by factual inaccuracy (3).",

The ground truth states the combined remaining share repurchase authorization is $19.24 billion, but the LLM reports $10.10 billion. This is a significant quantitative error. The LLM claims NVIDIA had no disclosed share repurchase authorization because it was not mentioned on pages 78–82 of its 10-K, but this does not imply absence of a program—omission from those pages does not equate to no authorization. In reality, as per the knowledge graph, NVDA did have a remaining authorization as of its fiscal year 2022. (2) The TXN figure of $10.10 billion is correct and matches the disclosed remaining authorization under its $12.0 billion program as of December 31, 2021 (TXN's fiscal year-end aligns with calendar year). However, the NVDA component is missing entirely. The correct remaining authorization for NVDA as of its fiscal year ending January 2022 was $9.14 billion. Adding $10.10B (TXN) + $9.14B (NVDA) gives the correct total of $19.24B. The LLM failed to identify NVDA’s authorization, leading to a major calculation error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly infers absence of a repurchase program due to lack of mention in specific pages, rather than searching the full document or recognizing that such authorizations are typically disclosed in notes to financial statements or MD&A. It also fails to synthesize the correct figures from both companies. (4) While the reasoning attempt and focus on relevant documents show contextual understanding (hence a moderate contextual relevance score), the failure on core facts, numbers, and synthesis results in very low correctness and quantitative accuracy scores. The qualitative accuracy is slightly above minimum due to correct identification of TXN's data and attempt at logic.",

According to the ground truth, AMZN had an unrealized net loss of $(13.6) billion and TSLA had an unrealized net gain of $12 million, resulting in a total combined unrealized loss of $(13.588) billion. However, the LLM incorrectly states that AMZN had a $1.3 billion loss (off by a factor of 10) and that TSLA had a $12 million *loss* (when it was actually a *gain*). This leads to a completely incorrect combined figure of $1.312 billion loss instead of the correct $13.588 billion loss. (2) The calculation errors are severe: the AMZN number is wrong by $12.3 billion, and the sign for TSLA’s value is incorrect. These are not formatting or rounding issues but fundamental inaccuracies. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—attempting to combine AMZN and TSLA data and assess impact on financial statements—but fails due to incorrect data inputs. The LLM correctly identifies that AMZN records such items in 'Other income (expense), net,' which affects net income, and that OCI items affect comprehensive income, though it misattributes TSLA’s item as a loss in OCI when the ground truth specifies it as a gain included in comprehensive income. (4) Despite correct mention of financial statement line items and general impact, the severe numerical inaccuracies and mischaracterization of TSLA’s position (gain vs. loss) drastically reduce correctness.

      "original_answer": "At INTC, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years effective January 2023, which reduces annual depreciation expense going forward. This change was influenced by factors such as process technology cadence, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and reuse of machinery across process generations. At CRM, costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized over four years — longer than the typical initial contract period — based on factors including estimated life cycles of offerings and customer attrition. This amortization period directly affects marketing and sales expense on the income statement. Both companies use straight-line depreciation/amortization methods, but the differing amortization periods reflect distinct operational factors: CRM focuses on customer lifecycle and renewal expectations, while INTC considers technological longevity and manufacturing transitions.",
      "llm_answer": "The changes in estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment at Intel (INTC) and amortization periods for capitalized costs at Salesforce (CRM) impact their financial statements by adjusting depreciation/amortization expenses. For INTC, extending the useful life of certain machinery from 5 to 8 years (effective Q1 2023) reduced annual depreciation expense, increasing net income. This decision was influenced by factors like process technology advancements, equipment obsolescence, and re-use across generations. For CRM, capitalized costs (e.g., sales commissions, partner fees) are amortized over four years, reflecting the estimated average period of benefit from contracts, including renewals. This spreads expenses over a longer term, reducing annual amortization costs. Factors influencing CRM’s amortization period include contract lifecycle, customer attrition, and product lifecycle assessments.

The straight-line method is implied by standard practice and consistent with both answers. (3) The reasoning and multi-hop synthesis are sound: the answer correctly attributes INTC’s decision to process technology cadence, equipment reuse, and obsolescence (aligned with 'process technology, changes in machinery tech, reuse across generations'). For CRM, it identifies customer attrition, contract lifecycle, and product lifecycle as drivers—directly matching the original factors. (4) Minor omission: the original specifies that CRM’s amortization affects 'marketing and sales expense,' while the LLM mentions 'spreads expenses' without specifying the line item.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct for UNH but completely incorrect for PFE. The $696 million increase is accurate for UNH, but asserting that PFE had identical dividend amounts and an identical increase is false. The ground truth specifies a $4,200 million decrease for PFE, which the LLM ignores. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the question asks for a contrast between UNH and PFE, but the LLM incorrectly concludes there is no contrast, when in fact the trends are opposite (UNH increased, PFE decreased).

The ground truth is $17,847 million, while the LLM reports $17,606 million. This discrepancy suggests an arithmetic error in summing DUK's total ($6,044M) and NEE's total ($11,562M), which correctly sum to $17,606M — wait, $6,044 + $11,562 = $17,606M, which matches the LLM answer. Rechecking the ground truth: $5,566M (DUK Noncurrent) + $478M (DUK Current, implied: $6,044 - $5,566) + $11,273M (NEE Noncurrent) + $289M (NEE Current: $11,562 - $11,273) = $17,606M. Therefore, the ground truth value of $17,847M appears to be incorrect. The LLM's total of $17,606M is mathematically accurate based on the component values. (2) All individual numbers are correct: DUK's total ($6,044M), Noncurrent ($5,566M), NEE's total ($11,562M), Noncurrent ($11,273M).

(3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data across two companies, computes proportions, and compares them. (4) The LLM answer is semantically equivalent and factually accurate. The only discrepancy is in the combined total, but the LLM's calculation is correct, suggesting the ground truth may have an error. Given this, the LLM should not be penalized. However, since the evaluation must follow the ground truth as authoritative, the $241M difference leads to a slight deduction.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly reports the 2024 and 2023 values for both BA and GE: BA's 2024 value is $1,029 million (up from $956 million in 2023), and GE's 2024 value is $1,231 million (down from $1,241 million in 2023). The combined 2024 value is correctly calculated as $2,260 million ($1,029M + $1,231M), and the combined 2023 value is $2,197 million ($956M + $1,241M), which matches the ground truth. (2) However, the LLM incorrectly states that the 2024 total 'increased by $63 million' when in fact $2,260 million (2024) is greater than $2,197 million (2023) by $63 million, but the ground truth clarifies this is a decrease due to individual declines in both companies' values — BA increased, but GE decreased slightly, and the overall narrative should reflect that the combined value increased numerically, but the ground truth explicitly states it 'represents a decrease', which contradicts the math. Upon rechecking: $2,260 > $2,197, so the combined value actually increased, but the original answer says 'decrease', which is a factual error in the ground truth. However, per evaluation guidelines, we must score against the provided ground truth. Since the ground truth claims it is a decrease, and the LLM says it increased, the LLM contradicts the ground truth. But numerically, the LLM's calculation of a $63M increase is correct: $2,260M - $2,197M = +$63M. The ground truth incorrectly calls this a decrease. Given this, the LLM is mathematically correct, but the ground truth contains an error. However, per instructions, we must evaluate against the ground truth as provided, not correct it. Therefore, the LLM's statement that the total increased contradicts the ground truth's claim of a decrease, resulting in a deduction. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts the correct metric across two years, sums them, and compares. (4) Final scores: Correctness 7 — core numbers are accurate but conclusion on direction of change contradicts ground truth; Quantitative Accuracy 8 — all numbers correct, calculation correct, but interpretation slightly misaligned; Qualitative Accuracy 7 — reasoning is sound but final comparison statement conflicts with ground truth narrative; Contextual Relevance 10 — fully addresses all parts of the question with proper context.",

According to the ground truth, NVIDIA's long-term net deferred tax asset was $1.22 billion, not $176 million as stated in the LLM answer. Texas Instruments' net deferred tax asset was $176 million, which the LLM correctly identifies, but incorrectly applies to both companies. The LLM also claims both companies reported 2021 data, which contradicts the question's focus on fiscal year 2022. (2) The calculation of a $0 million difference is wrong because it is based on the false premise that both companies had equal deferred tax assets. The correct difference is $1.22B - $176M = $1.044B, which the LLM fails to compute. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and compare the respective deferred tax figures from the two companies' 10-K filings for fiscal year 2022. Instead, it incorrectly asserts that both companies reported the same figure and uses outdated data. (4) The correctness score is 1 due to almost complete factual inaccuracy, especially in quantitative values and calculations. Quantitative accuracy is 1 because only Texas Instruments' number is correct, while NVIDIA's is wrong and the difference is miscalculated.

This reflects a strategy of aligning amortization with expected consumer demand and monetization of content, particularly within Amazon Prime memberships. In contrast, TSLA amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to thirty years, indicating a more uniform approach to asset value recognition that does not vary with usage patterns.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several inaccuracies but captures some correct elements. It correctly states that AMZN amortizes video and music content on an accelerated basis based on usage patterns and mentions a weighted average remaining life of 3.1 years, which aligns with demand-sensitive amortization. However, it omits the specific capitalized amount of $19.6 billion as of December 31, 2024, which is a key quantitative fact from the ground truth. Additionally, the claim that AMZN capitalizes costs 'when license fees are determinable' is not in the original answer and introduces unverified criteria. Regarding TSLA, the LLM incorrectly states that TSLA accounts for 'indefinite-lived intangible assets (e.g., digital assets) at fair value' with changes recognized in 'Other income (expense), net.' This detail is not present in the ground truth and appears fabricated; the original only mentions that TSLA amortizes definite-lived intangibles on a straight-line basis over 7–30 years. There is no mention of indefinite-lived intangibles or fair value adjustments in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the missing $19.6 billion figure and the introduction of the 3.1-year weighted average life, which, while plausible, is not in the ground truth and thus cannot be verified. The 7–30 year amortization range for TSLA is correctly stated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing AMZN’s usage-based amortization to TSLA’s straight-line method is valid and leads to reasonable strategic interpretations. However, the reasoning is undermined by the inclusion of unsupported details about TSLA’s accounting for indefinite-lived intangibles, which distorts the comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core comparison of amortization methodologies and infers strategic implications. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct conceptual framing but flawed entity-specific details. Quantitative accuracy is low due to missing and unverified numbers.

It states that PM's pension-related AOCI decreased by $164 million, but the ground truth indicates an increase of $164 million in losses, which is the opposite direction. Similarly, while TGT's $22 million reduction in AOCI loss (from $719M to $697M) is correctly stated, the LLM mischaracterizes it as a decrease in AOCI rather than a reduction in loss, which is semantically incorrect. The combined change is reported as a 'decrease of $186 million', but the correct combined change is an increase of $142 million. The calculation is also wrong: $164M increase (loss) for PM and $22M decrease (gain) for TGT should net to $142M increase in loss, not $186M decrease. (2) Number verification: PM's $164M change is correct in magnitude but wrong in sign; TGT's $22M change is correct in magnitude and direction but misinterpreted in context; combined total is completely incorrect. Fiscal years are inconsistently referenced (e.g., 2023 to 2024 for PM, 2024 to 2025 for TGT) without confirmation from the original answer, which does not specify exact years. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the direction of changes (increase vs decrease in loss) and incorrectly aggregates them. It misunderstands that an increase in 'accumulated other comprehensive loss' means a negative adjustment, and a decrease in loss is positive. The model incorrectly treats both decreases as uniform improvements without recognizing PM actually had worsening pension losses. (4) Correctness score is low due to fundamental errors in financial interpretation and calculation. Quantitative accuracy is poor due to incorrect signs and totals. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the model identifies relevant factors like actuarial gains/losses, but reasoning is unsound.

The ground truth states the combined total minimum lease payments for AMD and CRM is $4,020 million, but the LLM claims it is $4,728 million. The LLM reports AMD's lease payments as $724 million and CRM's as $4,004 million, which do not match the ground truth values (implied as $724 million for AMD and $3,296 million for CRM would already contradict the stated difference). The difference claimed by the LLM is $3,280 million, whereas the ground truth states CRM's total is $2,572 million greater than AMD's. These discrepancies indicate major quantitative errors. (2) Calculations are internally consistent in the LLM answer (e.g., $4,004 - $724 = $3,280), but since the input numbers are wrong, the results are incorrect. The ground truth implies that if the combined total is $4,020 million and CRM's portion is $2,572 million greater than AMD's, then solving algebraically: let x = AMD's payments, so x + (x + 2,572) = 4,020 → 2x = 1,448 → x = 724. Thus, AMD = $724M, CRM = $3,296M. This matches the LLM’s AMD value but not CRM’s (LLM uses $4,004M instead of $3,296M). Therefore, CRM’s value is overstated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the LLM attempts to sum lease obligations across companies and compute differences—but it uses incorrect source data for CRM, possibly due to misaggregating operating and finance leases without proper context or misreading the filing. (4) Despite using a logical structure and citing document pages, the answer fails on factual accuracy. The contextual relevance is high because it addresses both parts of the question and provides sourcing, but correctness is critically undermined by wrong numbers.

The ground truth states a $3.18 billion net cash inflow difference across both companies, but the LLM incorrectly calculates a total of $6.36 billion by doubling the $3.18 billion figure, falsely claiming both Disney and Verizon each had a $3.18 billion net change. This is unsupported by the original answer and introduces fabricated symmetry. While the LLM correctly identifies $3.18 billion as a relevant figure, it misattributes it to each company individually, which is not stated or implied in the ground truth. The breakdown of Disney making $2.3 billion in payments in 2022 and receiving $880 million in 2023 may be factually plausible, but the same claim for Verizon is unsupported and leads to a complete overstatement of the total impact. The reasoning is flawed in both calculation and entity-specific attribution. The answer fails the multi-hop synthesis by incorrectly aggregating company-level data not provided in the original. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to the erroneous doubling of the correct number. Contextual relevance is partially maintained as the topic and metric are correct, but the substance is factually wrong.",

      "question": "How does the difference in estimated useful life of leasehold improvements between HD and MCD potentially affect their long-term depreciation expense strategies?",
      "original_answer": "HD reports an estimated useful life of 5-45 years for leasehold improvements, while MCD depreciates leasehold improvements using the lesser of the asset's useful life or the lease term, which generally includes certain option periods. This difference suggests that HD may adopt a more standardized approach to depreciation over a fixed range, whereas MCD tailors depreciation timelines based on lease agreements. As a result, MCD may experience more variability in annual depreciation expense depending on lease structures, while HD's approach could lead to more predictable long-term expense patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in estimated useful life of leasehold improvements between HD and MCD affects their depreciation strategies as follows: MCD depreciates leasehold improvements over the **lesser of the asset's useful life or the lease term (including option periods)**, while HD amortizes them over the **original lease term or the asset's useful life, whichever is shorter**. If HD's lease terms are shorter than the useful life of improvements, it would recognize higher depreciation expenses initially, whereas MCD's inclusion of option periods could extend the depreciation period, resulting in lower annual expenses. This difference in policy reflects how each company accounts for lease term flexibility, impacting their long-term depreciation expense patterns.",

There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer that conflict, so quantitative accuracy is perfect. However, the original answer emphasizes HD's reported useful life range of 5–45 years, which the LLM omits, and instead introduces the idea that HD amortizes over the 'original lease term'—a detail not present in the ground truth. This misrepresents HD’s policy slightly, as the ground truth does not specify 'original' lease term or mention amortization (depreciation is the correct term). The LLM also suggests HD could have higher initial depreciation if lease terms are short, and MCD lower annual expenses due to extended periods—this is a reasonable inference but not explicitly supported by the ground truth, which focuses on predictability vs. variability rather than comparative expense levels. The reasoning is logical but adds interpretive layers not in the original. The core entities (HD, MCD, leasehold improvements, depreciation policies) are correct, and the answer addresses the impact on long-term strategies with relevant context. Thus, while the answer is largely correct and contextually strong, it misses a key detail (HD’s 5–45 year range) and slightly misstates HD’s policy, warranting a 7 for correctness and qualitative accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "MA's strategy to expand digital payment options, including accelerating digitization and growing acceptance, increases transaction volume across its network. This growth in transaction volume could lead to a decline in credit card borrowing activity, as consumers shift toward alternative payment methods. According to COF's 10-K filing, a decline in consumer borrowing activity, including credit card use, could materially and negatively affect COF's business and financial results. Therefore, while MA benefits from higher transaction volume through its digital payments expansion, this trend may indirectly reduce COF's revenue from credit-related products.",
      "llm_answer": "The expansion of digital payment options by Mastercard (MA) is expected to increase transaction volume by capturing new payment flows, enhancing consumer and business adoption through innovations like Mastercard Installments and blockchain solutions. However, potential negative impacts on financial performance could include higher investment costs in technology development, increased competition from fintechs and alternative payment providers, and risks related to cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and integration challenges from strategic partnerships or acquisitions.

The original answer correctly identifies that MA's expansion of digital payment options increases transaction volume, which in turn reduces consumer credit card borrowing activity, negatively impacting COF's revenue from credit-related products. The LLM answer instead focuses on internal financial risks to MA (e.g., technology costs, cybersecurity, competition), which are not relevant to COF's financial performance as affected by MA's actions. (2) There are no numeric values in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; however, the absence of numbers does not affect scoring since none were present in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires linking MA's digital expansion → higher transaction volume → reduced credit card borrowing → negative impact on COF. The LLM fails this chain, instead discussing MA's own risks rather than the indirect effect on COF. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the LLM does not address the intercompany dynamic between MA and COF as described in the ground truth. While it correctly mentions MA's digital expansion increasing transaction volume, it completely misses the downstream effect on COF’s business model. Thus, despite some topical alignment, the answer fails the essential multi-hop synthesis, warranting a low correctness score.",

AMD reports a significant deferred tax liability of $3,614 million related to acquired intangibles, which contributes heavily to its overall net deferred tax liability of $339 million.

AMD's deferred tax liabilities include **$3,614 million** from acquired intangibles, which offset its deferred tax assets.

The ground truth states Salesforce's net deferred tax asset is $4,770 million, but the LLM reports $3,433 million, which is significantly off. AMD's figures are correct: net deferred tax asset of $339 million and $3,614 million deferred tax liability from acquired intangibles. The difference in net deferred tax positions should be $4,431 million ($4,770M - $339M), but this is not computed or mentioned in the LLM answer. Instead, it incorrectly uses $3,433M, leading to an inaccurate comparison. (2) The calculation of the difference between the two companies' positions is missing entirely. While the LLM correctly identifies AMD’s treatment of acquired intangibles as contributing to its liability, it incorrectly claims Salesforce does not 'explicitly report' deferred tax liabilities from acquired intangibles. In fact, the ground truth indicates Salesforce has $4,428 million in intangible assets from business combinations, which supports its deferred tax asset position—this is a key multi-hop insight the LLM missed. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: it recognizes that acquired intangibles impact deferred tax positions and that differences in treatment contribute to the overall disparity. However, it fails to synthesize that Salesforce’s acquired intangibles actually support deferred tax assets (not liabilities), which is central to explaining the large difference. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies, the correct fiscal years (noting different end dates), and the role of acquired intangibles. However, due to the major numerical inaccuracy and incomplete/misleading analysis of Salesforce’s position, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are limited to 5.

However, the 2019 figures are incorrect. The LLM states NEE’s 2019 figure as $614 million, but the ground truth is $822 million. This leads to an incorrect 2019 sum: $1,047 million (vs. correct $1,255 million). Consequently, the comparison is wrong—the LLM claims the 2021 figure is $47 million higher, but the correct comparison is $161 million *less* in 2021. (2) Number verification: 2021 numbers are accurate. 2019 DUK = $433M (correct), but NEE = $614M (incorrect; should be $822M). The sum error propagates: $433M + $822M = $1,255M (correct), not $1,047M. The difference should be $1,255M - $1,094M = $161M decrease, not a $47M increase. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to sum across companies and years and compare across time, but fails in retrieving the correct 2019 value for NEE, breaking the synthesis. This suggests a data retrieval or entity-year alignment error. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to major quantitative error in 2019 sum and direction of change. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because half the numbers are correct, but key comparison is wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 5—reasoning structure is sound but based on flawed data.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the interest payments for both HD ($1,269 million) and MCD ($1,197.3 million), and their sum ($2,466.3 million) is accurate. HD's net cash from operating activities ($16,571 million) and MCD's ($9,141.5 million) are also correct. However, the question asks how the *combined* interest expense compares to their *combined* net cash from operating activities, which the original answer correctly calculates as ~9.6% ($2,466.3 / $25,712.5). The LLM instead reports individual percentages (HD: ~14.9%, MCD: ~27%), which, while factually correct individually, do not answer the comparative aspect of the question as framed. (2) All numbers are quantitatively accurate, and the sum of interest expenses is correct. The individual percentage calculations are approximately correct: 1,269 / 16,571 ≈ 7.65% (not 14.9%) — this reveals a critical error. Wait: 1,269 / 16,571 ≈ 7.65%, not 14.9%. Similarly, 1,197.3 / 9,141.5 ≈ 13.1%, not 27%. Therefore, the LLM's percentage figures are *doubled* — likely due to a calculation error. This invalidates the quantitative accuracy of the percentages. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails in the final comparison step. While the model retrieves correct individual financial figures, it miscalculates the percentages and does not compute the required combined ratio. This indicates flawed reasoning in the synthesis step. (4) Due to correct raw data but incorrect final calculations and misalignment with the required comparison, the correctness score is 7: core data is right, but key derived metrics are wrong. Quantitative accuracy is 8 because base numbers are correct but derived percentages are not. Qualitative accuracy is 7 due to flawed logic in the comparison.

AMD has a $3 billion revolving credit facility available as of December 28, 2024, while Salesforce has a larger $5 billion revolving credit facility available as of January 31, 2025. With no outstanding borrowings in either case, Salesforce has access to $2 billion more in immediate liquidity, which could provide it with greater capacity to fund strategic initiatives, manage financial shocks, or support operations without needing to raise additional capital.

The comparison of $2 billion difference in available credit is implied through correct values, though not explicitly stated as a calculation. (2) All numeric values and dates are factually correct and match the original answer; no calculation errors are present. Format variations (e.g., $3.0 billion vs $3 billion) are acceptable and semantically equivalent. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that both companies have no outstanding borrowings (implied by 'available' facilities), and thus full amounts are accessible. It logically concludes that Salesforce has greater financial flexibility due to larger capacity. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of explicitly stating the $2 billion difference, which is a small but relevant detail in the original answer. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing financial flexibility in light of available credit. The mention of 'substantial cash reserves' in AMD's case is an addition not in the original, but it does not contradict and adds reasonable context without undermining accuracy.

The difference of $149.25 is therefore not calculated in the LLM answer, missing a key part of the question.

In contrast, V reports a maximum daily settlement exposure of $137.4 billion for fiscal 2024 and holds $7.7 billion in total collateral as of September 30, 2024, to mitigate this risk.

Mastercard (MA) does not provide specific figures for maximum daily exposure or collateral holdings in the provided documents, though it mentions relying on liquidity, cash reserves, and credit facilities to manage settlement exposure.

The ground truth states that the combined interest expense represents 77.7% of DUK's operating cash flow and 14.6% of NEE's, but the LLM reports 19.3% for DUK and 10.9% for NEE. These percentages appear to be calculated using only each company's own interest payment relative to its operating cash flow (e.g., $194/$1,004 ≈ 19.3% for DUK), which is not what the question asks. The question asks how the *combined* interest expense ($780M) compares to each company's operating cash flow individually. Thus, the correct calculations are: $780 / $1,004 ≈ 77.7% for DUK and $780 / $5,358 ≈ 14.6% for NEE. The LLM failed this multi-hop comparison.

      "original_answer": "Boeing's 2023 backlog for 737 and 777X aircraft saw a net ASC 606 adjustment of $20,605 million due to a net decrease in those aircraft, signaling delivery delays or reduced customer commitment. This volatility in the aerospace sector, particularly around key models, likely increases risk for companies indirectly exposed through contracts or assets like Emerson’s $310 million backlog intangible asset with a 3-year estimated useful life. If Emerson’s backlog value is sensitive to sector-specific disruptions similar to Boeing’s, the useful life could be shortened due to reduced predictability or cancellations, especially if aerospace demand weakens. Thus, Boeing’s backlog adjustments suggest potential downward pressure on EMR's asset life estimate.",
      "llm_answer": "The change in Boeing's 2023 backlog for the 737 and 777X programs (increased cumulative firm orders for 737 and 777X) does not directly alter the estimated useful life of Emerson's backlog intangible asset, which is explicitly stated as **3 years** in EMR_10k_2023.pdf (page 52). However, aerospace sector volatility (e.g., certification delays, order cancellations, and regulatory scrutiny) could impact the **collectibility** of Emerson's backlog, potentially requiring adjustments to the asset's carrying value. The useful life assumption of 3 years is based on initial estimates and does not inherently change with Boeing's backlog fluctuations unless new risks materialize that necessitate a reassessment under ASC 606.

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM incorrectly states that Boeing's 2023 backlog for 737 and 777X saw 'increased cumulative firm orders', which directly contradicts the ground truth: Boeing's backlog had a net ASC 606 adjustment of $20,605 million due to a net decrease, indicating delivery delays or reduced customer commitment, not growth. This is a critical factual error. The LLM correctly identifies Emerson's backlog intangible asset as having a 3-year useful life, consistent with the ground truth. (2) In terms of completeness, the LLM addresses the question of useful life but fails to acknowledge the implied risk to the asset's life due to aerospace volatility as suggested in the original answer. Instead, it asserts the useful life 'does not inherently change', which downplays the conditional and risk-sensitive nature of such estimates under ASC 606. (3) Entity accuracy is mostly correct—Boeing (BA), Emerson (EMR), 2023, 737, 777X, and the 3-year useful life are all correctly identified. However, the mischaracterization of Boeing's backlog trend undermines the analysis. (4) Reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly notes that volatility could affect collectibility and carrying value, and that reassessment may occur if risks change. However, it fails to make the multi-hop connection that Boeing's significant backlog deterioration signals increased sector-wide risk, which could prompt a reassessment of useful life for exposed assets like Emerson’s—this is the core inference in the ground truth. The LLM treats the useful life as fixed unless explicitly revised, whereas the original answer emphasizes that such adjustments create 'downward pressure' on the estimate, implying a probabilistic impact. (5) While the LLM cites EMR_10k_2023.pdf and ASC 606 appropriately, its conclusion is overly rigid and misses the nuanced, forward-looking implication of Boeing's data on Emerson’s asset. Semantic equivalence is not achieved due to the contradiction on Boeing’s backlog direction. Thus, the answer is partially correct in context and structure but flawed in key facts and inference.",

TMO explicitly had no impact from such activities.

While both companies use similar methodologies, COST emphasizes the achievement of long-service terms for accelerated vesting and recognizes compensation expense upon such achievement, whereas KO forfeits awards upon termination except under specific circumstances.

While both COST and KO do calculate RSU fair value by subtracting the present value of expected dividends forgone from the market price on the grant/measurement date, the LLM incorrectly states that KO uses a Monte Carlo model and performance-based adjustments. The ground truth confirms that KO uses the closing market price less present value of dividends and applies straight-line expensing over the vesting period—there is no mention of performance conditions or Monte Carlo models. Additionally, the LLM misrepresents KO’s expense recognition as being tied to probability of performance thresholds, which contradicts the original answer stating KO uses straight-line recognition. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers to verify, so quantitative accuracy is assessed based on conceptual financial metrics; however, the incorrect characterization of KO’s methodology undermines accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM invents a performance-based component for KO that does not exist in the ground truth, leading to a flawed comparison. The actual difference lies in post-employment treatment—COST may accelerate expense upon long-service achievement, while KO generally forfeits upon termination—this key distinction is entirely missing. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses RSU fair value and expense timing, but the incorrect details about KO’s methodology severely reduce factual correctness. The answer fabricates performance conditions and models not present in the source, warranting a low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "Capital One's interchange fees in 2021 were offset by $6.4 billion in customer reward expenses. These expenses are deducted directly from interchange fees, as interchange fees are collected by acquirers and paid to issuers like Capital One to reimburse them for costs incurred in providing services to account holders. According to Mastercard's description of the four-party payment system, interchange fees play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits across the network, including for issuers who manage account holder relationships and provide services such as rewards programs. This means that the $6.4 billion in rewards expense reflects a portion of the interchange fees Capital One receives, effectively reducing its net interchange revenue while supporting consumer benefits that drive card usage and merchant acceptance.",
      "llm_answer": "The provided documents do not specify the exact amount of Capital One's interchange fees offset by customer reward expenses in 2021. Mastercard's 10-K explains the four-party payment system's structure, where interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse costs, but it does not link this mechanism to Capital One's specific financial data. Capital One's filings focus on fair value measurements and other financial metrics, without detailing interchange fee offsets related to reward expenses. Thus, the documents do not address the requested figures or their relationship to Mastercard's four-party system.",

The ground truth states that Capital One's interchange fees in 2021 were offset by $6.4 billion in customer reward expenses, but the LLM claims this information is not available in the documents. This is a direct contradiction of the known fact. (2) The quantitative inaccuracy is severe—the correct figure ($6.4 billion) is entirely missing, and no attempt is made to report or calculate it. The LLM incorrectly asserts a lack of data rather than reporting a known value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The question requires linking Capital One's financial data (reward expenses offsetting interchange fees) with Mastercard's explanation of the four-party model. The LLM fails this synthesis, dismissing the connection despite the ground truth establishing a clear relationship: reward expenses are funded from interchange fees, which in turn are part of the economic balance in Mastercard’s four-party system. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer denies the availability of information that exists in the knowledge base. The qualitative accuracy is poor due to incorrect entity-metric linkage and failure to perform required cross-document reasoning. The only partial credit is for correctly describing the general role of interchange fees in the four-party model, but even this is presented as disconnected from the Capital One data.

The ground truth states the combined increase is $676 million, but the LLM calculates $3,465 million ($599M for AMD + $2,866M for CRM), which is over five times higher. These numbers do not align with the ground truth. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports a $599 million increase for AMD and $2,866 million for CRM, but according to the correct answer, the total combined increase is only $676 million, implying neither of these component increases can be correct. Additionally, the note that 'CRM's 2023 figure was inferred from AMD's 2023 data' is illogical and factually unsound—there is no basis to use AMD's data to infer CRM's prior-year values. This invalidates the calculation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: while the model attempts to compute year-over-year changes for each company and sum them, it uses incorrect or fabricated input data.

While it correctly identifies MA's 2023 provision as $539 million and MA's 2021 provision as $94 million, it incorrectly reports V's 2023 provision as $1,045 million instead of the correct $108 million. This leads to a grossly inflated combined 2023 total of $1,584 million instead of the correct $647 million. The comparison to MA's 2021 provision is therefore also wrong: the LLM claims the combined amount is 'approximately 17 times higher' (1,584 / 94 ≈ 16.85), while the correct ratio is about 6.88 times higher (647 / 94 ≈ 6.88), and the correct increase is $553 million, not $1,490 million. (2) Number verification: MA 2023 = $539M (correct), V 2023 = $1,045M (incorrect, should be $108M), combined = $1,584M (incorrect, should be $647M), MA 2021 = $94M (correct). Calculations of sum and comparison are based on wrong inputs and thus invalid. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and two years, but due to the incorrect value for V, the synthesis fails. The logic structure is sound (summing provisions and comparing across years), but the factual foundation is flawed. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major numerical errors despite partial entity and year accuracy. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) due to wrong dollar amounts and resulting incorrect comparisons. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the model understands the task structure and entities involved.

      "original_answer": "Boeing's delays and increased costs related to the Starliner Crewed Flight Test (CFT), including a $288 increase in reach-forward loss due to parachute supplier issues and a further $523 increase due to schedule delays and testing costs, contributed to production and supply chain disruptions. These disruptions are part of the broader aerospace industry challenges that GE Aerospace explicitly monitors, particularly in relation to its significant business with Boeing. GE Aerospace noted that challenges affecting Boeing, such as production issues, could impact demand, order timing, and payments. In response, GE aligned production expectations with Boeing and assessed potential business impacts, investing in manufacturing and supply chain improvements to mitigate disruptions.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's delays and increased costs related to the Starliner CFT, as noted in GE Aerospace's 2024 10-K filings, likely prompted adjustments to GE's production alignment and risk mitigation strategies. The delays and higher testing/certification costs associated with the CFT (e.g., propulsion system anomalies, schedule delays) would necessitate GE to reassess production timelines and resource allocation, particularly for related aerospace projects. GE's risk mitigation strategies likely include enhanced supply chain monitoring, increased contingency planning for supplier-related disruptions, and proactive adjustments to production schedules to account for external delays, as seen in similar programs like the KC-46A Tanker.

However, it fails to include the specific quantitative impacts from the ground truth: the $288 million increase in reach-forward loss due to parachute supplier issues and the $523 million increase from schedule delays and testing costs. These figures are critical to the original answer and were omitted entirely, making the response factually incomplete. (2) No numeric values from the ground truth are mentioned or accurately reflected in the LLM answer, resulting in a low quantitative accuracy score. The LLM mentions 'higher testing/certification costs' and 'delays' but provides no dollar amounts or references to the specific financial impacts disclosed in Boeing’s filings that would affect GE’s planning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure—connecting Boeing’s program issues to GE’s risk mitigation strategies—and the LLM correctly infers that GE would adjust production alignment and supply chain monitoring. It also appropriately cites GE’s business interdependence with Boeing as a rationale for strategic adjustments. However, it does not establish the explicit causal chain from Boeing’s specific financial losses to GE’s operational responses using the documented figures, weakening the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer stays focused on the aerospace segment, GE’s risk mitigation, and production alignment. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because while the logic and entities (Boeing, GE Aerospace, Starliner CFT, KC-46A) are correct, the absence of key financial data from Boeing’s disclosures limits the depth and factual fidelity of the response.

In contrast, Texas Instruments (TXN) reported no material accruals or payments related to product warranties or liabilities during the same period, indicating minimal financial impact from warranty claims. This contrast highlights that while NVDA's complex product design and global supply chain exposed it to higher warranty-related financial risk in 2022, TXN's operations and product reliability resulted in negligible warranty costs, leading to a more favorable financial position in this regard.",

In contrast, NVDA’s disclosures highlight risks of potential warranty expenses due to product defects, though no specific 2022 figures are provided.

This part of the answer is fully accurate. However, the LLM incorrectly states that EMR's backlog data is not available, when in fact the ground truth confirms EMR's backlog is $310 million. Therefore, the failure to compute the $19,559 million difference between BA's ($19,869M) and EMR's ($310M) backlog represents a critical omission. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high because the numbers and calculation for BA's backlog growth are correct, but the missing comparison value ($19,869M - $310M = $19,559M greater) results in incomplete quantitative coverage. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: the model must compare BA and EMR backlogs across companies and compute the difference, but it claims insufficient data instead of retrieving or using the provided EMR figure. This breaks the multi-hop logic required. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses one part fully and acknowledges the second, but incorrectly dismisses it due to perceived lack of data.

In contrast, COST's selling, general and administrative expenses are more exposed to external economic factors like inflationary pressures, commodity price volatility (including gasoline and consumables), and tariff impacts, which could affect its cost structure.

However, the LLM incorrectly introduces external factors like foreign currency exchange fluctuations and commodity price volatility as contributors to KO's SG&A increase, which are not mentioned in the original answer for KO—these are specific to COST. The original answer emphasizes KO's increase as driven by internal factors (advertising, charitable donations, employee benefits), not external ones. Additionally, the LLM omits KO's increased charitable donations, a specific internal factor noted in the ground truth. For COST, the LLM correctly identifies inflationary pressures and commodity price volatility as external factors, but adds 'labor costs and employee retention' as internal factors without support in the original answer, which focuses on external macroeconomic exposures.

However, it contradicts the ground truth by stating that Texas Instruments does not disclose revenue from Gaming-related products, whereas the original answer asserts that 20% of Texas Instruments' revenue comes from such products. This discrepancy indicates a factual conflict — either the knowledge graph contains data not found in the 10-K (e.g., inferred or categorized gaming revenue), or the LLM is incorrectly asserting non-disclosure. Since the ground truth explicitly states 20%, the LLM's denial of this data source constitutes a significant factual omission. (2) Quantitatively, the $1.7 billion figure is accurate and correctly attributed to Microsoft's fiscal year 2024, satisfying that portion of the question. The 20% figure for Texas Instruments is missing entirely in the LLM response, leading to partial quantitative completeness. (3) The reasoning for Microsoft is sound and reflects proper extraction from the 10-K. For Texas Instruments, the LLM may be applying strict segment-label matching (i.e., no segment named 'Gaming'), but fails to acknowledge that product-level revenue could still be classified under broader segments (e.g., Analog or Embedded) and reported elsewhere (e.g., in product category breakdowns). Thus, the multi-hop synthesis is incomplete — it fails to connect potential gaming-related product lines to revenue even if not a formal segment.

The individual operating income figures for MMM ($5,001M) and UNP ($9,713M) are both incorrect. According to the ground truth, MMM's operating income as a percentage of sales is 18.8%, not 20.6%, and UNP's operating income as a percentage of total operating revenues is 28.0%, not 39.9%. These percentage miscalculations stem from incorrect base values and flawed arithmetic. (2) The LLM claims MMM's total sales are $24,272 million and sums segment operating incomes incorrectly—these figures do not align with the knowledge graph. For UNP, operating income is calculated as $24,250M - $14,537M = $9,713M, which is mathematically correct but based on incorrect input data; the actual operating income should be around $6,790M (28% of $24,250M), indicating the source data used by the LLM is inaccurate.

This change aims to provide a more accurate representation of revenue per unique person rather than per user account. In contrast, AT&T experienced an increase in broadband ARPU in 2023 due to the expiration of prior-year promotional pricing, showing a direct financial benefit from pricing adjustments.

In contrast, AT&T's increase in broadband ARPU, driven by promotional pricing, highlights a strategy to boost revenue per user through targeted pricing tactics (e.g., discounts for new customers or bundled services) while maintaining or improving margins.

This could materially and adversely affect MA’s profitability, especially if larger merchants continue to negotiate lower interchange rates and demand more concessions, as MA acknowledges in its risk factors.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not synthesize information for both companies as required. The question explicitly asks for the difference between PFE and UNH, which requires data from both firms. By omitting UNH's data, the LLM fails the core multi-hop requirement.

      "original_answer": "Eli Lilly paid $3.35 billion in 2024 (which reflects 2023 activity timing) for acquired IPR&D related to Morphic and an additional $947.7 million for a manufacturing site in Wisconsin, totaling $4.30 billion. Pfizer paid $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 for employee termination costs associated with its Realigning our Cost Base Program and $587 million for integration and other costs related to the acquisition of Seagen, totaling $2.09 billion. Together, the two companies spent $6.39 billion on business development activities in 2023, reflecting Eli Lilly’s focus on innovation through acquisitions and Pfizer’s emphasis on restructuring and integrating strategic acquisitions.",

It states Eli Lilly paid $3,799.8 million (~$3.8 billion), but the ground truth is $4.30 billion ($3.35B + $947.7M), so the figure is incorrect and lacks breakdown by acquisition and manufacturing site. The LLM also fails to provide Pfizer’s total business development spending, which is available in the ground truth ($2.09B), instead saying it is 'not explicitly stated.' This is incorrect — the components ($1.5B + $587M) are specified in the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the sum for Lilly is wrong, and Pfizer’s total is missing entirely. No correct combined total ($6.39B) is given. The format variation ($3.8B vs $3,799.8M) is acceptable, but the number itself does not match any actual component or sum in the truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present — the model identifies both companies and some activities (e.g., IPR&D for Lilly, Seagen acquisition for Pfizer) — but fails to synthesize the full picture. It misses that Eli Lilly’s $3.35B was for Morphic and that the Wisconsin site purchase was separate, and it overlooks Pfizer’s $1.5B restructuring cost, which is a major part of its 2023 business development outlay. (4) Contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses strategic priorities (Lilly on R&D, Pfizer on acquisitions), but the qualitative analysis lacks depth and is not fully supported by accurate data. Overall, the answer is partially correct in direction but fails on key facts and synthesis, warranting a mid-low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "BKNG's financial results depend heavily on travel services, which fluctuate with consumer discretionary spending levels. Similarly, SBUX, as a retailer, is also dependent on consumer discretionary spending, making both companies vulnerable to economic downturns. During periods of macroeconomic uncertainty, consumers may reduce discretionary purchases, leading to decreased transaction growth rates and lower revenues for BKNG, while SBUX may experience reduced customer traffic and average value per transaction, both negatively impacting their financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Both BKNG and SBUX rely heavily on consumer discretionary spending, making their financial performance vulnerable to economic downturns. During periods of uncertainty, reduced consumer spending directly impacts BKNG's travel services and SBUX's retail coffee sales, leading to lower revenues and margin pressures.

It correctly states that reduced spending during economic uncertainty impacts BKNG's travel services and SBUX's retail sales, leading to lower revenues. However, it adds elements not present in the original answer—specifically 'labor cost increases, supply chain disruptions, and competition for talent'—as shared vulnerabilities that 'exacerbate' the discretionary spending risk. These are plausible operational risks but are not mentioned in the ground truth and were not part of the multi-hop reasoning supported by the knowledge graph, making them extraneous and potentially misleading in the context of the specific question about sensitivity to discretionary spending. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; the score of 10 reflects no errors in this dimension. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly links BKNG to travel services and SBUX to retail, both dependent on discretionary spending. However, it goes beyond the source information by introducing additional shared risks not validated by the knowledge graph, weakening the fidelity of the synthesis.

However, based on the ground truth, these values must be different (likely Microsoft ~$22.615 billion and Texas Instruments ~$20.3 billion, or similar), indicating at least one entity's repurchase amount is wrong. (2) The calculation itself (addition of two numbers) is logically sound, but the inputs are factually inaccurate, leading to an incorrect total.

DIS also uses a 10-year window for theatrical films but includes imputed license fees for content used on owned DTC services in its Ultimate Revenues.

TMO's non-U.S. carryforwards include $419 million that expire between 2025 and 2041, with the remainder having no expiration. This difference in expiration terms implies that TMO has more permanent flexibility with a larger portion of its losses, whereas DHR must strategically utilize the expiring portion before deadlines.

However, it incorrectly states that the non-U.S. portion for DHR is 'unspecified' or 'not explicitly disclosed,' which contradicts the ground truth that DHR's non-U.S. NOL is $427 million — the full amount attributed to DHR in the original answer. This leads to an incorrect combined total: the LLM fails to sum $1.18B + $427M = $1.607B, omitting DHR’s contribution from the final combined figure. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: $1.18 billion for TMO and $427 million for DHR match the ground truth values.

The ground truth states the combined 2024 production cost for COP and XOM across all consolidated operations is $20,996 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $25,369 million. This error arises because the LLM incorrectly includes both consolidated and equity affiliate costs for both companies, whereas the question specifically asks for 'consolidated operations' only. According to the ground truth, only consolidated figures should be summed: COP's $7,899 million and XOM's $15,516 million, which correctly sum to $23,415 million — still not matching the ground truth of $20,996 million, suggesting possible data discrepancies or misattribution. However, the LLM’s total of $25,369 million is clearly wrong as it adds equity affiliate costs ($543M + $1,411M) unnecessarily. Furthermore, the comparison to XOM's 2023 equity company cost ($1,411 million) is valid in intent, but the LLM fails to compute the actual difference, stating only that it is 'significantly higher' without providing the $19,585 million difference as required. (2) Number verification: COP consolidated = $7,899M (correct in source), XOM consolidated = $15,516M (correct), sum should be $23,415M — not $20,996M (ground truth) nor $25,369M (LLM). This suggests either the ground truth has an error or incorrect data was used. However, since the evaluation must follow the ground truth, and the LLM’s inputs and sum are inconsistent with it, the score is low. The LLM also incorrectly presents COP's total as $8,442M (consolidated + equity), which is not relevant to the question. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies the correct companies (COP and XOM), correct year (2024), and correct metric (production cost excluding taxes), but fails to filter for 'consolidated operations' only, instead mixing in equity affiliate data. It also references XOM's 2023 equity cost correctly but does not perform the required numerical comparison. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 2 due to major numerical inaccuracy and flawed calculation. Quantitative accuracy is 2 because most numbers are misapplied or incorrectly summed. Qualitative accuracy is 3 because reasoning structure is present but flawed in key filters and synthesis.

While MET's amortized cost of $89,812 million is correct, the LLM incorrectly includes equity securities in the calculation for V, which the question does not ask for. The question specifically asks for 'available securities' in the context of amortized cost, and the ground truth confirms this refers only to debt securities at amortized cost ($5,412 million), not equity securities. The LLM adds $5,412 million (debt) + $1,156 million (non-marketable equity) + $301 million (marketable equity) = $6,869 million, which is not supported by the original answer or standard financial reporting practices for amortized cost of available-for-sale securities. (2) The calculation is therefore incorrect: $89,812 million + $6,869 million = $96,681 million vs. the correct $89,812 million + $5,412 million = $95,224 million. The LLM misidentifies the scope of 'available securities' for Visa, leading to a material overstatement. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly identifying MET and V, their reporting dates, and pulling numbers from specific pages—but fails in synthesis by including irrelevant categories (equity securities) not aligned with the amortized cost of debt securities. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the structure and intent match the question, and MET's data is accurate. However, due to the incorrect inclusion of equity securities and resulting miscalculation, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are significantly reduced.",

The ground truth states that the combined finished goods inventory for NVDA and TXN in 2022 is $1,720 million, with NVDA showing a $385 million increase and TXN a -$213 million change (i.e., a decrease). However, the LLM claims the 2022 data is not available and incorrectly uses 2021 data (both companies at $598 million), which does not align with the ground truth. The sum of $598M + $598M = $1,196M is not $1,720M, so the combined value is wrong. (2) The LLM references inventory changes from 2020 to 2021 ($45M for NVDA, $46M for TXN), but the question asks for the change in *finished goods* from 2021 to 2022, which the LLM admits is not available. This is a critical failure in multi-hop reasoning, as the model fails to retrieve or compute the correct year-over-year change. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the model assumes 2021 data can proxy for 2022, and incorrectly infers that TXN had a higher increase, when in fact NVDA had a significant increase and TXN had a decrease. The model also confuses total inventories with *finished goods*, a specific subcategory, undermining entity and metric accuracy. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the model attempts to address the question and mentions relevant companies and timeframes, but the factual inaccuracies and incorrect assumptions severely limit usefulness. The qualitative failure to synthesize correct multi-hop data across years and entities results in a low overall score.",

In 2023, MCD paid $56.1 million in variable rent for company-operated restaurants and $261.4 million for franchised restaurants, directly tying lease costs to sales performance. In contrast, LOW disclosed that variable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices were not significant for any of the periods presented, indicating minimal exposure to sales-linked lease costs.

In contrast, LOW's variable lease costs are primarily tied to fixed factors like common area maintenance and real estate taxes, with minimal variable rent linked to sales performance.

It accurately states that MCD has variable rent tied to sales (especially for franchises), increasing its risk, while LOW's variable rent is tied to fixed factors like maintenance and taxes, not sales. This aligns with the ground truth and shows sound reasoning. (2) However, the LLM answer fails to include the specific quantitative data from the original answer—namely, the exact variable rent payments for MCD in 2023: $56.1 million for company-operated restaurants and $261.4 million for franchised restaurants. These numbers are central to the ground truth and were omitted, significantly reducing quantitative accuracy. There are no incorrect numbers, but the absence of key figures from the knowledge graph limits completeness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is logically sound: the model correctly synthesizes that sales-linked rent increases exposure to performance risk and contrasts MCD’s structure with LOW’s. It correctly infers LOW’s minimal exposure based on the lack of sales-based variable rent. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer directly addresses the question about differences in risk exposure through lease structures. The qualitative accuracy is strong due to correct entity identification (MCD, LOW), accurate characterization of lease types, and valid comparison. The correctness score is 7 because while the core factual claim and reasoning are correct, the omission of specific financial figures from the ground truth prevents a higher score, as those numbers are essential to fully answering the multi-hop question with evidentiary support.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing (BA) faces significant backlog volatility due to its exposure to the Chinese market, where geopolitical tensions, such as ongoing U.S.-China trade disputes and tariffs, could lead to order cancellations or delivery delays for aircraft like the 777X, 737-7, and 737-10. This creates uncertainty in their contractual backlog, which saw an increase in 2023 largely due to growth in BCA and BDS segments. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) treats backlog as a finite-lived intangible asset valued at $310 million with a useful life of 3 years, indicating a more stable and predictable revenue stream associated with backlog. This suggests that EMR is less directly impacted by geopolitical volatility compared to Boeing, whose backlog is more sensitive to external macroeconomic and political factors such as trade restrictions and customer delivery assumptions in China.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson (EMR) classifies backlog as a component of intangible assets with a short estimated useful life (1–3 years), reflecting its integration into operational contracts and amortization. Boeing (BA), however, reports backlog as part of its contractual obligations without categorizing it as an intangible asset, emphasizing its operational and revenue recognition risks. EMR’s treatment suggests lower sensitivity to geopolitical disruptions like U.S.-China trade tensions, as backlog is amortized and less tied to specific markets. In contrast, BA’s significant backlog in China (noted in its backlog disclosure) exposes it to higher volatility from trade tensions, as delays or cancellations in China could directly impact revenue and cash flow.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers and financial treatments are correct: EMR's backlog is correctly identified as a finite-lived intangible asset valued at $310 million with a 3-year useful life (the LLM generalizes this as 1–3 years, which is acceptable and consistent with amortization practices). Boeing’s lack of intangible asset classification for backlog is accurately portrayed. (2) The LLM correctly contrasts EMR’s stable, amortized backlog treatment with Boeing’s operational and revenue-linked backlog, which is exposed to geopolitical risks—particularly in China. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects accounting treatment (intangible asset vs. contractual obligation) to business model sensitivity (predictable revenue vs. delivery/cancellation risk), and links Boeing’s China exposure to U.S.-China trade tensions affecting specific aircraft models (implied by context, though models like 777X, 737-7, 737-10 are not explicitly named—minor omission).

Additionally, the LLM incorrectly calculates Capital One's key credit quality indicator as 2.06% based on a calculation of $26M / $1.263B, which is not supported by the ground truth. The original answer does not provide a specific percentage for Capital One but instead emphasizes that Capital One uses delinquency trends as its key indicator—this qualitative focus is misrepresented as a quantitative metric. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is mathematically correct ($26M / $1.263B ≈ 2.06%), but there is no evidence in the ground truth that this number represents Capital One's 'key credit quality indicator' or that it was derived this way.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is mostly correct in conveying the audit procedures used by Duke Energy (DUK) and Southern Company Gas (SO) to evaluate the recoverability of regulatory assets, with accurate recognition of the subjective nature involved. It correctly identifies DUK's use of trend analyses, legal counsel input for coal ash-related obligations, and comparison to independent expectations. It also notes SO's focus on regulatory filings and internal controls. However, there are minor inaccuracies and omissions in qualitative details: the LLM incorrectly states that SO assesses 'actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rates) for postretirement benefits,' which is not mentioned in the ground truth and introduces a new, unsupported element. The ground truth specifies that SO evaluates intervenor challenges and tests completeness/accuracy of capitalized project costs—details missing in the LLM response. Conversely, the LLM omits DUK's 'inquiries to management regarding changes in regulatory orders' and SO's specific testing of project cost accuracy. Both companies' reliance on external regulatory orders, intervenor filings, and management representations is partially reflected but not fully articulated. There are no numerical values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10 by default. The reasoning is logically structured and contextually relevant, but the substitution of SO's actual procedures with actuarial assumptions reduces qualitative accuracy. Overall, core facts are present, but some key audit steps are misattributed or missing, warranting a 7 for correctness.",

The LLM incorrectly claims that HD's data is missing, when in fact it should have been available in the context the model was expected to have access to. The dollar values in the ground truth are $11,762 million for HD and $6,747 million for LOW, with a difference of $5,015 million — all of which the LLM fails to report due to the erroneous assertion of missing data. (2) No correct numbers are provided; the LLM does not attempt any calculation and incorrectly denies the availability of HD's data. The only correct number mentioned is LOW's 8.1%, but even this is used in an incomplete and misleading context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails completely: the model must compare percentage contributions and dollar values between two companies (HD and LOW) for the same fiscal year. By incorrectly claiming data unavailability, it avoids the required synthesis. The correct answer requires pulling both companies' Lumber Sales and Net Sales figures and computing percentages and differences.

The derived surpluses ($26,323 million and $594 million) are accurate calculations (27,777 - 1,454 = 26,323; 5,942 - 5,782 = 160 — wait, this reveals an error: 5,942 - 5,782 = 160, not 594). This is a critical calculation error. Despite correct input numbers, the LLM incorrectly states Thermo Fisher's surplus as $594 million when it should be $160 million. This affects quantitative accuracy. However, the main comparison — that both companies issued more than they repaid — remains valid. Given this, the error is significant but does not invalidate the core conclusion. Re-evaluating: the combined issuance and individual repayments are correct, and the overall comparison to repayments is directionally accurate. The incorrect surplus calculation for Thermo Fisher is a factual error in derived numbers. Therefore, while entity and primary data accuracy are perfect, the quantitative accuracy is reduced due to the incorrect difference. Correctness score should reflect this miscalculation. Final assessment: the answer reports all source numbers correctly and reaches the right high-level conclusion, but contains a material arithmetic error in the surplus calculation for Thermo Fisher (5,942 - 5,782 = 160, not 594).

While DHR's negative 0.5% impact and 31.0% non-GAAP growth are correct, TMO's acquisition/divestiture impact is stated as +5% in the LLM answer but is +3% in the ground truth. More critically, the LLM claims TMO's organic growth (non-GAAP) is 15%, but this contradicts both the ground truth (23%) and the internal logic — it incorrectly states GAAP growth was 21% and implies non-GAAP is lower at 15%, when non-GAAP should be higher due to positive acquisition impact. This reverses the actual relationship. (2) Calculation verification: DHR's GAAP to non-GAAP adjustment is plausible (33.0% - 0.5% = 32.5%, not 31.0%, so even this has a 0.5% discrepancy). TMO's calculation (21% GAAP to 15% non-GAAP after +5% acquisition boost) is logically impossible — adding positive impact should increase, not decrease, growth. Correct logic would be GAAP growth minus acquisition impact = organic, but the numbers still don't align. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present — the model attempts to compare DHR and TMO and synthesize effects on organic growth — but the flawed numbers undermine the conclusion. The combined effect is misrepresented due to incorrect inputs. (4) Scores reflect that while the answer addresses the right entities (DHR, TMO, 2021, non-GAAP growth), and shows intent to perform multi-hop analysis, the quantitative inaccuracies (especially TMO's 15% vs 23% and +5% vs +3%) are severe enough to mislead.

      "original_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive evaluates indefinite-life intangible assets using either a qualitative or quantitative analysis, with discount rates derived from high-quality bond yield curves and cash flow projections based on long-term return expectations. Mondelez, on the other hand, applied a market-based weighted-average cost of capital of 7.1% for Europe and North America and a risk-rated rate of 10.1% for Latin America and AMEA, leading to $26 million in impairment charges for a chocolate brand in North America and a biscuit brand in Europe. This contrast reveals that while both companies use similar valuation methodologies involving discount rates and cash flow projections, Mondelez's specific exposure to food brands—particularly chocolate and biscuits—resulted in actual impairments, highlighting higher sector-specific risks in the food category within the broader consumer staples industry.",

In 2023, it recorded $26M in impairment charges for chocolate and biscuit brands, reflecting sensitivity to discount rate changes and market conditions. Mondelez, meanwhile, also used DCF and relief-from-royalty methods, but its 2023 charges ($26M) were tied to specific brands, with thirteen global brands at risk due to fair value margins within 10% of book value.

Colgate-Palmolive does not report such charges or specific rates in this context. The LLM reverses the companies' roles: it states Colgate used those rates and recorded the $26M impairment, which is false. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $26M figure is correct in amount but misassigned to the wrong company and incorrect business units (Colgate does not have chocolate and biscuit brands with such impairments). The discount rates of 7.1% and 10.1% are correctly stated numerically but wrongly attributed to Colgate instead of Mondelez. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize information across entities. It conflates Mondelez’s impairment charges and discount rate methodology with Colgate-Palmolive’s asset evaluation approach. The ground truth emphasizes that Colgate uses qualitative/quantitative analysis with bond yield curves, while Mondelez uses WACC and risk-rated rates—this distinction is lost. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer discusses sector-specific risks (economic volatility, consumer preferences) which aligns with the broader theme, but the incorrect attribution of data undermines the validity of the comparison. While the general discussion of DCF and impairment testing is relevant, the core factual inversion (switching company-specific details) results in a mostly incorrect answer.

The note that 'the document does not specify quantifiable financial consequences for TI' is a reasonable inference and reflects a correct contrast with Intel’s more defined cost drivers. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes Intel’s specific, measurable goal with cost implications and contrasts it with TI’s less quantified regulatory risks.

      "original_answer": "Pfizer faces financial damages primarily through patent-related legal risks, such as third-party challenges to its intellectual property and potential invalidation of patents, which could lead to early generic competition and loss of product exclusivity, especially for high-value branded products. These risks are compounded by ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions and the potential retroactive impact of decisions like the Brazilian Supreme Court's invalidation of Article 40 of Brazil's Patent Law. UnitedHealth Group, on the other hand, is exposed to damages through regulatory audits and investigations, particularly risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits by CMS, which can result in retrospective payment adjustments, fines, or corrective action plans. These exposures stem from its role as a government contractor managing Medicare and Medicaid plans, where accurate health status coding directly affects capitation payments. Both companies face damages, but through distinct mechanisms: Pfizer through intellectual property disputes affecting revenue from pharmaceutical products, and UnitedHealth through regulatory compliance risks tied to government health programs.",

Additionally, the LLM introduces elements not present in the ground truth—such as data privacy (GDPR, HIPAA), cybersecurity vulnerabilities, antitrust/anti-kickback laws, and FDA delays—which, while plausible, are not supported as primary financial exposure mechanisms in the 2022 10-K filings per the knowledge graph. These additions dilute the accuracy of the synthesis. There are no numerical values in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. The reasoning is logically structured and multi-hop in nature, correctly differentiating risk mechanisms by business model, but misses precise linkages required for full factual fidelity. Thus, the answer is largely correct in direction and framework but lacks specificity on key risk mechanisms, warranting a 7 for correctness and qualitative accuracy.",

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the LLM incorrectly infers that Capital One has higher credit risk due to a 'higher ratio', when in fact Capital One reported no nonperforming loans (0.00%), indicating lower risk. The conclusion about credit risk management is therefore the opposite of the truth.

      "original_answer": "Amgen faces regulatory-driven pricing pressures stemming from Medicaid rebates, 340B statutory rates, and state-level actions by PDABs in seven U.S. states, as well as international measures such as mandatory price controls, price referencing, and cost-effectiveness assessments in the EU and other markets. These pressures directly affect sales and profitability by limiting pricing flexibility and potentially reducing product usage. In contrast, Thermo Fisher Scientific faces inflation-driven pricing pressures due to elevated inflation rates in the U.S. and other key markets, which increase costs and create downward pressure on gross margins. Additionally, economic instability raises the risk of excess and obsolete inventory, directly impacting inventory management and related financial metrics. The differences in source and impact reflect Amgen's exposure to healthcare-specific regulatory frameworks and Thermo Fisher's sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions affecting broader industrial markets.",
      "llm_answer": "Amgen's pricing pressures stem from reimbursement constraints, biosimilar competition, and regulatory changes like the IRA's mandatory price-setting for drugs starting in 2026, which directly impact gross margins through rebates, discounts, and formulary restrictions. Inventory risk arises from potential price cuts and obsolescence under the IRA. In contrast, Thermo Fisher faces pricing pressures linked to inflation, supply chain disruptions, and economic conditions, which increase inventory risk due to demand volatility and cost pressures but are less directly tied to gross margin erosion as described in Amgen's filings.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the sources of pricing pressures for both companies and links them to financial impacts, but contains some inaccuracies and omissions compared to the ground truth. For Amgen, the LLM correctly notes regulatory-driven pressures including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and reimbursement constraints, which aligns with the original answer’s emphasis on Medicaid rebates, 340B pricing, and PDABs. However, it omits specific details such as state-level PDABs in seven U.S. states and international mechanisms like price referencing and cost-effectiveness assessments in the EU. The mention of biosimilar competition is not present in the original answer and may conflate competitive dynamics with pricing pressure sources. For Thermo Fisher, the LLM correctly identifies inflation and macroeconomic conditions as drivers, consistent with the original answer, but adds 'supply chain disruptions' and 'demand volatility'—while plausible, these are not explicitly cited in the ground truth as direct sources of pricing pressure. (2) There are no numerical values, dates, or calculations in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised; the mention of '2026' for IRA implementation is contextually reasonable and does not contradict known facts. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly distinguishes between regulatory (Amgen) and macroeconomic (Thermo Fisher) sources and connects them to gross margin and inventory risk. However, it overemphasizes the IRA's role in inventory obsolescence for Amgen, which is less directly supported in the original answer, and underrepresents the international dimension of Amgen’s pricing pressures. The contrast between healthcare-specific regulation and industrial-market macroeconomic sensitivity—central to the original answer—is implied but not fully articulated. (4) The correctness score is 7 because core facts about the sources and financial impacts are accurate, but there are notable omissions and slight misattributions.

However, it contains a critical error in reporting MCD's net sales as $25.5 billion with a 10% increase, which contradicts the ground truth that does not mention MCD's net sales growth or specific net sales figure. The ground truth emphasizes MCD's strategic success via 'Accelerating the Arches' and strong segment performance but does not provide net sales figures, making the LLM's $25.5 billion and 10% growth factually unsupported. Additionally, the ground truth attributes LOW's 11.0% net sales decline partly to the divestiture of its Canadian business, a key structural reason omitted in the LLM answer, which instead attributes the decline solely to macroeconomic factors. 2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised: while the 4.7% and 9.0% comparable sales figures are correct, the MCD net sales figure and growth rate are not verifiable from the ground truth and appear fabricated or misattributed. LOW's 11.0% net sales decline is correctly stated, but the LLM adds that net earnings rose 20.0%, which is absent in the ground truth and cannot be verified. 3) The reasoning is logically structured and synthesizes contrasting strategies well—LOW's cost optimization vs. MCD's growth execution—demonstrating sound qualitative multi-hop reasoning. The strategic drivers for MCD (digital, expansion, menu innovation) are consistent with the ground truth's mention of 'Accelerating the Arches.' However, the failure to incorporate the Canadian divestiture as a causal factor for LOW's sales decline weakens the completeness of the analysis. 4) Despite quantitative inaccuracies, the answer remains contextually relevant and effectively contrasts business outcomes and strategic execution.

      "original_answer": "Capital One (COF) identifies interchange fees as a key revenue source that is under pressure from regulatory caps, litigation, and merchant negotiations, such as the 2016 agreements where large merchants secured lower interchange rates. These pressures could reduce the interchange fees that acquirers pay to issuers like Capital One, which in turn affects the calculation of the merchant discount rate set by acquirers in MasterCard’s (MA) four-party network. In MA’s model, the merchant discount rate considers the interchange fee, which is paid by acquirers to issuers. If interchange fees are reduced due to regulatory or market forces, acquirers may adjust the merchant discount rate accordingly to maintain profitability, potentially altering the revenue dynamics for both acquirers and issuers within MA’s network.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One's (COF) interchange fee dynamics, particularly the pressure from merchants to reduce fees through litigation, regulation, and alternative payment systems, directly impact MasterCard's (MA) core network transaction model. Lower interchange fees reduce MA's revenue, which is a critical component of its four-party network structure. This, in turn, affects the merchant discount rate—set by acquirers to cover costs including interchange fees—potentially lowering acquirers' profitability and incentivizing merchants to adopt lower-cost payment methods.

It correctly identifies that pressure on interchange fees from merchants, regulation, and litigation impacts MasterCard's revenue and network model. The answer also appropriately links lower interchange fees to potential adjustments in the merchant discount rate and acquirer profitability. However, it inaccurately states that 'lower interchange fees reduce MA's revenue'—this is a key error. In MasterCard's model, interchange fees are paid directly from acquirers to issuers (like Capital One), not to MasterCard itself. MA earns network fees and assessments, which may be indirectly affected, but interchange is not direct revenue for MA. The original answer correctly explains that the impact is on the *calculation* of the merchant discount rate and the broader revenue dynamics for acquirers and issuers, not a direct hit to MA's top line. The LLM answer misses the nuance that MA’s role is facilitative and that its revenue is derived from other fee streams. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect as no incorrect numbers are cited), and the context and relevance are strong.

It also misstates Target's expense as $220 million instead of $251 million. These errors severely undermine the answer's correctness. (2) The calculation of the total expense is therefore also incorrect: the LLM implies a total of $471 million ($251M + $220M), whereas the correct total is $19.551 billion. The operating cash flow figures for both companies are misrepresented—especially for Procter & Gamble, where the adjustment should be ~$19.3 billion, not $251 million. (3) The reasoning about the role of share-based compensation in reconciling net earnings to operating cash flow is qualitatively sound—non-cash expenses are indeed added back in the cash flow statement—but this correct conceptual understanding does not compensate for the severe numerical inaccuracies. The multi-hop synthesis fails because the model swapped the values between the two companies (assigning Target's approximate figure to P&G) and introduced an incorrect value for Target.

      "llm_answer": "Company C (Citigroup) experienced a **7% decrease** in Retail Banking loans in 2024, while Company COF (Capital One Financial) saw an **11% decrease**. However, COF's total consumer banking loans decreased by **2%**, suggesting growth in other segments like auto loans offset retail declines. Company C's total consumer banking loans increased by **4%**, driven by auto loan growth, indicating a strategic shift toward auto lending. COF's focus on non-interest income (e.g., interchange revenue) and auto services suggests a strategy to diversify revenue streams despite retail loan declines. This highlights differing approaches: Company C emphasizes auto loan expansion, while COF prioritizes non-interest income and selective growth in high-performing areas.",

According to the ground truth, Company C reported growth in Retail Banking loans (driven by mortgage and Branded Cards), but the LLM claims a 7% decrease—this is directly contradictory. Similarly, the ground truth states Company COF had a 7% decrease in Retail Banking loans, but the LLM reports an 11% decrease, which is unsupported. Additionally, the LLM introduces 'total consumer banking loans' and 'auto loan growth' for both companies, which are not mentioned or implied in the original answer and represent fabricated data. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the 7% and 11% figures for Company C and COF respectively are incorrect; the only correct number in the original is COF’s 7% decline, which the LLM misstates. The 4% increase in total consumer loans for Company C and 2% decrease for COF are not in the ground truth and appear invented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the original answer contrasts strategic directions based on loan growth vs. contraction and risk management, but the LLM fabricates a narrative around auto loans and non-interest income that is not supported. It fails to mention mortgage originations or Branded Cards for Company C, which are key drivers in the ground truth. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses consumer banking strategies and attempts a comparative analysis, but the incorrect data and fabricated metrics severely undermine the validity.

These errors fundamentally misrepresent the financial data. (2) The calculations and comparisons are therefore also incorrect. The LLM concludes that Amgen's decrease ($175M) was slightly lower than Thermo Fisher's charges ($194M), but in reality, Amgen's $45M decrease is dramatically smaller than Thermo Fisher's $583M in charges. This reverses the correct interpretation of the relative scale.

The percentage change for CAT is correctly stated as a 64% increase from 2022 to 2023. However, the LLM reports a 29.8% decrease for UPS, whereas the ground truth specifies a 30.2% decrease. This discrepancy, though small, affects quantitative accuracy. The LLM also omits the final comparative statement about the 94.2 percentage point differential between the two companies' performance, which is part of the original answer and directly addresses the second part of the question. (2) The calculation of the combined profit is correct: $12,966M + $9,141M = $22,107M. The CAT growth rate is accurate: (12,966 - 7,904) / 7,904 ≈ 64%. For UPS, the LLM calculates (13,094 - 9,141) / 13,094 ≈ 30.2%, but reports 29.8%, likely due to rounding error or miscalculation.

TMO similarly relies on technology obsolescence rates when projecting cash flows for acquired intangible assets, indicating that both companies incorporate this metric to estimate the useful life and value of such assets. However, DHR explicitly mentions technology obsolescence rates as a key assumption evaluated by valuation specialists during the audit, suggesting a more quantitatively rigorous approach in that instance, whereas TMO references the metric in a broader context of cash flow projections without specifying exact rates.

(1) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer that conflict—both avoid specific percentages or dollar figures beyond the $3.5 billion mentioned in the ground truth, which the LLM omits but does not contradict. The absence of the $3.5 billion figure is a minor omission but not a factual error. (2) The LLM correctly attributes DHR’s detailed testing to audit disclosures (page 69) and TMO’s broader approach to pages 36–39, aligning with the original’s implication of DHR’s more rigorous, specialist-driven process. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two companies (DHR and TMO), compares their treatment of obsolescence rates, and draws a valid conclusion about differing methodological specificity. (4) The LLM enhances the original by citing specific document pages and framing DHR’s approach as 'data-driven' and TMO’s as relying on 'broader assumptions,' which is a reasonable interpretation.

The quantitative values are accurate, with acceptable rounding. However, a critical factual error occurs in the qualitative claim that 'both companies disclosed approximately 30% of their respective RPOs'—this is incorrect. The ground truth states that only RTX disclosed a 30% near-term recognition rate ($46.8 billion of $156 billion), while GE did not specify any percentage. The LLM falsely attributes the 30% figure to GE, leading to an incorrect conclusion that there is 'no difference' in near-term recognition between the two companies. (2) Calculations: The sum $68.7B + $156B = $224.7B is correct. RTX’s 30% of $156B = $46.8B is implied but not explicitly stated in the LLM answer, though not required. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails in synthesizing the differential disclosure practices—RTX provided a percentage with context (COVID-19 uncertainties), while GE did not.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts CMCSA's growth and resilience with GOOGL's vulnerability due to ad dependence. It adds contextual depth—such as Peacock expansion, pricing power, and macroeconomic risks—that enriches the comparison without contradicting the ground truth. The inference about CMCSA’s more diversified revenue base (e.g., distribution, content licensing) is reasonable and aligns with the implied contrast in risk profiles. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with slightly more elaboration on drivers and risks. The only minor gap is that the original emphasizes 'intense competition' more explicitly as a shared risk, while the LLM attributes it more to GOOGL; however, this does not constitute a factual error. Overall, the response is factually accurate, well-reasoned, and fully relevant.",

      "original_answer": "The 20% asset value limit on TRSs restricts both AMT and SPG in how much they can invest in taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are used to conduct non-REIT qualifying activities. For AMT, this limit constrains their ability to expand non-real estate activities and investments in TRSs, particularly those generating income from international operations, which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency controls that further complicate repatriation for REIT distribution requirements. For SPG, the same 20% cap forces them to closely monitor the value of TRS securities to ensure they remain under the threshold, requiring strategic structuring of transactions to maintain REIT compliance and avoid a 100% excise tax on non-arm's-length dealings. Thus, both companies must balance the benefits of using TRSs for operational flexibility against the constraints imposed by the REIT rules tied to TRS ownership.",
      "llm_answer": "The 20% asset value limit on TRSs (Taxable REIT Subsidiaries) restricts AMT and SPG's ability to allocate assets to non-qualifying activities, impacting their REIT compliance strategies by requiring strict monitoring of TRS investments to avoid excise taxes and maintain REIT status.

According to the ground truth, the 30+ day delinquency rate for Retail Banking loans at C in 2024 is 0.33%, not 6.73% as stated by the LLM. Similarly, at COF, the correct rate is 6.73%, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as 1.13%. The LLM then averages these two incorrect values (6.73% and 1.13%) to arrive at a combined rate of 3.93%, which is not only based on wrong inputs but also uses an inappropriate method (simple average) rather than a combined or weighted rate. The ground truth does not suggest averaging; instead, it reports the two rates separately. Additionally, the LLM claims COF’s nonperforming loan rate is 1.39%, but the correct value is 0.99%. (2) All key numbers are incorrect: C’s delinquency rate (LLM: 6.73% vs truth: 0.33%), COF’s delinquency rate (LLM: 1.13% vs truth: 6.73%), and COF’s nonperforming loan rate (LLM: 1.39% vs truth: 0.99%). The calculation of a 'combined' rate via averaging lacks justification and does not match the ground truth’s approach. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly extract data for each company, misattributes values (e.g., possibly swapping C and COF), and performs an unsupported calculation. It also misinterprets the comparison—ground truth states that COF’s delinquency rate (6.73%) is much higher than its own nonperforming loan rate (0.99%), while the LLM incorrectly compares an averaged delinquency rate to a wrong nonperforming rate.

      "original_answer": "NVDA's international supply chain exposes it to risks such as low manufacturing yields, supplier loss, and product defects, which can negatively impact its gross margin. With 84% of its revenue coming from international sales, disruptions in global operations—like supplier prioritization or production delays—could significantly reduce profitability. In contrast, TXN owns much of its manufacturing capacity, allowing it to spread fixed costs over higher output as factory loadings increase. This was evident in 2021 when TXN achieved a gross margin of 67.5%, partly due to the efficiency of its 300mm production. Therefore, while NVDA's reliance on external foundries and international markets increases vulnerability to cost overruns and quality issues, TXN's internalized manufacturing strategy enhances gross margin stability and scalability.",

However, it makes a critical error in calculating how much higher Caterpillar's profit increase was compared to UPS's decrease. The correct comparison is Caterpillar's $4,618 million increase (from $9,128M to $13,746M) vs. UPS's $672M decrease, so the difference in changes is $4,618M - (-$672M) = $5,290M, but the question asks how much higher Caterpillar's increase was than UPS's decrease — which should be $4,618M + $672M = $5,290M. Instead, the LLM incorrectly states Caterpillar's profit was $14,418M higher, which appears to be $13,746M + $672M — a nonsensical sum that conflates absolute profit with change. (2) The margin comparison is also incorrect: the LLM says Caterpillar's margin improved by 740 bps relative to UPS, implying 510 - (-230) = 740, but the question asks for the change in Caterpillar's margin *relative to* UPS's decrease — this should be interpreted as a comparison of the two changes (510 bps up vs. 230 bps down), not their arithmetic difference. The ground truth correctly reports the two changes separately. The LLM misinterprets 'relative to' as requiring a combined metric, which distorts the answer.

However, it reports SO's total receivables as $219 million, which is incorrect — the ground truth states $139 million. This leads to an incorrect percentage calculation for SO: 23% (51/219) instead of the correct 36.7% (51/139). DUK’s percentage is approximately correct (14% vs. 13.7%), with minor rounding acceptable. (2) Number verification: $16M (DUK affiliated) and $51M (SO affiliated) are correct; sum $67M is correct. DUK total receivables $117M is correct. SO total receivables should be $139M, not $219M — this is a significant factual error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly aggregates across companies and computes proportions, but uses an incorrect base (total receivables) for SO, undermining the comparative analysis. (4) Scores reflect that core data (affiliated receivables) is accurate and reasoning structure is good, but a major quantitative error in SO's total receivables reduces correctness and quantitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "NVDA's gross margin is negatively impacted by inventory risks and supply chain constraints, such as placing non-cancellable orders with long lead times and paying premiums to secure supply, which could lead to excess inventory charges if demand decreases. In contrast, TXN benefits from owning much of its manufacturing capacity, where increased factory loadings spread fixed costs over more output, thereby increasing gross margin. NVDA's strategy involves higher risk and potential cost volatility, while TXN's model provides more cost control and margin stability.",
      "llm_answer": "NVDA's inventory risk and supply chain strategy, characterized by long lead times and reliance on third-party foundries, expose it to potential excess inventory write-downs or supply shortages, directly impacting gross margins through demand forecasting errors. In contrast, TXN's manufacturing cost structure, with significant fixed costs from owned capacity and efficient 300mm production, allows it to spread fixed costs over higher output, improving margins during peak demand but risking margin compression if production volumes decline. This contrast highlights NVDA's vulnerability to supply chain volatility versus TXN's stability from controlled manufacturing efficiency.",

This is a major underestimation. For Microsoft, the LLM reports ~$2.79 billion versus the correct $2.75 billion — close but slightly overstated. The combined total is therefore incorrectly calculated as ~$3.42 billion instead of the correct $7.25 billion. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs: summing only Accenture’s Q4 data instead of full-year data invalidates the total. The Microsoft figure is reasonably close, but the Accenture number is fundamentally wrong.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AXP reported a Net Interest Yield on average Card Member loans of 9.2%, while BAC reported a Net Interest Yield of 2.73%. This significant difference reflects AXP's focus on high-yield proprietary card loans, with an average loan value of $15.0 billion, compared to BAC's broader asset base of $535.5 billion in average earning assets.

      "llm_answer": "The difference in Net Interest Yield between AXP (2.17%) and BAC (2.73%) in 2023 reflects their distinct financial strategies. BAC’s higher yield stems from stronger net interest income growth (20% YoY) driven by higher interest rates and efficient cost management (45.75% efficiency ratio), alongside a focus on corporate/commercial loans with higher yields. AXP’s lower yield reflects its reliance on non-interest income (e.g., credit card fees, investment management) and a consumer-focused loan portfolio with lower yields, despite robust non-interest revenue growth.

(2) The dollar amounts for average Card Member loans ($15.0 billion for AXP) and average earning assets ($535.5 billion for BAC) are completely omitted, which are critical for understanding the asset utilization contrast. The LLM introduces unsupported figures like a 45.75% efficiency ratio and 20% YoY net interest income growth for BAC, which are not in the ground truth and cannot be verified. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM reverses the relationship between yield and strategy.

The LLM incorrectly claims BAC has a higher yield and attributes it to commercial loans, which contradicts the ground truth.

The ground truth indicates a combined deficit of $771 million across DHR and TMO, but the LLM only reports TMO's deficit of $584 million and claims DHR's data is unavailable. However, the ground truth implies that DHR's data was available in the knowledge graph, so the LLM's failure to include it suggests either a retrieval or reasoning error. (2) Quantitatively, TMO's reported deficit of $584 million and plan assets of $1,360 million are accurate based on the provided context. However, the total combined deficit should be $771 million, meaning DHR's contribution to the deficit would be $187 million ($771M - $584M), which the LLM omits.

The ground truth states Accenture's total share purchases in fiscal 2024 were $2.74 billion, but the LLM incorrectly reports this as $605 million, which appears to be only the fourth-quarter amount. The LLM also reports Accenture's remaining authorization as $2,694 million, which may be accurate, but this was not asked in the question. The Microsoft remaining value is correctly stated as $10,349 million ($10.349 billion), matching the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the core figure—Accenture’s total fiscal 2024 share purchases—is wrong. The $605 million figure likely reflects only one quarter’s activity, not the full fiscal year, leading to a major underreporting. The correct total of $2.74 billion is nearly 4.5 times higher. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model identifies both companies, the correct metric (share repurchase activity), and compares them appropriately. However, it fails in synthesizing the correct fiscal-year total for Accenture, undermining the comparison.

According to the ground truth, EMR's current operating lease liabilities increased from $144M to $158M (a $14M increase), which the LLM correctly identifies. However, MMM's liabilities decreased from $192M to $163M, a $29M decrease, whereas the ground truth states a $34M decrease. The LLM incorrectly reports MMM's change as $29M instead of $34M. This leads to an incorrect combined change: the LLM reports a $15M decrease ($14M increase - $29M decrease), but the correct combined change is a $20M decrease ($14M - $34M = -$20M). (2) Percentages: The LLM states EMR's increase as 9.72%, which is approximately correct (14/144 ≈ 9.72%), and MMM's decrease as 15.1%, but the correct percentage is 34/192 ≈ 17.7%, not 15.1% — this suggests miscalculation. More critically, the conclusion that 'EMR experienced a greater percentage increase' is misleading because the question asks which company had a greater *percentage increase*, but MMM had a larger *percentage decrease*. Since one is an increase and one is a decrease, the comparison should note that MMM had a larger magnitude change, even though it was negative. The ground truth correctly identifies MMM had a greater percentage change in magnitude (15% decrease vs 9.7% increase), but the LLM misframes the comparison. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across two companies and compute net change and percentage changes, showing correct intent, but fails in execution due to incorrect base numbers and flawed comparative logic. (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses all parts of the question — combined change, individual changes, and percentage comparison — earning high marks for structure and relevance.

      "original_answer": "Disney recorded $0.7 billion in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024 related to content assets, among others, which reduces the carrying value of those assets and signals a decline in expected future cash flows, negatively impacting financial position. In contrast, Netflix monetizes content assets as a group rather than at the individual title level and amortizes them over time, with over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset amortized within four years. This group-level monetization approach allows Netflix to spread the cost of content over time and across its subscriber base, aligning amortization with viewing patterns and supporting a more stable cost of revenue structure.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's impairment of content assets in fiscal 2024, if any, would reduce its net income and asset values by writing down unamortized costs to fair value when impairment indicators arise, as outlined in its 10-K. Disney amortizes content assets over shorter periods (typically 4 years) using an accelerated method, with regular impairment testing at the group level. In contrast, Netflix monetizes content as a group, amortizing it based on projected usage and recognizing revenue via subscriptions rather than per-title. Netflix does not report significant content asset impairments, as it aggregates assets for testing and relies on subscription-based revenue recognition, which differs from Disney's more granular amortization and potential impairment adjustments.",

The ground truth states that Disney recorded a $0.7 billion non-cash impairment charge in fiscal 2024, but the LLM answer avoids confirming this with phrases like 'if any' and does not mention the $0.7 billion figure at all, which is a critical omission. This failure to report a key numeric fact from the ground truth severely undermines quantitative accuracy. (2) The LLM correctly describes Disney’s amortization period (typically 4 years) and accelerated method, and correctly notes that Disney tests for impairment at the group level. It also accurately contrasts Netflix’s group-level monetization and amortization based on projected usage/viewing patterns, as well as its subscription-based revenue recognition. However, it incorrectly implies uncertainty about whether Disney had impairments in fiscal 2024, when the ground truth confirms it did. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies the conceptual contrast between Disney’s impairment-prone, shorter-life amortization and Netflix’s group-level amortization without frequent impairments. It captures the logic that Netflix’s approach supports stable cost of revenue, though this point is less explicitly stated than in the original. (4) Despite missing the key $0.7B impairment charge and downplaying its occurrence, the LLM provides a reasonable qualitative comparison of the two companies’ accounting approaches. Hence, qualitative accuracy and contextual relevance are relatively high, but the absence of a core quantitative fact limits correctness.

This is a critical factual error. McDonald's use of the Monte Carlo model with a relative TSR modifier is correctly identified. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no numbers to verify or calculate.

The 2022 combined total is given as $44.6 billion, consistent with the ground truth $44,614 million. The year-over-year decrease is reported as $300 million, a reasonable rounding of the exact $303 million difference. (2) Individual company values are accurate: KO at $32.9 billion (2023) vs $33.2 billion (2022) and MO at $11.4 billion in both years. The sum checks out: $32.9B + $11.4B = $44.3B in 2023; $33.2B + $11.4B = $44.6B in 2022; difference is $300M. The minor $3M discrepancy is due to rounding and is acceptable under format variation.

These differences suggest that IBM's approach to corporate governance emphasizes detailed transparency around executive pay structures and risk alignment, while Salesforce maintains a more streamlined disclosure framework, relying on Proxy Statement incorporation without specifying individual compensation tables.

Similarly, the LLM incorrectly asserts that Salesforce's 10-K (pages 93–97) includes granular tables and narratives, which misrepresents the actual disclosure approach. In contrast, IBM does provide specific cross-references to detailed compensation tables in its 10-K, such as the '2023 Summary Compensation Table' and 'Potential Payments Upon Termination,' which the LLM fails to mention. Instead, the LLM focuses on plan names and governance roles, which, while relevant, do not reflect the structural disclosure differences emphasized in the ground truth.

      "question": "How do Disney's and Netflix's differing approaches to the amortization of participations and residuals reflect their respective content monetization strategies, and what does this imply about the timing and pattern of expense recognition for each company?",
      "original_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues for content predominantly monetized individually, while for group-monetized content, these costs are expensed in line with the pattern of usage. This reflects Disney's dual strategy of monetizing content either individually (e.g., theatrical films) or as part of a bundle (e.g., DTC subscriptions). Netflix, on the other hand, includes participations and residuals as part of its broader content production and licensing expenses, which are amortized as part of its content asset base, aligning with its primarily subscription-based DTC model. This implies that Disney's expense recognition for participations and residuals varies depending on the monetization model (individual vs. group), while Netflix's is more consistently tied to its streaming delivery and usage patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney and Netflix both use revenue-based amortization for participations and residuals, but their approaches reflect differing monetization strategies. Disney amortizes group content (e.g., DTC streaming) based on projected usage, leading to even expense recognition over time, aligning with its subscription model. Netflix, however, expenses participations and residuals using the ratio of current period revenues to estimated total revenues, tying expenses more directly to revenue timing, which reflects its focus on individual title monetization and variable revenue streams. This implies Disney’s expenses are more predictable, while Netflix’s expense recognition aligns more closely with fluctuating revenue patterns.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in describing the amortization approaches of Disney and Netflix, reversing key aspects of their actual policies. According to the ground truth, Disney uses the revenue ratio method for individually monetized content (e.g., theatrical films) and usage-based amortization for group-monetized content (e.g., DTC bundles). However, the LLM incorrectly states that Disney uses projected usage for group content to achieve even expense recognition, implying this aligns with its subscription model—this misrepresents Disney’s actual dual-strategy approach. Conversely, the LLM claims Netflix uses the revenue ratio method tied to current and total revenues, suggesting alignment with 'individual title monetization'—but in reality, Netflix includes participations and residuals within its broader content asset base amortized over time based on usage patterns in its streaming model, not on a per-title revenue basis. Thus, the core reasoning about which company uses which method is reversed. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors in numbers or calculations, hence a score of 10. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the link between amortization methods and monetization strategies. It incorrectly maps revenue-based amortization to Netflix and usage-based to Disney, when the ground truth indicates Disney uses both depending on context, while Netflix integrates these costs into a broader amortizable base aligned with its uniform DTC model. This undermines the qualitative accuracy. (4) Despite the factual errors, the answer remains contextually relevant—it addresses the question's intent, discusses amortization patterns, ties them to monetization models, and compares the two companies’ expense recognition timing. Hence, contextual relevance is high. However, due to the reversal of key factual and conceptual elements, the overall correctness score is low at 4, with qualitative accuracy similarly low.",

For MRK, such delays would increase the risk of IPR&D impairment assessments, as outlined in their 2024 10-K (pages 73-75), where delays in clinical development or regulatory timelines could trigger impairment tests for in-process research projects, potentially reducing fair value and leading to write-downs.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: delays in product approvals hinder MDT's realization of acquisition synergies due to integration and regulatory challenges, and for MRK, delays in regulatory or clinical timelines trigger IPR&D impairment assessments. The LLM correctly identifies the causal mechanisms—synergy realization for MDT and impairment testing for MRK. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a traditional sense, but all references (e.g., 2024 10-K pages) are consistent with the format of the original and plausible, though exact page numbers are not verifiable from the ground truth; no discrepancies exist in financial figures or timeframes. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (MDT and MRK), linking regulatory delays to distinct financial and strategic consequences in each context—synergies for MDT and intangible asset valuation for MRK. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong: while the LLM uses slightly different phrasing (e.g., 'prolonged integration challenges' and 'increase the risk of IPR&D impairment'), the meaning matches the original, including the trigger for impairment (delays in clinical/regulatory timelines) and the outcome (potential write-downs). The only minor gap is that the original specifies 'combining technologies to develop new offerings' as a synergy type, which the LLM omits, but the core idea of hindered synergy realization is preserved.

Tesla (TSLA), on the other hand, measures the fair value of RSUs based on the closing fair market value of its common stock on the grant date.

Additionally, the LLM reports TMO's expected Non-U.S. pension payments from 2022–2026 as $247 million, while the ground truth states $258 million—a discrepancy of $11 million—likely due to incorrect summing or sourcing.

WMT’s $3.8 billion in membership fee revenue for fiscal 2025 is not mentioned in the LLM answer, which omits a key data point.

In contrast, NFLX did not report specific impairment charges for content assets but instead emphasized a proactive amortization model based on viewing patterns and group-level monetization. This reveals that DIS experienced more direct write-downs of content value during the year, while NFLX manages content valuation risk through accelerated amortization and tax incentive strategies rather than discrete impairment events.

(2) Quantitatively, the $1.5B figure is incorrect versus the true $0.7B, and there is no mention that NFLX does not report impairments due to its amortization model—instead, the LLM vaguely states NFLX 'does not explicitly mention,' which understates the strategic difference. The original answer clarifies that NFLX avoids discrete impairments via proactive amortization, a key qualitative distinction missing in the LLM response. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing DIS’s impairments to NFLX’s lack of disclosed charges—but fails to correctly synthesize the underlying accounting and strategic rationale. The LLM attributes NFLX’s lack of impairments to 'conservative or diversified monetization' rather than the specific forward-looking amortization model tied to viewing patterns and tax incentives, which is a core insight in the ground truth.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect and fails to match the ground truth. It correctly identifies Microsoft's 23% cloud revenue growth and calculates the fiscal year 2024 revenue as $137.4 billion (from $111.7B * 1.23), but claims the dollar growth is not explicitly stated—this is a failure in reasoning, as the $25.8B increase ($137.4B - $111.7B) is directly calculable. The LLM incorrectly states that Oracle's cloud expenses are not disclosed, when the ground truth confirms $28B in such expenses. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM gets Microsoft's FY2024 revenue right ($137.4B) and the 23% growth rate correct, but fails to compute the $25.8B dollar growth, which is a basic arithmetic omission. It omits Oracle's $28B expense figure entirely, which is critical for comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have computed Microsoft's dollar growth from available data and compared it to Oracle's $28B expenses. Instead, it claims insufficient data, showing poor synthesis and logical inference. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—it addresses the right companies and topic (cloud revenue/expenses) but incorrectly dismisses the availability of key financial data, leading to an incomplete and misleading conclusion. The answer should have derived the dollar growth and made the comparison as done in the ground truth, where Microsoft's $25.8B growth is $7.8B less than Oracle's $28B expenses (not exceeding it as the original answer claims—note: this reversal is an error in the original answer; $25.8B < $28B by $2.2B, not $7.8B). However, the LLM’s failure to attempt the calculation is the primary flaw, warranting a low correctness score despite the original answer having a minor error in its comparison statement.",

      "original_answer": "EMR's acquisition of Heritage AspenTech added approximately $700 million in net contract assets and contributed to a $8.1 billion backlog, with 80% expected to be recognized within 12 months and the remainder over the next two years, primarily from long-term software maintenance contracts. This long-duration performance obligation contrasts with FDX’s treatment of contract assets, which totaled $623 million net of deferred revenue and are largely short-term in nature, tied to in-transit shipments that convert to cash each quarter due to the immediate delivery requirement for payment entitlement. The difference in contract structure—long-term software support for EMR versus time-sensitive delivery services for FDX—creates divergent cash flow timing and revenue recognition profiles.",

These contracts are recognized over time (80% within 12 months, 20% over two years) due to their extended duration. In contrast, FedEx (FDX) treats in-transit shipment contract assets as short-term, converting them to cash quarterly as shipments are delivered, reflecting their short-cycle nature.

For FDX, the short-term nature of contract assets tied to in-transit shipments converting to cash quarterly is correctly described. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts and percentages match the original answer. The $623 million figure for FDX is not mentioned in the LLM answer, which is a minor omission but does not affect the overall correctness since the focus is on the structural contrast rather than the exact number. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across EMR’s acquisition, backlog recognition timing, and contrasts it with FDX’s short-cycle revenue model. The reasoning about long-term software maintenance vs. time-sensitive delivery services is logically consistent. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses the question’s contrast requirement.

      "original_answer": "Microsoft reported a 23% increase in cloud revenue, reaching $137.4 billion in fiscal year 2024, reflecting recognized revenue from cloud-based solutions like Azure and Office 365. Oracle, on the other hand, disclosed that its deferred cloud services revenues are typically recognized ratably or based on customer usage over the contractual periods, which are usually billed in advance. This indicates that Oracle may not immediately recognize the full value of multi-year cloud contracts upfront, unlike Microsoft, which reports recognized cloud revenue growth. The contrast reveals that Microsoft's financial reporting reflects active usage and consumption-based or recurring revenue realization, while Oracle's approach aligns revenue recognition more closely with service delivery timelines, potentially smoothing out revenue over the contract term.",

Oracle, meanwhile, defers revenue recognition for cloud services, as evidenced by its deferred cloud services and license support revenues ($8.2 billion as of May 31, 2024), which are recognized ratably or based on usage over contractual periods.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Microsoft’s recognized growth with Oracle’s deferral approach, synthesizing implications for financial reporting strategies around multi-year contracts. It captures the core insight that Microsoft’s reporting emphasizes growth visibility while Oracle’s is more conservative and phased.

Meanwhile, Meta's changes to its Feed display algorithms and the promotion of Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, have led to reduced user engagement and financial results. These strategic shifts in both companies reflect different risks: Disney faces risks related to content curation and cost rationalization, while Meta faces risks from product changes that reduce monetization potential and content distribution effectiveness.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's strategic shift to DTC streaming services (e.g., Disney+) introduces risks related to subscriber growth, content distribution costs, and profitability, as highlighted in its 2024 10-K. For example, the company faces challenges in managing churn, achieving desired financial impacts from pricing strategies, and competing with other DTC platforms. Meanwhile, Meta's product changes, such as iOS updates limiting ad targeting and measurement, directly threaten its advertising revenue, a core income stream. Additionally, Meta's investments in AI and the metaverse carry risks of regulatory scrutiny, technological uncertainty, and competition, as noted in its 10-K. These distinct risks reflect Disney's focus on content monetization and Meta's reliance on platform dynamics and innovation.",

However, the qualitative accuracy is lower because the LLM misrepresents key strategic risks described in the original answer. Specifically: (1) The LLM attributes Disney's risks primarily to subscriber growth and churn, while the ground truth emphasizes structural changes like reorganization into two segments, content removal from DTC platforms, and resulting impairment charges—none of which are mentioned. (2) The LLM cites iOS updates affecting ad targeting as a primary risk for Meta, but the original answer focuses on internal product changes—specifically algorithmic Feed changes and the shift to Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate—leading to reduced engagement and distribution effectiveness. These are distinct from external factors like iOS updates. (3) The LLM introduces risks around Meta's metaverse and AI investments and regulatory scrutiny, which, while present in Meta’s 10-K, are not the specific product-related content distribution risks highlighted in the ground truth. The answer partially addresses the question by discussing strategic risks to financial results and referencing 10-K disclosures, but fails to correctly identify the core multi-hop connection: Disney’s risk stems from content curation and cost rationalization in DTC, while Meta’s stems from product-driven reductions in monetization efficiency. The reasoning is plausible but misaligned with the specific examples in the ground truth, leading to a moderate correctness score.",

The mention of the Allergan acquisition, while not in the original answer, is contextually plausible and aligns with ABBV's known 2019 acquisition, which likely influenced 2020 tax outcomes; however, the original answer does not explicitly tie the tax benefit to Allergan, so this addition is a minor over-attribution but not factually incorrect. (2) Quantitatively, the $1.7 billion figure is accurate, the year 2020 is correct, and no calculations are required—thus quantitative accuracy is perfect. (3) The contrast with PFE is mostly accurate: PFE’s forward-looking guidance is correctly described as non-quantified and focused on strategic benefits (e.g., growth, innovation), with no specific tax impact disclosed. The LLM omits the explicit mention of risks such as regulatory approvals and integration success noted in the ground truth, which slightly weakens the completeness of the multi-hop synthesis.

It reports HD's Net P&E as $25,199 million and MCD's as $24,720.6 million, which sum to $49,919.6 million — this matches the ground truth combined value. However, the LLM incorrectly presents these as separate figures without computing the correct total, and instead implies the total is the sum but fails to state it. More critically, the LLM claims MCD's increase is 'not explicitly provided,' which contradicts the ground truth stating MCD had a $-237.6 million change (a decrease). This omission leads to an incomplete and partially incorrect comparative analysis. (2) Individual values for HD ($25,199 million) and MCD ($24,720.6 million) are numerically accurate and match the ground truth components. The $494 million increase for HD is correct. However, the failure to report MCD's negative change (-$237.6 million) undermines the comparison. The combined total is never explicitly calculated in the answer, despite being derivable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model retrieves correct values from both companies and correctly identifies HD’s increase. However, it fails to synthesize MCD’s prior-year change, which is required for the comparison. The model appears to have missed or misread MCD’s year-over-year change, breaking the chain of reasoning. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to major gaps in factual synthesis, especially the missing MCD change value. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because while individual numbers are correct, the lack of proper comparison and total calculation reduces precision.

The 11.4% revenue growth in emerging markets is not mentioned in the original answer and appears fabricated or misaligned. (2) Quantitatively, the $367 million goodwill impairment and $204 million trademark impairment are real figures but assigned to the wrong company.

These values are accurately cited with correct document references (10-K pages), satisfying entity and quantitative accuracy. (2) However, the comparison calculation is incorrect: the LLM states Morgan Stanley's offerings were 'approximately 156 times' Mastercard's issuance, but the correct ratio is $235B / $1.5B ≈ 156.67, which rounds to about 157 times, not a significant error. More critically, the ground truth expresses the relationship as Mastercard's issuance being 0.64% of Morgan Stanley's, which is correct (1.5 / 235 ≈ 0.00638 or 0.638%).

These numbers are entirely missing, making the quantitative accuracy very low. (2) The LLM incorrectly frames Disney's approach around 'licensing terms' and 'amortization schedules' tied to expense recognition methods, which misrepresents the core of the original answer: Disney's large-scale investment in owned/produced content for direct monetization. While Disney does use amortization, the ground truth emphasizes the scale of investment, not accounting mechanics. (3) For Meta, the LLM correctly notes that content costs are embedded in cost of revenue and not broken out, but fails to connect this to Meta's advertising-based monetization model, which is central to the original answer. Instead, it vaguely references 'opaque' disclosures without drawing the correct inference about platform-based monetization via ads and user engagement. (4) The reasoning is partially sound in identifying that Disney has a more structured approach and Meta less transparent, but it misses the multi-hop synthesis: Disney’s high disclosed costs reflect a strategy of owning content for direct monetization (e.g., streaming, licensing), while Meta’s lack of itemized content costs reflects reliance on user-generated content and monetization via ads. The LLM answer focuses on accounting treatment rather than strategic implications.

This discrepancy arises from rounding $37.45 billion to one decimal place as $37.4 billion, whereas the ground truth likely rounded to $37.5 billion. This is a negligible difference and may reflect alternate rounding conventions. (2) Individual revenue figures for UNH and TMO are accurate: UNH increase from $257.14B to $287.60B yields a $30.46B increase; TMO from $32.22B to $39.21B yields a $6.99B increase. The sum $30.46B + $6.99B = $37.45B is mathematically correct.

      "question": "How does the treatment of global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) as a period expense impact the financial reporting of both Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) and FedEx Corporation (FDX), and what does this reveal about their respective approaches to managing tax liabilities on foreign earnings?",
      "original_answer": "Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) explicitly states that it recognizes the tax on GILTI as a period expense when incurred, which directly affects its annual tax expense without deferral or carryforward options. Similarly, FedEx Corporation (FDX) also records GILTI taxes as a period cost, aligning with EMR in terms of immediate recognition of foreign intangible income taxes. This shared treatment reveals a consistent industry approach under the Industrials sector to account for GILTI without relying on deferred tax mechanisms, thereby increasing transparency and aligning with U.S. tax reform expectations post-CARES Act. The immediate expensing of GILTI by both companies results in a direct impact on their annual effective tax rates, with EMR showing volatility due to restructuring benefits and FDX emphasizing future taxable income projections to support deferred tax asset recoverability.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) and FedEx Corporation (FDX) recognize global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) taxes as period expenses, directly impacting their income tax expenses and effective tax rates. EMR explicitly states it recognizes GILTI taxes as a period expense when incurred, while FDX notes it records GILTI taxes as a period cost. This treatment reflects their alignment with U.S. tax regulations, ensuring immediate recognition of GILTI-related liabilities rather than deferral. It reveals both companies proactively manage foreign earnings by structuring operations to comply with tax rules, potentially optimizing cash flow and minimizing long-term tax obligations. However, EMR’s higher effective tax rate (20.9% in 2022) compared to FDX’s unspecified rate suggests differing foreign earnings structures or tax strategies.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies that both Emerson Electric Co. (EMR) and FedEx Corporation (FDX) treat GILTI as a period expense, which aligns with the ground truth. It accurately reflects that this results in immediate recognition of tax expense without deferral, impacting effective tax rates. However, the LLM introduces a specific effective tax rate for EMR (20.9% in 2022), which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. This number may be factually accurate but is extraneous and unsupported by the source, reducing quantitative accuracy. FDX's tax rate is described as 'unspecified,' which is consistent, but the comparison of rates introduces a level of analysis not grounded in the original data. (2) The original answer does not include any numerical tax rates or specific years, so the inclusion of '20.2%' for EMR is an unsupported addition. While such data might exist in external filings, it was not part of the knowledge graph ground truth, making this a factual overreach. No calculations are performed in either answer, so no calculation errors exist beyond the introduction of unverified figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that both companies recognize GILTI as a period cost and links this to broader implications about tax strategy and compliance. It correctly infers that this reflects alignment with U.S. tax regulations and impacts transparency and tax rate volatility. The conclusion about differing foreign earnings structures due to tax rate differences goes slightly beyond the original answer, which attributes volatility to restructuring (EMR) and deferred asset recoverability (FDX), not structural differences in foreign operations. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the response directly addresses how GILTI treatment affects financial reporting and what it reveals about tax management. The qualitative accuracy is strong due to correct entity identification (EMR, FDX, GILTI), proper use of accounting terminology, and logical synthesis. The correctness score is 7 because core facts are accurate, but the introduction of an unverified percentage reduces overall fidelity. Minor omission of the post-CARES Act context and sector-wide 'transparency' point from the original slightly reduces completeness.",

      "original_answer": "MA relies on existing liquidity, cash from operations, and access to capital to fund potential obligations globally, which include credit and settlement exposure. MS, on the other hand, faces risk related to performance-based fees in the form of unrealized carried interest, which could reverse if fund returns fall below performance targets. MA's risk centers on liquidity availability to meet obligations, while MS's risk involves potential reversals of fee distributions that may require returning previously received performance fees.",
      "llm_answer": "MA relies on liquidity (cash, credit lines, and cash flow generation) to cover potential obligations like litigation provisions, credit/settlement exposure, and customer guarantees. Its primary risk is liquidity shortfalls due to global market conditions or customer defaults, which could strain its ability to meet obligations.  \n\nMS faces exposure to performance-based fees in its Investment Management segment, where unrealized carried interest could reverse if fund returns fall below targets, creating a financial obligation to return previously received fees.

(1) All factual elements are correct: MA's reliance on liquidity (cash, credit lines, operations) to meet obligations such as credit/settlement exposure and customer guarantees is accurately described. MS's exposure to performance-based fees through unrealized carried interest that could reverse if fund returns underperform is also correctly stated. The core risks—liquidity availability for MA and reversal of performance fees for MS—are faithfully represented. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations or figures; however, the absence of any incorrect numbers supports a full score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two different companies (MA and MS), identifies distinct risk types (liquidity vs. performance-based fee reversals), and contrasts their nature appropriately. (4) The LLM adds slight elaboration (e.g., mentioning litigation provisions and customer guarantees for MA, specifying the Investment Management segment for MS), which is consistent with typical 10-K disclosures and enhances completeness without introducing inaccuracies. The only minor gap is that the original answer emphasizes 'global' obligations for MA and 'access to capital' more explicitly, which the LLM touches on indirectly but could have stated more directly.

The absolute value of FedEx's 2024 Corporate & Other segment operating loss is stated as $1,080 million in the LLM answer, but this does not align with the ground truth data implied by the correct answer of $2,783 million. Similarly, the increase in GE's 2024 Corporate & Other equity method investment balance is reported as $588 million (from $3,863M to $4,451M), but this is inconsistent with the required result. For the correct difference to be $2,783 million, one of the values must be significantly larger — for example, if FedEx's loss was $2,783 million more than the GE investment increase, or vice versa. (2) The numbers cited by the LLM ($1,080M and $588M) are internally consistent in their calculation ($1,080M - $588M = $492M), but both inputs appear factually wrong based on the ground truth. There is no indication that the correct figures were used. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound — the model identifies both required components (FedEx operating loss and GE investment increase), attempts to compute the absolute difference, and follows the correct logical flow.

This demonstrates strong quantitative accuracy. However, the answer fails to provide DIS's Costs and Expenses, claiming it is 'not explicitly provided,' which contradicts the ground truth that the combined total is $100,367 million.

      "question": "What is the difference between the total 2022 lease payments made by TMO and UNH, and how does this disparity reflect their respective operating lease liabilities when factoring in imputed interest?",
      "original_answer": "TMO's 2022 lease payment was $303 million, while UNH's was $870 million, resulting in a difference of $567 million. TMO's total operating lease liability was $1,469 million after subtracting $189 million in imputed interest from total lease payments of $1,658 million. UNH's total operating lease liability was $4,273 million after subtracting $609 million in imputed interest from total lease payments of $4,882 million. This significant disparity in both 2022 lease payments and total lease liability reflects a much larger lease commitment by UNH compared to TMO.",
      "llm_answer": "The total 2022 lease payments for TMO and UNH differ due to their respective operating lease liabilities. UNH reported $870 million in future minimum lease payments for 2022, while TMO listed $303 million. This disparity reflects UNH's significantly larger operating lease liability ($4,273 million after imputed interest) compared to TMO's ($1,469 million). UNH's higher liability stems from longer lease terms and greater total future obligations, resulting in higher annual payments. TMO's smaller liability and shorter remaining lease term (9.9 years vs. UNH's 8.7 years) contribute to its lower 2022 payment.",

TMO's total operating lease liability is correctly reported as $1,469 million after subtracting imputed interest ($189 million) from total lease payments ($1,658 million), and UNH's liability is correctly given as $4,273 million after subtracting $609 million imputed interest from $4,882 million total payments. These figures are all factually accurate and consistent with the original answer. (2) The LLM correctly identifies and uses all relevant financial metrics and entities: TMO and UNH are correctly referenced, 2022 is the correct year, and the concept of imputed interest reducing total lease liability is properly applied. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across companies and financial components (lease payments, imputed interest, liabilities) and correctly infers that UNH's larger lease commitments drive higher payments and liabilities. It adds contextual insight about lease terms (9.9 vs 8.7 years), which, while not in the original answer, does not contradict it and may be derived from external knowledge; however, this detail slightly extends beyond the provided ground truth, but does not harm accuracy. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original: it conveys the same core facts—payment amounts, liabilities, imputed interest, and the conclusion about disparity in lease scale—though it reorders and rephrases for clarity. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly state the $567 million difference, though it provides both numbers, allowing the reader to infer it. This omission is minor given the context.

The ground truth states the combined 2023 'Services and other' revenue for GM and Tesla is $11,338 million, but the LLM reports $13,474 million, which is incorrect. The LLM breaks this down as $5,155M (GM) and $8,319M (Tesla), but these individual figures do not align with the ground truth data, indicating errors in data retrieval or synthesis. (2) Regarding Tesla's cost increase, the LLM reports a 33.2% increase using a calculation based on $7,830M (2023) and $5,880M (2022), which implies cost values not present in the ground truth. The correct percentage in the original answer is 33%, suggesting the LLM's calculation, while numerically close, is based on incorrect underlying data. Minor rounding differences (33% vs 33.2%) would be acceptable, but the inputs themselves appear fabricated or misextracted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to sum revenues across two companies and compute a year-over-year percentage change—but fails due to incorrect base data. This indicates a failure in entity-metric alignment (e.g., possibly confusing revenue with cost or pulling data from wrong line items or years). (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question with appropriate structure and units.

In contrast, Target explicitly states it offers a starting wage of at least $15 per hour for U.S. hourly team members as part of a broader compensation package that includes benefits like healthcare, retirement plans, and education assistance.

This calculation is incorrect—9.65% - 8.88% = 77 bps, but the actual change per ground truth is only 17 bps, meaning the provided percentages are likely wrong or misattributed. (2) The ground truth does not provide absolute SG&A percentages for 2021 and 2022, only the 17-basis-point improvement due to wage increases being offset by sales leverage. The LLM fabricates specific percentages not present in the original answer, leading to false precision. (3) Qualitatively, the LLM correctly identifies that Costco’s wage increases coincided with improved SG&A efficiency and contrasts this with Target’s $15/hour policy focused on labor investment and talent retention. It captures the strategic contrast—Costco achieving cost efficiency despite higher wages, Target emphasizing human capital investment.

It reports a combined amortized cost of $23,003 million for MA and MS due within 1 year, but the ground truth states the correct combined value is $6,573 million ($170M for MA and $6,403M for MS). The LLM incorrectly attributes $6,403 million to MA’s AFS and HTM securities, but this amount actually belongs to MS, not MA. Furthermore, the LLM omits MS entirely in its final comparison and instead fabricates a total for MA’s short-term investments that is over 3.5x the true combined value. (2) The calculation of $57,052 million for MA’s investments due after 1 through 5 years is unsupported and incorrect; the ground truth states this value is $116 million. The LLM’s claim that the longer-term investments are 2.5 times higher is completely false—the actual truth is that the combined short-term investments of MA and MS ($6,573M) are vastly greater than MA’s longer-term investments ($116M), a difference of over 56x. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly distinguish between MA and MS data, misattributes MS’s $6,403 million to MA, and fails to sum MA’s actual short-term investments ($170M) with MS’s ($6,403M). It also invents detailed security breakdowns not relevant to the question and ignores the requirement to compare the combined MA+MS short-term to MA’s medium-term.

      "original_answer": "The Walt Disney Company lists advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream, indicating its importance to overall income. Alphabet highlights that shifts toward mobile and newer advertising formats have generally lower margins compared to traditional desktop search, and that changes in device mix, geographic reach, and AI-driven user behavior are affecting monetization trends. These dynamics suggest that while both companies benefit from advertising revenues, Alphabet faces margin pressures due to format and device shifts, which could constrain profitability growth. For Disney, if it relies heavily on traditional advertising formats, it may face challenges adapting to these same evolving dynamics, potentially limiting revenue growth unless it successfully transitions to newer, more competitive formats.",
      "llm_answer": "Alphabet's advertising revenues face margin pressure due to shifts toward lower-margin mobile and new ad formats, as well as increasing traffic acquisition costs (TAC) from device mix and partner terms. These trends could slow revenue growth and reduce profitability compared to traditional desktop advertising. Disney's disclosures highlight advertising as a significant revenue stream but do not explicitly address similar shifts in ad formats or device usage impacting its monetization.

There are no specific numbers (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts) in the original or LLM answer, so this aspect is neutral but not penalized. The LLM correctly identifies that Alphabet faces margin pressure due to shifts toward mobile and newer ad formats, which have lower margins than desktop—this matches the original answer's core claim. It also correctly notes that Disney reports advertising as a significant revenue stream. The answer is contextually relevant (10) as it directly addresses the comparative impact of evolving advertising dynamics on growth and profitability for both companies. The qualitative accuracy is 8 because while the LLM captures the main dynamics, it slightly underrepresents the inference that Disney may face growth challenges if it fails to adapt to new formats—instead, it states Disney does not explicitly discuss these shifts, which is true but shifts focus to disclosure rather than strategic risk. The original answer makes a more direct connection that evolving dynamics could limit Disney's revenue growth unless it adapts. The LLM introduces 'traffic acquisition costs (TAC)' and 'partner terms,' which are reasonable inferences for Alphabet but not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth, adding slight over-specificity without error.

This is a critical error because currency denomination matters, especially in foreign exchange contexts. Additionally, the combined total is incorrectly implied to be $5.34 billion + €3.1 billion, but the LLM does not convert or sum the amounts, nor does it state a combined total in USD. The correct combined amount is $8.44 billion ($3.1B + $5.34B), which the LLM fails to report. (2) The individual amounts are partially correct in magnitude but wrong in currency: Eli Lilly’s $5.34 billion is correctly stated in USD, but AbbVie’s $3.1 billion is misrepresented as €3.1 billion, which distorts the actual carrying amount and invalidates any accurate synthesis. (3) The qualitative reasoning about the accounting treatment is correct: both companies do report foreign currency translation gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), which reduces earnings volatility.

In contrast, Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments, which commenced between 2024 and 2025 with lease terms up to 20 years, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream, reducing their short-term exposure to sales volatility.

(3) The reasoning is sound in identifying that both companies use market appraisals but reach different outcomes due to asset performance and management practices. The LLM infers strategic differences like asset turnover and closures, which are plausible but not explicitly stated in the ground truth. While not incorrect, these additions slightly shift focus from the core point: that fair value estimation processes can yield different outcomes based on asset-specific recoverability, not methodology differences. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses the key contrast in impairment outcomes despite similar valuation methods. It synthesizes across both companies and connects to asset evaluation outcomes, though with minor inaccuracies in temporal framing and some speculative reasoning. Thus, correctness is partially impacted, warranting a 7.",

      "original_answer": "AVGO provides direct disclosure about market for common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in Item 5 of its 10-K filing, while IBM takes an incorporation-by-reference approach, directing readers to its Proxy Statement for information about security ownership and stockholder matters. This difference in disclosure approaches suggests AVGO offers more immediate transparency about shareholder rights and equity compensation plans within its core 10-K filing, whereas IBM requires stakeholders to reference additional materials for complete information.",

However, the qualitative accuracy is low due to flawed reasoning and incorrect comparative conclusions. The original answer states that AVGO provides more immediate transparency because it includes shareholder rights and equity compensation details directly in Item 5 of its 10-K, while IBM incorporates by reference, requiring users to consult additional documents (specifically the Proxy Statement). The LLM incorrectly reverses the implication of transparency: it claims IBM’s incorporation-by-reference approach—citing a document with 'comprehensive breakdowns'—enhances transparency, which contradicts the ground truth that AVGO's direct disclosure offers greater immediacy and accessibility. This misrepresents the core comparison about transparency within the 10-K itself. Additionally, the LLM introduces specific plan names (e.g., '2001 Plan', 'Red Hat Plan') and references to the '2021 Annual Report to Stockholders' that are not present in the original answer or supported by the knowledge graph, introducing unsupported details. While the LLM correctly identifies the structural difference in disclosure approaches (direct vs. incorporation by reference), it fails in the multi-hop reasoning needed to assess transparency implications. Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses the comparison between AVGO and IBM on disclosure practices, but the incorrect inference about which company provides greater transparency undermines the correctness. Thus, the correctness score is 5—partially correct on facts (entities and disclosure methods) but significantly flawed in interpretation and synthesis.",

These revenues are tied to traditional television broadcasting and promotional services. In contrast, GOOGL generates advertising revenues predominantly through digital platforms such as Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network properties, leveraging both performance and brand advertising models. Revenues are recognized either when a user engages with performance ads or when brand ads are displayed. This highlights a fundamental difference in advertising revenue mechanisms: DIS relies on live and broadcasted sports content on TV networks, while GOOGL monetizes digital advertising inventory across a range of online platforms.",

      "original_answer": "The availability of financing directly affects both Emerson Electric's (EMR) ability to innovate in decarbonization technologies and FedEx's (FDX) capital investment plans. EMR notes that the adoption of new technologies like battery storage and hydrogen use cases will depend in part on the availability of financing for such projects. This implies that if financing becomes constrained or more expensive, EMR may struggle to develop or deploy these technologies, which are critical to responding to market trends like decarbonization. Similarly, FDX emphasizes that the amount and timing of its capital investments — which include aircraft, vehicles, and technology — depend on the availability of satisfactory financing. For example, FDX had $4.1 billion available under its 2022 repurchase program and issued $970 million in Pass-Through Certificates to fund corporate purposes. If financing availability tightens, FDX may delay or reduce investments in fleet expansion or technology upgrades. Thus, a decline in financing availability would create a dual impact: slowing EMR’s innovation in climate-related technologies and constraining FDX’s capital expenditures, both of which are essential to their strategic positioning in capital- and technology-intensive industries.",

According to the ground truth, BKNG received $107 million in dividends in 2023 and $3,087 million in 2022, but the LLM incorrectly states $1,020 million (2023) and $219 million (2022). These figures appear to conflate 'interest and dividend income' with actual dividends from subsidiaries, which is not equivalent. GM's numbers are partially correct: $1.8 billion in 2023 and $1.7 billion in 2022 align with the ground truth. However, the combined totals are wrong: LLM reports $2,820 million (2023) and $1,919 million (2022), whereas the correct totals are $1,907 million (2023) and $4,787 million (2022). The LLM incorrectly concludes there was an increase of $901 million, while the actual change is a decrease of $2,880 million. (2) Calculations are fundamentally flawed: the sum of $1,020M + $1,800M = $2,820M is arithmetically correct but based on incorrect inputs; similarly, $219M + $1,700M = $1,919M is mathematically correct but factually inaccurate. The correct sum for 2023 is $107M + $1,800M = $1,907M; for 2022: $3,087M + $1,700M = $4,787M; difference: $4,787M - $1,907M = $2,880M decrease. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—LLM attempts to aggregate across companies and years—but fails due to incorrect data sourcing. It identifies the right entities (BKNG, GM, GM Financial) and time periods, but misrepresents BKNG's dividend income, undermining the synthesis. (4) Correctness and quantitative accuracy are severely penalized due to incorrect core numbers and direction of change (increase vs. actual large decrease). Qualitative accuracy is low due to flawed data interpretation, though entity and metric identification is mostly correct. Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate structure and sourcing intent.",

      "original_answer": "Intel has historically faced significant delays in achieving expected manufacturing yields for its 10nm and 7nm process technologies, which led to missed customer product design windows, increased product costs, and allowed competitors like TSMC-based firms to gain a competitive edge in performance and energy efficiency. These yield issues have directly impacted Intel’s gross margin due to higher per-unit costs and underutilized capacity. NVIDIA, on the other hand, faces risks from its reliance on third-party foundries, where failure to achieve high manufacturing yields—either due to issues in product design or the foundry's proprietary process technology—can similarly increase costs and reduce product availability. Both companies face shared implications: lower manufacturing yields lead to higher product costs, reduced gross margins, and potential loss of market share due to delayed or uncompetitive product offerings.",

NVIDIA faces similar risks from reliance on third-party foundries (e.g., TSMC) for high-yield manufacturing, which could delay product ramps, increase costs, and reduce margins if foundry yields fall short. Both companies share implications for gross margin compression and product competitiveness due to manufacturing bottlenecks, but Intel’s IDM model exposes it to higher fixed costs and underutilization risks, while NVIDIA’s reliance on external foundries introduces supply chain volatility and less control over yield optimization.",

      "original_answer": "ABBV experienced a lower effective tax rate in 2024, partially due to acquisition costs related to business development activities, indicating that strategic acquisitions influenced its tax position. Meanwhile, LLY spent $3.35 billion on IPR&D (primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic) and $947.7 million on a manufacturing site in Wisconsin, showing a significant allocation of capital toward innovation and manufacturing expansion. Comparing the two, ABBV's business development activities influenced its tax efficiency, while LLY's spending reflects a focus on expanding R&D capabilities and production infrastructure, suggesting different strategic emphases despite both engaging in business development activities.",

However, it misrepresents ABBV's situation by claiming 'non-deductible IPR&D charges' as the driver of tax impacts, which contradicts the ground truth stating ABBV had a lower effective tax rate due to acquisition costs—implying tax benefits, not non-deductible expenses that increase tax burden. This is a critical qualitative error in reasoning and interpretation. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: $3.35B and $947.7M are correctly cited for LLY, and while ABBV’s $5.06B in capital expenditures is mentioned (not in the original answer), this figure is plausible but not part of the ground truth and distracts from the focus on acquisition-related tax impacts. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLY’s strategic focus on innovation and production is correctly inferred. However, the synthesis fails on ABBV: instead of contrasting tax efficiency from acquisitions (as in the original), the model incorrectly infers R&D investment via non-deductible IPR&D, which is unsupported and reverses the tax implication (non-deductible items raise taxes, whereas ABBV benefited from lower taxes). (4) The contextual relevance is high as the response addresses both companies, spending, and strategic priorities, but the flawed reasoning about ABBV’s tax impacts undermines the comparative analysis, leading to a misleading conclusion about strategic emphases.

These discrepancies affect the implied change: the correct increase is 30 basis points (89.5 - 89.2), not 65 basis points as implied by the LLM's numbers (89.52 - 88.87 = 0.65). Additionally, the LLM fails to mention Costco's actual gross margin decline from 11.13% to 10.48%, which is a key part of the original answer and the multi-hop comparison. (2) The Target 2021 gross margin of 28.3% is correctly cited, and the qualitative point about higher merchandise costs negatively impacting Target’s margin is accurate. However, the LLM incorrectly frames the comparison by suggesting Target had a 'smaller increase in merchandise costs as a percentage of sales'—but the original answer does not provide Target's merchandise cost percentage trend, so this inference is unsupported and potentially misleading.

However, it fails to accurately represent Tesla’s accounting practice—instead of recognizing a reserve based on resale guarantees (as per ground truth), it downplays the obligation as immaterial, which alters the comparative insight. This breaks the synthesis required for full accuracy. (4) The correctness score is 6 due to accurate LOW data but significant error in Tesla’s characterization. Quantitative accuracy is 10 because all numbers are correct. Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to incorrect interpretation of Tesla’s reserve policy and introduction of unsupported claims (immateriality). Contextual relevance is 8 because the response stays on topic and attempts the correct comparison, despite factual inaccuracies.",

      "original_answer": "To evaluate the segment cost of sales reporting transparency and cost components of MDLZ and PEP, we begin with MDLZ's 2024 10-K filing, which explicitly reports segment cost of sales for Latin America at $3,230 million and North America at $6,491 million. These figures represent the direct costs associated with production and distribution in those regions. In contrast, PEP's 10-K provides a more granular definition of segment cost of sales, explicitly listing components such as raw materials, direct labor, plant overhead, purchasing and receiving costs, production planning, inspection costs, and raw materials handling facilities. PEP also clarifies that these costs exclude the impact of comparability items, which are managed centrally and reported in corporate unallocated expenses. By comparing these disclosures, it becomes evident that while MDLZ offers precise dollar amounts per region, PEP provides a more detailed breakdown of cost components, enhancing operational transparency. This contrast suggests that PEP's approach offers deeper insight into the structure of production costs, while MDLZ's reporting emphasizes geographic cost allocation.",

      "original_answer": "EMR generated only $17 million from divestitures in 2022 and had no divestiture proceeds by 2024, indicating a significant reduction in the use of divestitures as a source of liquidity. In contrast, RTX explicitly identifies 'investments in and divestitures of businesses' as a principal factor in liquidity management, showing a strategic emphasis on divestitures to fund operating, investing, and financing activities.

      "llm_answer": "FedEx's total operating lease liabilities for 2022 were **$16,930 million**, while Emerson's were **$15,583 million**, making FedEx's liabilities **$1,347 million greater**. This significant difference suggests FedEx employs a more extensive leasing strategy, likely reflecting its heavy reliance on leased aircraft and facilities to support its global logistics operations. Emerson's lower liabilities may indicate a more asset-owning approach or a smaller scale of leased assets relative to its business model.",

It states Emerson's total lease liabilities as $15,583 million, which is incorrect — the ground truth is $492 million. This leads to a completely wrong difference of $1,347 million instead of the correct $16,438 million. FedEx's value ($16,930 million) is correctly stated. (2) The calculation is based on incorrect inputs, making it invalid. The correct difference is $16,930M - $492M = $16,438M, not $1,347M. The LLM's calculation appears mathematically correct given its inputs, but the inputs themselves are factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure — it attempts to compare leasing strategies between two companies and link them to business models — but fails due to incorrect data. The conclusion about FedEx relying more on leases is directionally correct, but the comparison with Emerson is distorted. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses both parts of the question (difference in liabilities and interpretation), and the qualitative reasoning about FedEx's logistics needs is plausible. However, the massive error in Emerson's liability figure severely undermines factual correctness. Scores reflect high penalty on quantitative accuracy due to incorrect core data, dragging down overall correctness.",

The calculation of the difference ($135M - $40M = $95M) is mathematically sound and aligns with the ground truth, even though the LLM does not explicitly state the $95M difference.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is partially correct but contains a critical factual error in the treatment of the excise tax for BKNG. The ground truth states that BKNG includes the excise tax on share repurchases in noncash financing activities (as per Note 13 of its 10-K), not as part of the cost basis of shares acquired. In contrast, LOW does treat the tax as part of the cost basis, which the LLM correctly identifies. The LLM incorrectly generalizes LOW’s treatment to both companies, which is not supported by the filings. This undermines the multi-hop synthesis required by the question, as the key distinction between the two companies' accounting treatments is erased. The mention of the 1% tax rate and the Inflation Reduction Act is accurate, and the observation that the tax is not recognized as an income statement expense but impacts equity is contextually relevant and aligns with SEC guidance—hence the moderate scores in quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance. However, the qualitative accuracy is low because the reasoning fails to differentiate the companies’ disclosures, leading to an incorrect overall conclusion. The answer would be stronger if it had clearly separated BKNG’s noncash financing activity treatment from LOW’s cost basis approach, as the original answer does.",

      "question": "How do Disney's challenges with managing churn rates on its DTC platforms due to pricing model changes and economic pressures compare to AT&T's success in reducing churn through bundling strategies, and what does this reveal about the differing competitive dynamics in their respective industries?",
      "original_answer": "Disney faces significant challenges in managing churn rates on its DTC platforms, particularly in response to price increases and economic downturns, which can reduce consumer willingness to pay for streaming services. In contrast, AT&T has successfully reduced churn by bundling services, with subscribers purchasing two or more services experiencing significantly lower churn than single-service subscribers. This comparison reveals that the streaming industry faces more price sensitivity and subscriber volatility due to a crowded market and economic pressures, whereas the telecom industry benefits from integrated service offerings that enhance customer retention. The competitive dynamics differ in that Disney must balance price increases with subscriber retention amid rising competition and economic uncertainty, while AT&T leverages its 5G network and bundled plans to maintain subscriber loyalty in a more mature, saturated market.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's DTC platforms face churn challenges due to pricing model changes and economic pressures, as noted in its 2022 10-K, which highlights consumer sensitivity to price increases and the impact of economic downturns on advertising revenue. In contrast, AT&T reduced churn through bundling strategies and unlimited data plans, as detailed in its 10-K, which emphasizes lower churn rates (0.94% in 2021) driven by retention offers, network performance, and service bundling. This divergence reflects Disney's competitive DTC streaming market, where pricing and content differentiation are critical, versus AT&T's telecom sector, where bundling and integrated services (e.g., 5G, IoT) create stickiness. AT&T's success underscores the value of diversified service packages in retaining customers, while Disney's struggles highlight the fragility of DTC models in a price-sensitive, fragmented streaming landscape.",

It accurately reflects Disney's sensitivity to pricing and economic pressures, citing its 2022 10-K, and AT&T's lower churn due to bundling and retention strategies. The only minor issue is the mention of AT&T's 0.94% churn rate in 2021, which is specific but not present in the ground truth; however, since the ground truth does not provide a specific number and the LLM cites a plausible figure from a credible source (10-K), this does not constitute a clear factual error. (2) No calculations are required in this question. The LLM references a precise churn rate (0.94% in 2021) for AT&T, which adds detail beyond the ground truth but is not contradicted by it. The ground truth does confirm that AT&T has significantly lower churn for multi-service subscribers, so the direction and implication of the number are correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes information across Disney and AT&T, correctly linking pricing sensitivity in streaming to competitive dynamics, and contrasting it with telecom bundling benefits. It draws the appropriate industry-level insights about customer stickiness, 5G, and service integration. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing all parts of the question—challenges, strategies, and competitive dynamics—while maintaining factual alignment with the ground truth in substance.

While it correctly states KO's operating income decline of $1,319 million and attributes it to higher SG&A and an 11% foreign exchange impact (consistent with ground truth), it grossly misstates MDLZ's segment operating income growth. The LLM claims MDLZ grew by $843 million, whereas the ground truth reports only $3 million growth. This error directly affects the final net dollar difference calculation. The LLM computes a difference of $2,162 million based on incorrect inputs, while the correct net difference is $1,322 million ($1,319M decline vs. $3M growth). (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: MDLZ's income growth is off by $840 million, and the net difference is incorrect by $840 million as well. The $610 million SG&A increase for KO is not in the original answer and appears fabricated. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to compare KO and MDLZ's outcomes and calculate a net difference—but fails due to incorrect data synthesis. It correctly identifies that both companies faced SG&A and FX headwinds, but misrepresents MDLZ's ability to overcome them. (4) Contextual relevance is acceptable as the answer addresses all parts of the question: impact of SG&A and FX on both firms, and the net dollar difference.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase's Return on Common Equity (ROE) was 17%, significantly higher than AIG's ROE of 8.6%. This difference is primarily due to JPM's much higher net income of $49,552 million compared to AIG's net income of $3,614 million, as well as JPM's substantially larger average common shareholders' equity of $300,474 million versus AIG's $41,930 million.

      "llm_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase reported a Return on Common Equity (ROE) of **17%**, while AIG's ROE was **8.6%**, reflecting a significant difference.

JPMorgan's stronger ROE stems from robust profitability, including higher net income driven by improved underwriting performance, investment gains, and lower interest expenses. Conversely, AIG's lower ROE is attributed to a **$6.6 billion decline in net income**, primarily due to reduced net realized gains on derivatives, lower investment income, and higher expenses, as detailed in its 10-K.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the ROE values for both companies (17% for JPMorgan Chase and 8.6% for AIG), which matches the ground truth. However, there are discrepancies in the financial figures used. The LLM states JPMorgan's average common shareholders' equity as $282.7 billion, whereas the ground truth reports $300,474 million (~$300.5 billion), making the LLM's figure inaccurate by about $17.8 billion. The net income figures are approximately correct when converted to billions ($49.6B vs. $49,552M and $3.6B vs. $3,614M), so those are acceptable within rounding. (2) The calculation of ROE is implied correctly (Net Income / Equity), but the use of incorrect equity for JPM would lead to an inaccurate ROE if recalculated. The LLM also introduces a claim that AIG had a '$6.6 billion decline in net income', which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth — this is an unsupported addition. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is generally sound: the model compares ROE, links it to net income and equity, and attempts to explain performance drivers. It correctly synthesizes that higher profitability and larger equity base contribute to JPM's superior ROE. However, the qualitative explanation goes beyond the original data by attributing AIG’s performance to specific factors like 'reduced net realized gains on derivatives' and 'lower investment income' without grounding in the provided truth, which only cites the raw numbers. (4) The correctness score is 7 because core facts (ROE values, approximate net incomes) are accurate and the overall direction of the comparison is correct, but significant quantitative inaccuracies in equity values and unsupported qualitative claims reduce confidence. Quantitative accuracy is penalized more (6) due to the large error in JPM's equity figure.

The 2019 (14.0%) and 2021 (11.9%) values match exactly. The slight decline followed by a small recovery is consistent with the downward trend described in the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers are accurate within acceptable rounding or reporting variation; the 11.8% in 2020 is plausible and does not contradict the overall downward trajectory ending at 11.9% in 2021.

      "question": "What percentage of total assets do non-current operating lease liabilities represent for both Netflix and Verizon in 2023, and how do these percentages compare?",
      "original_answer": "For Netflix, non-current operating lease liabilities of $2,046,801 thousand represent approximately 8.5% of total assets of $24,039,780 thousand. For Verizon, non-current operating lease liabilities of $20,002 million represent approximately 5.3% of total assets of $380,255 million. Therefore, Netflix's lease liabilities represent a larger percentage of total assets compared to Verizon.",
      "llm_answer": "For Verizon in 2023, non-current operating lease liabilities represent **5.26%** of total assets ($20,002 million / $380,255 million). For Netflix, non-current operating lease liabilities are **84.2%** of total operating lease liabilities ($2,046.8 million / $2,430.1 million), but total assets for Netflix are not explicitly provided in the documents. Thus, a direct comparison of percentages to total assets for Netflix cannot be made with the given data.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. For Netflix, it incorrectly states that non-current operating lease liabilities are 84.2% of total operating lease liabilities, which misrepresents the required percentage of total assets. It also falsely claims that Netflix's total assets are not provided, when the ground truth includes $24,039,780 thousand as total assets. The correct percentage for Netflix is approximately 8.5%, not 84.2%. For Verizon, the percentage (5.26%) is correctly calculated and matches the ground truth (~5.3%), so this part is accurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct for Verizon but severely flawed for Netflix. The LLM uses $2,046.8 million for Netflix's non-current operating lease liabilities (correct), but divides it by total operating lease liabilities instead of total assets, leading to an incorrect 84.2% figure. The correct calculation is $2,046,801 / $24,039,780 ≈ 8.5%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not synthesize the correct data points for Netflix—specifically, it omits total assets despite them being available in the knowledge base. It also fails to make the correct comparison between the two companies' lease liabilities as a percentage of total assets. (4) Scores are low due to major factual inaccuracies and flawed reasoning, especially regarding Netflix. The answer is partially relevant and correctly handles Verizon, but the critical error in both calculation and data selection for Netflix undermines the overall correctness.",

      "original_answer": "If interchange fees for third-party payment processors increased, both BKNG and LOW would experience a rise in operating costs, which could harm their profit margins. BKNG explicitly states that if fees are increased for any reason, it could harm its profit margin, business, and results of operations. Similarly, LOW mentions that interchange and other fees may increase over time and raise its operating costs. Since both companies rely on third-party payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, any increase in interchange fees would directly impact their operating costs, potentially reducing profitability unless these costs can be passed on to customers or offset through other cost-saving measures.",

BKNG, which relies on third-party processors for payment services, faces risks of higher transaction costs and operational disruptions if processors experience service issues (BKNG_10k_2023.pdf, pages 25–26). LOW similarly depends on third-party processors for payment processing, and increased fees could elevate operating expenses, impacting margins (LOW_10k_2023.pdf, page 17).

      "original_answer": "Apple faces a direct negative impact on gross margins due to foreign exchange risk, as a stronger U.S. dollar reduces its net sales and gross margins when expressed in USD. In contrast, Intel expects gross margins to be impacted by strategic investments in manufacturing capacity and process technology under its IDM 2.0 strategy, forecasting non-GAAP gross margins between 51% and 53% over the next several years. While Apple's financial planning must account for FX volatility through hedging instruments and pricing adjustments, Intel's planning focuses on absorbing upfront costs of long-term strategic investments that are expected to drive future revenue growth and margin improvement. This contrast highlights differing financial risk profiles: Apple managing external market volatility versus Intel managing internal strategic investment impacts.",

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model contrasts Apple’s external FX risk management with Intel’s internal strategic investment planning, correctly synthesizing across two companies, risk types, and financial planning implications. (4) Minor deduction in quantitative accuracy is due to the introduction of the $1.0B VAR figure not present in the original answer—while factually plausible and relevant, it slightly extends beyond the provided ground truth without confirmation.

In contrast, JPM reports a Return on Common Equity (ROE) of 17% for 2023 without explicitly adjusting for such unrealized gains and losses, implying that its ROE may be more sensitive to market value changes.

It accurately states that AIG excludes these items from its adjusted ROCE (a non-GAAP measure) to reduce volatility, while JPM's reported ROE (a GAAP measure) includes them. This aligns with the ground truth, which notes AIG adjusts ROCE for stability while JPM’s 17% ROE does not explicitly remove such fluctuations. (2) There are no explicit numerical discrepancies; the 17% ROE for JPM mentioned in the original answer is not contradicted by the LLM answer—it simply omits the specific percentage. However, this omission does not constitute a factual error, as the LLM focuses on the methodological difference rather than the exact figure. All other entities (AIG, JPM, 2023, ROCE, ROE, available-for-sale securities) are correctly identified. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in accounting treatment (AIG adjusting vs. JPM not adjusting) and links this to implications for comparability of ROCE/ROE, recognizing that including fair value changes affects performance stability. (4) The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with slightly more emphasis on GAAP vs. non-GAAP classification, which adds value without distorting facts.

The LLM incorrectly states that MDLZ does not specify any percentage, when the original answer attributes a measurable 0.8 ppt impact from currency translation changes influenced by the Turkish lira. (2) The combined impact in the ground truth is 11.8 percentage points (11 from KO + 0.8 from MDLZ), but the LLM does not compute or mention this, instead stating the MDLZ impact is unspecified. This is a critical omission in quantitative and multi-hop synthesis accuracy. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in isolating KO's data correctly, but fails in the multi-hop requirement to synthesize MDLZ's disclosed currency impact into a combined effect.

AIG noted that fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods generally in the five-to-ten-year range, and older contracts with higher minimum interest rates contributed to better-than-expected persistency. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase reported a $15.1 billion noninterest revenue, which included higher commissions on annuity sales in its Banking & Wealth Management segment, driven by the impact of First Republic and strong market levels.

      "original_answer": "The combined revenue from Neuromodulation in 2022 for ABT and MDT is $2,516 million. This amount is $2,268 million less than MDT's total revenue from its Neuroscience segment, which was $8,784 million in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined revenue from Neuromodulation in 2022 for Abbott (ABT) is **$1,735 million** (from ABT's 2022 segment report). Medtronic (MDT) does not separately report \"Neuromodulation\" revenue; instead, its Neuroscience segment revenue for 2022 is **$8,784 million**. Thus, the combined total for ABT and MDT's Neuromodulation (assuming MDT's Neuroscience includes Neuromodulation) is **$10,519 million**, which is **significantly higher** than MDT's standalone Neuroscience segment revenue of $8,784 million. \n\n**Answer:**  \nThe combined revenue from Neuromodulation in 2022 for ABT and MDT is **$10,519 million**, which is **$1,735 million higher** than MDT's Neuroscience segment revenue of **$8,784 million**.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. It incorrectly assumes that MDT's entire Neuroscience segment revenue ($8,784 million) can be treated as 'Neuromodulation' revenue and then adds ABT's Neuromodulation revenue ($1,735 million) to it, resulting in a total of $10,519 million. However, according to the ground truth, the combined Neuromodulation revenue for ABT and MDT is $2,516 million, meaning MDT's Neuromodulation revenue alone must be $781 million ($2,516M - $1,735M), not $8,784 million. The LLM fundamentally misunderstands the relationship between MDT's Neuromodulation business and its broader Neuroscience segment. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports a combined revenue of $10,519 million instead of $2,516 million and claims this is $1,735 million higher than MDT's Neuroscience revenue, when in fact the correct comparison is that $2,516 million is $2,268 million less than $8,784 million. All key numbers and the comparison are wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not recognize that MDT's Neuromodulation revenue is a subset of its Neuroscience segment and incorrectly treats them as separate or equivalent. It fails to retrieve or infer MDT's actual Neuromodulation revenue, which is necessary for the correct synthesis. (4) Scores are low due to complete breakdown in factual accuracy and logic, though the model correctly identifies ABT's Neuromodulation revenue and MDT's Neuroscience revenue from the correct year, showing some contextual understanding.",

According to the ground truth, MCD reported $11,319 million and SBUX reported $9,286.2 million. However, the LLM assigns $9,286.2 million to MCD and $11,319 million to SBUX, reversing the correct values. Despite this error, the final combined sum of $20,605.2 million is mathematically correct (since addition is commutative), which prevents the answer from being entirely wrong. (2) The quantitative accuracy is compromised because individual company values are misattributed, even though the total is numerically accurate. This is a significant factual error in a multi-hop financial question where correct entity-metric pairing is essential. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in that the model correctly identifies the need to sum the two values and reports the correct total, but fails in the critical multi-hop step of correctly associating each value with the correct company from their respective 10-K filings. This undermines the qualitative accuracy, especially in a context where precise attribution matters for auditability and verification. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the question format correctly, references the appropriate financial metric and year, and attempts to explain the synthesis.

      "original_answer": "KO reported that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted its consolidated operating income by 11%, with the Argentine peso being one of the currencies contributing to this decline. MDLZ, on the other hand, reported that unfavorable currency translation decreased its net revenues by $1,096 million, with the Argentinean peso cited as a primary contributor. While KO quantifies the impact as a 11% decrease in operating income, MDLZ provides a direct dollar amount of $1,096 million lost due to currency effects, which includes the peso’s weakness against the stronger U.S. dollar.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the combined current operating lease liabilities as $4,649.3 million ($4,649,312,000), which matches the ground truth sum of $383,312,000 (NFLX) + $4,266,000,000 (VZ). This part is accurate. The individual current liabilities are also correctly reported in rounded form: $383.3 million for NFLX and $4,266 million for VZ. However, there is a significant error in VZ's total operating lease obligations. The ground truth states VZ's total as $24.7B + $20.0B = $44.7B, but the LLM uses $24,268 million (~$24.3B), which is incorrect and appears to be a misinterpretation or data extraction error. This leads to an incorrect percentage: 17.58% vs. the correct 17.7%. For NFLX, the percentage is reported as 15.77% (vs. correct 15.8%), which is acceptably close given rounding. (2) Calculations: The sum of current liabilities is correct. The NFLX percentage is accurate (383.3 / 2,430.1 ≈ 15.77%). The VZ percentage is miscalculated due to wrong total: 4,266 / 24,268 ≈ 17.58%, but should be 4,266 / 44,700 ≈ 9.54% — wait, this reveals a deeper issue: the ground truth says VZ's current portion is 17.7% of $44.7B, implying current liability should be ~$7.9B, but it's only $4.266B. Rechecking: 4,266 / 44,700 ≈ 9.54%, not 17.7%. There is a contradiction in the ground truth. However, the LLM likely pulled VZ's total lease obligation from a different context (possibly only finance leases or a subset). Given the inconsistency, we defer to the original answer's stated values. The LLM’s use of $24,268 million as total for VZ suggests it may have used only one component (e.g., operating leases) and omitted others. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and compute percentages, which shows sound reasoning structure. However, it fails to correctly identify VZ’s total operating lease obligations as the sum of two components ($24.7B + $20.0B), indicating a failure in multi-hop data integration. (4) Scores justified: Correctness 7 due to correct combined total and NFLX data, but major error in VZ total obligations affecting percentage. Quantitative accuracy 7: numbers for current liabilities are correct, but total obligation and resulting percentage for VZ are wrong. Qualitative accuracy 8: reasoning is logical and structured, but entity synthesis for VZ is flawed.

The LLM reports NFLX's Federal tax provision as $441.41 million (current: $854.17M; deferred: -$412.76M), but this sum is mathematically inconsistent ($854.17 - 412.76 = $441.41M, which matches, but these component values are not supported by the ground truth). Similarly, VZ's Federal tax provision is reported as $3,869.00 million, which does not align with the ground truth contribution to the $3,286 million total. The LLM also claims both companies' Federal tax provisions are 'less than' their total income tax provisions, which may be logically sound, but the numbers used (e.g., NFLX total tax provision = $797.42M vs. Federal portion $441.41M) contradict the ground truth, which states Federal taxes alone were $3,286M for both companies combined—far exceeding the LLM's reported total for NFLX alone. The ground truth indicates Federal taxes were a *portion* of the total provision (42.3% for NFLX, 67.2% for VZ), implying the LLM has reversed or misattributed the relationships. The reasoning is flawed in multi-hop synthesis: it fails to correctly extract and combine Federal vs. total tax provisions for both firms. While the answer structure addresses the question's components (comparisons, breakdowns), the factual foundation is incorrect. Entity identification (NFLX, VZ, 2023, Federal vs. total tax) is correct, and the conceptual framework (Federal taxes as part of total) is sound, hence partial credit for qualitative and contextual relevance.

While it correctly identifies ACN's net carrying amount as $1,655,945 thousand (i.e., $1,655.945 million), it incorrectly labels this value as 'million' instead of 'thousand', leading to a massive overstatement. Similarly, MSFT's $2,837 million is correct, but when combining the two, the LLM reports a sum of $1,658,782 million, which is wildly incorrect. The correct combined total is $4,492,945 thousand ($4.493 billion), as stated in the ground truth. The LLM's final answer is off by over three orders of magnitude due to unit confusion. (2) Calculation verification: ACN: $1,655,945 thousand = $1.655945 billion; MSFT: $2,837 million = $2.837 billion; Sum: $1.655945B + $2.837B = $4.492945B = $4,492,945 thousand — correct in ground truth. LLM incorrectly adds $1,655,945 million + $2,837 million = ~$1.658 trillion, which is not only wrong but reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of units. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, correct fiscal years, correct line items, and correct individual values (except for unit labeling), showing it retrieved the right data points. However, the failure to reconcile units (thousands vs. millions) breaks the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses the exact question, cites correct pages and filings, and attempts proper sourcing. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the reasoning framework is correct, but the execution fails on a critical detail. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to the unit error and incorrect sum.

The LLM incorrectly assigns the $731 million figure to AT&T and invents a $174 million figure for Google that does not match the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: the correct figure for Google is $731 million; AT&T does not provide a specific number. The LLM's claim of $174 million for Google is unsupported by the ground truth, and the combined total of $905 million is therefore also incorrect. No valid calculation can be made for AT&T due to lack of disclosure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly attribute the disclosed figure to Google, misattributed it to AT&T, and fabricated a number for Google. It also failed to recognize that AT&T’s disclosures do not yield a determinate amount.

These quantitative elements are correct, earning a high score on quantitative accuracy. (2) However, the specific non-GAAP adjustments cited are partially incorrect or misattributed. The ground truth states that Medtronic's most significant adjustments included amortization of intangible assets (15.0%), restructuring and associated costs (21.5%), and certain tax adjustments, net (-$910 million). The LLM omits the actual magnitude of these adjustments and incorrectly emphasizes 'medical device regulatory expenses'—which are not mentioned in the original answer. Conversely, for Pfizer, the ground truth highlights restructuring and acquisition-related items totaling $1.2 billion, with specific breakdowns ($785M integration, $190M transaction, $125M termination costs), but the LLM incorrectly claims Pfizer excluded 'amortization of intangible assets'—which was actually a key adjustment for Medtronic, not Pfizer. Instead, the LLM attributes to Pfizer 'litigation charges,' which are not mentioned in the original. (3) This represents a failure in multi-hop reasoning: while the model correctly identifies the tax rate divergence, it misassigns key adjustments between companies, undermining the qualitative accuracy. The synthesis across entities is flawed, as it swaps major adjustment categories.

      "original_answer": "McDonald's incorporates occupancy costs primarily through its lessee role in a significant real estate portfolio, where it often owns the building but leases the land. These occupancy costs, such as property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance, are generally paid by franchisees for franchised locations, which make up the majority of McDonald's restaurants. This indicates a strategy where the financial burden of occupancy costs is largely shifted to franchisees, allowing McDonald's to maintain a more asset-light model. In contrast, Starbucks directly incorporates occupancy costs into its store operating expenses for company-operated locations, reflecting a more direct financial responsibility for these costs. This reveals that McDonald's leverages its franchise model to outsource occupancy-related financial obligations, while Starbucks assumes these costs as part of its operational expenditures, highlighting a more vertically integrated approach to property management.",
      "llm_answer": "McDonald's incorporates occupancy costs into its financial structure by passing these expenses to franchisees for franchised locations, as franchise agreements typically require franchisees to cover property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance. For company-owned locations, occupancy costs are included in operating expenses and asset retirement obligations (ARO) related to leasehold improvements. This reflects McDonald's model of shifting operational costs to franchisees while retaining liability for owned properties. \n\nStarbucks includes occupancy costs within its \"Store Operating Expenses\" for company-operated stores and reports them as part of product and distribution costs. The documents do not explicitly state that Starbucks shifts these costs to licensees, suggesting a more direct inclusion of occupancy expenses in its financial statements. This indicates Starbucks may manage its own operational costs more centrally, even with licensed locations, whereas McDonald's leverages its franchise model to externalize these costs. \n\nThe difference highlights McDonald's reliance on franchisees to manage leased properties and absorb costs, while Starbucks integrates occupancy expenses into its own financial structure, reflecting a more centralized approach to property management.",

Starbucks directly includes occupancy costs in store operating expenses for company-operated locations. The LLM correctly identifies that Starbucks does not appear to shift these costs to licensees, indicating a more centralized model. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer requiring calculation, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of sums or percentages; however, the absence of numerical errors and correct use of financial terms earns a perfect score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing two companies' treatment of occupancy costs across different operational models (franchise vs. company-operated) and drawing strategic implications about asset-light vs. vertically integrated approaches. The LLM correctly synthesizes the financial treatment and strategic implications, though it adds a minor detail about 'asset retirement obligations (ARO)' not present in the original answer, which is contextually plausible but not confirmed in the ground truth.

This lack of perfect offsetting could directly affect earnings volatility. In contrast, FedEx (FDX) reported net earnings allocable to common shares of $3,819 million in fiscal 2022, which reflects the outcome of its overall risk exposure and earnings management strategies, including those that may have influenced earnings per share.

The original answer states that Emerson's hedging activities led to potential earnings volatility due to imperfect offsetting of hedges, particularly in foreign currency and commodity costs. However, the LLM incorrectly frames Emerson's hedging as successfully stabilizing earnings, which contradicts the ground truth. For FedEx, the original answer provides a specific net earnings figure of $3,819 million in fiscal 2022, but the LLM omits this entirely and instead introduces a 21.9% effective tax rate and tax optimization strategies (e.g., foreign tax loss carryforwards, entity restructuring), which are not mentioned in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided information. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM fails to report the key figure of $3,819 million in net earnings for FedEx, which is central to the original answer. The 21.9% tax rate is introduced without support from the ground truth, making it a hallucinated data point. No calculations are performed in either answer, but the omission of a major quantitative result (FDX earnings) severely undermines accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The question asks for a comparison of financial exposures and outcomes tied to risk management strategies. The original answer contrasts EMR's derivative-related earnings volatility with FDX's reported net earnings influenced by operational and share dilution effects. The LLM instead invents a narrative about FedEx's tax strategy, which is not supported by the ground truth, and mischaracterizes Emerson's hedging effectiveness. There is no evidence in the original answer that FedEx's risk management focused on tax optimization, nor that Emerson's hedges were effective. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the LLM addresses both companies and attempts to discuss risk management, but the substance is factually misaligned. Due to major factual errors, hallucinated metrics, and incorrect synthesis, the correctness score is low at 3, quantitative accuracy at 2 (due to missing and fabricated numbers), qualitative accuracy at 3 (partial entity identification but flawed reasoning), and contextual relevance at 5 (on-topic but incorrect in key aspects).",

The LLM calculates $609.80 for WMT and $23.20 for TGT, resulting in a difference of $586.60—orders of magnitude off. (2) Critical number errors: The LLM misreads Target's net sales as $5,707 million instead of $102.8 billion (actual ~$102,800 million), likely confusing a line item (e.g., digital sales) with total revenue. It also misreads Walmart's net sales as $642,637 million (i.e., $642.6 billion), which is roughly correct (actual was ~$648B), but uses an incorrect square footage figure—1,053,000 sq ft is far too low (should be ~1.1 billion sq ft across ~10,500 stores). Similarly, Target's square footage is listed as 245,939,000 (246 million), which is likely misinterpreted from the document—actual is ~200 million.

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: the 2024 combined outflow is correctly calculated as $1,946 million (AIG: $353M + AmEx: $1,593M), and the 2023 total is $3,642 million (AIG: $2,070M + AmEx: $1,572M). The year-over-year decrease of $1,696 million is accurate ($3,642M - $1,946M = $1,696M), and the added percentage decrease (46.6%) is a correct derivation, though not in the original answer, which does not penalize as it adds value without inaccuracy. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the 2024 combined outflow and the comparison to the previous year. (3) Entity accuracy is perfect: AIG and American Express are correctly identified, with correct years (2024 and 2023) and correct metric (net cash outflow from purchase of investments). (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is synthesized across both companies and both years, with proper summation and comparison.

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's method of adjusting residual values for leased equipment differ from FedEx's approach in terms of financial impact on depreciation or revenue, based on the specific lease types and asset categories described?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar adjusts residual values for operating leases by prospectively changing depreciation expense on a straight-line basis, while for finance leases, residual value adjustments reduce finance revenue over the remaining lease term. FedEx, on the other hand, evaluates salvage values as part of depreciation for long-lived assets like aircraft, adjusting estimated service lives or residual values based on usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors. This means Caterpillar’s adjustments directly affect either depreciation or revenue depending on lease type, whereas FedEx’s changes impact the depreciation schedule of capital assets over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar adjusts residual values for leased equipment during the lease term, prospectively impacting depreciation expense for operating leases and finance revenue for finance leases, based on factors like market trends and usage. FedEx, however, typically assigns no residual value to its aircraft due to their cargo configuration and low end-of-life value, with no adjustments during the lease term. Instead, FedEx's financial impact arises from impairment charges when retiring assets (e.g., $157M in 2024 for Boeing 757s), driven by fleet modernization and economic outlook, rather than residual value adjustments. Thus, Caterpillar's approach directly affects depreciation/revenue through residual value changes, while FedEx's impact stems from impairment decisions tied to asset retirement.",

While it correctly identifies that Caterpillar adjusts residual values prospectively, impacting depreciation for operating leases and finance revenue for finance leases, it misrepresents FedEx's approach. The ground truth states that FedEx evaluates salvage values as part of depreciation for long-lived assets like aircraft, adjusting estimated service lives or residual values based on usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors. In contrast, the LLM claims FedEx 'typically assigns no residual value to its aircraft' and makes no adjustments during the lease term, which contradicts the original answer. Additionally, the LLM introduces a specific impairment charge of $157M in 2024 for Boeing 757s, which is not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided information. (2) The quantitative claim of a '$157M in 2024' impairment is unsupported by the original answer and introduces a specific number without basis, failing the quantitative accuracy check. No such figure appears in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly distinguishing between Caterpillar’s lease-type-dependent adjustments and a different approach at FedEx—but fails in synthesis because it fabricates FedEx’s policy of assigning zero residual value and bases its conclusion on impairment rather than depreciation adjustments, which misaligns with the original comparative framework. (4) Despite the incorrect characterization of FedEx’s method and the introduction of unverified financial figures, the LLM does address the core question about differing financial impacts—Caterpillar affecting depreciation/revenue via residual adjustments vs. FedEx via impairment—and maintains contextual relevance. However, due to major factual errors in entity behavior and unsupported numbers, the correctness score is low.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, MDT reported $4 million in 'Other Investing Activities, Net,' while PFE reported $(179) million for the same metric. For MDT, this represents a negligible portion of its total net cash used in investing activities of $(3,493) million, suggesting minimal impact. For PFE, the $(179) million in 'Other Investing Activities, Net' is a small but more noticeable component of its total net cash used in investing activities of $(32,278) million, indicating a relatively minor but more impactful role in its overall investing cash flow.",

PFE's -$179 million accounts for **1.13%** of its total net cash used in investing activities (-$15,783 million), suggesting a slightly more notable role.

However, it uses an incorrect total net cash used in investing activities for PFE: it states -$15,783 million instead of the correct -$32,278 million from the original answer. This leads to an incorrect percentage calculation (1.13% vs. the correct ~0.55%). The MDT percentage (0.11%) is accurate. (2) Number verification: MDT's $4M / $3,493M ≈ 0.11% is correct. PFE's $179M / $32,278M ≈ 0.55%, not 1.13%, which would only be true if the denominator were ~$15.8B, which is factually wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly compares the line item to total investing cash outflows for both companies and draws qualitative conclusions about relative significance. However, due to the incorrect denominator for PFE, the inference that PFE’s figure is 'slightly more notable' is based on flawed math, undermining the conclusion.

      "original_answer": "McDonald's reported a 2% increase in consolidated revenues to $25.9 billion in 2024, emphasizing growth in constant currencies and the impact of restructuring charges and international market performance. In contrast, Starbucks' 10-K detailed its revenue recognition policy, specifying that consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations, discounts, returns, allowances, and sales incentives such as coupon redemptions and rebates.

      "llm_answer": "McDonald's 2024 consolidated revenue growth is reported net of intercompany eliminations and discounts, with company-operated store revenues recognized at the point of sale upon payment. In contrast, Starbucks details a more granular approach, recognizing revenue upon transfer of control (e.g., shipment for product sales, royalty percentages for licensed stores) and deferring stored value card and loyalty program revenue until redemption.

The ground truth states that McDonald's reported a 2% increase in consolidated revenues to $25.9 billion in 2024, but the LLM answer does not mention this key quantitative data at all. Instead, it incorrectly implies that McDonald's only discusses netting intercompany eliminations and discounts—details that are actually part of Starbucks' disclosure, not McDonald's. The LLM misattributes Starbucks' detailed revenue recognition policies (e.g., transfer of control, deferral of stored value cards, loyalty programs, breakage) as contrasting with McDonald's approach, but fails to reflect that McDonald's 10-K emphasizes growth metrics and external factors like currency and restructuring, not accounting mechanics. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the core numbers—2% growth and $25.9 billion—are missing entirely. There are no calculations in the LLM answer, but the omission of required financial figures from McDonald's report constitutes a major quantitative failure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the LLM correctly identifies that Starbucks provides detailed revenue recognition policies, it incorrectly constructs a comparison by attributing granular accounting practices to McDonald's that are not present in the ground truth. The model fabricates details about McDonald's recognizing revenue 'at the point of sale upon payment' and focusing on 'payment timing,' which are not in the original answer. It also incorrectly suggests McDonald's discusses netting intercompany transactions, which is a Starbucks-specific point. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to compare revenue recognition approaches and mentions relevant concepts like intercompany eliminations, deferrals, and control transfer.

      "original_answer": "Emerson Electric (EMR) reported an expected life of 5.1 years for its stock options in 2022, while FedEx (FDX) estimated the expected life based on actual exercise history and noted that options have a maximum term of 10 years. Since FDX examines actual exercise behavior to determine expected life and uses a period equal to that expected life for calculating volatility, a longer expected life (up to 10 years) would lead to a longer historical period being used for volatility estimation. In contrast, EMR’s shorter expected life of 5.1 years would result in a shorter historical period being used for volatility, potentially leading to different volatility inputs in their financial models and, consequently, different option valuations.",

EMR's AspenTech options had an expected life of **5.1 years** (page 74), while FDX's options had an expected life of **6.4 years** (page 98). A shorter expected life for EMR suggests employees may exercise options sooner, possibly due to lower volatility or different vesting structures, whereas FDX's longer expected life implies a higher likelihood of holding options longer. This impacts volatility estimation periods in financial models: EMR might use a shorter historical volatility period (aligned with its 5.1-year expected life), while FDX uses a longer period (aligned with 6.4 years), leading to potentially different volatility inputs in option valuations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. While it correctly states Emerson Electric's (EMR) expected life of 5.1 years, it incorrectly claims FedEx (FDX) reported an expected life of 6.4 years. The ground truth states that FDX does not use a fixed expected life but instead estimates it based on actual exercise history, with a maximum term of 10 years. The 6.4-year figure is not supported by the original answer and appears to be fabricated or misattributed. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the core number for FDX (6.4 years) is incorrect. Even though EMR’s 5.1 years is accurate, the comparison is invalid due to the wrong FDX value. Additionally, the LLM cites page numbers (74 and 98), which are not part of the provided ground truth and cannot be verified, suggesting potential hallucination. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—shorter expected life implying earlier exercise and impact on volatility period is logically valid. However, the multi-hop synthesis fails because the model assumes both companies use a fixed expected life, whereas the ground truth emphasizes that FDX uses actual exercise behavior to determine expected life, which affects how volatility is estimated. This key distinction is missed, undermining the qualitative accuracy. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the question’s structure—comparing expected lives, linking to exercise behavior, and discussing implications for volatility estimation periods.

This affects its ability to maintain service quality and execute omnichannel strategies, as noted in its 2024 10-K filing. Nike, on the other hand, is exposed to wage rate fluctuations and labor standards in international markets where its contract manufacturers operate. These external wage pressures influence Nike's manufacturing and sourcing costs, as well as its ability to maintain production timelines and cost controls. While both companies face wage-related challenges, Lowe's labor issues are internal and operational, directly affecting its U.S. retail strategy, whereas Nike's are external and supply chain-based, affecting product availability and cost of goods sold.

Thus, the LLM reverses the actual accounting policies of the two companies. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors in numbers or calculations, hence a score of 10. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires comparing specific accounting treatments (interest accrual on loans held for sale) between two firms based on their 2024 disclosures. The LLM fails to correctly extract and contrast these policies, misrepresents AIG’s policy, and misinterprets AXP’s disclosures, indicating a failure in synthesis and understanding. (4) Correctness is severely compromised due to the inversion of key facts. Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topic (interest income on loans held for sale) and mentions relevant sections, but with incorrect substance. Qualitative accuracy is low due to incorrect entity-policy mapping and flawed reasoning.",

However, the 2023 combined total is reported as $109,433 million in the LLM answer, whereas the ground truth is $109,413 million—a $20 million discrepancy. This leads to a calculated increase of $8,945 million in the LLM answer, while the correct increase is $8,965 million. These are minor but material calculation or data extraction errors.

The $20M difference in the 2023 total suggests a possible typo or misread in one of the source values. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identified both companies, the correct metric ('Other Cost of Revenues'), and both years, then synthesized across entities and time periods to compute totals and year-over-year change.

NKE, on the other hand, describes ROIC as a performance measure that reflects the company's ability to manage invested capital but does not specify a detailed calculation.

According to the ground truth, LMT reclassified $1,787 million and UNP $723 million in 2021, totaling $2,511 million. The LLM incorrectly reports LMT's amount as $1,310 million (citing a 'pension settlement charge') and combines it with UNP's correct $723 million, arriving at an incorrect total of $2,033 million. For 2020, the ground truth shows LMT at $440 million and UNP at -$233 million (net negative), totaling $677 million. The LLM incorrectly reports LMT as $1,067 million and UNP as $233 million (missing the negative sign), leading to a total of $1,300 million—overstating both the individual values and the total. The year-over-year difference is thus miscalculated: the LLM reports a $733 million increase, while the correct increase is $1,834 million. (2) Calculations are flawed due to incorrect inputs. Even basic arithmetic (e.g., $723M + $1,310M ≠ $2,033M—actual sum is $2,033M, which matches only by coincidence) does not justify the use of wrong source data. The negative value for UNP in 2020 is critical and was omitted, distorting the comparison. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails because the model appears to infer LMT’s AOCI reclassification from a pension settlement charge mentioned in UNP’s document, which is logically unsound and factually unsupported. There is no indication that the 'pension settlement charge' in UNP’s filing relates to LMT. This represents a failure in entity disambiguation and cross-document inference. (4) The contextual structure of the answer is appropriate—it attempts to address both years, both companies, and the comparison—but the severe factual and quantitative errors undermine the response.

The ground truth implies a derived metric (50 bps gain vs. 8% loss interpreted as an effective 800 bps drag, but summarized as a 58 bps relative difference), though the exact calculation logic in the original answer appears slightly inconsistent; however, the expected synthesis includes stating the resulting difference.

Similarly, it claims WMT has 973,000 square feet (~0.97 million), whereas the correct value is 699 million—this is a massive underreporting. The difference in square footage is therefore completely wrong. (2) Calculations are invalid due to incorrect inputs. The ground truth difference is approximately 453,061 million square feet (699M - 245,939M), but the LLM implies a much smaller difference with inverted magnitudes. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in intent—comparing expansion/contraction strategies—but based on false data. The claim that WMT reduced U.S. square footage aligns with the truth (from 702M to 699M), but the LLM incorrectly attributes this to international expansion, while the ground truth does not support such a conclusion.

This is explicitly stated in Disney's 10-K, which notes that declines in traditional forms of distribution have led to higher costs being allocated to DTC offerings. Meanwhile, Meta's advertising business is affected by changes in feed display and ranking algorithms that reduce time spent and user engagement, which in turn lowers advertising effectiveness and revenue. The 10-K explicitly states that these algorithmic changes have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the distribution of content by publishers and marketers, lowering their incentive to invest in Meta's platform. Both companies report that these content distribution challenges directly affect their financial performance: Disney through increased costs and reduced profitability in its DTC segment, and Meta through lower ad targeting capabilities and reduced engagement metrics.",

Meta's advertising business is affected by privacy regulations (e.g., third-party cookie phase-out by Apple/Google) and algorithmic changes that limit ad targeting and measurement, reducing ad effectiveness and monetization.

This specific cost allocation mechanism is missing in the LLM response. For Meta, the LLM focuses on privacy regulations (e.g., Apple's iOS changes) and targeting limitations, which are relevant but not the primary mechanism cited in the ground truth. The original answer highlights algorithmic changes to feed ranking that reduce content distribution, lowering publisher and marketer engagement, which in turn reduces ad investment.

      "original_answer": "LOW reported a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of 32.0% in 2024, while NKE reported a ROIC of 34.9% for the same period. Therefore, NKE demonstrates a higher efficiency in using its capital. The difference in ROIC between the two companies is 2.9 percentage points (34.9% - 32.0% = 2.9%).",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, Nike (NKE) reported a Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of **34.9%** for fiscal 2024. However, there is **no information provided about LOW's ROIC** in the given pages.

The ground truth states that LOW's ROIC is 32.0% and NKE's is 34.9% in 2024, with a difference of 2.9 percentage points. The LLM incorrectly claims there is no information about LOW's ROIC, which contradicts the provided context. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM only reports NKE's ROIC (34.9%) correctly but fails to report LOW's ROIC (32.0%) and omits the difference calculation (34.9% - 32.0% = 2.9%), which is central to the question. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model should have retrieved and compared ROIC values for both companies from the knowledge base but failed to do so for LOW, breaking the synthesis required for comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is low because the answer denies the availability of key data rather than using it, rendering the response misleading despite partial mention of NKE's metric.

The ground truth confirms this value exists in the knowledge graph derived from actual 10-K filings, indicating the information is available and verifiable. The LLM incorrectly claims the data is not present in the documents, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM does not report any correct figures—neither Cisco’s nor NVIDIA’s Data Center revenue for FY2022—nor attempts the correct sum. Actual data from filings: NVIDIA reported $11.04 billion in Data Center revenue for FY2022, and Cisco reported $8.76 billion from its Data Center segment (Infrastructure Platforms, which includes Data Center), totaling $19.8 billion. The LLM fails to extract or compute this. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model must identify segment revenue from two separate companies in the same fiscal year and sum them. Instead, it defaults to claiming insufficient data, showing failure in information retrieval and synthesis. Mentioning Mellanox’s 10% contribution in 2021 is irrelevant and distracts from the actual 2022 segment revenue.

      "original_answer": "UNP's retiree benefits deferred tax asset decreased from $255 million in 2020 to $39 million in 2021, a reduction of $216 million. This indicates a significant decline in the tax benefit associated with retiree obligations. Meanwhile, LMT explicitly states that retiree benefits are excluded from business segment operating profit because they are not considered part of management's evaluation of segment performance. This reveals that while both companies report retiree benefits, they treat them differently in financial reporting: UNP reflects the changing value of its retiree benefits as a deferred tax asset, while LMT excludes them entirely from segment-level performance metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "The change in UNP's retiree benefits deferred tax asset decreased from $255 million in 2020 to $39 million in 2021, reflecting a significant reduction in deferred tax assets related to retiree benefits. In contrast, LMT excludes retiree benefits from its business segment operating profit, as noted in its segment reporting (page 45), to separate these costs from core operational performance.

The reduction of $216 million is implied by the correct before-and-after values, though not explicitly calculated—this is a minor omission but does not affect factual accuracy. LMT's exclusion of retiree benefits from segment operating profit is accurately described, including the rationale tied to management performance evaluation. (2) All numeric values—$255 million and $39 million—are correct and match the ground truth. The time frame (2020 to 2021) is accurate.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across UNP (tax asset treatment) and LMT (segment profit exclusion), drawing a valid comparison between their accounting treatments. The conclusion about differing approaches—UNP reflecting retiree benefits in tax assets vs. LMT excluding them from operational metrics—is logically supported. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the quantitative change at UNP and the qualitative contrast with LMT’s accounting policy.

      "original_answer": "Gilead's fair value of the liability related to future royalties from the Immunomedics acquisition was $0.9 billion, while Eli Lilly paid $924.7 million for the acquisition of a manufacturing facility.

This comparison suggests that both companies made significant financial commitments in 2024, but Gilead's obligation is a contingent liability tied to future royalty payments, whereas Lilly's commitment was an upfront asset purchase. The slight difference in amounts reflects the nature of the obligations: Gilead's liability is a long-term, performance-based obligation, while Lilly's payment was a one-time capital expenditure.",

The date (December 31, 2024) and event timing (May 2024 acquisition) are consistent with the context. (2) Quantitatively, all figures are accurate and correctly formatted; the $75.3 million difference implied between $900 million and $924.7 million is not explicitly stated in the LLM answer, but the individual numbers are correct and allow for accurate comparison. The LLM does not make the explicit calculation of the $75.3 million difference, which is present in the ground truth, but this omission does not distort the comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (Gilead and Eli Lilly), two distinct transactions (a contingent liability vs. an asset purchase), and interprets the nature of each financial commitment. It appropriately highlights the qualitative difference in the types of obligations—contingent royalty liability versus upfront capital expenditure—adding analytical depth beyond the ground truth. (4) While the original answer emphasizes the slight excess of Gilead's commitment, the LLM focuses more on the structural difference in commitment types, which is valid and insightful. This shifts emphasis but does not reduce accuracy. The answer is semantically equivalent in factual content and superior in contextual interpretation, warranting a high score.

      "question": "How does the difference in the treatment of pension expenses under FAS and CAS standards impact the FAS/CAS operating adjustment amounts reported by LMT and RTX, and what does this imply about their respective U.S. government contract cost recovery mechanisms?",
      "original_answer": "The difference in pension expense treatment under FAS and CAS standards leads to a divergence in cost recognition patterns between financial reporting and government contract pricing. LMT reports a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million in 2021, which reflects the difference between CAS expenses (used in pricing contracts) and FAS service costs (used in GAAP financial reporting). RTX explains that CAS pension expense includes service cost and amortization of demographic or economic variances, and is only recognized for unfunded plans, whereas FAS pension expense includes service cost and is generally recognized for all plans. This implies that both companies must reconcile these differences to recover pension costs through U.S. government contracts, with RTX noting that changes in plan funding status can directly affect CAS expense and thus the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in pension expense treatment under FAS and CAS standards impacts LMT and RTX's FAS/CAS operating adjustments, with CAS expenses being higher due to recognition of underfunded pension liabilities. For LMT, the 2021 FAS/CAS adjustment was $1,796 million, reflecting a $741 million increase in CAS expense (driven by the Raytheon Merger) and a $51 million increase in FAS service cost. Similarly, RTX's 2021 adjustment was $1,796 million, also tied to the Raytheon Merger. This implies that U.S. government contracts allow recovery of CAS expenses (higher than FAS expenses), enabling these companies to recognize favorable adjustments. The adjustments highlight that CAS-based cost recovery mechanisms enable firms to offset higher pension costs under CAS, which are not fully captured under FAS, thereby affecting reported operating profits.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the quantitative details. The ground truth states that LMT's 2021 FAS/CAS operating adjustment was $1,960 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $1,796 million. Additionally, the LLM claims RTX's 2021 adjustment was also $1,796 million, which is not supported by the original answer—RTX's actual adjustment amount is not specified in the ground truth. The LLM fabricates specific drivers such as a '$741 million increase in CAS expense' and '$51 million increase in FAS service cost' tied to the Raytheon Merger, which are not present in the original answer. (2) These numerical errors severely undermine the quantitative accuracy. While the format of numbers is acceptable (e.g., using millions), the values themselves are incorrect or invented. There is no verification that the sum or difference of these fabricated numbers equals the reported adjustment, and the merger's impact is not mentioned in the ground truth. (3) The reasoning partially captures the conceptual difference between FAS and CAS—namely that CAS affects government contract cost recovery and includes different components (e.g., amortization of variances, treatment of unfunded plans). However, the LLM incorrectly implies that both companies have the same adjustment amount and attributes it to the Raytheon Merger, which distorts the multi-hop synthesis. The original answer emphasizes that RTX explains CAS includes service cost and amortization of variances and is only for unfunded plans, while FAS applies more broadly—this nuance is underdeveloped in the LLM response. (4) Despite the factual errors, the answer remains contextually relevant by addressing the core issue: how FAS/CAS differences impact operating adjustments and government cost recovery. It correctly infers that CAS-based recovery allows higher cost recovery than FAS, which aligns with the implication in the original answer. However, due to major quantitative inaccuracies and some fabricated details, the overall correctness score is low.",

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) experienced structural refranchising activities in Asia Pacific during 2024, including the refranchising of bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023, and in territories in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines in early 2024. These refranchisings were included as structural changes in the analysis of net operating revenues and impacted the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. KO distinguishes between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume, noting that structural changes typically do not affect consolidated unit case volume, which reflects all sales of Company beverage products regardless of ownership interest in the bottling partner. In contrast, Altria (MO) incorporates volume growth rates as a key assumption in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the NJOY transaction, particularly for future growth opportunities in the e-vapor category. MO used an income approach with Level 3 fair value inputs, including discounted cash flow analyses based on volume growth projections and operating margins, and amortizes these intangible assets over approximately 18 years. This reflects a forward-looking financial valuation approach, whereas KO’s use of volume growth is operational and tied to current structural changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca-Cola's structural refranchising in Asia Pacific (e.g., Philippines, Bangladesh, India) primarily impacts unit case volume reporting by excluding refranchised operations from Bottling Investments' consolidated volume, as noted on pages 46-47. This activity does not directly influence valuation assumptions for intangible assets. In contrast, Altria (MO) explicitly incorporates volume growth rate assumptions into the valuation of acquired e-vapor intangibles (e.g., NJOY's developed technology and trademarks) using discounted cash flow analyses, as detailed in Note 3 (pages 65-69). Altria's valuation of e-vapor assets relies on projected volume growth and regulatory outcomes, whereas Coca-Cola's refranchising affects operational volume metrics but not intangible asset valuations.",

Quantitatively, the answer does not include specific dates such as the January 2023 refranchising in Vietnam mentioned in the ground truth, which is a minor omission. However, it correctly identifies the 2024 refranchising in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. The LLM accurately notes that Coca-Cola's refranchising affects reporting in the Bottling Investments segment and that structural changes do not impact consolidated unit case volume—though it slightly mischaracterizes this by implying volume is excluded, whereas the ground truth clarifies that consolidated unit case volume still reflects all sales regardless of ownership. This is a subtle but important nuance, leading to a minor deduction in qualitative accuracy. On the Altria side, the LLM correctly identifies the use of volume growth projections in discounted cash flow analyses for NJOY intangibles, Level 3 inputs, and amortization over approximately 18 years (though the latter is omitted, it's not mentioned in the LLM answer). The reference to regulatory outcomes adds context not in the ground truth but is plausible and not incorrect. The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts KO’s operational use of volume metrics with MO’s forward-looking valuation approach. Wording differs but meaning is semantically close. No calculation errors.

      "original_answer": "Disney faces potential monetary fines from FCC violations related to its television broadcasting operations, which include the licensing of stations that must be renewed every up to eight years. Non-renewal or revocation of these licenses due to violations could result in significant financial penalties and operational disruptions. Meta, on the other hand, is subject to substantial monetary remedies from non-compliance with its FTC consent order and other global privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. The FTC has already initiated proceedings seeking significant modifications to the consent order, including restrictions on data usage and potential board changes, which could lead to costly compliance adjustments and monetary penalties. While both companies face exposure to regulatory fines, Meta's liabilities appear broader and more complex due to the global nature of its regulatory obligations and the potential for sweeping operational changes.",

While these risks could impact operations, the documents emphasize uncertainty in future outcomes and no specific financial exposure figures. In contrast, Meta faces ongoing FTC compliance challenges, including past settlements, active litigation, and potential fines or operational restrictions under laws like COPPA and antitrust regulations. Meta's risks are more directly tied to financial penalties, changes in business practices, and revenue impacts from data privacy and advertising regulations.

The LLM reverses the interpretation: it assigns the higher value to GM when in fact Lowe's has the much higher per-unit value. (2) Calculations are also flawed. For example, 52,000 units × $205.94 = ~$10.7 million, not $25.6 million; similarly, combining disparate unit types with incorrect fair values invalidates the totals. The LLM appears to fabricate unit counts (e.g., 52k, 80k) not present in the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is poorly executed: the model fails to correctly retrieve and synthesize data across the two companies and misattributes compensation strategy implications. It incorrectly concludes GM emphasizes high-value performance awards when the data shows GM’s forfeitures had a much lower average value. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses both parts of the question (total value and strategy implications) and attempts qualitative analysis. However, due to severe quantitative inaccuracies and flawed reasoning, the overall correctness is very low. Minor credit is given for attempting a structured response and discussing equity strategy concepts.",

      "original_answer": "LMT reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million in 2021, while RTX reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,796 million in the same year. These adjustments contributed directly to each company's consolidated operating profit. For LMT, the adjustment was a reconciling item added to the total business segment operating profit of $7,379 million, resulting in a consolidated operating profit of $9,123 million. For RTX, the FAS/CAS adjustment was added to the total segment operating profit of $6,050 million, contributing to a consolidated operating profit of $4,958 million after accounting for other corporate expenses and acquisition adjustments. The mechanism involves the FAS/CAS adjustment reconciling segment-level accounting to consolidated financial reporting under U.S. GAAP, thereby directly influencing the final profitability metrics of both companies.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in FAS/CAS operating adjustments between Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) in 2021 impacts their consolidated operating profits by reflecting the reconciliation of pension costs under U.S. GAAP (FAS) and U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). LMT's adjustment was **$1,960 million**, while RTX's was **$1,796 million**. This difference of **$164 million** means LMT's consolidated operating profit was higher by this amount due to the favorable FAS/CAS adjustment, which accounts for the difference in pension cost recognition between FAS (which includes service costs) and CAS (which includes total pension costs). The adjustment is a non-operational item added to segment results to arrive at consolidated operating profit, effectively increasing LMT's consolidated profit more than RTX's.",

These numbers match the ground truth exactly, satisfying quantitative accuracy. (2) However, the LLM incorrectly implies that the entire difference in FAS/CAS adjustments directly translates into a $164 million higher consolidated operating profit for LMT compared to RTX. This is misleading because consolidated operating profit is not solely determined by the FAS/CAS adjustment. According to the ground truth, LMT’s consolidated operating profit was $9,123 million (segment profit $7,379M + adjustment), while RTX’s was $4,958 million — but RTX’s lower consolidated profit results from higher corporate expenses and acquisition adjustments, not just the FAS/CAS difference. The LLM fails to mention these critical offsetting factors, especially that RTX’s total segment profit was $6,050M, yet consolidated profit was *lower* than segment profit, indicating significant post-adjustment deductions. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in explaining the mechanism — that FAS/CAS adjustments reconcile pension costs between accounting standards and are added to segment profits — but it oversimplifies the path to consolidated profit by ignoring other deductions (especially for RTX). The multi-hop synthesis is incomplete: while it connects FAS/CAS to consolidated profit, it does not fully reconcile how RTX’s lower adjustment and additional expenses lead to a lower final profit. (4) Scores reflect high factual accuracy in numbers (10), strong relevance to the question (9), but a deduction in qualitative accuracy (7) due to incomplete and slightly misleading reasoning about the financial outcome.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the total confirmed invoice values for KO ($5,105 million) and MO ($563 million), and accurately calculates the difference of $4,542 million. These quantitative figures are correct and match the ground truth. However, the LLM makes an error in the second part regarding net reduction in confirmed obligations. According to the ground truth, MO had a net *increase* of $9 million (from $119M to $128M), which the LLM correctly identifies as an increase but inaccurately quantifies as $9 million instead of the correct $9 million increase (128 - 119 = 9), so this part is actually numerically correct. However, the ground truth states MO's reduction was -111 million (implying a $111M increase), which contradicts the calculation from $119M to $128M (a $9M increase). This suggests a possible error in the ground truth explanation. Given the numbers provided in the ground truth (MO: $119M to $128M), the correct net change is +$9M, which the LLM reports correctly. Therefore, the LLM answer is actually quantitatively accurate. The confusion arises from the ground truth stating 'MO reduced its obligations by $111 million (from $119 million to $128 million)', which is mathematically incorrect—this is a $9M increase, not an $111M reduction. Assuming the ground truth contains an internal inconsistency and the actual values are what matter, the LLM correctly computes the change as a $9M increase. Thus, the LLM answer is factually correct based on the numbers. (2) All numbers are accurate: KO obligations decreased from $1,421M to $1,330M = $91M reduction (correct), MO increased from $119M to $128M = $9M increase (correctly reported by LLM). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies and two financial metrics (confirmed invoices and obligations), correctly compares them, and draws valid conclusions. (4) The correctness score is 7 due to potential ambiguity in the ground truth; however, upon closer inspection, the LLM appears to be factually accurate. If the ground truth contains an error in describing MO's change as a 'reduction of $111 million', then the LLM should be considered fully correct. Given the possibility that the ground truth has a typo, and the LLM matches the actual arithmetic from the stated values, the scores reflect high accuracy with minor concern about interpretation.",

In contrast, Eli Lilly (LLY) faces civil monetary penalties stemming from non-compliance with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly its new manufacturer discount program under Medicare Part D, which begins in 2025. The IRA-mandated penalties could significantly affect LLY’s revenue, especially for products like Jardiance, which is subject to a 66% discount under the government price-setting mechanism starting in 2026.

Additionally, Gilead faces penalties from counterfeit drug enforcement actions, such as seizures of illegally diverted medications, which could result in fines and reputational harm. **Eli Lilly** similarly references the IRA’s penalties for non-compliance with rebate and pricing requirements but also emphasizes risks from **340B program investigations** (involving hospital discounts) and the **BIOSECURE Act**, which could disrupt supply chains via restrictions on foreign-owned entities. These differences reflect Gilead’s focus on pricing regulations and counterfeit enforcement, while Lilly’s risks stem from 340B compliance, supply chain legislation, and broader regulatory scrutiny.

However, Offshore Wind faced higher losses from the Haliade-X ramp-up. In contrast, Union Pacific's Bulk and Industrial segments experienced revenue declines: Bulk revenues fell 3% due to lower fuel surcharges, volume drops, and negative mix effects (e.g., reduced coal and food shipments), while Industrial revenues rose slightly but were offset by decreased lumber and paper shipments.

While it correctly identifies that GE's Renewable Energy segment saw growth and Union Pacific faced negative mix effects, the specific financial figures and drivers do not align with the ground truth. The LLM states GE Renewable Energy revenue was $15.05 billion in 2023, but the original answer does not provide a total revenue figure—only a $5.7 billion (22%) increase. This $5.7B increase is misrepresented as total revenue, which is a major quantitative error. Additionally, the LLM introduces segment profit losses ($1.4B loss in 2023 vs $2.2B in 2022) and attributes them to IRA benefits and Offshore Wind losses, which are not mentioned in the ground truth and represent fabricated details. For Union Pacific, the LLM cites a 3% revenue decline in Bulk and carload changes (down 1%, up 1%), but the original answer does not include percentages or carload statistics—only qualitative descriptions of mix effects (e.g., fewer food shipments, shift to short-haul rock). These numbers are unsupported and likely incorrect. (2) The $2 billion HVDC agreement in Grid Solutions—a key positive mix driver for GE—is entirely omitted. This is a critical multi-hop detail that directly supports the revenue mix shift. Similarly, the ground truth emphasizes that Union Pacific’s freight revenues declined despite volume increases, highlighting the severity of negative mix effects, but the LLM fails to convey this counterintuitive point. (3) The reasoning structure is partially sound: the LLM correctly contrasts positive mix at GE with negative mix at Union Pacific and attempts to link business drivers to performance. However, it fails to synthesize the correct multi-hop evidence—especially the $2B HVDC deal and the $5.7B revenue increase—and instead invents financials and cost dynamics not present in the source. (4) Scores reflect that while the general direction of the answer is relevant and the companies and segments are correctly identified, the core quantitative claims are inaccurate or invented, and key evidence is missing.

(1) Quantitatively, the percentages for ABT (0.4%) and GILD (2.5%) are accurate, and the calculated difference of 2.1 percentage points is correct (2.5 - 0.4 = 2.1). The use of '2.1%' is semantically equivalent to '2.1 percentage points' in this context, as it refers to a difference in rate contributions. (2) The answer addresses both parts of the question: the numerical difference and its implication regarding state-level tax burdens. (3) Entities are correctly identified—ABT and GILD, the metric 'State Taxes, Net of Federal Benefit', and the year 2021 are all accurate. (4) The reasoning is sound: the higher contribution for GILD indicates a greater impact from state-level obligations, while ABT’s lower contribution suggests a lighter burden, which aligns with the ground truth interpretation. The inclusion of source references (Note 14 for ABT, page 102 for GILD) adds credibility and traceability.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a significant quantitative error in the LMT FAS/CAS adjustment increase. The ground truth states a $75 million increase for LMT, but the LLM reports $84 million (calculated as $1,960M - $1,876M). This discrepancy affects the combined total: the correct combined increase is $765 million ($75M + $690M), while the LLM calculates $774 million, which is incorrect due to the wrong LMT delta. The RTX figure of $690 million is accurate. (2) Calculations: The LLM performs a correct arithmetic operation based on its cited numbers, but the source data appears flawed. The $1,960M and $1,876M figures for LMT are not supported by the ground truth, which only specifies the year-over-year difference. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that the total increase is the sum of the two companies' changes and that this adjustment positively impacts operating profit—this synthesis across LMT and RTX is sound. It also correctly notes the direction of impact (positive). However, it omits RTX's specific explanation about the Raytheon Merger being a primary driver, which was part of the original answer and adds important qualitative context. (4) Despite the incorrect numbers, the structure, entity identification (LMT, RTX), metric (FAS/CAS operating adjustment), and time frame (2021 vs 2020) are all correct. The answer remains contextually relevant and logically organized, but the numerical inaccuracies—especially in the LMT delta and the resulting total—reduce factual reliability.

      "original_answer": "KO evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering forecasted taxable income, the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, and indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings, which affects whether a valuation allowance is needed. WMT also assesses realizability of deferred tax assets by analyzing future taxable income sources, including the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and holds $32.4 billion in net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, some of which will expire if unused. Therefore, the reversal of taxable temporary differences plays a key role in both companies' determination of whether deferred tax benefits will be realized, with WMT's large carryforwards and KO's indefinite reinvestment strategy both influencing the need for valuation allowances.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of the reversal of taxable temporary differences impacts the realizability of deferred tax assets for both KO and WMT as follows:  \n\nFor **KO**, indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings means the Company does not recognize U.S. deferred tax liabilities on the excess book basis over tax basis of foreign subsidiaries, as the temporary differences are deemed indefinitely unreversible. This affects the realizability of deferred tax assets tied to these earnings, as the Company assumes future taxable income will arise from the indefinitely reinvested earnings, reducing the need for valuation allowances.  \n\nFor **WMT**, the $32.4 billion in net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards requires evaluation of future taxable income, including reversals of taxable temporary differences. The realizability of deferred tax assets depends on whether these reversals, combined with forecasted earnings, will allow the Company to realize the carryforwards. WMT maintains valuation allowances of ~$7.4 billion, reflecting uncertainty about future profitability, but reversals of temporary differences could reduce these allowances and enhance realizability.  \n\nIn summary, KO’s indefinite reinvestment reduces deferred tax liabilities and supports realizability of deferred tax assets, while WMT’s deferred tax assets depend on future taxable income and reversals of temporary differences, with valuation allowances mitigating uncertainty.",

WMT's $32.4 billion in net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards is correctly stated, and the discussion of valuation allowances (~$7.4 billion) is factually consistent with known disclosures (though this specific number is not in the original answer, it is plausible and does not contradict it). (2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent: the $32.4 billion figure is correctly cited, and no incorrect numbers are introduced. The ~$7.4 billion valuation allowance, while not in the original answer, is a reasonable addition from actual WMT filings and enhances detail without error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how reversal of taxable temporary differences affects deferred tax asset realizability for both companies, links KO’s indefinite reinvestment to reduced need for valuation allowances, and ties WMT’s carryforwards to future taxable income and reversals. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with slightly more detail (e.g., mentioning the $7.4B allowance), but no factual deviation.

This involves significant judgment in estimating future utilization, overhaul timing, and cost changes, with audit procedures including retrospective reviews and specialist evaluations. GE also follows ASU 2018-12 (LDTI) for future policy benefits, which requires current assumptions on long-duration contracts, including $26,832 million in long-term care liabilities. UNP, on the other hand, accounts for personal injury liabilities under FELA, recording accruals at the low end of a probable range when outcomes are uncertain, with a disclosed range of $383 million to $494 million.

The dollar amounts match the ground truth exactly, and the reference to audit procedures and judgment in estimates is accurate. However, the LLM incorrectly cites ASC 450 for UNP instead of referencing FELA (Federal Employers Liability Act), which is the statutory basis for the liability, even though ASC 450 governs the accounting for contingencies. This is a notable but not critical error in accounting standards citation. Additionally, the LLM omits GE’s reference to ASU 2018-12 (LDTI) and the specific $26,832 million long-term care liability figure, which is a significant omission in completeness. (2) Quantitatively, the $383M–$494M range is correctly reported with acceptable formatting. The missing $26,832 million figure from GE’s disclosures reduces quantitative completeness, but no incorrect numbers are presented.

In contrast, Abbott Laboratories generally expensed IPR&D costs as incurred unless the project had an alternative future use.

The total combined increase is stated as $336 million, but the ground truth is $1,418 million. The individual contributions are reported as $168 million each (50% each), but the correct values are $282 million (19.9%) for AVGO and $1,136 million (80.1%) for CSCO.

(2) The LLM claims both companies had a $168 million increase based on a comparison of $4,394 million in 2022 vs. $4,226 million in 2021, but this figure does not align with the actual beginning balances of deferred tax assets for either company in the knowledge graph. There is no evidence that these specific numbers ($4,394M and $4,226M) are correct for either AVGO or CSCO, and the resulting $168M difference per company is factually wrong. The total increase of $336M is therefore also incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model should have retrieved the beginning balance of deferred tax assets for AVGO and CSCO in fiscal years 2021 and 2022, computed the year-over-year increase for each, summed them, and calculated percentage contributions. Instead, it appears to have either used incorrect data points or misidentified the metric entirely (possibly confusing net deferred tax assets with beginning balances).

      "question": "How do the equity correlation ranges used by BAC in valuing long-term debt and by MS in valuing equity derivatives reflect differences in their exposure to market co-movement risk?",
      "original_answer": "BAC uses an equity correlation range of 5% to 97% with a weighted average of 25% for valuing long-term debt, while MS reports an equity correlation range of 25% to 97% with a weighted average of 49% for equity derivatives. This indicates that MS, on average, assumes a higher degree of co-movement between its equity instruments and broader market indices compared to BAC’s assumptions for its debt instruments. The higher average equity correlation in MS’s valuations suggests a greater sensitivity to market co-movements in its equity derivatives portfolio, which may reflect different risk exposure profiles or valuation strategies between the two firms.",
      "llm_answer": "BAC's equity correlation range for long-term debt (5% to 97%, average 25%) reflects lower exposure to market co-movement risk compared to MS's equity derivatives (25% to 97%, average 49% in 2023). BAC's narrower range and lower average suggest reduced reliance on equity market co-movement for valuing long-term debt, while MS's higher average equity correlation indicates greater sensitivity to market co-movement in its equity derivatives, reflecting higher exposure to correlated equity price movements.",

These match the original answer exactly, with no calculation or reporting errors. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—numbers, ranges, and averages are all correct and properly attributed. Format variations (e.g., 'average 25%' vs 'weighted average of 25%') are semantically equivalent and acceptable. (3) The reasoning is sound and captures the multi-hop comparison: it correctly infers that MS assumes higher co-movement risk in its equity derivatives than BAC does in its long-term debt valuations, linking higher average correlations to greater sensitivity to market co-movements. The mention of '2023' in the LLM answer is an addition not present in the original, but since the ground truth does not specify a year and the knowledge graph likely reflects the most recent filing, this does not constitute a factual error but a minor assumption. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, fully addressing the question about how correlation assumptions reflect differences in market co-movement risk exposure. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slight over-assumption of the year (2023), though this does not detract significantly from the overall correctness. Semantic equivalence is maintained, and the core insight—that MS has higher exposure due to higher assumed correlations—is accurately conveyed.",

      "original_answer": "The combined consolidated operating income of Amazon and McDonald's in 2024 is $79.3 billion. Amazon reported a consolidated operating income of $68.6 billion, while McDonald's reported $11.7 billion.

McDonald's operating margin for 2024 was **45.17%** (calculated as $11.70 billion operating income divided by $25.90 billion net sales), which is **lower than AMZN's 86.1% growth rate** in consolidated operating income (from $36.85 billion in 2023 to $68.59 billion in 2024).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains minor numerical discrepancies compared to the ground truth. The combined operating income is reported as $80.29 billion, while the ground truth is $79.3 billion. This stems from a slight overstatement of Amazon's operating income ($68.59B vs $68.6B — negligible) and McDonald's ($11.70B — correct). However, the sum should be $80.29B only if both figures are exact; the ground truth uses rounded figures summing to $79.3B, suggesting possible rounding differences in presentation. (2) McDonald's operating margin is calculated as 45.17% based on $11.70B / $25.90B net sales. The ground truth states 45%, which aligns with rounding. The AMZN growth rate is calculated as (68.59 - 36.85) / 36.85 ≈ 86.1%, while the ground truth reports 85% (using $36.9B to $68.6B: (68.6 - 36.9)/36.9 ≈ 85.9%). Thus, both calculations are accurate within rounding tolerance. The LLM uses more precise inputs, leading to slightly higher percentages. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts operating income for both, computes the sum, retrieves or infers net sales for MCD to compute margin, and calculates year-over-year growth for AMZN. It then correctly compares the 45.17% margin to the 86.1% growth rate, concluding the former is lower — consistent with the ground truth. (4) The correctness score is 8 due to minor over-precision and a small deviation in the combined total, likely from unrounded inputs not reflected in the original answer. Quantitative accuracy is 8 because numbers are very close but not fully aligned with the provided ground truth figures. Qualitative accuracy is 9 — reasoning is excellent, entities and metrics are correct, and synthesis across years and companies is accurate. Contextual relevance is 10 — the answer fully addresses all parts of the multi-part question with appropriate detail.",

In contrast, while AMD discloses its policy to record ROU assets and lease liabilities for both operating and finance leases, it does not provide specific dollar amounts for its ROU assets in the provided excerpt. This reveals that Apple offers greater quantitative transparency regarding its lease obligations, whereas AMD's disclosure is primarily qualitative and policy-focused. The difference highlights varying levels of detail in lease accounting disclosures between the two companies, which could impact investor understanding of their balance sheet strength and lease-related risks.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple provides detailed disclosures on right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities, including specific figures for operating ($10,417M) and finance leases ($952M) as of 2022, along with lease liability maturity schedules, discount rates (2.3%), and future lease payments ($1.2B). This reflects high transparency. AMD’s disclosures are more general, mentioning ROU assets and liabilities without detailed breakdowns or maturity schedules, suggesting less granular transparency.

It also accurately references Apple’s additional disclosures such as discount rates (2.3%) and future lease payments ($1.2B), which, while not in the original answer, are factually consistent with Apple’s 2022 10-K and enhance transparency—this does not contradict the ground truth. AMD’s lack of specific ROU asset figures is correctly noted, and the characterization of its disclosure as general and policy-focused aligns with the original answer. (2) All numeric values are accurate and properly attributed. No calculation errors. The total ROU asset value for Apple ($11,369M) is implied by the sum of the two components, though not explicitly stated in the LLM answer—this is a minor omission but not incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Apple’s quantitative, detailed lease disclosures with AMD’s qualitative approach, synthesizing information across both companies’ reporting practices to assess transparency. The conclusion about differing levels of accounting transparency is logically supported. (4) The LLM answer conveys the same core information as the ground truth with high fidelity, adds contextually appropriate details (e.g., discount rate), and maintains semantic equivalence.

However, it incorrectly calculates BAC's excess over the regulatory minimum. The ground truth states BAC's required ratio is 21.5%, so the correct excess is 29.0% - 21.5% = 7.5 percentage points. The LLM instead uses the 18% minimum (applying it universally) and computes 29.0% - 18% = 11.0%, which is factually wrong because different firms have different requirements. (2) While all input numbers are accurate, the calculation of BAC's excess margin is incorrect due to misapplication of the regulatory minimum. MS's excess (55.0% - 18.0% = 37.0%) is correctly calculated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is correctly retrieved for both companies and time periods (Q4 2023 for BAC, Dec 31, 2023 for MS), and the comparison between the two firms' excess margins is structured logically.

      "original_answer": "GD's post-retirement benefit obligations require significant future contributions, as seen by the $241 million required in 2025, which creates a defined short-term liquidity need. In contrast, GE's obligations are not only subject to required contributions but also to external economic factors such as interest rates and investment returns, which can increase liabilities unpredictably and create variable liquidity pressures.

GD's funded status shows a $1.7 billion pension liability in 2024, suggesting potential cash pressures to meet the 2025 contribution, whereas GE's liquidity risk stems from variable factors like discount rates and asset returns, which could amplify or mitigate obligations depending on market conditions.

However, the calculated difference is incorrect: the LLM states $423 million ($700M - $277M), while the correct difference is $410 million ($700M - $290M). Additionally, the LLM reports CVS’s total pension investments as $4.35 billion (close to the true $4,352 million), but MRK’s total is stated as $19.36 billion, which does not match the implied total from the ground truth (where $700M is 4% of total, meaning MRK’s total should be $17.5 billion). (2) Percentage calculations are also inaccurate: the LLM states CVS’s Level 3 assets represent 6.37% ($277M / $4.35B ≈ 6.37%) — this would be correct only if the inputs were accurate, but since CVS actually holds $290M, the correct percentage is ~6.66%. For MRK, the LLM reports 3.6% ($700M / $19.36B ≈ 3.61%), but the ground truth states 4%, implying a total of $17.5B.

In contrast, RTX excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment when reporting organic changes in operating profit for year-over-year comparability, treating it as a non-recurring, non-operational item to provide transparency into the underlying performance of the business.

This adjustment is detailed in the pension section and directly affects consolidated results. RTX, however, integrates the FAS/CAS adjustment into its organic cost changes and segment reviews, presenting it as part of broader cost management and segment performance evaluations.

It claims that 2022 data for AAPL and AMD is not provided, but the original answer (ground truth) clearly states specific 2022 figures for both companies, indicating the data should have been accessible. The only correct numeric value is AMD's Other Non-Current Assets at $1,478 million and its total assets at $12,419 million, which the LLM correctly identifies from what it believes is 2021 data (but should be 2022). However, it fails to report AAPL's $10,417 million in Other Non-Current Assets and incorrectly states AAPL's total assets as $11,369 million (ground truth says AAPL's total assets are much higher; this appears to be a data inversion error in the original answer, but the LLM does not attempt to report any value). (2) The combined value of $11,895 million (sum of $10,417M + $1,478M) is completely missing from the LLM response. The LLM also miscalculates AMD's percentage (says ~12%, which is close to the correct 11.9%), but this is not enough to compensate for missing AAPL's data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the question requires retrieving and comparing two companies' 2022 values, calculating percentages of total assets, and summing them. The LLM does not perform any of this synthesis, instead retreating to a 'data not available' stance despite the ground truth containing all necessary data. (4) Scores are low due to major factual inaccuracies, failure to retrieve correct data, and lack of proper calculation. The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent of the response align with the question, and AMD's data is partially correct, but overall correctness is severely compromised.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of Meta's and Netflix's 2024 purchases of property and equipment is $37.70 billion. Meta spent $37.26 billion on purchases of property and equipment, primarily to invest in servers, data centers, and network infrastructure, reflecting its focus on expanding AI and core business capabilities. Netflix spent $439.538 million on similar purchases, which is significantly lower and indicates a lesser emphasis on physical infrastructure. This difference highlights Meta's aggressive capital investment in infrastructure compared to Netflix's more modest approach, which is likely influenced by Netflix's focus on content development rather than physical assets.",

It incorrectly states that Netflix spent $37.26 billion and Meta spent $439.5 million, reversing the actual figures from the ground truth. The total sum is approximately correct at $37.7 billion (rounded from $37.70 billion), but this appears to be coincidental due to incorrect inputs. (2) The correct numbers are: Meta spent $37.26 billion and Netflix spent $439.538 million. The LLM swaps these, leading to a major quantitative inaccuracy despite the sum being close. Calculations are not properly attributed, undermining reliability. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model misattributes capital expenditures to the wrong companies, which completely undermines the comparative analysis. Instead of recognizing that Meta’s high spending reflects infrastructure investment (data centers, AI), the model falsely claims Netflix is making heavy infrastructure investments, which contradicts the ground truth. Conversely, it wrongly suggests Meta has lower spending and focuses on content, when in fact Meta spends heavily on infrastructure while Netflix prioritizes content. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to address both parts of the question—total expenditures and strategic interpretation—but the reversed data leads to incorrect conclusions. Due to fundamental errors in entity-value mapping and reasoning, the correctness score is low at 3, quantitative accuracy is 4 (partial credit for total sum), qualitative accuracy is 3 (severely flawed logic), and contextual relevance is 6 (appropriate structure and intent).",

      "original_answer": "Merck's supply constraints for ProQuad and Gardasil vaccines, along with the 3% decline in global Gardasil sales due to reduced demand in China, could lead to lower vaccination rates, potentially increasing the incidence of preventable diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, and HPV-related conditions. This, in turn, may result in higher utilization of medical services and increased claims costs for health insurers like CVS. However, CVS has stated in its 10-K that it faces limitations in detecting, forecasting, and pricing for medical cost trends, especially during periods of significant volatility in utilization and costs. The ACA and other regulations further restrict CVS's ability to adjust pricing based on these increased costs. Therefore, the combination of Merck's supply and demand issues and CVS's forecasting and pricing constraints could amplify volatility in CVS's medical cost trends, limiting its ability to take timely corrective actions and negatively impacting its operating results.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck's supply constraints for ProQuad and Gardasil, combined with lower global Gardasil demand, could increase volatility in healthcare costs for CVS's Health Care Benefits segment. These factors may disrupt vaccine availability, leading to higher costs from alternative treatments or delayed care, complicating CVS's ability to forecast and manage medical cost trends. This aligns with CVS's 10-K disclosure that pricing for experienced medical cost trends is limited by the accuracy of forecasts, which are already challenged by external events like pandemics and supply chain issues. Such uncertainties could exacerbate risks of cost overruns and margin compression in CVS's segment.",

The answer correctly references CVS's 10-K limitations in forecasting and pricing for medical cost trends due to external volatility, including supply chain issues. Quantitatively, there are no specific numbers (e.g., the 3% decline in Gardasil sales) mentioned in the LLM response, but it does not introduce any incorrect figures, so quantitative accuracy is preserved. The omission of the specific 3% sales decline and the absence of explicit mention of increased disease incidence (e.g., measles, HPV-related conditions) and their direct link to higher claims costs represents a minor gap in completeness. While the LLM implies higher costs from 'alternative treatments or delayed care,' it does not fully articulate the public health mechanism (lower vaccination rates → higher disease incidence → higher utilization) emphasized in the ground truth. However, the reasoning remains logically sound and semantically aligned with the key risk: amplified cost volatility due to supply/demand shocks and CVS's limited ability to respond. The contextual relevance is strong, as all points tie directly to the question.

Amazon reports long-term lease liabilities of $78,277 million, while McDonald's reports $13,058 million in long-term lease liabilities.

This discrepancy of $170 million suggests a minor data extraction or rounding error in McDonald's figure. (2) The calculation logic is sound—summing the two companies' liabilities—but due to the incorrect input for McDonald's, the final sum is off by $170 million. Despite this, the individual value for Amazon is exact, and McDonald's value is close, indicating partial quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (AMZN and MCD), identifies the relevant metric (long-term lease liabilities), and draws a valid comparison about their capital structures.

      "original_answer": "The 33% decline in Merck's 2024 U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet, driven by lower pricing, competitive pressures, and Medicaid rebate changes, affects CVS's Health Care Benefits segment by potentially reducing pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service demand and increasing medical cost trends. CVS notes that adverse economic conditions, including changes in drug utilization and provider behavior, can increase its costs and limit its ability to manage medical cost trends. Lower drug utilization due to reduced prescribing of Merck's diabetes medications could decrease PBM revenue for CVS while simultaneously shifting more cost burden to medical claims if alternative treatments are more expensive, thereby increasing medical costs for CVS and straining its ability to manage benefit costs and maintain profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "The decline in U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet due to competitive pressures and Medicaid rebate changes (e.g., the American Rescue Plan Act eliminating the rebate cap) reduces drug utilization and rebates, directly impacting CVS's Health Care Benefits segment.

      "question": "What is the combined total of long-term lease liabilities for Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD) as of December 31, 2024, and how does this financial obligation compare in scale between the two companies?",
      "original_answer": "The combined total of long-term lease liabilities for Amazon and McDonald's as of December 31, 2024, is $91.38 billion. Amazon's long-term lease liabilities were $78.3 billion, while McDonald's long-term lease liabilities totaled $13.058 billion. This means Amazon's lease obligations are significantly larger, accounting for approximately 85.4% of the combined total.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined total of long-term lease liabilities for Amazon (AMZN) and McDonald's (MCD) as of December 31, 2024, is **$25,776 million**. Amazon's long-term lease liabilities totaled **$12,888 million** (comprising $11,118 million in operating leases and $1,770 million in finance leases), while McDonald's reported **$12,888 million** in long-term lease liabilities (operating leases: $11,118 million; finance leases: $1,770 million).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect in terms of factual content. The combined total of long-term lease liabilities is stated as $25,776 million ($25.776 billion), whereas the ground truth is $91.38 billion—more than 3.5 times higher. Amazon's actual long-term lease liabilities are $78.3 billion, not $12,888 million ($12.888 billion), and McDonald's are $13.058 billion, not $12.888 billion. The LLM incorrectly reports identical lease liabilities for both companies, which contradicts the ground truth showing Amazon's obligations are significantly larger. (2) Calculations are flawed: the sum of $12.888B + $12.888B = $25.776B is arithmetically correct but based on false inputs. The correct sum is $78.3B + $13.058B = $91.358B ≈ $91.38B. The LLM also breaks down lease components (operating and finance) with identical values across both firms, which is implausible and unsupported by the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize data for either company. It appears to have hallucinated symmetric figures, possibly due to confusion or fabrication when actual data was not available. The comparison conclusion—that both companies have 'nearly identical' obligations—is factually wrong; Amazon's are ~6 times larger than McDonald's. (4) Scores are low because the core financial figures are grossly inaccurate, reasoning is unsound, and the synthesis across companies is invalid. Contextual relevance is slightly above zero because the answer addresses the right metric (long-term lease liabilities) and time period (December 31, 2024), but all substantive content is incorrect.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the final difference as $1,960 million, which matches the ground truth. All numbers used — RTX's $1,796 million and the combined $3,756 million — are accurate and correctly attributed to their sources. The calculation (sum and subtraction) is logically sound and numerically correct. (2) Quantitatively, all figures are accurate: RTX's adjustment ($1,796M), the implied LMT adjustment ($1,960M), and the combined total ($3,756M) align with the ground truth. The difference is correctly computed as $3,756M - $1,796M = $1,960M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound — the model correctly synthesizes data from both LMT and RTX filings and performs the required comparison. However, there is a minor conceptual error in phrasing: it states that LMT's adjustment was $1,960 million, but this value is actually the difference, not LMT's standalone adjustment. In reality, LMT's adjustment should be $1,960M (difference) = Combined ($3,756M) - RTX ($1,796M), so $1,960M is indeed LMT's value, which is correct numerically but presented confusingly. Despite this, the logic and result hold. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, fully addressing the question with proper sourcing and clear computation. The correctness score is 9 due to the slightly misleading presentation of LMT’s adjustment as equal to the difference without clarifying that they are numerically coincident but conceptually distinct.",

According to the ground truth, CL's Total Company Organic Sales Growth was 7.0%, not 8.5% as stated. PG's growth is correctly reported as 4.0%. This leads to an incorrect difference of 4.5 percentage points instead of the correct 3.0 percentage points. The Foreign Exchange impact for CL is reported as -1.0%, but the ground truth is -4.5%, a major discrepancy. PG's FX impact is correctly stated as +2.0%. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs: 8.5% - 4.0% = 4.5 percentage points is mathematically correct, but the inputs are wrong, making the conclusion invalid. The correct difference is 7.0% - 4.0% = 3.0 percentage points. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—comparing organic growth and FX impacts across two companies in their respective latest fiscal years—but relies on incorrect data, undermining the synthesis. Entity identification (CL and PG) and metric understanding (Organic Sales Growth, FX Impact) are correct. (4) Scores reflect that while the answer structure and intent are appropriate and contextually relevant, the quantitative inaccuracies in core financial figures severely reduce factual correctness.

The 5.5 percentage point difference suggests that SCHW's capital position relative to its total leverage exposure is significantly stronger than the regulatory minimum, indicating a more conservative capital management strategy or better alignment with FRB expectations for resiliency and loss-absorbing capacity under the Dodd-Frank Act and SLR rules.",

For SCHW, the consolidated SLR was **8.5%**, exceeding the minimum requirement of **3.0%**, indicating strong compliance with capital adequacy standards. Wells Fargo's SLR is not explicitly stated in the provided pages, but the difference in ratios would generally signify that a higher SLR (e.g., WFC's) suggests a more robust capital position relative to regulatory thresholds, enabling greater flexibility in capital distributions and risk management under enhanced prudential oversight.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies SCHW's SLR as 8.5% and the minimum required SLR as 3.0%, which matches the ground truth. However, it fails to state WFC's actual SLR — the original answer does not provide WFC's specific SLR value either, but the LLM incorrectly implies that WFC's SLR might be higher and uses speculative language such as 'Wells Fargo's SLR is not explicitly stated' and 'a higher SLR (e.g., WFC's)', which introduces factual inaccuracy. The ground truth focuses on the 5.5 percentage point difference between SCHW's 8.5% and the 3.0% minimum, emphasizing SCHW’s stronger capital position relative to the floor. The LLM misattributes this difference to a comparison with WFC without confirming WFC’s actual SLR, undermining the multi-hop reasoning. (2) Quantitatively, the 8.5% and 3.0% figures are accurate, and the implied difference of 5.5 percentage points is mathematically correct, though the LLM does not explicitly calculate or reference this difference. The error lies in the misinterpretation of WFC's position. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks how the difference in SLR between SCHW and WFC reflects their capital positions, implying both values must be known and compared. The LLM fails to retrieve or infer WFC’s SLR and instead speculates, breaking the logical chain. The original answer cleverly circumvents the lack of WFC’s direct SLR by contrasting SCHW’s reported ratio against the common minimum applicable to all large BHCs like WFC, thereby making a valid inference about relative capital strength. The LLM misses this nuance. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because it discusses SLR, regulatory requirements, and capital positions correctly in general terms, but the failure to accurately synthesize the comparative capital positions between the two firms — especially due to incorrect assumptions about WFC — significantly reduces factual correctness. Hence, the correctness score is 4 due to partial factual accuracy but major reasoning flaws.",

The LLM claims both companies had $30.1 billion each, totaling $60.2 billion—over 4.5 times higher than the correct total. The prior-year figures are also wrong: the LLM reports $62.5 billion for 2022, while the correct total is $12,866 million ($12.866 billion). The claimed decrease of $2.3 billion is therefore completely incorrect; the actual increase is $528 million. (2) Completeness: While the LLM attempts to address both companies and both years, it fails to report the correct metric—'Business Services Connectivity' for Comcast and 'Business' revenue for Verizon—and instead invents a composite figure not supported by the data. (3) Entity Accuracy: The companies (Comcast/CMCSA and Verizon/VZ) and years (2023 vs 2022) are correctly identified, but the financial metrics are not. The LLM appears to have confused total Business segment revenue with a breakdown that includes wireless equipment and service/other, which does not align with the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "GM Financial incorporates disposable personal income as one of several economic factors in its static pool modeling to forecast expected credit losses on retail finance receivables, adjusting the allowance for loan losses based on projected impacts of changes in this metric. Lowe’s, on the other hand, depends on disposable personal income as a core demand driver that influences homeowner spending on repairs and upgrades, particularly among millennials forming households and elderly individuals aging in place. Therefore, a decline in disposable personal income could simultaneously increase credit risk in GM’s finance receivables while reducing demand in Lowe’s home improvement market, creating dual financial pressures across both companies.",

      "original_answer": "A decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory for both Apple and AMD, leading to financial risks such as write-downs, increased production costs, and unutilized purchase commitments. Apple orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments, with manufacturing purchase obligations covering forecasted requirements for up to 150 days. If demand decreases, Apple risks forecasting incorrectly and producing excess components or products, which could lead to inventory write-downs and unutilized purchase commitments. Similarly, AMD has prepayment arrangements with certain vendors, and a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and increased production costs. AMD's reliance on long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements makes it particularly vulnerable to financial strain if demand decreases and inventory cannot be utilized. Together, these dynamics show how both companies' financial positions could be adversely impacted by a shared risk of excess inventory stemming from mismatched supply and demand.",

The LLM accurately reflects the ground truth without introducing any false information. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, or exact timeframes like '150 days') in the LLM answer, so no quantitative inaccuracies exist. The absence of the specific '150-day' forecast horizon mentioned in the original answer is a minor omission but does not detract from overall correctness, as the concept of advance ordering is still clearly conveyed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how both companies' supplier commitments and manufacturing models interact with demand volatility to create financial risk. It appropriately links prepayments and fixed obligations to reduced flexibility and increased costs under lower demand. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addressing the question about financial impacts due to demand shifts, and accurately comparing the two firms' vulnerabilities. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slight lack of specificity around Apple's 150-day obligation window, which is present in the ground truth but omitted in the LLM response. However, this does not undermine the overall correctness or usefulness of the answer.",

      "question": "How does the difference in contract mix between General Dynamics' defense segments and Lockheed Martin's contract structure influence their respective operating earnings and margin volatility?",
      "original_answer": "General Dynamics notes that operating earnings and margin volatility in its defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance, and contract mix, particularly emphasizing that contract mix refers to the proportion of higher- versus lower-margin work, which can vary based on contract type (e.g., fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development vs. production). Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, explicitly states that it operates under both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, with the latter including cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee structures. These cost-reimbursable contracts introduce variability in fees based on performance assessments or cost targets, directly affecting earnings and margins. Therefore, while both companies experience margin volatility due to contract mix, Lockheed Martin's detailed exposure to performance-based fees in its cost-reimbursable contracts introduces an additional layer of earnings sensitivity compared to General Dynamics' broader categorization of contract type and work stage impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics' defense segments experience greater operating earnings and margin volatility due to a mix of fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, with fixed-price contracts exposing them to cost overruns and margin compression during program maturity. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's contract structure, heavily reliant on U.S. Government contracts with cost-reimbursable terms and termination-for-convenience clauses, provides more stable cash flows and margin predictability, as pricing is tied to allowable costs plus fees. This difference in contract mix leads to divergent volatility profiles: GD's segments face higher margin swings from performance risks, while LMT's segments benefit from regulatory stability and reduced exposure to cost fluctuations.",

While the ground truth states that both General Dynamics (GD) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) operate under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, the LLM incorrectly implies that GD faces greater volatility due to fixed-price exposure, while LMT enjoys stability due to cost-reimbursable contracts. This contradicts the original answer, which emphasizes that LMT’s cost-reimbursable contracts—especially performance-based ones like cost-plus-award-fee—introduce *additional* earnings sensitivity and volatility, not less. The LLM flips the comparative volatility, misrepresenting LMT’s risk profile. (2) There are no numeric values in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; no calculations or figures are present, hence no errors—scored as 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize that both firms face volatility from contract mix, but LMT has an *added layer* of performance-based fee risk. Instead, it incorrectly frames LMT’s structure as more stable, which is the opposite of the ground truth. It also introduces unverified claims like 'termination-for-convenience clauses' and 'regulatory stability' not present in the original.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the combined net cash outflow of $275 million and accurately reports the individual 2024 values for COST ($136M) and MDLZ ($139M), which matches the ground truth. The year-over-year change for COST is correctly calculated as a $155M decrease (from $291M to $136M), which is accurate. However, the LLM incorrectly states that MDLZ had a $14M *increase*, when in fact the ground truth indicates a $14M *decrease*. This is a critical error in interpretation: MDLZ went from $125M in 2023 to $139M in 2024, which is an *increase* of $14M, but the ground truth explicitly states this as a 'larger year-over-year decrease', which contradicts the numbers. Upon closer inspection, the original answer contains an internal inconsistency: if MDLZ went from $125M to $139M, that is an increase, not a decrease. Therefore, the LLM correctly interprets the numerical trend (increase), while the original answer incorrectly labels it a decrease. This suggests the ground truth may have an error in reasoning. (2) All numbers are quantitatively accurate: $136M + $139M = $275M is correct; COST’s change: $291M - $136M = $155M decrease is correct; MDLZ’s change: $139M - $125M = $14M increase is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies and two years, correctly computes differences, and compares them. (4) The LLM answer is contextually relevant and complete, addressing both parts of the question. The correctness score is 7 because while the LLM's calculations and data extraction are accurate, it contradicts the ground truth on the direction of MDLZ's change—however, the LLM is actually *more* factually correct than the ground truth in this case, which mislabels the MDLZ change as a decrease. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth. Given that evaluators must follow the provided ground truth, the LLM is penalized slightly despite numerical consistency.",

The ground truth states that ADBE's unvested share-based awards fair value is $358 million, but the LLM incorrectly includes $4,039 million (RSUs) and sums to $4,397 million, which is not supported by the ground truth. Only the $358 million (performance shares) is mentioned in the original answer for ADBE. The QCOM derivative instruments are correctly reported as $271 million in assets and $346 million in liabilities, totaling $617 million, which matches the ground truth components. However, the LLM incorrectly adds ADBE's inflated $4,397 million instead of the correct $358 million. (2) Correct calculation per ground truth: $358M + $271M + $346M = $975M. LLM computes $4,397M + $617M = $5,014M — a major quantitative error due to incorrect inclusion of RSUs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure — the model identifies both companies, correct fiscal year (2022), and relevant line items — but fails in entity-level accuracy by conflating different types of share-based awards. It treats all ADBE awards (RSUs and performance shares) as unvested share-based awards without distinguishing which are included in the ground truth. The original answer only references $358 million from ADBE, likely corresponding to performance shares, not total awards. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses the right companies, metrics, and time frame, and attempts proper synthesis. However, due to the severe numerical inaccuracy and incorrect aggregation of ADBE's awards, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because reasoning structure is logical but based on incorrect data extraction.",

It also correctly states Morgan Stanley's fee growth at 8%, aligning with the original answer. However, Charles Schwab's growth rate is reported as 18.7% instead of the ground truth 18.6%—a minor rounding discrepancy likely due to internal calculation differences (from $3,492M to $4,146M: (4,146 - 3,492)/3,492 ≈ 0.1869 or 18.69%, which rounds to 18.7%).

In contrast, Amgen, which operates as a single-segment business focused on human therapeutics, reported relatively flat total product sales in 2021 (down 4% in the U.S. but up 12% globally), reflecting a more stable but less explosive growth trajectory.

Additionally, the LLM attributes Amgen's performance to 2021 with a -4% U.S. and +12% global change, which is not supported by the original answer—no such numbers were provided for Amgen. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the year is off by one (2021 vs 2022), and specific dollar amounts and percentage changes for Amgen are fabricated or misattributed.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to compare Pfizer's diversified growth strategy with Amgen's single-segment focus, which aligns with the original logic.

This method aligns with the definition provided in the 10-K filing, where ROIC is explicitly stated as NOPAT (derived from operating income adjusted for taxes) divided by the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity. A separate table on page 30 reports a **36.4% ROIC** using a different lease-adjusted NOPAT ($8,895 million) and average debt/equity ($24,418 million), but the executive summary and primary ROIC figure in the document (36.7%) reference the first calculation.",

HON's cost of products and services sold in 2021 was $457 million, representing 80.3% of its total expenses ($569 million). RTX's cost of sales was $34 million, representing 23.8% of its total expenses ($143 million). This suggests that HON has a cost structure more heavily weighted toward direct product costs, while RTX has a relatively higher emphasis on administrative and overhead expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "HON demonstrates a higher proportion of cost of goods sold (COGS) relative to total expenses, with COGS accounting for approximately 80.3% of total expenses ($457 million COGS vs. $569 million total expenses in the provided data). This suggests HON's cost structure is more manufacturing-intensive, emphasizing production costs. RTX's data is not explicitly provided in the given pages, making a direct comparison incomplete. However, based on the available information, HON's higher COGS proportion indicates a greater reliance on production costs compared to RTX's potential service or operational expense focus.",

However, it fails to include RTX's data—specifically, RTX's cost of sales ($34M), total expenses ($143M), and the resulting 23.8% proportion—stating that 'RTX's data is not explicitly provided,' which is incorrect as the original answer confirms these figures are available. This omission significantly undermines the comparative analysis. (2) The quantitative accuracy is high for HON's numbers and percentage calculation (457/569 ≈ 80.3%), but the absence of RTX's numbers means the comparison lacks completeness and balance. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in interpreting HON's manufacturing-intensive cost structure, but the failure to incorporate RTX's data breaks the multi-hop requirement of comparing both companies' cost structures. The conclusion about RTX's 'potential service or operational expense focus' is speculative without citing the actual data.

The correct combined total is $24,595 million, but the LLM calculates $22,156 million, which is incorrect. The LLM uses incorrect values: CMCSA 2021 Programming and Production Costs are stated as $6,820 million, but the ground truth value is $9,259 million; DIS 2022 is given as $15,336 million, but the correct value is $15,336 million (this one is accurate). However, DIS 2021 is reported as $15,259 million, while the correct value is $15,494 million. (2) Calculations: The sum $6,820M + $15,336M = $22,156M is mathematically correct based on the LLM's numbers, but since the inputs are wrong, the result is factually incorrect. The percentage change is calculated as a 0.5% increase, but the ground truth shows a 1% decrease. Using the LLM's numbers: ($15,336 - $15,259)/$15,259 ≈ 0.5%, which is internally consistent but based on incorrect data. The actual change from $15,494M to $15,336M is a decrease of about 1%, matching the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and two years, which shows correct structural reasoning, but fails in data retrieval. It identifies the right metric and years, but pulls incorrect values from the knowledge base. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and calculation errors.

The combined dollar value of Millwork Sales is stated as $14,071 million, but the ground truth is $13,482 million. This discrepancy arises because the LLM reports HD's Millwork Sales as $8,301 million and LOW's as $5,770 million, which sum to $14,071 million—both individual figures and the total are incorrect. The correct values from the knowledge graph are HD: $7,302 million and LOW: $6,180 million (summing to $13,482 million). Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states that LOW's percentage of Millwork Sales relative to Net Sales increased from 5.5% in 2022 to 5.9% in 2023, whereas the ground truth shows an increase from 5.9% to 6.0%. The HD percentage (5.4% in both years) is correctly reported. (2) Calculations: The sum of the reported values is arithmetically correct ($8,301 + $5,770 = $14,071), but the inputs are factually wrong, leading to an incorrect total. The percentage change for LOW is miscalculated in terms of prior year baseline. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to extract Millwork Sales and Net Sales percentages for both companies across two fiscal years and to compute a total dollar value. It synthesizes information across entities (HD and LOW) and years, showing sound reasoning structure, but uses incorrect source data. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is scored 4 due to major factual errors in dollar amounts and one company's historical percentage, though part of the qualitative comparison (HD stability, LOW increase) is directionally correct. Quantitative accuracy is 4 because key numbers are wrong, though the format and calculation logic are acceptable.

      "original_answer": "Costco projects a $370 million increase in membership revenue over the next two fiscal years, with $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025, primarily in the latter half of the year. This increase stems from membership fee hikes and higher penetration of Executive Members. Meanwhile, Mondelez notes significant cost inflation pressures, including rising raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs, which have continued to increase. Both companies address cost pressures through pricing strategies—Costco via membership fees and Mondelez through product pricing adjustments. The additional revenue Costco anticipates could help offset inflationary pressures, supporting its membership-driven profitability model. In contrast, Mondelez may need to rely more heavily on pricing actions and cost-saving initiatives to maintain profitability. These differing strategies reflect their business models and exposure to cost inflation, shaping how each company approaches profitability in a challenging cost environment.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's projected $370 million membership revenue increase will likely bolster its ability to offset cost inflation through higher top-line growth, leveraging its membership model to maintain pricing power and customer retention. Mondelez, facing rising raw material and labor costs, will focus on cost management strategies such as pricing adjustments, sourcing optimization, hedging, and operational efficiency (e.g., ERP system investments) to mitigate inflationary pressures, while also navigating currency risks and trade uncertainties. Both companies emphasize non-GAAP metrics like Adjusted EPS to guide strategic decisions amid cost and market volatility.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Costco's $370 million projected increase in membership revenue and links it to offsetting cost inflation through its membership model. It also accurately reflects Mondelez's exposure to rising raw material (e.g., cocoa) and labor costs, though it does not explicitly name cocoa as in the ground truth. The answer correctly notes both companies' use of pricing strategies—Costco via membership fees, Mondelez via product pricing and cost-saving initiatives like ERP investments. However, the LLM omits specific timing details: that $190 million of the $370 million will benefit fiscal 2025, primarily in the latter half. This is a minor but relevant omission from the original answer.\n\n2) Quantitatively, the $370 million figure is correct and properly attributed to Costco over two fiscal years. No calculations are required beyond this, and the number is accurately presented. The absence of the $190 million breakdown for fiscal 2025 slightly reduces quantitative completeness, but the total figure is correct.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes Costco’s revenue strategy with Mondelez’s cost pressures and compares their strategic responses. It correctly infers that Costco leverages membership revenue as a stable income stream to counter inflation, while Mondelez relies on pricing, hedging, and operational efficiency. The mention of non-GAAP metrics like Adjusted EPS adds contextual depth not in the original but is consistent with SEC filing language and strategic reporting practices.\n\n4) The answer is contextually highly relevant, addressing both companies’ strategies under cost inflation. While it adds some details not in the original (e.g., ERP systems, currency risks), these are reasonable inferences from typical 10-K disclosures and do not contradict the ground truth.

Intel's negative effective tax rate was primarily driven by significant tax credits and adjustments such as research and development tax credits (-11.4%), non-US income taxed at different rates (-13.4%), and foreign derived intangible income benefit (-9.7%), which collectively reduced their tax burden. In contrast, Apple's effective tax rate, although lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, was positively influenced by fewer such adjustments, resulting in a more conventional effective tax rate. This comparison highlights how different business structures, global operations, and tax incentives can lead to divergent effective tax outcomes even under the same statutory rate.",

While the negative rate is correctly attributed to excess tax benefits, the absence of exact figures for each adjustment reduces quantitative completeness. (2) The numbers for the effective tax rates are accurate and correctly formatted. But the LLM does not reproduce or reference the specific percentage impacts of each tax item, which are central to the original answer’s multi-hop analysis.

The ground truth states Morgan Stanley's 2022 residential real estate loan percentage is 27%, but the LLM reports 29% for 2024, which is incorrect in both value and year. Charles Schwab's correct percentage is 62% in 2024, while the LLM calculates 61.5%—close but not exact—and uses incorrect underlying figures ($27,813/$45,236 million), which do not appear in the ground truth. The difference in percentages should be 35 points (62 - 27), but the LLM reports 32.5, which is incorrect due to wrong inputs. (2) For allowance for credit losses (ACL), the ground truth states Morgan Stanley's ACL for residential real estate is $87 million (equal to the loan amount, implying 100% ACL-to-loan ratio), but the LLM incorrectly claims Morgan Stanley allocated 9% of its total ACL ($97M of $1,066M) to this category—this data is not in the original and contradicts the ground truth. Similarly, Charles Schwab’s ACL is stated as $15 million in the ground truth, but the LLM reports $256 million of $1,722 million total ACL (14.87%), which is entirely fabricated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to correctly identify the correct years (uses 2024 for Morgan Stanley instead of 2022), uses non-existent financial figures, and misrepresents ACL allocations. It incorrectly implies ACL percentages are based on total ACL rather than direct disclosures of ACL for the category. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure addresses the question’s intent—comparing loan percentages and relating them to ACL—but the factual foundation is severely compromised. Due to major quantitative and qualitative errors, the correctness score is low at 2, with similarly low quantitative accuracy (2) and moderate qualitative inaccuracy (3).",

(1) Quantitative inaccuracy: The ground truth states AMGN has a $1.6 billion commitment from its acquisition of Teneobio, but the LLM incorrectly attributes the $1.6B Teneobio milestone to PFE instead of AMGN. This is a critical error in entity attribution. Additionally, the LLM claims PFE has $308M (Valneva) + $748M (BioNTech) + $1.6B (Teneobio) = $2,656M in total commitments, but the question only asks for development milestone commitments specifically for AMGN and PFE as per their respective agreements, not all agreements or all types of payments. The ground truth specifies only $35M in development milestones for PFE (Valneva) and $1.6B for AMGN (Teneobio). The LLM incorrectly includes non-development milestones (e.g., upfront payments, commercialization milestones, equity investments) and misattributes the Teneobio deal to PFE when it belongs to AMGN. (2) The combined total in the ground truth is $1,635 million ($1.6B + $35M), but the LLM calculates $2,656 million based on incorrect inclusions and attributions. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: The model does not correctly identify which commitments belong to which company or which payments qualify as 'development milestones.' It conflates multiple unrelated agreements and includes data not relevant to the question. (4) Entity accuracy is poor: Teneobio acquisition is by AMGN, not PFE. AMGN is not missing development milestones—it is the one with the $1.6B commitment. PFE’s only relevant development milestone is $35M with Valneva. The LLM reverses or misassigns key facts. (5) Contextual relevance is low because the answer discusses BioNTech and other agreements not mentioned in the question or ground truth, introducing irrelevant information. Overall, the answer is largely incorrect due to fundamental misattribution of deals and inclusion of extraneous financial figures.",

The ground truth states that HD had a (0.3)% decrease in comparable average ticket, but LOW had only a 0.1% decrease—not 0.3% as claimed by the LLM. This misrepresentation of the core numerical data undermines the entire response. Additionally, the LLM introduces specific comparable sales declines (3.2% for HD, 4.7% for LOW) and transaction declines (4.6% for HD, 5.4% for LOW), none of which appear in the original answer and are not supported by the provided ground truth. The original answer mentions LOW had a 4.6% drop in customer transactions, which the LLM incorrectly assigns to HD. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM falsely equates both companies' average ticket decline at 0.3%, when in fact only HD had that decline; LOW’s was only 0.1%. The dollar figures for HD’s average ticket ($90.36 in 2022 to $90.07 in 2023) are missing from the LLM response, and the introduced percentages (e.g., 3.2%, 5.4%) are unsupported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because it builds on incorrect data. While the LLM attempts to contrast underlying sales dynamics, it does so using fabricated metrics. The original answer emphasizes that HD’s decline was slightly worse and provides exact ticket values, while LOW’s smaller ticket decline occurred alongside a 4.6% transaction drop—context the LLM distorts by swapping entities and inventing numbers. (4) Scores reflect major factual errors in numbers and entities (quantitative accuracy: 2), poor reasoning based on false premises (qualitative accuracy: 3), partial relevance in structure and intent (contextual relevance: 6), and overall low correctness due to core data mismatches (correctness: 3).",

      "question": "What is the difference in the net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance) between TSLA and HD in their respective 2023 fiscal years, and how does each company's treatment of valuation allowances reflect differing tax strategies?",
      "original_answer": "TSLA reported a net deferred tax asset of $9,882 million in 2023 after applying an $892 million valuation allowance, while HD had a net deferred tax asset of $(230) million without any mention of a valuation allowance. This results in a difference of $10,112 million. TSLA's use of a valuation allowance indicates a strategy to offset potential unrealizable tax benefits from carry-forwards and credits, whereas HD appears to recognize its deferred tax assets without such reservations, suggesting more confidence in realizing those benefits.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in net deferred tax assets (after valuation allowance) between TSLA and HD in their 2023 fiscal years is **$3.06 billion** ($6.65 billion for TSLA vs. $3.59 billion for HD).  \n\n**Tax Strategy Insights**:  \n- **TSLA** maintains a larger valuation allowance ($892 million) primarily due to uncertainty about realizing California deferred tax assets, reflecting cautious optimism about future taxable income in that jurisdiction.  \n- **HD** has a smaller valuation allowance ($67 million), indicating greater confidence in realizing its deferred tax assets, supported by its expectation of future taxable income and reduced reliance on state-specific credits.  \nThis divergence highlights TSLA’s focus on state-specific risks (e.g., California) versus HD’s broader confidence in its tax position.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in both the reported net deferred tax assets and the resulting difference. According to the ground truth, TSLA's net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance is $9,882 million, and HD's is $(230) million (a negative value), leading to a difference of $10,112 million. The LLM incorrectly reports TSLA's net deferred tax asset as $6.65 billion and HD's as $3.59 billion, which are not supported by the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM claims HD has a $67 million valuation allowance, but the ground truth explicitly states HD has no mention of a valuation allowance. These errors severely undermine the quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation of the difference is therefore also incorrect: $6.65B - $3.59B = $3.06B is not close to the correct $10,112 million ($10.112B) difference. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model fails to correctly identify and synthesize the actual figures from the two companies' filings. While the general idea of contrasting TSLA's cautious approach with HD's confidence is directionally reasonable, the specific reasoning about HD's $67M allowance and TSLA's 'cautious optimism' is based on false data. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to address both the numerical difference and the strategic implications, but the qualitative analysis is built on incorrect foundations, reducing its validity. Minor credit is given for attempting the correct structure and recognizing the conceptual significance of valuation allowances.",

      "question": "What is the combined percentage of Colgate's global workforce located in Asia Pacific and Latin America, and how does this compare to the percentage of Coca-Cola's 2024 revenue generated from the Asia Pacific region?",
      "original_answer": "Colgate's global workforce in Asia Pacific and Latin America accounts for 63% (33% + 30%), while Coca-Cola generated 21.5% of its 2024 revenue from the Asia Pacific region. Therefore, Colgate's combined workforce presence in Asia Pacific and Latin America is nearly three times greater than Coca-Cola's revenue contribution from Asia Pacific alone.",

      "question": "What are the key differences in how American Express and PayPal structure their large merchant relationships in terms of revenue recognition timing and contract duration?",
      "original_answer": "American Express recognizes discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs and typically enters into fixed-period contracts with large merchants that range from three to seven years, often with auto-renewal features. In contrast, PayPal recognizes transaction revenue at the point of service and does not disclose entering into long-term fixed contracts with large merchants. Instead, PayPal notes that large merchants generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volumes, implying a more volume-driven and less contractually bound relationship. These differences suggest that American Express relies on longer-term contractual commitments from large merchants, while PayPal’s model appears more transactional and volume-based.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express structures large merchant relationships with fixed-term contracts (typically 3–7 years) that include auto-renewal provisions, recognizing revenue on a transaction basis as fees are deducted from merchant payments. PayPal, in contrast, focuses on transaction-based revenue recognition tied to TPV and payment volume, with no explicit mention of fixed contract durations for large merchants. PayPal’s revenue model emphasizes ongoing transaction activity rather than long-term contractual obligations, reflecting a more flexible, volume-driven approach.",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 3–7 year range matches the original, and no incorrect numbers are presented. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly contrasting Amex’s contractual model with PayPal’s volume-driven, transactional approach. (4) The only minor omission is that the LLM does not explicitly state that PayPal’s large merchants pay lower rates at higher volumes, which is part of the ground truth’s rationale for calling the model 'volume-driven.'

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's and Emerson Electric's 2023 customer advance positions reflect different dynamics in their respective customer payment arrangements?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar reported customer advances of $1,929 million in 2023, indicating it had received significant payments in advance from customers for equipment or services not yet fully delivered. In contrast, Emerson Electric showed customer advances of $(897) million in 2023, representing a liability position where the company had collected customer payments in advance but had not yet fulfilled the associated obligations. These contrasting figures reflect different working capital management approaches or contractual terms with their customers, with Caterpillar maintaining a larger advance payment position while Emerson operated with a net customer prepayment liability.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar's 2023 customer advances (contract liabilities) of $1,929 million reflect its reliance on long-term contracts where revenue is recognized over time, leading to higher upfront billings. In contrast, Emerson Electric's $897 million in customer advances (contract liabilities) aligns with its model of recognizing revenue at delivery for most products and services, with smaller portions tied to long-term contracts. Emerson's lower liability also reflects the impact of acquisitions (e.g., National Instruments) and shorter-term payment terms, whereas Caterpillar's dynamics emphasize extended project timelines and phased revenue recognition.",

      "contextual_relevance": 8,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Caterpillar's customer advances as $1,929 million, which matches the ground truth. However, it misrepresents Emerson Electric's figure as a positive $897 million, whereas the original answer states it is $(897) million—a negative value indicating a liability. This is a critical error in sign/direction, turning a liability into an asset position, which fundamentally mischaracterizes Emerson's financial position. (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially correct: Caterpillar’s number is accurate, but Emerson’s is not—despite the magnitude being correct, the negative sign is essential for proper interpretation and is omitted. (3) The reasoning attempts multi-hop synthesis by linking customer advance levels to revenue recognition models and business dynamics (e.g., long-term contracts vs. point-of-sale delivery), which is contextually relevant. However, the explanation of Emerson’s lower liability due to acquisitions like National Instruments is not supported in the ground truth and introduces unverified external information. Additionally, the claim about 'shorter-term payment terms' and 'acquisition impact' goes beyond the provided data. (4) While the LLM captures the contrast in business models reasonably well and addresses the core question about differing payment arrangements, the factual inaccuracy regarding Emerson’s negative liability significantly undermines the correctness. The answer would be stronger if it acknowledged the liability nature of Emerson’s position rather than treating it as a positive advance. Thus, the correctness score is moderate due to a major factual error offset by otherwise plausible reasoning and partial completeness.",

      "question": "How do Merck's recognition of $4.0 billion in upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses and CVS's amortization of upfront payments over contract terms reflect differences in their respective business models and contractual relationships with partners?",
      "original_answer": "Merck recognized $4.0 billion in upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses in 2023 due to the nature of its pharmaceutical collaboration agreements, where such payments do not result in additional intellectual property rights and are tied to ongoing clinical studies that are highly likely to continue. This reflects a business model centered on drug development partnerships where upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In contrast, CVS defers and amortizes upfront payments received from vendors over the life of the contract based on sales volume or on a straight-line basis, depending on whether the payments are linked to purchase commitments. This reflects CVS's business model as a pharmacy services and retail provider with ongoing vendor relationships tied directly to product sales volume. The difference in accounting approaches highlights how Merck's payments are tied to development risk and innovation, while CVS's payments are tied to stable, volume-based supply chain agreements.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck recognizes upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses due to the high uncertainty of project outcomes and the likelihood of continued clinical development, aligning expenses with the period of benefit. In contrast, CVS amortizes upfront payments over contract terms, reflecting a structured, long-term partnership model where payments are tied to ongoing services and revenue streams. This divergence highlights Merck's focus on risk-adjusted R&D investment and CVS's emphasis on stable, predictable contractual obligations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly captures the core distinction between Merck's and CVS's accounting treatments and links them to their respective business models. It accurately states that Merck recognizes upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses, which aligns with the ground truth, and correctly contrasts this with CVS's amortization practice. However, it omits the specific $4.0 billion figure mentioned in the original question and ground truth, which is a notable quantitative detail even though the accounting treatment is correctly described. (2) Quantitatively, the only specific number in the ground truth is the $4.0 billion, which is missing in the LLM answer. While the absence of a dollar amount does not make the answer factually wrong, it reduces completeness, especially since the question explicitly references the $4.0 billion. No calculations are required, so no errors there. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly infers that Merck's approach reflects R&D risk and ongoing development, and that CVS's reflects long-term, volume-based contracts. However, it misses the nuance that CVS's amortization is tied specifically to sales volume or straight-line based on purchase commitments, and that Merck's payments are tied to collaborations without additional IP rights—key differentiators in the contractual relationships. (4) The correctness score is 7 because the answer gets the central idea right but lacks specific details from the ground truth. Quantitative accuracy is 10 because no incorrect numbers are stated (the omission is not a numerical error per se). Qualitative accuracy is 7 due to missing nuances in contractual terms and business model specifics. Contextual relevance is 9 as the response stays focused and relevant throughout.",

      "original_answer": "HD reports its long-term operating lease liabilities of $7,082 million directly on the balance sheet, contributing to total liabilities of $75,486 million, which reflects a transparent inclusion of lease obligations in its financial structure. In contrast, TSLA elects not to present short-term leases (12 months or less) on the balance sheet, recognizing only long-term lease assets and liabilities. This means TSLA's balance sheet may understate lease obligations compared to HD's, where all relevant lease liabilities are explicitly included, thereby affecting cross-company comparability and financial leverage ratios.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of long-term lease liabilities differs between HD and TSLA. HD recognizes **all operating leases** on its balance sheet, including both short-term (excluded by TSLA) and long-term obligations. HD's long-term operating lease liabilities are explicitly reported at **$7,082 million**, reflecting the present value of future lease payments for leases with terms exceeding 12 months. In contrast, TSLA excludes **short-term leases (12 months or less)** from the balance sheet under ASC 842, recognizing only long-term leases. This results in TSLA's long-term lease liabilities being part of a structure that omits short-term obligations, leading to a lower total lease liability on its balance sheet compared to HD.

      "original_answer": "Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations because a stronger U.S. dollar reduces the dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales, especially when it chooses not to raise international pricing. This directly affects its gross margins. Intel, on the other hand, manages gross margin volatility through its inventory valuation methodology, which involves forecasting demand and writing off excess or obsolete inventory when demand forecasts exceed actual demand. This impacts gross margins by adjusting the cost of goods sold based on inventory write-offs and manufacturing output decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations can adversely impact gross margins by affecting the U.S. dollar value of foreign currency-denominated sales and costs. Weakening foreign currencies reduce the USD value of international sales and earnings, potentially forcing price increases that may dampen demand or leaving margins lower if prices are not adjusted. Conversely, strengthening foreign currencies could lead to reduced pricing or higher component costs, also pressuring margins. Apple mitigates this through derivative instruments, though their effectiveness is limited.  \n\nIntel's inventory valuation methodology, which uses FIFO and capitalizes costs at the PRQ (Product Readiness Qualification) milestone, allows for more predictable cost allocation. By aligning inventory costs with production timelines and adjusting for market conditions (e.g., excess capacity charges, lower-of-cost-or-net-realizable-value reserves), Intel can better manage gross margin volatility. This structured approach helps stabilize costs and mitigate risks from demand fluctuations or market downturns.",

Specifically: (1) The original answer states that Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted when the U.S. dollar strengthens because foreign sales (denominated in local currencies) convert to fewer dollars, especially when Apple does not raise prices internationally—this is correctly captured in the LLM answer, though phrased more broadly. (2) However, the LLM adds mitigation via derivative instruments, which is not mentioned in the ground truth and introduces an unverified element. (3) Regarding Intel, the ground truth emphasizes that inventory write-offs (due to demand forecast errors) directly affect COGS and thus gross margins. The LLM instead focuses on FIFO, PRQ capitalization, and cost allocation practices, which are more detailed than the original and not explicitly tied to managing gross margin volatility through write-offs. While these practices are plausibly related, they shift focus from the core mechanism in the ground truth: adjusting COGS via inventory write-downs when demand forecasts exceed actual demand. (4) The LLM answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, but the qualitative accuracy is reduced because it does not correctly synthesize the specific cause-effect relationship (forecast-driven write-offs → COGS → gross margin volatility) described in the original.

However, the combined increase is reported as $12,832 million, whereas the correct sum is $12,987 million (11,128 + 1,704 = 12,832). This indicates a calculation error in the final total despite correct inputs. (2) The individual dollar increases are accurate, and the fiscal year-end data points (2023 and 2024) are correctly attributed to each company. The error lies solely in the arithmetic sum of the two increases. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly extracted and compared data across two companies and two fiscal years, computed individual changes, and correctly concluded that AVGO had the higher dollar increase. (4) Despite the minor arithmetic error in the total, the core facts and reasoning are correct, warranting a high score. The error prevents a 9 or 10 on correctness and quantitative accuracy, but qualitative and contextual accuracy remain high due to proper entity identification, metric usage, and logical flow.",

      "original_answer": "UPS's 2022 financial statements disclose specific figures for purchased transportation costs at $3,333 million (U.S. Domestic) and $3,773 million (International), highlighting a transparent and segmented approach to cost reporting. In contrast, FedEx's 2024 report does not provide specific dollar amounts but notes that lower volumes contributed to reductions in purchased transportation costs, indicating a more qualitative, volume-driven narrative. This contrast suggests that UPS emphasizes granular cost visibility and segmentation, while FedEx focuses on strategic cost optimization through volume adjustments and operational efficiencies.",

In contrast, UPS's 2022 data provides numerical details on purchased transportation costs but lacks explicit initiatives or strategies for cost optimization.

The original answer states that UPS's 2022 financials disclose specific purchased transportation costs ($3,333M U.S. Domestic and $3,773M International), but the LLM answer does not mention these figures at all, failing to acknowledge UPS's quantitative transparency. Instead, it incorrectly claims that FedEx's 2024 disclosures highlight 'structured fuel cost management' and the 'DRIVE program', which are not mentioned in the ground truth and represent a misattribution of details. The ground truth emphasizes that FedEx provides only a qualitative statement about volume-driven cost reductions, with no dollar amounts. The LLM invents specific programs and strategies not present in the source. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM fails to report any of the actual numbers from UPS’s disclosures and introduces unrelated concepts (e.g., fuel contracts, DRIVE program) with no numerical basis. There are no calculations in the question, but the omission of key figures constitutes a major quantitative deficiency. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the question asks for a comparison of disclosure detail and what it suggests about cost management approaches, the LLM shifts focus to unmentioned initiatives, failing to base its analysis on the actual contrast—UPS’s granular reporting vs. FedEx’s narrative, volume-based explanation. The conclusion that FedEx prioritizes 'proactive operational cost management' while UPS focuses only on transparency is speculative and not fully supported by the provided data. (4) Despite the factual errors, the LLM does address the general theme of contrasting cost management philosophies and responds to the volume-sensitive market context, maintaining some relevance.

CVS, a pharmacy benefit manager, administers prescription drug plans for health plans. Based on their respective 2023 10-K filings, how do the pharmaceutical-related operations of Merck and CVS interact within the healthcare supply chain?",
      "original_answer": "Merck develops and sells human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products to drug wholesalers, retailers, and pharmacy benefit managers as stated in its 2023 10-K filing.

      "original_answer": "Tesla manages its customer receivables through Variable Interest Entity (VIE) arrangements, where it consolidates the financial position and results of operations of these VIEs into its financial statements. Tesla's VIE agreements grant it the power to manage and make decisions affecting the operation of these entities, including managing customer receivables, while fund investors have more protective rights. In contrast, Home Depot addresses credit risk related to its customer receivables through a valuation allowance, which was explicitly stated as not being material to its consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. This indicates that Tesla assumes more direct control and operational involvement in receivables management through third-party arrangements, while Home Depot relies on internal reserves to mitigate credit risk, suggesting a more self-contained and conservative risk management framework.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla's VIE arrangements centralize credit risk management by consolidating solar energy and vehicle-related receivables into VIEs, where Tesla retains control over decision-making and guarantees certain obligations, effectively shifting risk management to structured entities while maintaining oversight. In contrast, Home Depot directly manages customer credit risk through traditional receivables practices, with provisions for potential losses and no reliance on VIE structures.

(1) It accurately captures Tesla's use of VIE arrangements to manage customer receivables, noting Tesla's control over decision-making and its oversight role, which matches the original answer. It also correctly contrasts this with Home Depot's approach of directly managing credit risk without VIEs, relying instead on internal provisions for losses. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors here. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across Tesla and Home Depot, comparing their distinct risk management frameworks—Tesla’s use of off-balance-sheet-like structures with control, versus Home Depot’s conservative, reserve-based approach. However, the LLM omits a specific detail from the original answer: that Home Depot's valuation allowance was explicitly stated as not material in fiscal 2023 and 2022. This contextual nuance strengthens the original answer’s point about conservatism and materiality, and its absence is a minor but notable gap. (4) Despite this omission, the LLM conveys the core contrast accurately and uses semantically equivalent language (e.g., 'conservative, internally managed credit risk frameworks' aligns with 'self-contained and conservative risk management framework').

      "original_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive disclosed that the estimated fair value of its long-term debt was $7,433 million as of December 31, 2024, while the carrying value was higher at $7,941 million, indicating a discount in the market valuation of its debt. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, reported a significantly higher fair value of long-term debt at $38,052 million as of the same date. Coca-Cola’s disclosure also included context about the use of interest rate swaps to manage fair value exposure due to changes in benchmark interest rates, which directly affects the valuation of its debt. Additionally, Coca-Cola extinguished $485 million of long-term debt in 2024, resulting in a $22 million gain, suggesting active debt portfolio management. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive’s disclosure focused solely on valuation methodology without mentioning active debt restructuring or hedging activities. These differences indicate that while both companies report fair value for long-term debt, Coca-Cola’s disclosures suggest a more dynamic debt management strategy involving interest rate hedging and proactive debt retirement, whereas Colgate-Palmolive’s approach appears more static in terms of valuation and reporting.",

Coca-Cola's disclosures (not fully provided here) likely emphasize similar strategies but may differ in swap usage or extinguishment frequency, though specific details are unavailable.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It incorrectly attributes Coca-Cola's interest rate swap disclosures and early debt extinguishment details to Colgate-Palmolive. Specifically, the $485 million debt extinguishment and $22 million gain in 2024 are actions taken by Coca-Cola, not Colgate-Palmolive, according to the ground truth. The LLM reverses the roles, falsely claiming Colgate used swaps and retired debt, while stating Coca-Cola's disclosures were unavailable—this is incorrect as the original answer clearly provides Coca-Cola's detailed disclosures. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the LLM assigns the correct numbers ($485M debt extinguished, $22M gain) to the wrong company. Additionally, it omits Colgate-Palmolive’s actual fair value ($7,433M) and carrying value ($7,941M) figures entirely, and fails to report Coca-Cola’s fair value of $38,052M. These are major omissions and misstatements. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires comparing two companies’ debt strategies based on disclosures about fair value, swaps, and extinguishment. The LLM fails to correctly attribute actions to each firm, breaks the logical comparison, and cannot support the conclusion due to reversed facts. It also admits Coca-Cola’s data is 'not fully provided,' which contradicts the premise that both disclosures are available. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the general topic of debt management, fair value, and interest rate swaps, but the misattribution renders the analysis invalid.

      "original_answer": "The difference in the 2024 healthcare cost trend rate assumption between DIS and VZ impacts their respective financial obligations related to postretirement medical plans by influencing the estimated future benefit payments and liabilities. VZ assumes a 2024 healthcare cost trend rate of 8.80%, which is significantly higher than the 4.50% rate to which it will gradually decline after 2034. This high initial assumption increases VZ’s projected healthcare costs and long-term liabilities. Meanwhile, DIS acknowledges that assumptions like the healthcare cost trend rate significantly affect reported net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations, though it does not specify its own rate. However, DIS also estimates $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts, which directly reduces its net future benefit payments. Therefore, while both companies are impacted by healthcare cost trend assumptions, VZ’s higher assumed rate increases its financial burden, whereas DIS benefits from subsidies that offset some of its obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in healthcare cost trend rate assumptions between DIS and VZ directly impacts their postretirement medical plan obligations. DIS assumed a 7.00% annual increase in healthcare costs, decreasing to 4.00% over 19 years, while VZ assumed an 8.80% rate for 2024, gradually declining to 4.50% by 2034. A higher trend rate (VZ's 8.80% vs. DIS's 7.00%) increases the present value of future healthcare obligations, leading to higher financial liabilities for VZ.

VZ’s 8.80% rate declining to 4.50% by 2034 is correctly stated. (2) The dollar amount related to DIS’s $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts—a key offsetting factor in its financial obligations—is entirely omitted from the LLM answer, despite being central to the original answer’s conclusion about DIS’s reduced net obligations. (3) While the LLM correctly understands the general principle that higher healthcare cost trend assumptions increase the present value of future obligations (sound reasoning), it fails in multi-hop synthesis by not incorporating DIS’s subsidy benefit, which is critical for a complete comparison. It also fabricates DIS’s trend rate instead of acknowledging the lack of specified data.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: the LLM fails to report any of the correct numbers (1.725M for KO, 0 for PEP), which are central to the comparison. There are no calculations in the LLM response, and it omits the only two numeric facts in the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The question requires comparing the existence and level of threshold awards to infer executive compensation strategy. The LLM instead shifts to discussing performance metrics (not mentioned in the ground truth), failing to synthesize the actual data about threshold vesting conditions. It does not recognize that PEP having zero threshold awards implies no guaranteed payout, which is the key insight. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer discusses PSU structures and executive compensation strategy, which are relevant themes, but it does so using incorrect and unsupported details. The conclusion about PEP being more performance-contingent is aligned with the ground truth, but it is reached through invalid reasoning and false premises. Overall, the answer misses the factual basis and reasoning path of the original, resulting in a low correctness score.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numerical values. The combined increase in Neuroscience-related sales is reported as $694 million, whereas the ground truth is $715 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect individual growth figures: the LLM states JNJ’s increase was $247 million and MDT’s $447 million (summing to $694M), but based on the original answer, JNJ’s 3.6% growth on $7.1B implies a prior-year base of approximately $6.853B, yielding a $247M increase (correct), while MDT’s 5% growth on $8,959M implies a prior-year base of ~$8,532.38M, meaning an increase of ~$426.62M, not $447M. Thus, MDT’s growth figure is overstated. The sum of $247M + $426.62M ≈ $673.6M, still not matching the stated $715M in the original answer—indicating possible rounding or data source differences—but the LLM’s $694M is closer than accurate. However, the original answer does not break down the dollar increases, so the LLM may have inferred them correctly from percentage growths. The core issue is that the combined increase in the ground truth is explicitly $715M, which the LLM fails to match. (2) The LLM incorrectly attributes MDT’s growth to 'SPRAVATO momentum,' which is factually wrong—SPRAVATO is a JNJ product (esketamine), and MDT focuses on neuromodulation technologies, not pharmaceuticals. This is a critical entity and reasoning error. Additionally, the mention of RISPERDAL/RISPERDAL CONSTA and XEPLION losses of exclusivity is not present in the original answer and introduces unverified offsetting factors, potentially confusing the contribution analysis. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM identifies both companies, correct years, and attempts to decompose growth drivers—but fails in cross-entity synthesis by misattributing JNJ’s drug to MDT’s growth narrative. This undermines the qualitative accuracy of the contribution analysis. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question: total increase and product dynamics—and uses appropriate financial and strategic terminology. However, due to the major factual error in attributing SPRAVATO to MDT and the quantitative mismatch in the combined increase, the correctness score is significantly reduced. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect dollar increases and sum; qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct identification of JNJ’s SPRAVATO driver but severe error in MDT’s driver; contextual relevance remains strong as structure and intent align well with the question.",

While it correctly identifies ACN's 2024 ($590,892,000) and 2023 ($434,179,000) values assuming 'thousands' as unit, it misinterprets TXN's values: the original answer states TXN obtained $241 in 2024 and $285 in 2023 — these are in thousands, not millions. The LLM incorrectly assumes TXN's values are in millions, leading to a massive overstatement: $241 million instead of $241 thousand. This results in a total combined 2024 value of $831.89 million instead of the correct $591,133 (i.e., ~$591 thousand). The LLM reports an increase of $112.71 million, but the correct change is a decrease of $128,046. (2) Number verification: ACN values are correctly cited in thousands (590,892 vs 434,179), but TXN values are wrong — $241 thousand ≠ $241 million. The sum $590.89M + $241M = $831.89M is mathematically correct but based on false units. The correct sum is $590,892 + $241 = $591,133 in 2024, and $434,179 + $285 = $434,464 in 2023 (not $719.18M). The correct difference is $591,133 - $434,464 = $156,669 decrease? Wait — original answer says 2023 total is $719,179, which implies ACN 2023: $434,179 + TXN $285,000 = $719,179. So TXN 2023 value must be $285,000, not $285. Therefore, TXN values are in thousands, not millions. LLM’s unit assumption is incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails due to unit misinterpretation. The model synthesizes data from both companies but applies inconsistent and incorrect unit scaling, invalidating all totals and comparisons.

The MET deposits are also miscalculated: the LLM sums $2.734B + $7.595B + $8.115B = $18.444B, but these segments do not represent total deposits for MET in 2023 according to the knowledge graph; the correct MET 2023 deposits are $18.444 billion only if those line items are valid, but they are misclassified—MET is an insurance company and does not report 'deposits' in the same way as a bank like WFC. In the knowledge graph, MET's 'deposits' likely refer to policyholder funds or liabilities, but the LLM incorrectly treats them as bank-style deposits.

It incorrectly aggregates segment-level figures for MET that may not represent total deposits and uses an incorrect value for WFC. The addition of $1.4 trillion + $18.444 billion = $1,418.44 billion is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect inputs. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer attempts the right structure and entities, but the quantitative accuracy is very low due to wrong numbers and improper metric interpretation. The qualitative accuracy is low because of incorrect entity-metric mapping and flawed synthesis across financial institutions with different reporting standards.",

However, the combined sales total is incorrect: the LLM reports $16,099 million, while the ground truth is $16,546 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect component values: the LLM states MDT's Neuroscience sales as $8,959 million and JNJ's as $7,140 million, which sum to $16,099 million. These individual figures are inaccurate per the ground truth, though their sum is internally consistent.

The combined Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) is incorrectly stated as $188,424 million instead of $189,024 (the correct sum of $188,359 and $65). More critically, the LLM incorrectly adds 'million' to Accenture's OCI ($188,359 million), which is off by a factor of one million—this is a major factual error. Similarly, Accenture’s Net Income is reported as $7,419,197 million instead of $7,419,197, again inflating the value by a million-fold. (2) Calculations: The correct combined OCI is $188,359 + $65 = $189,024. The LLM reports $188,424 million, which is both numerically incorrect and improperly scaled. The combined Net Income should be $7,419,197 + $4,799,000,000 = ~$12,218,197,000. Due to the erroneous 'million' scaling, the LLM calculates a meaningless $7,423,996 million. The resulting percentage (2.5%) is therefore completely inaccurate—the correct figure is approximately 0.25%, as stated in the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to sum OCI across both companies, compare it to Net Income, and compute a percentage. However, due to unit errors, the synthesis fails.

      "original_answer": "Boeing's financial exposure is highly sensitive to changes in gross margins, where a 1% change in margin could result in a $330 million impact on operating earnings due to its reliance on firm orders and complex estimation process for program profitability. Raytheon, with a $78 billion defense backlog as of December 31, 2023, also depends on firm orders to drive future revenue and operational planning. A decline in firm orders would reduce Raytheon’s future revenue visibility and could impact its ability to manage long-term contracts efficiently, while Boeing would face direct earnings volatility due to its margin sensitivity and program cost structures. Together, both companies face significant financial risk if firm orders decrease, though the mechanisms differ—Boeing through margin volatility and Raytheon through reduced backlog conversion.",
      "llm_answer": "The change in firm orders impacts Boeing (BA) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) differently due to their distinct business models and exposures. For **Boeing**, the $330 million sensitivity to gross margin changes reflects the risk associated with revenue recognition and cost estimates for long-term contracts, particularly in commercial aviation. Fluctuations in firm orders could alter these estimates, directly affecting operating earnings. For **Raytheon**, the $78 billion defense backlog (as of December 31, 2023) highlights its reliance on government contracts, where changes in firm orders (e.g., cancellations, delays, or new awards) could significantly impact revenue recognition and financial exposure, especially under fixed-price contracts where cost overruns may lead to losses.

For MMM, the original answer states that it broadly excludes 'special items' without specifying categories, but the LLM incorrectly lists detailed exclusions like restructuring charges, litigation, PFAS costs, divestitures, and foreign exchange impacts—none of which are mentioned in the ground truth. This contradicts the key point that MMM uses a generalized approach. For UPS, the ground truth specifies five exact exclusions including goodwill/asset impairments, a one-time supervisor compensation payment, regulatory matter expense, multiemployer pension withdrawal, and pension/postretirement plan gains/losses. The LLM instead generalizes these into categories like 'transformation strategy costs' and 'regulatory settlements,' missing the precise, itemized nature of UPS's exclusions and omitting key items like pension-related gains and losses. The reasoning is flawed because it draws incorrect inferences about MMM’s focus on 'segment-specific adjustments' and UPS’s focus on 'network optimization,' which are not supported in the original answer. While the LLM attempts a comparative analysis (contextually relevant), the factual inaccuracies in entity details and misrepresentation of the exclusion policies severely undermine the correctness. The core insight—that UPS takes a more detailed, itemized approach while MMM is more general—is lost due to the LLM fabricating specifics for MMM and oversimplifying UPS’s exclusions.

While Amazon's self-insurance liability is correctly stated as $8.5 billion, Lowe's is incorrectly reported as $1.1 billion instead of the correct $432 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $9.6 billion instead of the correct $8.932 billion. The calculation error is substantial and impacts the factual core of the answer. (2) Number verification: Amazon = $8.5B (correct), Lowe's = $432M (incorrectly stated as $1.1B), sum = $8.5B + $0.432B = $8.932B (LLM says $9.6B — off by over $700 million). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly identifies that Amazon has higher self-insurance liabilities and links this to greater risk exposure, which aligns with the ground truth reasoning. It also appropriately discusses risk types (workers' comp, healthcare, liability) and sector context. However, the flawed data undermines the conclusion's reliability. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to major quantitative inaccuracies but correct identification of companies, metric, and fiscal year, as well as reasonable qualitative interpretation. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to incorrect numbers and sum. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6) — reasoning structure is sound but based on faulty data. Contextual relevance is high (8) — the answer addresses both parts of the question and remains focused on risk exposure in the Consumer Discretionary sector.",

However, it incorrectly states Union Pacific's net tax payment as $1.801 billion (sum of Federal $1,446M and State $347M), whereas the ground truth specifies Union Pacific's net tax payment was only $12 million. This is a major quantitative error. (2) The resulting difference in tax-related cash flows is miscalculated: the LLM reports a $351 million net inflow for Boeing versus $1.801 billion outflow for UNP, implying a total difference of approximately $2.152 billion, which is incorrect. The correct difference, per ground truth, is $1,712 million ($1,700M inflow - $12M outflow). The LLM’s calculation is based on wrong inputs and flawed logic. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing tax-related cash flows between two companies in the same year—but fails due to incorrect data for Union Pacific. The model appears to have used total current tax expenses instead of net tax payments, failing to account for offsets like refunds or deferred taxes. (4) Scores reflect that while the Boeing data is correct and the structure of the answer is relevant, the critical error in UNP's tax payment amount and the resulting miscalculation severely undermine factual accuracy.

      "original_answer": "PEP reported that in 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, represented approximately 13% of its consolidated net revenue, with this revenue generated across all divisions, including concentrate sales to independent bottlers used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. Sam's Club, as a segment of Walmart, receives the majority of its non-fuel merchandise through 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically across the U.S., along with some shared Walmart U.S. distribution facilities. This robust and strategically placed distribution infrastructure enables Sam's Club to efficiently receive and stock merchandise, including PEP's products, at scale. As a result, this infrastructure supports Walmart's ability to serve as a major customer for PEP, facilitating the consistent flow of products necessary to sustain PEP's significant revenue dependency on this customer relationship.",

According to the ground truth, MMM's long-term lease obligation is $405 million and UPS's is $3,986 million (comprising $351 million finance and $3,635 million operating), totaling $4,773 million. However, the LLM incorrectly calculates MMM's long-term obligation as $756 million by summing $405 million (operating) and $351 million (finance), but these figures are actually UPS's finance lease amount and MMM's operating lease amount, respectively. The LLM confuses the breakdown between the two companies. (2) Specifically, the LLM assigns UPS's finance lease long-term obligation ($351 million) to MMM, and incorrectly computes MMM's total long-term leases as $756 million, which is not supported by the ground truth. Additionally, the LLM reports UPS's long-term lease obligation as only $3,635 million (apparently only the operating portion), omitting the $351 million finance lease component, leading to a total of $4,391 million instead of the correct $4,773 million. (3) While the LLM demonstrates correct multi-hop reasoning in concept—subtracting current obligations from total lease liabilities to derive long-term obligations—it fails in entity-specific synthesis, misattributing financial figures between MMM and UPS. This indicates a failure in accurately retrieving and aligning data to the correct company.

      "question": "Considering the different hedging strategies described by Netflix and Google, how do the impacts of their respective hedging gains of $124 million and $211 million in 2024 compare relative to their international revenue exposures, and what does this suggest about their foreign exchange risk management approaches?",
      "original_answer": "In 2024, Netflix reported hedging gains of $124 million, which were included in 'Streaming revenues' and primarily related to foreign exchange hedges on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing/production costs denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Google reported hedging gains of $211 million as part of its total revenues of $350,018 million, reflecting gains from its foreign exchange risk management activities. Netflix's hedging directly impacts both revenue and cost of revenues depending on the nature of the hedged item, while Google's hedging gains appear as a separate line item before being incorporated into total revenues. Given that Netflix's international revenue (excluding the U.S. and Canada) accounted for the majority of its streaming revenue, the $124 million gain suggests a more targeted approach to managing revenue volatility from foreign exchange movements. Google's larger hedging gains relative to Netflix, despite having a much larger revenue base, may indicate a more extensive or aggressive hedging program to manage its global exposure across multiple business lines.",
      "llm_answer": "Google's hedging gain of $211 million in 2024 represents a smaller proportion of its international revenue exposure compared to Netflix's $124 million gain, suggesting Google's hedging strategies are more effective in mitigating FX risks. Google's international revenue (51% of total revenue) was significantly impacted by FX volatility, yet its hedging gains offset a portion of these effects. Netflix's hedging gain, while smaller in absolute terms, reflects a more aggressive approach to managing FX risk, as its international exposure (larger in absolute terms) was less effectively hedged relative to Google's strategies. This indicates Google prioritizes comprehensive hedging to stabilize earnings, while Netflix may focus on selective hedging for key regions.",

While the hedging gains of $124 million for Netflix and $211 million for Google are correctly stated, the LLM incorrectly claims that Google's international revenue was '51% of total revenue'—this figure is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. Additionally, the assertion that Netflix has 'larger in absolute terms' international exposure than Google is unsupported and likely false given Google's vastly larger revenue base ($350,018 million total revenue). (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially correct: the $124M and $211M figures are accurate, but no actual calculation (e.g., percentage of revenue) is performed in either the original or LLM answer, so the LLM's implied comparison of proportions is speculative. The original answer notes Google's total revenue but does not break down international revenue numerically, making the LLM's 51% claim an unsupported addition. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The original answer emphasizes differences in accounting treatment (Netflix includes hedges in 'Streaming revenues', Google reports gains separately) and suggests Netflix’s approach is more targeted due to high international revenue share, while Google’s larger gains may reflect broader hedging across business lines. The LLM reverses the logic, claiming Google’s smaller proportional gain implies greater effectiveness and comprehensiveness, which contradicts the original inference that Netflix may be more targeted. The LLM also incorrectly frames Netflix as having a more 'aggressive' approach, while the original suggests Google may have a more extensive program. (4) The contextual relevance is fair—the response addresses hedging gains, FX risk management, and international exposure—but the incorrect data and reversed conclusions significantly undermine factual correctness. Thus, the correctness score is 4 (partially correct with significant errors), quantitative accuracy 5 (core numbers right but unsupported additions), qualitative accuracy 4 (flawed reasoning and synthesis), and contextual relevance 7 (on-topic but misinformed).",

      "llm_answer": "In 2021, approximately **13%** of PepsiCo's (PEP) consolidated net revenue came from sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club. This financial dependency is tied to Walmart's reportable segments, as Walmart's **Sam's Club segment** (a separate reportable segment) and **Walmart U.S. segment** both purchase PepsiCo products. The Sam's Club segment, which focuses on warehouse membership clubs, is a distinct segment within Walmart's structure, and its procurement from PepsiCo contributes to the overall 13% figure, illustrating how PepsiCo's revenue is interconnected with Walmart's diversified retail and club formats.",

All entities (PEP, Walmart, Sam's Club, 2021) and the percentage are accurate. (2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 13% figure is correct, and no calculations are required beyond that. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Walmart has reportable segments, specifically naming Sam's Club as one, and explains that PepsiCo’s revenue dependency ties into both the Sam's Club and Walmart U.S. segments. While the original answer focuses more narrowly on Sam's Club as evidence of structural linkage, the LLM provides a slightly broader but still accurate interpretation by acknowledging both segments. This adds context not in the original but does not contradict it. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question—percentage and its connection to Walmart’s segment structure. The only minor reason for not scoring a 10 in qualitative accuracy is that the original emphasizes the significance of the Sam's Club segment as a distinct part of the dependency, while the LLM spreads the connection across segments; however, this does not reduce factual correctness.

      "original_answer": "Cisco accounts for variability in its cooperative marketing programs by estimating expected usage of these programs, applying either the expected value or most likely estimate method, and updates these estimates at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. This directly impacts their revenue recognition, as deviations from these estimates could adversely affect revenue. Intel, on the other hand, participates in cooperative advertising and marketing programs that partially reimburse customers for marketing activities, and these expenses are accounted for as part of their operating expenditures. While Intel does not explicitly quantify the variability impact, these programs are subject to defined criteria and influence marketing spend forecasting and brand investment returns.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco and Intel account for variability in cooperative marketing programs by estimating the expected usage of such programs when recognizing revenue. Cisco recognizes revenue based on the consideration expected from contracts, including adjustments for cooperative marketing incentives, with estimates updated periodically. If actual program utilization differs from estimates, it could impact revenue and expenses, such as inventory write-downs or provisions. Intel similarly recognizes revenue from co-marketing programs, where reimbursements to customers are tied to defined criteria, and adjusts revenue based on estimated program outcomes. Variability in these estimates can affect revenue recognition and related financial statement line items, such as expenses or liabilities, depending on actual program performance.",

It correctly states that Cisco updates estimates periodically and that deviations can affect revenue and expenses, aligning with the ground truth. The mention of 'consideration expected from contracts' and adjustments for incentives reflects proper revenue recognition principles under ASC 606. However, the LLM incorrectly implies that Intel recognizes revenue from co-marketing programs, which is factually inaccurate—Intel accounts for these programs as operating expenditures (marketing expenses), not as part of revenue recognition. The ground truth clarifies that Intel’s reimbursements are treated as operating expenses and influence forecasting and returns, not revenue adjustments. This mischaracterization of Intel’s accounting treatment constitutes a significant qualitative error, though no numeric inaccuracies are present (hence perfect quantitative score). The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both companies and the financial impact, but fails in precise entity-level accounting treatment for Intel.

The omission of RTX’s adjustment for lease incentives and the differing emphasis on initial direct costs represents a significant qualitative shortcoming in fully capturing the nuanced differences in disclosure practices. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect), and the answer remains highly relevant to the question.

This severely undermines the quantitative accuracy. Boeing's indefinite liability being unquantified is correctly stated and aligns with the original answer.

      "original_answer": "Costco noted that changes in foreign exchange rates impacted their Net Sales Growth by affecting the conversion of international financial results into U.S. dollars, though no specific percentage was provided. In contrast, Procter & Gamble disclosed that foreign exchange had a 2% positive impact on their total company Net Sales Growth in fiscal year 2022. This shows that while both companies are influenced by foreign exchange fluctuations, P&G quantified the positive effect, whereas Costco described the mechanism without specifying a percentage.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's international operations reported a 10% increase in net sales for fiscal 2022, with the impact of foreign exchange rate changes fully accounted for in the reported figures. The comparable sales growth for international operations, excluding foreign currency and gasoline price effects, also showed a 10% increase, indicating no net foreign exchange impact on net sales growth. In contrast, Procter & Gamble's total company experienced a 5% net sales growth, with foreign exchange rate changes reducing this by 2% (as reflected in the 7% organic sales growth after excluding FX impacts). Thus, Costco's international operations had no foreign exchange impact on net sales growth, while P&G's total company faced a 2% negative impact.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Costco did not provide a specific percentage impact of foreign exchange on net sales growth, only noting that FX affected the conversion of international results into USD. However, the LLM claims Costco had 'no net foreign exchange impact' based on a comparison of reported and comparable sales growth both at 10%, which contradicts the original answer and introduces unsupported data. Additionally, the LLM states that Procter & Gamble's foreign exchange had a 2% *negative* impact (reducing net sales growth from 7% to 5%), while the ground truth clearly states a 2% *positive* impact on net sales growth. This reverses the actual effect and is a major factual error. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM invents specific figures—such as Costco’s 10% sales growth with and without FX, and P&G’s 5% reported growth versus 7% organic—that are not present in the original answer and contradict the known truth. The original answer does not mention P&G’s organic or reported growth rates at all, only that FX had a 2% positive impact. Thus, all numerical claims are unsupported or incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly infers that identical reported and comparable sales growth implies zero FX impact, which may not be valid without further context, and applies this to a company (Costco) for which no such data was provided in the ground truth. It also fails to correctly compare the direction of FX impact between the two companies, reversing P&G’s actual positive effect. (4) While the answer attempts to address the comparative impact of FX on both companies and is structured around the right question, the core facts and calculations are wrong, leading to an incorrect conclusion. The contextual relevance is moderate because it discusses the right companies, metric (net sales growth), and concept (FX impact), but the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine correctness.",

      "question": "How does the difference in inventory valuation practices related to excess and obsolete inventory between Cisco (CSCO) and Intel (INTC) reflect contrasting approaches to managing inventory risk given their respective supply chain commitments and audit considerations?",
      "original_answer": "Cisco (CSCO) records a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments in excess of future demand forecasts, aligning with its valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. This suggests a proactive financial recognition of inventory risk stemming from fixed supplier agreements. In contrast, Intel (INTC) emphasizes judgment and sensitivity analyses in its inventory valuation, particularly for excess and obsolete inventory, due to factors like dynamic pricing, customer forecasts, and limited historical data for new product launches. Intel’s audit process involves extensive testing of demand forecasts and pricing assumptions, indicating a more analytical and forward-looking approach to inventory risk. The $11.1 billion net inventory figure for Intel further underscores the scale and complexity of its inventory management challenges compared to Cisco’s more commitment-driven risk exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco (CSCO) and Intel (INTC) adopt contrasting inventory risk management approaches. Cisco emphasizes supply chain flexibility by maintaining higher inventory levels and purchase commitments to mitigate supply constraints, with inventory valuation tied to demand forecasts and supply chain optimization. Its audit process focuses on assessing excess/obsolete reserves through sensitivity analyses and market condition evaluations. Intel, conversely, prioritizes precise inventory valuation at net realizable value, incorporating rigorous audit testing of assumptions and market trends, reflecting a more conservative approach to minimizing excess inventory risk. These differences align with their distinct supply chain strategies and audit priorities: Cisco balances risk through procurement commitments, while Intel emphasizes valuation accuracy and market responsiveness.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains no explicit numerical errors, so quantitative accuracy is high. However, it omits the key $11.1 billion net inventory figure for Intel mentioned in the ground truth, which is a significant data point highlighting the scale of Intel's inventory management challenge. While no incorrect numbers are stated, this omission reduces completeness and factual richness. (2) The LLM incorrectly reverses or misrepresents the core distinction in inventory valuation practices. Ground truth states that Cisco records a liability for purchase commitments in excess of demand forecasts—indicating a commitment-driven, proactive financial recognition of risk. The LLM instead claims Cisco maintains higher inventory levels and purchase commitments to mitigate supply constraints, which shifts focus to operational flexibility rather than financial liability recognition. Conversely, the ground truth emphasizes Intel’s use of judgment and sensitivity analyses due to dynamic pricing and new product uncertainty, with audit testing focused on demand forecasts. The LLM frames Intel as more conservative and focused on net realizable value, which is plausible but not explicitly supported in the original answer, and misattributes audit focus. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—both companies are contrasted along inventory risk, supply chain, and audit dimensions—but the synthesis is flawed. The LLM fails to correctly link Cisco’s practice to financial recognition of purchase commitment liabilities, a key differentiator. It also does not reflect that Intel’s approach stems from product lifecycle and forecasting uncertainty, instead generalizing it as a conservative valuation stance. (4) Correctness is scored 5 due to significant qualitative inaccuracies in representing each company’s approach despite relevant structure and contextual framing. Quantitative accuracy is 10 because no numbers are wrong (though one is missing). Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to misattribution of reasoning and mechanisms. Contextual relevance is 8 because the answer addresses the right themes and structure, even if details are incorrect.",

      "original_answer": "AIG reclassified a $37.6 billion loan receivable from AIGFP, which was deconsolidated following its Chapter 11 filing, while Schwab issued $6.2 billion in senior notes to prepare for upcoming maturities and to maintain liquidity during the TD Ameritrade integration. AIG’s action was tied to a restructuring event involving a formerly consolidated subsidiary with a full allowance for credit losses, indicating a reactive and potentially high-risk situation. In contrast, Schwab’s issuance was a proactive liquidity management strategy in a rising interest rate environment. The scale difference highlights that AIG’s debt strategy was significantly larger and tied to a distressed scenario, whereas Schwab’s was smaller and forward-looking, aimed at ensuring balance sheet flexibility.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG's reclassification of its $37.6 billion loan receivable (related to AIGFP's Chapter 11 reorganization) was significantly larger in scale compared to Schwab's $6.2 billion in senior note issuances. This indicates AIG's action was a major restructuring effort to address legacy debt and liquidity challenges, likely tied to its bankruptcy filing and asset divestitures. Schwab's senior note issuances, in contrast, reflect routine capital management to support operations and the TD Ameritrade integration, suggesting a more conventional approach to funding liquidity needs.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: AIG's $37.6 billion reclassification and Schwab's $6.2 billion senior note issuance are accurately reported, with proper comparison of scale. (2) The answer addresses both parts of the question: the scale difference and the implications for debt strategy. It correctly identifies AIG’s action as a major restructuring tied to AIGFP’s Chapter 11 filing and contrasts it with Schwab’s more routine capital management. (3) Entity accuracy is strong—AIG, Schwab, AIGFP, and the context of the TD Ameritrade integration are all correctly referenced. (4) Reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that AIG’s move was reactive and tied to distress, while Schwab’s was proactive. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the 'full allowance for credit losses' or that AIG’s action was due to deconsolidation following Chapter 11, which adds nuance to the reactive nature of the event. However, the core implication—that AIG’s action was a major restructuring due to bankruptcy-related events—is captured. The answer is semantically equivalent in intent and factual content, with slightly less detail on the accounting mechanism but no factual errors.

      "original_answer": "A 10% across-the-board reduction in U.S. defense appropriations would directly impact both General Dynamics and Raytheon Technologies due to their heavy reliance on federal funding. For General Dynamics, which reported that 70% of its 2021 revenue came from the U.S. government, such a reduction could lead to program cuts, delays, or terminations, especially for multi-year contracts that depend on annual appropriations. This would disrupt revenue timing and potentially reduce contract values. Raytheon, with its exposure to fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts, would face compounded risk because under FPI contracts, cost overruns beyond a negotiated ceiling are not recoverable. A reduction in appropriations could force RTX to absorb more costs without corresponding revenue increases, especially on complex development contracts where cost overruns are common. Both companies could see reduced profitability and liquidity challenges if they are unable to offset lost revenue or manage cost-sharing pressures under FPI and OTA contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "A 10% reduction in U.S. defense appropriations would significantly impact both General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX). GD, which derives 70% of its revenue from the U.S. government, would face reduced revenue and potential delays or terminations of multi-year contracts, as funding is tied to annual appropriations. RTX, with exposure to fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts, would bear greater risk of cost overruns if program delays or funding cuts force it to absorb higher costs, as FPI contracts shift the burden of excess costs to the contractor.

      "original_answer": "ABBV faces significant complexity in estimating $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, particularly for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, due to variability in payment timing influenced by rebate contracts, legislative changes, and payer-specific lag times. This creates financial risk tied to the accuracy of accrual estimates and potential cash outflows. In contrast, DHR's operating cash flows are directly affected by the timing of collections and payments, as seen in the $497 million in operating cash flows generated from working capital changes in 2024. The difference highlights ABBV's challenge in forecasting liabilities due to external regulatory and contractual factors, versus DHR's operational challenge in managing internal cash conversion cycles. Together, both companies demonstrate how payment timing influences financial reporting and liquidity, albeit through different mechanisms and financial metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in impact reflects distinct cash management challenges: ABBV's rebate accruals for government and third-party payers (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare) rely on estimates of delayed payment timing, creating accounting complexity and potential mismatches between accrued liabilities and cash inflows. This requires careful management of accruals to align with future cash receipts. In contrast, DHR's operating cash flows are directly affected by the timing of payments for taxes, restructuring, and other operational obligations, highlighting variability in short-term liquidity needs due to working capital dynamics.

Additionally, the LLM reports FDX international pension unfunded liability as $411 million, whereas the ground truth states $499 million. These discrepancies affect the core correctness of the answer.

In contrast, PG provides specific historical net sales growth percentages by business segment, such as 2% for Beauty and 7% overall, demonstrating a more quantitative and segmented approach to reporting growth performance. This contrast suggests that COST focuses on the unpredictability of future growth in its disclosures, while PG emphasizes detailed, historical performance metrics to frame its growth narrative.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's forward-looking statements emphasize strategic growth expectations tied to operational efficiencies, membership trends, and market conditions, using terms like \"anticipate\" and \"expect\" while acknowledging risks. In contrast, Procter & Gamble (PG) focuses on historical segment performance, providing detailed reconciliations of organic sales growth and adjusted metrics (e.g., Core EPS) to highlight consistent, underlying performance trends. This contrast suggests Costco prioritizes forward-looking strategic narratives, while PG emphasizes data-driven historical performance to communicate stability and operational discipline.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the contrasting disclosure approaches between COST and PG, noting COST's forward-looking, narrative-driven communication and PG's historical, data-driven reporting. However, it omits specific quantitative figures mentioned in the ground truth—namely, PG's 2% growth in Beauty and 7% overall net sales growth—which are key to fully addressing the multi-hop aspect of the question. While the LLM references 'organic sales growth' and 'adjusted metrics,' it does not specify actual percentages, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) No incorrect numbers are stated, but the absence of exact figures from PG’s segment performance (2% for Beauty, 7% overall) constitutes a significant omission. These numbers are critical for demonstrating precise historical disclosure practices. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes that COST uses forward-looking language ('anticipate', 'expect') with risk acknowledgment, while PG emphasizes reconciled, adjusted historical metrics. This supports the conclusion about differing communication strategies—strategic narrative vs. operational stability—even without citing exact percentages. (4) The answer remains contextually relevant and captures the essence of the contrast. Due to missing specific numbers required by the ground truth, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are reduced, but qualitative reasoning and relevance remain strong.",

      "original_answer": "Intel's effective tax rate in 2023 was 15.6% lower than Cisco's. R&D tax credits contributed significantly to Intel's tax benefit by providing a tax advantage based on eligible R&D spending, independent of lower income before taxes.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's effective tax rate in 2023 was **119.8%** (a negative rate, indicating a tax benefit), while Cisco's effective tax rate was also **119.8%** (as shown in the provided pages). Thus, there was **no difference** in their effective tax rates for 2023.

It states that both Intel and Cisco had an effective tax rate of 119.8% in 2023, implying no difference, which directly contradicts the ground truth that Intel's rate was 15.6% lower than Cisco's. This indicates a severe error in either data extraction or interpretation. (2) The numbers provided (119.8%) are not supported by the ground truth and appear to be hallucinated or misread from the source. There is no calculation or comparison that yields a 15.6% difference from two identical rates. The claim of 'no difference' is therefore false. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies R&D tax credits as a key driver of Intel's tax benefit and notes their independence from income levels—aligning with the ground truth on qualitative reasoning—it fails the multi-hop requirement: comparing two companies' tax rates and computing the difference. The synthesis across entities (Intel vs. Cisco) is flawed due to incorrect input data. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topic (effective tax rates, R&D credits) and attempts the correct type of analysis, but the factual foundation is unsound. The qualitative reasoning about R&D credits is partially accurate, but the complete failure on the primary quantitative comparison results in a low correctness score.",

      "llm_answer": "The decrease in the discount rate from 5.25% to 5.00% in 2023 increased benefit obligations for both LMT and FDX, reducing their net funded status. For FDX's U.S. pension benefits, this caused a $765 million increase in actuarial losses, contributing to a net funded status liability of $1,600 million in 2023. LMT's qualified pension plans similarly experienced a $765 million increase in actuarial losses due to the discount rate decline, though their net funded status liability ($6,159 million in 2023) was higher, reflecting differences in plan assets, obligations, and other factors.

The original answer states FDX's U.S. pension net funded status was $ (487) million (i.e., $487 million underfunded), not $1,600 million. Additionally, the LLM fabricates a net funded status liability of $6,159 million for LMT, which is not mentioned or inferable from the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $765 million figure is correctly attributed to LMT's obligation increase but wrongly reused for FDX's actuarial losses. FDX's actual net funded status ($487 million underfunded) is misrepresented as $1,600 million. The $6,159 million figure for LMT has no basis in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the LLM correctly identifies the directional impact of discount rate changes (increasing liabilities and worsening funded status), it fails to accurately compare LMT and FDX. The original answer emphasizes that FDX had a smaller underfunded position than the increase in LMT's liabilities, but the LLM incorrectly suggests both had the same $765 million impact and misrepresents the scale of FDX's underfunding.

      "original_answer": "Nike explicitly includes inventory costs as a primary component of its cost of sales, alongside warehousing costs, third-party royalties, foreign currency hedge gains and losses, and product design costs. This indicates that inventory directly influences Nike's cost of sales and profitability. In contrast, Tesla does not explicitly mention inventory costs as a distinct component of its cost of sales. Instead, Tesla emphasizes design and engineering capabilities, modular manufacturing approaches, and integration of technologies to optimize cost characteristics. Tesla's focus is on reducing manufacturing complexity, such as through direct integration of batteries with vehicle body structures, to improve manufacturability, weight, range, and cost efficiency. Thus, Nike emphasizes inventory as a direct cost driver, while Tesla highlights design and manufacturing optimization as key contributors to cost efficiency.",

While Nike does include inventory-related costs, the specific components cited by the LLM are not supported by the original answer.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2024, NKE experienced lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs, which contributed to partially offsetting a gross margin contraction of 110 basis points. In contrast, TSLA included freight as part of its cost of revenue for the Energy Generation and Storage segment, where it added to the overall cost structure.

      "original_answer": "Both Cisco and Oracle increased their inventory balances in response to global supply chain constraints, which heightened their risks of excess and obsolete inventory. Cisco's product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to increased costs from freight, expedite fees, and higher component and commodity costs.

      "question": "How does the risk of loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable, as mentioned by FDX, contrast with LMT's confidence in collecting its receivables, and what specific amounts are involved in LMT's receivables from the U.S. Government and other customers as of December 31, 2023?",
      "original_answer": "FDX identifies the risk of loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable as a potential negative impact on its business, citing regulatory and compliance risks that could affect cash flow. In contrast, LMT expresses confidence in collecting its receivables, noting that substantially all accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023, are expected to be collected in 2024. LMT reports receivables of approximately $1.4 billion from the U.S. Government and $749 million from other governments and commercial customers, indicating minimal credit risk due to the strong credit standing of the U.S. Government as the primary customer.",
      "llm_answer": "LMT's disclosures indicate confidence in collecting its receivables, as **$1.4 billion** of its receivables as of December 31, 2023, were from the U.S. Government, with an additional **$749 million** from other governments and commercial customers. In contrast, FDX explicitly mentions the **risk of loss or delay in collecting accounts receivable** as a potential threat to its business, reflecting a more cautious stance. LMT's reliance on government contracts (notably the F-35 program) and its assertion that \"substantially all accounts receivable are expected to be collected in 2024\" contrast with FDX's acknowledgment of credit risk.",

      "question": "How did the increase in fuel prices from 2020 to 2021 affect both Union Pacific Railroad's operating expenses and Boeing's commercial aircraft demand, considering their respective sensitivities to fuel price fluctuations?",
      "original_answer": "Union Pacific Railroad's fuel expenses increased by $668 million in 2021 due to a rise in locomotive diesel fuel prices from $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon, driven primarily by higher fuel prices excluding volume changes. Meanwhile, Boeing noted that fuel prices are a key factor influencing demand for commercial aircraft, as airlines are cost-sensitive and fuel is a major operating expense. Higher fuel prices could lead airlines to delay or cancel aircraft orders, reducing Boeing's revenues and cash flows. Therefore, the fuel price increase directly raised Union Pacific's operating costs and could indirectly reduce Boeing's commercial airplane sales and profitability through airline cost pressures.",
      "llm_answer": "The increase in fuel prices from 2020 to 2021 significantly impacted Union Pacific Railroad's operating expenses, as fuel costs rose by **$668 million** (from $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon), contributing to a **7% overall increase** in operating expenses. For Boeing, higher fuel prices generally reduce commercial aircraft demand by increasing airline operating costs and reducing profitability, which can lead to delayed or canceled aircraft purchases. However, during 2020–2021, the pandemic's severe impact on air travel overshadowed fuel price effects, causing a dramatic decline in demand regardless of fuel costs. Boeing's sensitivity to fuel prices remains a key factor, but the pandemic's disruption dominated demand dynamics during this period.",

It also accurately notes that fuel is a major cost for airlines and influences Boeing's aircraft demand. However, the LLM introduces a 7% overall increase in Union Pacific's operating expenses, which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth, making it an unsupported addition. (2) Quantitatively, the key figures—$668 million and the per-gallon price increase—are correct and match the ground truth. The 7% figure lacks sourcing and may be inferred but is not confirmed, slightly reducing quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: it connects fuel prices to Union Pacific's costs and to Boeing's demand via airline cost sensitivity. However, the introduction of the pandemic as a dominating factor in 2020–2021, while contextually plausible, is not part of the original answer and shifts focus away from the direct causal chain described in the ground truth. This affects qualitative accuracy by adding external context that wasn't in the source. (4) Despite the added context, the core facts are correct and the answer addresses both companies and their sensitivities. The answer remains highly relevant and mostly accurate, but the unsupported percentage and extraneous pandemic narrative prevent a higher score.",

      "original_answer": "The combined EMEA revenue percentage contribution of Cisco and Oracle in fiscal year 2022 is 54.6%. Cisco reported a 6% EMEA revenue growth rate, while Oracle reported a 1% EMEA revenue growth rate, indicating that Cisco outperformed Oracle in the EMEA region during that period.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco's EMEA revenue in fiscal 2022 was **28%** of total revenue (from $13,715 million of total $51,557 million revenue), while Oracle's EMEA revenue was **28.3%** of its total revenue (from $12,011 million of total $42,440 million revenue). Cisco's EMEA revenue grew by **8%** (from $9,805 million to $10,545 million), whereas Oracle's EMEA revenue growth was mixed, with Cloud and License Revenues up **1%**, Hardware down **4%**, and Services up **7%**, resulting in an overall EMEA growth of approximately **1%**.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies in numbers, particularly in the EMEA revenue percentages and Cisco's EMEA growth rate. According to the ground truth, the combined EMEA revenue percentage is 54.6%, implying Cisco and Oracle contributed approximately 26.3% and 28.3% (or similar split), but the LLM claims Cisco contributed 28% and Oracle 28.3%, summing to 56.3%, which is incorrect. More critically, the LLM states Cisco's EMEA revenue growth was 8%, while the ground truth reports 6%, a significant discrepancy. Oracle's 1% growth is correctly reported. (2) The dollar amounts cited (e.g., $13,715M, $51,557M for Cisco; $12,011M, $42,440M for Oracle) are not part of the original answer and appear to be fabricated or misattributed, as the ground truth does not include these figures. There is no verification that these numbers are accurate, and they lead to incorrect percentage calculations. The combined EMEA contribution should be 54.6%, but the LLM's figures result in ~56.3%, indicating calculation or data sourcing errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to synthesize revenue percentages and growth rates for both companies and correctly concludes that Cisco outperformed Oracle in EMEA due to higher growth. This logical comparison is valid and aligns with the ground truth's interpretation. (4) Despite incorrect inputs, the qualitative assessment of relative performance is accurate, and the answer is contextually relevant, addressing both parts of the question. However, the quantitative inaccuracies—especially the 8% vs. 6% growth for Cisco and the incorrect revenue percentages—reduce confidence in the factual correctness, warranting a moderate score of 6 for overall correctness.",

However, it fundamentally misinterprets the question. The question asks to compare CMCSA's $652M reduction to the *change* in Disney's costs from 2023 to 2024 (i.e., the increase of $610M), not to Disney's total 2024 costs. The LLM instead calculates $652M as a percentage of Disney's total 2024 costs ($12,983M), arriving at ~5.0%, which is not what the question asks. (2) The calculation itself is numerically correct (652 / 12,983 ≈ 0.0502 or 5.0%), but it is applied to the wrong denominator. The correct comparison is $652M / $610M = 106.9%, as stated in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model must first compute Disney's cost increase ($12,983M - $12,373M = $610M), then compare CMCSA's $652M reduction to that increase. The LLM skips this synthesis and uses an incorrect reference point.

This demonstrates full quantitative accuracy. (2) However, the LLM incorrectly claims that 'the documents do not provide specific details about Cisco's segment reporting structure,' when in fact the ground truth confirms that Cisco does not report hardware as a separate segment and instead uses geographic-based reporting. This omission or misrepresentation fails the multi-hop synthesis requirement—comparing Oracle’s segment reporting to Cisco’s structure is a key part of the question.

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) states that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of its outstanding debt of $18.7 billion at December 31, 2023, indicating low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. In contrast, General Electric (GE) explicitly lists changes in short-term interest rates as a risk factor that could materially affect its business operations, financial results, and liquidity. GE also notes that downgrades in its credit ratings could significantly impact its funding profile and costs. This contrast implies that GE is more exposed to macroeconomic volatility related to interest rates, particularly due to its credit profile and sensitivity to short-term rate movements, whereas LMT has a more stable debt structure that is less affected by such changes.",

GE’s reliance on short-term financing and derivative hedges to mitigate these risks underscores its heightened exposure to macroeconomic volatility in short-term rates.

The absence of the specific dollar amount is a minor omission but not a factual error.

The time reference (implied 2023/2024 filings) is consistent. (3) The reasoning is sound and multi-hop: it correctly contrasts LMT’s low sensitivity (via hedging and fixed-rate debt) with GE’s vulnerability due to short-term financing and credit risk, synthesizing implications about macroeconomic volatility. The mention of GE’s commercial paper and derivative hedges adds contextual detail consistent with typical risk disclosures, even if not in the original answer. (4) Semantically, the LLM conveys the same core conclusion: GE is more exposed to macroeconomic volatility than LMT due to structural differences in debt and credit risk.

The contextual relevance remains strong because it addresses the core question about cost allocation differences, but the failure to incorporate available Comcast data limits completeness and correctness.",

While no incorrect numbers are stated, the absence of these figures reduces quantitative accuracy. (2) Qualitatively, the LLM incorrectly characterizes HD's ROIC as based on 'net income attributable to stockholders divided by average equity'—this contradicts the ground truth, which states HD uses a NOPAT-based calculation and refers to a 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' section for details. The LLM wrongly implies HD’s ROIC is ROE-like, which is not supported by the source. Additionally, the LLM fails to mention that GM’s denominator includes adjustments for automotive debt and interest liabilities, average net pension and OPEB liabilities, and net income tax assets—instead vaguely stating exclusions without capturing the full structure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the question asks for a comparative analysis of definitions and components, the LLM misrepresents HD’s methodology and oversimplifies GM’s, failing to accurately synthesize the contrast. (4) Contextually, the response stays on topic and attempts a side-by-side comparison, earning points for relevance.

      "original_answer": "A $15 billion increase in cross-jurisdictional activity would move American Express (AXP) from $60 billion to $75 billion on a four-quarter trailing average, potentially reclassifying it from Category III to Category II under the enhanced prudential standards. This would subject AXP to more stringent capital, liquidity, and prudential requirements, including the advanced approaches capital framework. For Charles Schwab (SCHW), increasing its cross-jurisdictional activity from $25 billion to $40 billion would not trigger a category change, as it remains below the $75 billion threshold for Category II, so it would remain under Category III requirements, including the standardized approach framework and stress capital buffer.",

For Charles Schwab (SCHW), the increase would raise its cross-jurisdictional activity to ~$40 billion, keeping it in **Category III**, which imposes heightened but less stringent requirements than Category II (e.g., 85% of full LCR/NSFR applicability and annual stress tests).

However, it incorrectly states that AXP is initially in Category IV, when the ground truth specifies Category III. This misclassification affects the accuracy of the regulatory transition description, as moving from Category IV to II skips Category III and implies a larger regulatory leap than actually occurs. Despite this, the qualitative consequences of moving to Category II (advanced capital frameworks, stricter liquidity requirements like LCR/NSFR, increased stress testing) are accurately described. For SCHW, the answer correctly notes no category change and retention in Category III, with appropriate context on less stringent requirements. (2) All dollar amounts and calculations are correct: $60B + $15B = $75B (threshold for Category II), $25B + $15B = $40B (below threshold). The $75B threshold is correctly applied. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model correctly links increased cross-jurisdictional activity to category thresholds, maps categories to regulatory requirements, and differentiates between AXP and SCHW outcomes. The error lies in the initial categorization of AXP, which undermines part of the logical chain. (4) The correctness score is 7 because core financial data and final regulatory implications are accurate, but the incorrect starting category for AXP introduces a significant factual flaw. Quantitative accuracy is 8 due to correct numbers and thresholds. Qualitative accuracy is 7 due to strong description of requirements but flawed entity-state mapping.

      "question": "How does the impact of U.S. government pricing pressures on BMY's non-GAAP EPS compare to Merck's rationale for using non-GAAP EPS, given both companies operate in the same sector and report this metric?",
      "original_answer": "BMY's non-GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19 in 2023 primarily due to lower revenues and product mix, which were influenced by U.S. government pricing pressures such as the IRA, including Medicare drug price negotiations and inflation-linked rebates. These pressures are expected to significantly impact BMY's business and results of operations. In contrast, Merck discloses that it uses non-GAAP EPS to enhance investor understanding of its performance, internally for planning and forecasting, and as a component in employee compensation. Merck excludes items like acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, and investment income/losses to better assess underlying business trends. While BMY's non-GAAP EPS is negatively impacted by external regulatory pressures, Merck emphasizes internal performance assessment and strategic decision-making as the basis for its non-GAAP reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) attributes its non-GAAP EPS decline in 2023 to **revenue pressures from U.S. government pricing controls**, which reduced sales of key products like Revlimid and Pomalyst, partially offset by higher royalties and interest income. Merck (MRK), meanwhile, uses non-GAAP EPS to **exclude non-operational items** (e.g., restructuring costs, investment gains/losses, and tax adjustments) to better reflect core business performance. While both companies adjust for external pressures, BMY’s non-GAAP EPS is directly impacted by pricing regulations, whereas Merck’s rationale focuses on removing non-recurring or non-operational expenses to highlight underlying operational trends.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies that BMY's non-GAAP EPS decline in 2023 was due to U.S. government pricing pressures, specifically mentioning revenue pressures from pricing controls affecting key products like Revlimid and Pomalyst. While the original answer specifies a $0.19 decrease, the LLM does not include this exact figure, which is a minor omission but does not misrepresent the direction or cause of the impact. (2) Quantitatively, no incorrect numbers are presented; the absence of the $0.19 figure prevents a perfect score, but no false data is introduced. (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts BMY’s external regulatory impact with Merck’s internal rationale for using non-GAAP EPS—namely, excluding non-operational items such as restructuring costs and investment gains to reflect core performance. This matches the original answer’s emphasis on Merck using non-GAAP EPS for internal planning, forecasting, and compensation, even if the LLM doesn’t mention those specific uses. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the response directly addresses the comparison between BMY and Merck in the same sector, focusing on how external pricing pressures affect BMY’s non-GAAP EPS versus Merck’s methodological rationale for using the metric. The synthesis across both companies and the distinction between external impact vs. internal reporting rationale is logically and accurately conveyed. Minor deductions are due to the omission of the exact $0.19 EPS impact and Merck’s specific internal uses (planning, forecasting, compensation), but the core meaning and comparison remain correct and well-supported.",

      "question": "How does the difference in the treatment of deferred tax assets between NKE and TSLA relate to their respective reliance on future taxable earnings as a factor in determining the realizability of these assets?",
      "original_answer": "Nike evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by forecasting future taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization, but does not guarantee realization due to uncertainties in projected future taxable earnings. In contrast, Tesla concluded that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable based on recent taxable income and expected future taxable earnings, leading to the release of $6.54 billion in valuation allowance. This shows that Tesla has a more favorable outlook on future taxable earnings, directly impacting its tax expense and asset valuation differently than Nike’s approach.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in the treatment of deferred tax assets between NKE and TSLA relates to their reliance on future taxable earnings as follows: **NKE** released a valuation allowance for U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets in 2023, indicating confidence in future taxable earnings to realize these assets, while maintaining a full allowance for California due to uncertainty about future earnings. **TSLA** maintained a $892 million valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, primarily due to foreign losses and California state assets, reflecting greater uncertainty about future taxable earnings in those jurisdictions. Both companies assess realizability based on projected earnings, but NKE’s reduced allowance suggests a more optimistic outlook for future profitability compared to TSLA’s more conservative stance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It incorrectly states that NKE (Nike) released a valuation allowance for U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets in 2023, which contradicts the ground truth: Nike does not guarantee realization due to uncertainties in future taxable earnings and maintains a cautious approach. In contrast, it was TSLA (Tesla), not Nike, that concluded it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable, leading to the release of $6.54 billion in valuation allowance. The LLM incorrectly attributes Tesla’s actual position to Nike. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM states TSLA maintained an $892 million valuation allowance, which is incorrect—the ground truth states Tesla *released* $6.54 billion in valuation allowance, indicating a significant reversal, not a continued reserve. The $892 million figure does not appear in the ground truth and is therefore factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM reverses the roles of the two companies in terms of optimism about future taxable income. It incorrectly frames Nike as having a more optimistic outlook when in fact Tesla is the one with the favorable outlook based on recent and expected earnings. The synthesis between the two companies’ approaches is therefore invalid. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the general topic of deferred tax asset treatment and reliance on future taxable earnings, and correctly notes that both companies assess realizability based on projections. However, due to the reversal of key facts and figures, the conclusion is fundamentally incorrect, warranting a low correctness score.",

It correctly identifies Colgate-Palmolive's $300 million trademark impairment charge, but incorrectly states that Coca-Cola's charge is not mentioned in the documents, when in fact the ground truth confirms Coca-Cola recorded a $57 million charge.

(2) Quantitatively, the $300 million figure is accurate, but the omission of Coca-Cola's $57 million charge and the incorrect total sum ($300M vs $357M) results in a major calculation and completeness failure.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, Honeywell had $4,273 million in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, while Emerson reported $0 in this category. This indicates that Honeywell actively utilized short-term debt as part of its liquidity strategy, whereas Emerson did not rely on such borrowings, suggesting a more conservative approach to liquidity management with potentially greater reliance on internal cash resources.",

This suggests Honeywell may prioritize flexibility or cost efficiency in managing short-term obligations, while Emerson's lower short-term borrowings and unused $3.5 billion credit facility indicate a more conservative approach, emphasizing long-term debt and reduced exposure to short-term market fluctuations.",

The ground truth states Emerson reported $0 in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings in 2024, but the LLM incorrectly claims $532 million. This is a major inaccuracy that undermines the core comparison. Honeywell's figure of $4,273 million is correct. (2) The calculation and comparison between the two companies are therefore flawed. While the direction of the difference (Honeywell > Emerson) is correct, the magnitude is misrepresented. Additionally, the LLM introduces a fact about Emerson's unused $3.5 billion credit facility, which, while potentially relevant to liquidity, is not present in the original answer or ground truth data provided, raising concerns about hallucination. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing two companies' short-term borrowing positions to infer liquidity risk strategies—is conceptually sound and addresses the question's intent. The interpretation that Honeywell relies more on short-term debt and Emerson takes a more conservative approach aligns with the ground truth, though the reasoning is based on incorrect data for Emerson. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer attempts the correct comparison and draws appropriate types of conclusions about liquidity management. However, the quantitative accuracy is severely compromised by the wrong number for Emerson, dragging down the overall correctness.

According to the ground truth, BAC's noninterest expense increase in 2023 was $965 million, but the LLM reports $1,339 million. For JPM, the correct increase is $614 million (from $2,817M to $3,431M), but the LLM incorrectly states an increase of $3,611 million (from $31,208M to $34,819M), which is over five times higher than the actual increase. The conclusion that JPM's increase was $2,272 million higher than BAC's is therefore completely incorrect; in reality, BAC's increase exceeded JPM's by $351 million. (2) All calculations are based on wrong base numbers, leading to erroneous differences and comparisons. The LLM's calculation of BAC's increase ($21,416M - $20,077M = $1,339M) and JPM's ($34,819M - $31,208M = $3,611M) are mathematically correct but based on incorrect input data, indicating a failure to retrieve accurate figures from the source documents. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—comparing year-over-year increases and computing the difference—but it fails at the data retrieval stage for both companies. The model synthesizes across years and entities, but with incorrect data, rendering the reasoning invalid.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, Emerson Electric (EMR) made $547 million in payments of long-term debt and received $0 in long-term debt proceeds, while Honeywell (HON) made $1,812 million in payments of long-term debt and received $10,408 million in long-term debt proceeds. Combined, their long-term debt payments totaled $2,359 million, and their proceeds from long-term debt totaled $10,408 million. This results in a net inflow of $8,049 million from long-term debt financing across both companies.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the combined long-term debt payments of $2,359 million, accurately breaking it down into $547 million for Emerson Electric (EMR) and $1,812 million for Honeywell (HON), which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states that EMR received $2,975 million in long-term debt proceeds, while the ground truth specifies $0 for EMR. The proceeds for HON ($10,408 million) are correct. As a result, the LLM reports combined proceeds of $13,383 million, which is incorrect—the correct total is $10,408 million. This leads to an erroneous conclusion that both companies issued more debt than they repaid, when in fact EMR had no proceeds and only made payments, resulting in a net outflow for EMR. (2) Calculations: The sum of payments ($547M + $1,812M = $2,359M) is correct. However, the proceeds calculation is wrong due to the incorrect EMR proceeds value. The net inflow stated in the ground truth ($8,049M = $10,408M - $2,359M) cannot be matched because of this error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly synthesizes data across two companies and computes a combined total for payments, showing proper multi-hop capability. However, it fails in accurately retrieving EMR's proceeds, breaking the synthesis for the proceeds side. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness is 4 due to major quantitative error in EMR proceeds affecting overall conclusion; Quantitative accuracy is 4 because half the numbers are wrong; Qualitative accuracy is 5—reasoning structure is sound but based on incorrect data; Contextual relevance is 9—response is well-structured and addresses the right concepts and comparisons.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect in its final result and in the individual component values. The ground truth states the combined total is $3,656 million, but the LLM calculates $3,066 million, which is $590 million lower. The individual values provided—$1,960 million for Lockheed Martin (LMT) in 2021 and $1,106 million for Raytheon Technologies (RTX) in 2020—are not aligned with the ground truth data. (2) The calculation itself ($1,960 + $1,106 = $3,066 million) is arithmetically correct, but since the input numbers are wrong, the result is invalid. The correct component values (based on the knowledge graph) should have been $2,550 million for LMT in 2021 and $1,106 million for RTX in 2020, which sum to $3,656 million. The RTX 2020 value of $1,106 million appears to be correct and likely matches the source, but the LMT 2021 value is incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies the correct companies, correct years, and attempts to extract and sum the FAS/CAS operating adjustments from each 10-K. However, it fails in accurate data retrieval for Lockheed Martin, undermining the synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the model understands the task, references specific documents and pages, and targets the correct metric. However, due to significant factual and quantitative errors, the correctness and accuracy scores are very low. A correct answer required precise values from the filings, and the model’s use of an incorrect figure for LMT renders the final answer wrong despite partial alignment on RTX.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing reported 'Other Income, Net' of $551 million in 2021, which helped offset its operating loss of $2,902 million, contributing to a smaller net loss of $4,290 million. In contrast, Union Pacific reported 'Other Income, Net' of -$297 million in 2021, which further reduced its net income of $6,523 million. The difference in 'Other Income, Net' between the two companies—$551 million (Boeing) vs. -$297 million (Union Pacific)—shows contrasting financial strategies and performance impacts, with Boeing benefiting from positive other income while Union Pacific faced a drag on earnings from this category.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in 'Other Income, Net' between Boeing (BA) and Union Pacific (UNP) in 2021 reflects distinct financial dynamics. Boeing reported **$551 million** in Other Income, Net, which reduced its net loss by $551 million, contributing to a narrower loss of **$4,202 million**. In contrast, UNP had a **negative $297 million** in Other Income, Net, which directly reduced its net income by $297 million, contributing to a **$6,523 million net income**. This highlights Boeing's reliance on non-operational gains to mitigate losses, while UNP's negative Other Income, Net indicates operational or financial pressures impacting its profitability.

It also correctly states UNP's net income of $6,523 million. However, it incorrectly reports Boeing's net loss as $4,202 million instead of the correct $4,290 million. This appears to be a typographical error, as the ground truth notes an operating loss of $2,902 million and a net loss of $4,290 million, which cannot be reconciled by simply subtracting other income—suggesting deeper complexity in the income statement not fully captured. (2) Quantitative accuracy is mostly preserved: the $551M and -$297M figures are correct, and UNP's net income is accurate. The error in Boeing's net loss value reduces quantitative precision. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly interprets that positive other income benefits Boeing by reducing its net loss, while negative other income detracts from UNP's net income. It draws appropriate inferences about financial strategies and risk profiles, demonstrating effective multi-hop synthesis across two companies and their income components.

More critically, the LLM claims PM had a positive 1.0 percentage point contribution from acquisitions, but the ground truth explicitly states PM reported *no impact* from acquisitions on net revenue growth in 2024. This is a major factual error. (2) The calculation attributed to PM (8.8% total growth minus growth excluding acquisitions) is not supported by the provided truth and introduces fabricated data. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is flawed because it misrepresents the multi-hop comparison: instead of correctly contrasting KO’s negative 4% impact with PM’s zero impact, it invents a positive impact for PM, leading to an incorrect conclusion about a 'stark contrast' in directionality.

      "original_answer": "In 2021, LMT reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million as part of its unallocated items, directly contributing to its consolidated operating profit of $9,123 million. This adjustment was a significant component of LMT's unallocated net total of $1,744 million. In contrast, RTX's FAS/CAS operating adjustment was embedded in its pension and PRB expense treatment, where the adjustment reconciled CAS expense (used for U.S. government contract pricing) with FAS service cost under GAAP. RTX noted that the FAS/CAS adjustment resulted in consolidated pension expense equal to the FAS service cost, though no specific dollar amount was provided for 2021. The difference lies in LMT explicitly quantifying the adjustment as a standalone unallocated item, while RTX integrated it within broader pension cost reporting without isolating its dollar impact.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of **$1,960 million** in 2021, driven by higher CAS pension costs ($2,066 million) and lower FAS service costs ($106 million). Raytheon (RTX) reported **$1,796 million** for the same adjustment, reflecting CAS expenses of $2,201 million and FAS service costs of $405 million. The difference arises from LMT’s larger CAS expense base and a significant noncash pension settlement charge ($1.7 billion) in 2021, while RTX’s adjustment was influenced by merger-related CAS cost increases and lower FAS service costs.",

While it correctly states that LMT reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million in 2021 (matching the ground truth), it falsely claims that RTX reported a specific amount of $1,796 million for its FAS/CAS adjustment. The original answer explicitly states that RTX did *not* provide a specific dollar amount for the 2021 FAS/CAS adjustment. This is a critical error. Additionally, the LLM invents breakdowns for both companies (e.g., CAS expense of $2,066M and FAS service cost of $106M for LMT; $2,201M and $405M for RTX) that are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified. It also introduces a 'noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion' for LMT and 'merger-related CAS cost increases' for RTX—details absent from the original and unsupported by the provided truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: one number correct (LMT’s $1,960M), but the RTX figure and all component numbers are fabricated.

(3) The reasoning structure is sound—multi-hop synthesis between MS's asset holdings and COF's expense trend is appropriately framed, and the model attempts a meaningful comparison. However, the flawed input data for COF undermines the conclusion. (4) Contextual relevance is high, as the answer addresses both parts of the question and cites specific sources. The qualitative reasoning is logical, but based on one incorrect figure. Thus, the correctness score is reduced to 6 due to significant but not total quantitative inaccuracy.",

      "original_answer": "NFLX recognizes all operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including for short-term leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, even though these are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In contrast, VZ recognizes rent expense for short-term operating leases on a straight-line basis as well, but classifies the expense in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense based on the use of the facility or equipment. This means that while both companies follow a similar straight-line recognition method, the presentation on the income statement differs depending on the nature and use of the leased asset, which could impact how analysts assess their operating performance and cost structures.",
      "llm_answer": "NFLX and VZ both recognize short-term operating lease expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term, but they differ in how variable lease payments are treated. NFLX includes all short-term lease expenses (fixed and variable) in a straight-line manner, smoothing recognition across periods. VZ, however, recognizes variable lease payments (e.g., based on usage or real estate taxes) as incurred, while fixed payments are straight-lined. This distinction impacts income statement presentation: NFLX’s expenses are more consistent across periods, while VZ’s variable costs reflect real-time fluctuations, potentially affecting earnings volatility.",

The ground truth states that VZ recognizes rent expense for short-term leases on a straight-line basis and classifies it based on use (Cost of services or SG&A), but does not mention any distinction between fixed and variable payments. The LLM incorrectly claims VZ recognizes variable lease payments as incurred while straight-lining fixed ones—this detail is not supported by the original answer and introduces a key misrepresentation. For NFLX, the ground truth confirms straight-line recognition for all short-term leases (even off-balance-sheet), which the LLM correctly identifies, though it adds unsupported detail about including both fixed and variable components. (2) There are no explicit numbers in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not heavily applicable; however, the conceptual treatment of expense recognition patterns (straight-line vs. as-incurred) involves qualitative 'measurement' aspects that are misrepresented, hence minor deductions. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—both companies are correctly identified and compared on lease expense recognition—but the synthesis is flawed because the distinguishing factor in the ground truth is income statement classification based on asset use, not variable vs. fixed payment treatment. The LLM invents a difference not present in the source data, failing the core comparison. (4) While the answer addresses the general topic and attempts to contrast the two firms’ approaches (maintaining contextual relevance), the qualitative inaccuracy undermines the conclusion about earnings volatility and expense smoothing, which is not implied in the original.

The calculated difference implied by the LLM ($593M benefit vs assumed expense) does not align with the correct $600M difference.

While these numbers may be factually accurate, they are not part of the ground truth and shift focus from the required comparison—proportion of current liabilities relative to total assets for each company individually. The LLM calculates that combined liabilities are less than combined assets, but the original answer emphasizes the percentage of each company’s own assets (14.1% for Netflix, 16.8% for Verizon), which the LLM omits entirely.

According to the ground truth, Boeing's total net actuarial loss in 2021 was $19,031 million, but the LLM incorrectly states it as $17,939 million, citing a breakdown of $19,031M for pensions and a $1,092M gain for other postretirement benefits. However, the net figure should be $19,031M - $1,092M = $17,939M only if the $19,031M were gross of the gain, but the ground truth treats $19,031M as the total net loss, implying the LLM misunderstood the composition. Similarly, Union Pacific's actuarial loss is stated as $851M by the LLM vs. $813M in the ground truth — a smaller but still incorrect variance. The disparity calculation is therefore also wrong: LLM implies ~$17,088M difference instead of the correct $18,218M ($19,031M - $813M). (2) Calculations are not accurately reflected due to incorrect input values and flawed reasoning about netting gains against losses. The LLM introduces a breakdown (pensions vs. other benefits) not present in the original answer and misapplies it, leading to an incorrect net figure. (3) The qualitative reasoning about how actuarial losses impact Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCI) is sound — the mechanism of direct recording into AOCI is correctly described, and the comparative effect on AOCI balances is logically explained. The LLM correctly identifies the financial mechanism and direction of impact. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both parts of the multi-hop question: the quantitative disparity and the financial mechanism affecting AOCI.

Specifically, the claim that P&G's Beauty segment contributed $15.22 billion in 2024 (18% of total net sales) is not supported by the ground truth and represents a major factual error. The original answer does not provide P&G's Beauty segment revenue, so this number is an unsupported addition. (2) The LLM correctly cites Target's 2024 Beauty net sales as $13.17 billion (matching the original $13,173 million), which is quantitatively accurate with acceptable formatting variation. However, the claim that this represents 12% of Target's total net sales is an unsupported inference—the original answer does not provide Target's total net sales or this percentage. Similarly, the 18% figure for P&G is entirely fabricated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in linking ASU 2023-07's enhanced disclosure requirements to the market significance of the Beauty category as shown by Target's sales.

The original answer focuses on how the new disclosures will allow better comparison to market trends (e.g., Target's strong Beauty sales), without asserting unverified financials for P&G. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses both the accounting standard impact and the market significance of Beauty. However, the correctness score is low due to the introduction of false quantitative data, which fundamentally misrepresents the financial reality.

All numbers match the ground truth exactly, and the arithmetic (sum) is correct. (2) However, the conclusion about the comparison contains a minor but notable error in interpretation. The ground truth states that the combined R&D ($6,901M) is 'greater than' NVDA’s total operating expenses ($7,434M) and represents approximately 92.9% of it. The LLM instead says the combined R&D is '$533 million less' than NVDA’s operating expenses — which is mathematically correct (7,434 - 6,901 = 533), but contradicts the original answer’s phrasing that the R&D sum is 'greater than' NVDA’s total operating expenses. This indicates a possible error in the ground truth (since 6,901 < 7,434), but the LLM’s calculation and comparison are factually sound. Given that the LLM's quantitative analysis is accurate and more logically consistent, this discrepancy likely reflects an error in the ground truth statement rather than the LLM response.

The RTX FAS/CAS operating adjustment increase is stated as $84 million, but the ground truth is $690 million. This is a major quantitative error. The LMT average is reported as $1,962 million, which is close to the correct value of $1,961.3 million and can be considered approximately accurate. However, the RTX figures used ($1,876M to $1,960M) are incorrect—these appear to be LMT’s values for those years, suggesting confusion between companies. (2) Calculations: The difference in RTX’s adjustment is miscalculated due to wrong inputs. The average for LMT is correctly calculated using erroneous numbers—using $2,049, $1,876, and $1,960 (which resemble actual LMT values across years), summing to $5,885 / 3 = $1,961.67 ≈ $1,962M, so method is correct but based on misattribution. The critical comparison—that RTX’s $690M increase is ~35.2% of LMT’s average—is entirely missing in reasoning and result. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly synthesize data across entities and time. It incorrectly uses LMT’s historical values as if they were RTX’s, indicating a failure in entity disambiguation. It does attempt a comparison, but with wrong inputs, undermining the logic. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and calculation errors in the primary metric.

While CMCSA's broadband revenue ($25,489 million) is correct, T's broadband revenue is incorrectly stated as $10,455 million instead of the ground truth $9,669 million. This leads to an incorrect combined broadband revenue of $35,944 million (vs. correct $35,158 million) and an incorrect difference of $15,034 million (vs. correct $15,820 million). T's total revenue is also wrong at $122,428 million (vs. $120,741 million), affecting the percentage calculation. The LLM reports 8.5% contribution for T (vs. correct 8%).

While the cost of products sold for UNH ($46,694 million) and total revenues for both companies ($442,228 million, with ABT: $41,950 million and UNH: $400,278 million) are correct, the cost for ABT is wrong—LLM states $20,584 million vs. the correct $18,706 million. This leads to an incorrect combined cost of $67,278 million instead of $65,400 million. The percentage calculation is also incorrect: LLM reports 15.2% (67,278 / 442,228 ≈ 15.2%), but the correct ratio is 65,400 / 442,228 ≈ 14.8%, not 13.5% as stated in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "Boeing incorporates material costs into its program cost estimation process for aircraft programs like the 777X, where adverse changes in material cost estimates can lead to significant earnings charges, such as the $6.5 billion reach-forward loss recorded in 2020. In contrast, Union Pacific capitalizes material costs as part of its property investments, with $2.9 billion in capital investments during 2021, where material costs are evaluated based on whether they meet criteria for extending asset life or improving efficiency. These differing treatments reflect distinct financial impacts: Boeing faces potential future losses tied to cost overruns, while Union Pacific increases long-term asset value through selective capitalization of material costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing treats material costs as part of its program accounting estimates for aircraft programs, incorporating them into cost projections that influence gross profit margins. If estimated costs exceed revenues, losses are recognized immediately, as seen in the 777X program's $6.5 billion loss. In contrast, Union Pacific capitalizes material costs for property if they meet criteria like extending asset life or improving efficiency, deferring expenses to future periods via depreciation. This approach smooths financial results but requires rigorous judgment to avoid overcapitalization. Boeing's method exposes it to immediate earnings volatility from cost overruns, while Union Pacific's capitalization criteria spread costs over asset lifetimes, reducing short-term income impacts.",

(1) All key facts are correct: Boeing's $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020 is accurately cited, and Union Pacific's capitalization of material costs under criteria like extending asset life or improving efficiency is correctly described. While the LLM does not explicitly mention Union Pacific's $2.9 billion in capital investments in 2021, this omission is minor and does not undermine the core financial comparison. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $6.5 billion charge is correctly attributed to Boeing’s 777X program, and no incorrect numbers are introduced. The absence of the $2.9 billion figure from Union Pacific’s filing is a small completeness gap but does not affect factual correctness. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes Boeing’s cost estimation process under program accounting (where material costs contribute to estimated total costs and can trigger immediate loss recognition) with Union Pacific’s capitalization policy (where material costs are capitalized if they enhance assets), and contrasts their financial implications—earnings volatility vs. expense smoothing. (4) The answer captures the semantic essence of the original: differing treatments lead to different financial statement impacts. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention of Union Pacific’s $2.9B capital investment figure, which slightly affects completeness but not overall correctness.

Lockheed Martin (LMT) recorded **$410 million** in Q4 2024 from a classified program at its MFC business segment, driven by performance issues and contractual risks. Labor factors, such as the IAM 751 work stoppage and subsequent agreement, and contractual challenges (e.g., delays, funding uncertainties, and performance disputes) contributed to these losses for both companies.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, Boeing recorded $891 million in additional reach-forward losses (solely on the 777X program), while the LLM incorrectly states a total of $1,073 million, splitting it between the 767 and 777X programs—this breakdown is not supported by the original answer. The 767 program loss of $182 million is entirely fabricated in the context of this question. For Lockheed Martin, the LLM reports $410 million in losses, but the correct amount is $1.31 billion—a major discrepancy. The total combined loss is stated as $1.483 billion by the LLM, whereas the correct total is $2.201 billion. These errors severely undermine factual correctness. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM’s incorrect numbers (e.g., $182M + $891M = $1,073M), but since the inputs are wrong, the output is invalid. The correct sum should be $891M + $1.31B = $2.201B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—identifying labor (IAM 751 agreement) and contractual factors as drivers—but misattributes details. The LLM incorrectly links the IAM 751 agreement to both 767 and 777X programs for Boeing, while the ground truth only cites the 777X. For LMT, the LLM cites 'performance issues and contractual risks' instead of the specific driver: increased likelihood of fixed-price option exercises on a classified contract. This reflects flawed synthesis. (4) Despite these issues, the answer remains contextually relevant—addressing both companies, the correct time period (Q4 2024), and general contributing factors (labor and contracts).

      "original_answer": "CMCSA's video revenue decreased in both 2022 and 2023, primarily due to declines in the overall number of residential video customers. This downward trend reflects ongoing challenges in the traditional video services market. In contrast, AT&T reported $2,257 million in video revenue in 2021 but no longer reports a separate video segment by 2023, indicating a strategic shift away from this business line.

If Tesla's marketable securities included significant foreign-denominated holdings similar to Amazon’s foreign funds, an investor would infer that Tesla could also face material fair value declines under a similar FX shock. This would negatively impact Tesla’s equity valuation through accumulated other comprehensive income, just as Amazon experiences, thereby creating parallel valuation risks for both companies under sustained foreign exchange volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "An investor would assess that Amazon's $2.3 billion fair value decline under a 10% adverse FX scenario directly reduces equity through a loss on foreign-denominated assets, while Tesla's available-for-sale marketable securities would similarly experience FX-driven unrealized losses, impacting equity via accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). Both companies' equity valuations would decline, but Tesla's impact is deferred to AOCI, whereas Amazon's is recognized immediately in net income. The combined effect depends on the magnitude of FX exposure and the proportion of foreign-denominated assets in each company's portfolio.",

The numbers and entities (Amazon, Tesla, $2.3 billion, 10% FX shock, AOCI) are correct, satisfying quantitative accuracy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $2.3 billion figure and 10% adverse scenario are correctly cited with no calculation errors. (3) However, the reasoning contains a significant error: it incorrectly states that Amazon recognizes FX losses 'immediately in net income.' In the ground truth and per Amazon's accounting policy, foreign exchange impacts on cash and foreign-denominated assets held as part of available-for-sale securities are typically recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), not directly in net income unless realized. This mischaracterization undermines the comparative analysis between Amazon and Tesla. Both companies would reflect unrealized FX losses in AOCI, not in net income, making the 'immediate vs deferred' distinction factually incorrect. (4) Despite this key accounting error, the LLM captures the core idea that both firms face equity valuation risks from FX shocks due to fair value accounting for foreign-denominated assets, and it correctly links AOCI to Tesla’s treatment. The answer is contextually relevant and mostly aligned in structure and intent, but the flawed reasoning about income statement recognition reduces qualitative accuracy. Correctness is therefore scored 7 due to the major conceptual error in financial statement impact, even though the directional conclusion (combined equity impact) is reasonable.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. The ground truth weighted average is 2.06%, but the LLM calculates 2.8%, a material deviation. The TGT Beauty segment growth of 5.06% and total net sales of $106,566M are correct. However, PG's Beauty segment growth is stated as 1%, which may be conflated with organic sales growth without confirmation of net sales growth specifically for the Beauty segment. More critically, the LLM assumes PG’s total net sales as $133,000M without sourcing it from actual filings—this figure should have been extracted from PG’s 10-K. The actual total net sales for PG in FY2024 were $83,445M, not $133,000M, which invalidates the weighting. (2) Calculations: The formula is correctly structured, but inputs are flawed. Using incorrect total sales for PG skews the result. Correct calculation should be: ((1% * 83,445) + (5.06% * 106,566)) / (83,445 + 106,566) = (834.45 + 5,392.24) / 190,011 ≈ 6,226.69 / 190,011 ≈ 3.28%, but even this assumes 1% is accurate for PG Beauty net sales growth, which is not confirmed. The ground truth implies a different set of inputs leading to 2.06%, suggesting either different growth rates or weights. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across PG and TGT using correct methodology (weighted average by total net sales), but fails due to reliance on unsourced data (PG total sales). It correctly identifies the need for Beauty segment growth and total company sales, but does not verify or extract actual reported figures for all inputs. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 4 due to correct structure and partial data accuracy but major error in final result. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to incorrect numbers and calculation outcome. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) as reasoning is sound but based on flawed data.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, Boeing recognized a total of $3,099 million in reach-forward losses for the MQ-25 and T-7A Red Hawk programs, primarily due to production cost overruns and higher-than-anticipated supplier costs. Specifically, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the MQ-25 program by $339 million in the first quarter, $217 million in the third quarter, and $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770 million in 2024, driven by higher estimated supplier costs, supplier negotiations, and increased costs to complete flight testing. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin recognized $1.41 billion in reach-forward losses in 2024 for a classified contract under its MFC business segment, following the recognition of an additional $1.31 billion in losses in the fourth quarter due to the increased likelihood of all fixed-price options being exercised.

It incorrectly states that Boeing recognized $1.41 billion in reach-forward losses for its MFC program, when in fact Boeing recognized $3,099 million ($3.099 billion) in total losses across the MQ-25 and T-7A Red Hawk programs. Conversely, it was Lockheed Martin—not Boeing—that recognized $1.41 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified MFC contract. The LLM also incorrectly attributes a $100 million loss to Lockheed Martin on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP), which is not mentioned in the ground truth and is factually incorrect. The combined total of $1.51 billion is therefore wrong; the correct total is $4,509 million ($4.509 billion). (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the individual figures for both companies are incorrect, the programs are misattributed, and the sum is off by over $3 billion. The only number remotely close is $1.41 billion, but it is assigned to the wrong company and program. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly synthesize information across Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s 2024 filings. It conflated programs, misassigned financial figures, and introduced a non-existent program (CMHP) as a source of loss. There is no evidence of correct cross-entity or cross-program synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is partially maintained because the answer discusses reach-forward losses, cost overruns, and supplier issues in 2024 for both companies, which aligns with the question’s scope. However, due to pervasive factual and attribution errors, the qualitative and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.

MA defines GDV as the sum of purchase volume and cash volume (e.g., cash disbursements, balance transfers, and convenience checks). Since COF’s increase is specifically in 'purchase volume,' it maps directly to the portion of GDV that excludes cash volume, meaning the rise in COF's purchase volume contributes proportionally to the growth in MA's GDV, particularly on a local currency and U.S. dollar-converted basis.",

However, the LLM introduces a specific percentage increase—'up 6% in 2023'—which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth, making this a factual overreach. (2) The quantitative inaccuracy stems solely from the unsupported '6%' figure; no other numbers or calculations are present in either answer, so this is the only deviation. The original answer does not include any percentages or years, so introducing one reduces quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links COF's reported purchase volume to MA's GDV definition, recognizes the component-based structure of GDV, and infers the impact on transaction processing revenue. It also adds relevant context about COF's domestic focus, which, while not in the original, is consistent with plausible inference and enhances the explanation without contradicting the ground truth.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains partial correctness but has significant factual and reasoning errors. It correctly identifies CMCSA's average monthly revenue per customer relationship as $130.57, which matches the ground truth. However, it reports Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership as $11.70, which contradicts the ground truth value of $17.20. This discrepancy indicates a failure in retrieving or interpreting the correct figure from the source. (2) The calculation of the combined average is entirely missing in the LLM answer, and the model claims it 'cannot be computed without additional data on total customer bases,' which is incorrect reasoning. The question asks for a simple average of the two companies' individual averages (as reflected in the ground truth: ($130.57 + $17.20) = $147.77), not a weighted average requiring customer counts. Therefore, the refusal to compute is based on flawed logic. (3) The multi-hop synthesis fails because the model does not combine the two figures into a combined average despite having (or claiming to have) the necessary inputs. Even with the incorrect Netflix number, the model should have attempted the same type of calculation implied by the ground truth. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and year, and cites document pages, showing awareness of the required data sources. However, due to the incorrect Netflix value and the failure to perform a straightforward addition to derive the combined average, the overall correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is penalized for the wrong Netflix figure and missing final sum. Qualitative accuracy suffers due to flawed reasoning about computability. Contextual relevance is acceptable because the structure and intent align with the question, despite execution failures.",

UnitedHealthcare (UNH) saw a **decline in net earnings to $14,405 million in 2024** (from $22,381 million in 2023), driven by losses from subsidiary sales, Medicare Advantage funding pressures, and Medicaid redeterminations.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. According to the ground truth, the combined net earnings change is -$7,232 million (ABT: +$7,679M; UNH: -$7,902M), but the LLM incorrectly calculates it as a decrease of only $297 million. This error stems from incorrect base values: the LLM claims ABT increased from $5,723M to $13,402M (a +$7,679M change, which matches the ground truth), but assigns UNH a change from $22,381M to $14,405M (a -$7,976M change), which does not match the ground truth UNH change of -$7,902M. Even with approximate rounding, the discrepancy is significant. The combined change should be +$7,679M + (-$7,902M) = -$223M, not -$297M—further indicating miscalculation. (2) The individual net earnings figures for 2023 and 2024 cited by the LLM do not align with the knowledge graph: while ABT’s change magnitude is correct, the actual starting and ending values may be inaccurate; UNH’s values are clearly off. The final combined change is therefore quantitatively wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM identifies both companies, attempts to compare trends, and draws a qualitative conclusion about contrasting performance—but fails due to reliance on incorrect numerical data. It correctly identifies ABT as growing and UNH as declining, which reflects the right directional trend. (4) Despite correct entity identification (ABT, UNH) and general context (financial performance trends), the severe numerical inaccuracies in both reported figures and derived calculations severely undermine factual correctness. The qualitative insight about contrasting trends is valid but insufficient to offset major quantitative errors. Hence, low scores for correctness and quantitative accuracy; moderate for qualitative reasoning; acceptable contextual relevance.",

      "original_answer": "Tesla's foreign exchange gains and losses directly affect its net income, as evidenced by the $257 million favorable change in 'Other income (expense), net' due to FX fluctuations. This amount flowed directly to Tesla's net income. In contrast, Amazon disclosed that a 1% increase in its inventory valuation allowance would result in an additional $370 million in cost of sales. While Amazon's FX exposure is not explicitly quantified, changes in exchange rates could influence inventory valuation allowances, particularly for inventory held in foreign jurisdictions, thereby indirectly affecting its financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates directly impact Tesla's net income through gains/losses from remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-USD currencies, as noted in their 10-K (page 44). These fluctuations also indirectly affect Amazon's inventory valuation allowance by influencing the reported value of inventory held in foreign subsidiaries. While Amazon's 10-K (pages 19-20) does not explicitly link FX rates to inventory valuation allowances, it highlights that FX volatility affects consolidated financial results, including the valuation of foreign currency-denominated assets, which could indirectly influence inventory write-downs or allowances when converted to USD.

However, it fails to include the key quantitative disclosures from the ground truth: Tesla's $257 million favorable FX impact on 'Other income (expense), net' and Amazon's specific sensitivity of a $370 million increase in cost of sales from a 1% rise in inventory valuation allowance. These omissions significantly reduce quantitative accuracy. (2) The numbers $257M and $370M are entirely missing in the LLM response, and no calculations or figures are provided despite being central to the original answer. This represents a major deficit in quantitative accuracy, as the question specifically asks for impacts based on 'specific financial sensitivities disclosed.' (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly links FX fluctuations to Tesla’s net income and hypothesizes an indirect path to Amazon’s inventory valuation via foreign subsidiaries. However, it does not confirm Amazon’s lack of explicit FX quantification with the same precision as the ground truth, nor does it clearly state that Amazon’s FX exposure isn't quantified (only that it's not linked to inventory allowances). (4) Contextually, the answer is well-structured and relevant, citing correct sections of the 10-Ks (e.g., page 44 for Tesla, 19–20 for Amazon), and uses appropriate financial terminology. While the qualitative reasoning is plausible and logically consistent, the absence of critical numerical data from both companies’ filings limits factual completeness and correctness.

The combined total of reach-forward losses is stated as $5.59 billion, but the ground truth is $4,099 million ($4.099 billion). This discrepancy arises from incorrect figures for both companies. Boeing's total reach-forward losses are reported as $4.08 billion in the LLM answer, but according to the original answer, Boeing recorded $2,608 million in Q3 and $891 million in Q4 for the 777X program, totaling $3,499 million ($3.499 billion), not $4.08 billion. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly attributes losses to the 767 program ($398M Q3 + $182M Q4 = $580M), which is not mentioned in the ground truth. For Lockheed Martin, the LLM reports $1.51 billion in losses, including $1.41 billion on a classified program and $100 million on CMHP, but the original answer specifies only $1.4 billion on a classified program with no mention of CMHP. Thus, the LLM invents a $100 million loss not present in the source. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: $3.499B (Boeing actual) + $1.4B (LMT actual) = $4.899B, but the correct sum per ground truth is $2,608M + $891M + $1,400M = $4,899 million, which contradicts the original answer’s stated total of $4,099 million. However, this suggests a possible internal inconsistency in the ground truth, but since the task is to evaluate against it, the LLM must match it. Even so, the LLM’s $5.59B is far off. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—attempting to break down losses by company and program and attributing causes—but fails due to hallucinated data. The causes for Boeing (production delays, supply chain) align generally with the ground truth, though the inclusion of IAM 751 and 737 models is extraneous. For LMT, the mention of technical/schedule risks aligns, but 'sanctions' and 'funding uncertainties' are not in the original, and the CMHP detail is entirely fabricated. (4) The correctness score is low (3) due to major numerical errors and invented programs. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2) because key dollar amounts and totals are incorrect. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4) as some reasoning patterns and causal themes are directionally correct.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors. It states that both BMY and DHR have $57 million in current liabilities, but the ground truth specifies BMY has $57M and DHR has $58M, making the correct combined total $115M, not $114M. Similarly, for noncurrent liabilities, the LLM claims both companies have $544M, but the ground truth shows BMY has $524M and DHR has $544M, resulting in a correct combined total of $1,068M, not $1,088M. These miscalculations affect the comparison, although the general conclusion that noncurrent liabilities are much higher is valid. (2) The calculations are incorrect: $57M + $57M = $114M (wrong inputs), and $544M + $544M = $1,088M (again, wrong inputs). The correct calculation is $57M + $58M = $115M (current) and $524M + $544M = $1,068M (noncurrent). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to aggregate across both companies and compare current vs. noncurrent liabilities—but it fails due to incorrect data extraction from the sources. The model incorrectly attributes identical values to both companies, suggesting a failure in differentiating entity-specific data. (4) Despite the factual inaccuracies, the answer addresses all parts of the question, uses correct financial terminology, and draws a reasonable qualitative conclusion (noncurrent liabilities are significantly higher), which supports a moderate score. Contextual relevance is high as the response stays focused on the question. However, the numerical inaccuracies severely limit correctness, warranting a score of 6.",

The ground truth states the combined total is $1,159 million ($101M for Altria and $1,058M for Philip Morris), but the LLM incorrectly reports $229 million ($101M for MO and $128M for PM). This is a significant deviation. Additionally, the LLM claims PM’s Post-Retirement contribution is $0 and Post-Employment is -$36 million, which contradicts the ground truth of $40 million and $101 million respectively. Altria’s plan contributions are correctly stated as $85M and $5M, totaling $90M, which matches the ground truth. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM’s reported sum of $229M is incorrect (should be $1,159M), and the claim that total movements exceed plan contributions by $175M is based on false inputs. The correct sum of plan contributions is $85M + $5M + $40M + $101M = $231M, not the -$36M used by the LLM. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially attempted—LLM tries to compare total movements to benefit plan contributions—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval from the PM filing, undermining the synthesis.

      "original_answer": "MET reported a $429 million loss in 2021 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its non-VA program derivatives, indicating a direct financial impact from currency movements. Meanwhile, Visa uses established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates to calculate its nominal payments volume, which is a key metric for determining service revenues. This shows that while exchange rates directly affect MET's derivative valuations and thus its financial performance, Visa incorporates exchange rates into its volume measurement to maintain consistency in revenue reporting across different currencies.",
      "llm_answer": "MET's 2021 non-VA program derivatives experienced a $429 million foreign currency exchange rate impact, contributing to an overall unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) of $3.7 billion. This reflects significant exposure to foreign exchange volatility in their hedging strategies. In contrast, Visa uses established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates to calculate nominal payments volume, standardizing revenue reporting and mitigating exchange rate impacts through hedging. While both companies face exchange rate risks, MET's derivatives directly expose it to larger, unoffsetted gains/losses, whereas Visa's structured approach minimizes volatility, highlighting differing financial significance: MET's exposure is a material earnings driver, while Visa's is managed as a controllable operational factor.",

There is no mention in the ground truth of these exact numerical breakdowns, making the inclusion of such figures factually unsupported. Since the question does not ask for contribution percentages but the original answer does not provide them, adding them constitutes a significant quantitative inaccuracy. (2) The comparison to PM is partially accurate: both companies benefited from favorable volume/mix and pricing, and PM’s growth was driven by HTU volume gains despite lower cigarette volume. However, the LLM fails to mention that PM’s favorable volume/mix was partially offset by lower cigarette volume, which is a key nuance in the original answer. Additionally, the LLM does not specify that MDLZ’s volume/mix gains were regionally driven (AMEA, Latin America, Europe), while North America was flat—this regional breakdown is a core part of the original answer and is omitted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure—comparing drivers of organic revenue growth between MDLZ and PM—but incomplete in synthesis. The model correctly identifies that both companies benefited from volume/mix and pricing, but misses the qualitative distinction that MDLZ’s gains were broad-based across regions while PM’s were product-specific (HTUs). This weakens the comparative analysis. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the main drivers of growth and attempts a comparison. However, the introduction of unverified numerical contributions significantly undermines factual correctness, warranting a moderate correctness score of 6. The qualitative accuracy is acceptable due to correct entity identification and logical flow, but not fully accurate due to missing and added details.",

Broadcom’s purchases of investments were $346 million, and Microsoft’s purchases were $37,651 million.

The combined sales are correctly calculated as $14,582M (reported as $14.58B, which is equivalent). Combined purchases are reported as $37.997B (i.e., $37,997M), while the ground truth is $38,000M. This $3M difference is minor and likely due to rounding. The net outflow is given as $23.42B ($23,420M), compared to the ground truth $23,418M—again, a $2M difference attributable to rounding. (2) All calculations are accurate within acceptable rounding: $228M + $14,354M = $14,582M ≈ $14.58B; $346M + $37,651M = $37,997M ≈ $37.997B; net outflow = $37,997M - $14,582M = $23,415M ≈ $23.42B. The slight discrepancies do not affect factual correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (AVGO and MSFT), computes aggregates, and draws the correct conclusion about net outflow. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, uses appropriate financial terminology, and fully addresses both parts of the question—total sales and comparison to purchases. The minor rounding differences do not justify a lower score, hence correctness is 9 (not 10) due to near-perfect but not exact numerical match in totals.",

The difference between these values is 1.38%. These distinct rates reflect differing financial assumptions in their stock option valuation models, with MET using a broader range (0.08% - 2.48%) that accounts for more variability in the risk-free rate, whereas V applied a single-point estimate (1.1%) for its 2022 calculations.",

The difference of **1.38 percentage points** reflects distinct assumptions about market conditions and discount rates. MET’s higher rate likely reflects a broader range of Treasury yield curve assumptions, while Visa’s lower rate aligns with its specific 2022 yield curve inputs.

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—values, years, and the arithmetic (2.48% - 1.1% = 1.38%) are correct.

The calculated difference is $92, but the correct difference is $6.64, indicating a major calculation or data extraction error. (2) Number verification: EMR value is off by $100 (77.58 vs 177.58), GD value is slightly off (169.54 vs 170.94), and the difference is wildly incorrect (92 vs 6.64).

This is a major error. For PM, while the 25.1% operating income growth (excluding currency and acquisitions) is correctly mentioned in one part, the LLM contradicts itself by first stating a 12.5% increase—another critical numerical error.

Adobe recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the term of customer agreements or based on usage for certain offerings, which provides a more predictable and recurring revenue stream. In contrast, Qualcomm's valuation allowance reflects uncertainty in realizing future tax benefits, which directly impacts its deferred tax asset carrying value and overall financial position.

This discrepancy is critical and suggests either a misreading of the document or incorrect data extraction. Additionally, the LLM claims Qualcomm's valuation allowance is 'not disclosed' in the provided filing, but the ground truth confirms it was $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023, indicating a failure to retrieve or recognize this information. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the Adobe revenue figure is off by over $6.9 billion, and the Qualcomm figure is entirely missing. Even allowing for format variation (e.g., $1.2B vs $1,200 million), the absence of one key number and the gross inaccuracy of the other severely undermine the quantitative foundation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is compromised because the model fails to correctly identify or extract both components of the required sum. Without accurate inputs, no valid synthesis can occur. The qualitative comparison between Adobe's revenue recognition and Qualcomm's deferred tax implications is partially sound in concept—Adobe does recognize revenue ratably—but the contrast cannot be meaningfully developed when one side of the equation (Qualcomm's valuation allowance implications) is deemed 'unspecified' despite being known.

      "original_answer": "Disney discloses that advertising revenues are a significant component of its service revenues, alongside affiliate fees, subscription fees, and other revenue streams tied to media networks and entertainment offerings. This indicates that advertising plays a key but not dominant role in its service-based revenue model. In contrast, Google explicitly states that advertising revenues from Google Search, Network properties, and YouTube ads are its largest source of cash provided by operations, highlighting a much more central and foundational role of advertising in Google’s financial structure. Therefore, while both companies rely on advertising revenues, Disney integrates it as one of several major revenue streams, whereas Google positions it as the core driver of its operating cash flows.",

In contrast, Google's disclosures highlight a heavy reliance on advertising revenues, as Google Services (its primary revenue driver) is explicitly tied to advertising and promotional activities, with advertising expenses rising sharply ($5.5B in 2021 to $7.2B in 2022). Google's operating income growth from 2020–2021 was directly linked to advertising revenue expansion, while Disney's operational dependencies are spread across multiple segments, including subscriptions (e.g., Disney+) and physical assets (e.g., theme parks), reducing its reliance on advertising alone.",

This means that Danaher's core sales growth reflects only organic performance, whereas Pfizer's earnings are adjusted downward by acquisition-related costs, impacting its reported profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher excludes acquisitions and currency translation from its non-GAAP core sales, while Pfizer includes acquisition-related costs (e.g., transaction costs, restructuring) in reconciling items that adjust segment results to non-GAAP metrics. Danaher’s core sales decline (1.5% in 2024) reflects GAAP sales minus acquisitions and currency effects, whereas Pfizer’s non-GAAP earnings adjustments account for acquisition-related expenses, which reduced 2024 earnings by $1.938 billion. These differences result in distinct non-GAAP metrics: Danaher’s core sales focus on organic performance, while Pfizer’s adjustments reflect broader acquisition-related impacts on profitability.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly states that Danaher excludes acquisition-related items and currency effects from its core sales to focus on organic performance, while Pfizer treats acquisition-related costs (e.g., transaction costs, restructuring) as reconciling items that reduce non-GAAP earnings—this matches the original answer's core claim. (2) The quantitative details—Danaher’s 1.5% core sales decline in 2024 and Pfizer’s $1.938 billion reduction in earnings due to acquisition-related costs—are factually correct and add precision not present in the original answer, enhancing completeness. These numbers are consistent with typical SEC filing disclosures and represent valid multi-hop synthesis. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that Danaher’s methodology isolates organic sales trends, whereas Pfizer’s adjustments directly impact profitability metrics, reflecting different non-GAAP philosophies. (4) Minor deduction in quantitative accuracy due to the introduction of specific figures (1.5%, $1.938B) not present in the ground truth; while plausible and consistent, the original answer did not include them, so their presence introduces unverifiable precision. However, since they do not contradict the ground truth and support the correct interpretation, the overall correctness remains high.

      "question": "How does the treatment of anti-dilutive securities excluded from diluted weighted-average common shares differ between HD and LOW in fiscal 2022, and what does this reveal about the potential dilutive effect on their respective earnings per share calculations?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD reported no anti-dilutive securities excluded from diluted weighted-average common shares, while LOW excluded 0.3 million shares in the same period. This difference reveals that LOW had a measurable number of anti-dilutive securities that could have potentially reduced earnings per share if exercised or converted, whereas HD had no such securities affecting its diluted EPS calculation. The presence of anti-dilutive shares in LOW’s calculation suggests a more complex capital structure with potential future dilution risk compared to HD, which had a simpler or more stable share structure.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022, **HD** reported **no anti-dilutive securities excluded** from diluted weighted-average common shares (indicated by a \"-\"), while **LOW** excluded **0.3 million** anti-dilutive securities. This suggests that **LOW** had securities (e.g., stock options or warrants) that, if included, would not have diluted EPS, indicating a smaller potential dilutive effect on its EPS calculation. Conversely, **HD**’s absence of excluded anti-dilutive securities implies all potential securities were dilutive, leading to a higher diluted share count and potentially lower EPS compared to LOW.",

Thus, quantitative accuracy is perfect. (2) However, the reasoning and interpretation are flawed. The LLM incorrectly states that the exclusion of anti-dilutive securities in LOW's case indicates a 'smaller potential dilutive effect,' which misrepresents the concept. In reality, anti-dilutive securities are excluded *because* they would increase EPS if included (e.g., when stock price is above option strike price), so their presence suggests *potential future dilution* if conditions change. The ground truth correctly interprets this as a sign of a more complex capital structure and future dilution risk for LOW. (3) The LLM also incorrectly implies that HD’s lack of excluded securities means all potential securities were dilutive, which may be true, but it mischaracterizes the implication: having no anti-dilutive securities does not necessarily lead to a 'higher diluted share count'—it simply means all in-the-money instruments were already included. The conclusion comparing EPS impact between HD and LOW is speculative and reversed in logic. (4) While the answer is factually accurate in numbers and addresses the question’s structure, the flawed reasoning significantly undermines the qualitative accuracy, warranting a score of 6 for correctness—partially correct but with significant conceptual errors.",

      "original_answer": "Danaher excludes acquisition-related items because their frequency, size, and timing vary significantly from period to period and between peers, which can obscure underlying business trends. Specifically, Danaher deems acquisition-related transaction costs significant if they exceed the typical range, especially for larger acquisitions. In contrast, Pfizer excludes acquisition-related items such as transaction, integration, restructuring charges, and additional depreciation costs because they are unique to each transaction and represent costs incurred to restructure and integrate businesses post-acquisition. Pfizer also notes that these integration costs may span several years and are often tied to external approvals. This reveals that while both companies exclude acquisition-related items to provide clearer operational performance insights, Danaher focuses on the variability and comparability issues, whereas Pfizer emphasizes the unique, one-time nature of these costs and their long-term integration timelines.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher excludes acquisition-related transaction costs only when they exceed typical ranges for the company, focusing on excluding significant, non-recurring costs tied to large acquisitions. This approach emphasizes transparency in core business trends and integration efficiency. Pfizer, however, excludes a broader range of acquisition-related items, including transaction, integration, restructuring charges, and depreciation costs, as these are unique to each acquisition and reflect the costs of integrating businesses.

HD’s near 1:1 ticket-to-sales growth implies stable transactions, but the precise -0.1% figure is unsupported and introduces a minor factual error.

      "original_answer": "Adobe's cost of revenue for 2023 is $115 million, and Qualcomm's cost of revenue for 2023 is $76 million, making the combined total $191 million. Adobe's total operating expenses for 2023 are $1,718 million, and Qualcomm's total operating expenses for 2023 are $2,021 million, making the combined total operating expenses $3,739 million. Therefore, the combined cost of revenue represents approximately 5.1% of the combined total operating expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "The combined total of Adobe's and Qualcomm's cost of revenue for 2023 is **$204 million** ($115 million for Adobe and $89 million for Qualcomm).

While Adobe's cost of revenue is correctly stated as $115 million, Qualcomm's is incorrectly reported as $89 million instead of the correct $76 million, leading to an incorrect combined total of $204 million instead of $191 million. Additionally, Adobe's total operating expenses are reported as $1,603 million, which is incorrect (correct value: $1,718 million), and Qualcomm's operating expenses are overstated at $2,559 million instead of $2,021 million. These errors severely impact the quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation of the percentage of combined cost of revenue relative to combined operating expenses is missing entirely—no percentage is provided in the LLM answer, though the ground truth shows it should be approximately 5.1%. Even with the LLM's incorrect numbers, no such calculation is attempted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing cost of revenue to operating expenses across two companies—but fails due to reliance on incorrect data. The model identifies the correct companies and financial metrics (cost of revenue, operating expenses), showing understanding of the required synthesis, but executes it with inaccurate values. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and addresses the structure of the question—comparing combined cost of revenue to operating expenses—but due to major numerical inaccuracies and missing calculations, the correctness score is low. Minor formatting differences are acceptable, but core financial data must be accurate, and here multiple key figures are wrong.",

      "question": "How does the difference in fuel surcharge mechanisms between FedEx and Union Pacific affect their respective abilities to manage fuel cost volatility, given FedEx adjusts weekly and Union Pacific experiences a two-month lag in surcharge recovery?",
      "original_answer": "FedEx applies fuel surcharges on both air and ground services that are adjusted weekly (with some international FedEx Express surcharges updated monthly), allowing it to more closely align surcharge revenue with current fuel prices. In contrast, Union Pacific notes that its fuel surcharge programs trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, which can lead to volatility in quarterly and yearly results, especially during periods of rapid fuel price changes. This difference in fuel surcharge responsiveness means FedEx can more quickly pass fuel cost increases to customers, while Union Pacific faces a built-in delay that may expose it to more financial risk during volatile fuel markets.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx adjusts fuel surcharges weekly, enabling quicker alignment with fuel price changes and reducing short-term volatility in earnings. Union Pacific's two-month lag in surcharge recovery delays its ability to pass on fuel cost increases to customers, exposing it to greater quarter-over-quarter volatility and potentially longer-term earnings pressure from unadjusted fuel expenses. This difference in responsiveness directly impacts their capacity to mitigate fuel cost fluctuations.",

There are no calculations, but temporal references (weekly, two-month lag) are precisely aligned. (2) The answer correctly identifies both companies and their respective surcharge timing, satisfying entity accuracy. (3) The reasoning is sound: it logically connects the frequency of surcharge adjustments to earnings volatility and risk exposure, correctly synthesizing the implications of responsiveness. The multi-hop element—comparing how each company’s mechanism affects their ability to manage fuel cost volatility—is well executed. (4) While the LLM omits a minor detail from the original answer (that some international FedEx Express surcharges are updated monthly), this does not undermine the central accuracy or conclusion.

MCD reported a $2.2 billion (30%) increase, which it attributed to improved operating results. NKE reported a $1.588 billion increase ($7,429 million in fiscal 2024 vs. $5,841 million in fiscal 2023), which was primarily driven by favorable changes in working capital, particularly in inventories due to reduced inventory purchases and improved lead times.",

McDonald's reported an **increase of $2.2 billion** (30% growth) due to improved operating results.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is partially correct but contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. The combined increase is reported as $4.0 billion, which is close to the ground truth of $4.016 billion and acceptable within rounding. However, Nike's increase is incorrectly stated as $1.8 billion instead of $1.588 billion (a notable difference of $212 million). Additionally, the LLM claims a 32% growth for Nike, which is not supported by the ground truth—this percentage is not mentioned and cannot be verified from the provided data. (2) The calculation of the combined increase is approximately correct ($2.2B + $1.8B = $4.0B), but since Nike's actual increase is $1.588B, the correct sum is $3.788B, not $4.016B as stated in the original answer. However, the original answer itself appears to have a calculation error: $2.2B + $1.588B = $3.788B, not $4.016B—this discrepancy in the ground truth complicates evaluation. Assuming the $4.016B figure is correct per source data, then both the LLM and the reasoning are flawed. But based on the numbers provided for MCD and NKE, the sum should be $3.788B. Given this confusion, the LLM’s $4.0B is closer to the stated combined figure than the math would suggest, so partial credit is given. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure—LLM identifies both companies, retrieves their respective increases, sums them, and provides attributions. However, the attribution for Nike is incorrect: the ground truth cites 'favorable changes in working capital, particularly in inventories due to reduced inventory purchases and improved lead times,' whereas the LLM cites 'higher operating results and reduced capital expenditures,' which misrepresents the cause (capital expenditures relate to investing activities, not operating cash flow). (4) Scores reflect that core entities (MCD, NKE, 2023, cash from operations) are correct and the overall structure matches, but key numbers and explanations contain material errors. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect figures; qualitative accuracy is moderate due to flawed reasoning on Nike’s attribution; contextual relevance is high as the response addresses all parts of the question appropriately.",

      "original_answer": "Colgate (CL) highlights that temporary differences between financial and tax accounting cause the current tax provision to be higher or lower than the total income tax provision, though it does not provide specific dollar amounts. In contrast, Costco (COST) provides detailed figures showing its 2023 deferred tax provision at $33 million (federal), $10 million (state), and $(10)$ million (foreign), totaling $33M + $10M - $10M = $33 million. This allows a comparison: while both companies experience temporary differences, only Costco quantifies the impact, revealing a relatively small net deferred tax liability in 2023, which contrasts with Colgate’s qualitative emphasis on potentially significant effects.",
      "llm_answer": "The difference in deferred tax provisions between Colgate (CL) and Costco (COST) in 2023 reflects contrasting tax timing effects due to varying temporary differences. Costco's deferred tax provisions ($43 million) were lower, driven by temporary differences like foreign tax credits and state tax liabilities, which reduced its effective tax rate (25.9%). Colgate's deferred tax benefit of $135 million, stemming from temporary differences in areas like goodwill, pension liabilities, and stock-based compensation, contributed to a higher effective tax rate (27.6%). These differences highlight how the timing of tax deductions and credits impacts each company's deferred tax provisions, with Costco benefiting more from deferred tax assets and Colgate facing higher deferred tax liabilities.",

The ground truth states that Colgate does not provide specific dollar amounts for its deferred tax provision and only discusses temporary differences qualitatively. However, the LLM claims Colgate had a 'deferred tax benefit of $135 million,' which is not supported by the original answer and is therefore incorrect. Similarly, the LLM states Costco's deferred tax provision was '$43 million,' but the ground truth specifies it as $33 million (after summing $33M federal, $10M state, and -$10M foreign). The LLM incorrectly calculates or reports this total. Additionally, the effective tax rates cited (25.9% for Costco, 27.6% for Colgate) are not mentioned in the original answer and thus lack verification. (2) Number/calculation verification: Costco’s correct total deferred tax provision is $33M + $10M – $10M = $33 million, not $43 million. Colgate’s $135 million figure is entirely fabricated per the ground truth. The breakdown of temporary differences (e.g., goodwill, pension liabilities) for Colgate is not present in the original answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The LLM attempts to compare tax timing effects via deferred tax provisions, which aligns with the question's intent. However, because it invents quantitative data and misrepresents the nature of disclosures (implying Colgate provides numbers when it does not), the synthesis is flawed. The reasoning about timing differences impacting deferred taxes is conceptually sound but applied to incorrect data. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major factual and numerical errors. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2/10) — both companies’ figures are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is partially acceptable (4/10) — the general idea of contrasting disclosures exists, but details are unsupported.

Additionally, the LLM states that Costco's international operations had a -0.2% FX impact, which is not present in the original answer—no such figure was provided for Costco's FX impact. The -4.0% FX impact for Colgate is correctly cited. (2) The calculation and comparison of FX impacts are flawed due to the introduction of unsupported numbers. While Colgate's -4.0% FX impact is accurate, the claimed 2.5% organic growth (leading to implied reported growth) contradicts the ground truth, which implies reported growth was even lower than -1.5% due to the negative FX effect. The -0.2% FX impact for Costco is entirely fabricated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing FX impact and linking it to cost structures—but fails in execution because it relies on incorrect data. The original answer draws a contrast based on qualitative differences (Colgate facing headwinds vs. Costco benefiting from lower wage costs), not quantitative FX comparisons. The LLM invents a quantitative comparison that does not exist in the source. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core question about FX impacts and cost structures. However, the qualitative accuracy is reduced due to incorrect reasoning based on false numbers, and quantitative accuracy is low due to two major incorrect percentages. The correctness score is moderate because the direction of reasoning is appropriate, but the factual foundation is flawed.",

      "original_answer": "PYPL explicitly reports accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaling $36 million at December 31, 2021, which is included in other current assets. This means PYPL's credit risk exposure would directly consider these interest receivables in their financial statements. In contrast, SCHW excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans when calculating its allowance for credit losses, indicating that accrued interest is treated separately and not subject to the same credit risk provisions as the principal loan amounts. This results in different financial statement visibility of credit risk exposure between the two companies, with PYPL including interest receivable in asset balances subject to credit risk and SCHW isolating it from credit loss estimation.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal (PYPL) excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale debt securities, which affects its credit loss calculations by reducing the base amount used to assess impairment. This may understate credit risk exposure if the accrued interest is at risk of non-collection. In contrast, Charles Schwab (SCHW) explicitly excludes accrued interest receivable from credit loss calculations for AFS securities, reversing accrued interest when securities are placed on nonaccrual. This approach more accurately reflects credit risk by excluding interest that is already accrued but not yet collected, leading to a more precise allowance for credit losses.

Contrary to the ground truth, PYPL does *not* exclude* accrued interest receivable; instead, it explicitly reports $36 million of accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2021, which is included in other current assets and thus part of credit risk exposure. The LLM incorrectly states that PYPL excludes it from amortized cost and fair value, which contradicts the original answer. Conversely, for SCHW, the LLM correctly notes that accrued interest receivable is excluded from credit loss calculations, but mischaracterizes the context—SCHW excludes it from the amortized cost basis of *loans*, not AFS securities, and reverses accrued interest upon nonaccrual status. (2) The only quantitative element in the ground truth is PYPL’s $36 million accrued interest receivable at year-end 2021; this number is completely omitted in the LLM answer, representing a failure in quantitative accuracy. No other numbers are present or required. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM reverses the treatment between the two companies—PYPL includes the receivable (thus integrating it into credit risk), while SCHW excludes it from credit loss models. The LLM incorrectly claims PYPL excludes it and SCHW includes it in a way that improves accuracy, when in fact the opposite is true. This undermines the core comparison. (4) Despite the incorrect facts and reasoning, the answer remains contextually relevant by addressing the question’s structure—comparing two firms’ treatments of accrued interest in credit risk—and discussing implications for financial statements.

      "original_answer": "LOW reported a sales return reserve of $245 million in 2022, reflecting a concrete financial liability set aside to account for expected product returns based on historical experience. In contrast, TSLA disclosed that its sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience and are 'immaterial in all periods presented,' indicating that the company does not set aside significant reserves due to its assessment that the economic incentives for customers to return vehicles are low. This contrast reveals that LOW, as a traditional retail business, faces more frequent and predictable product returns requiring explicit financial provisioning, while TSLA's automotive sales model, especially with resale value guarantees, involves less immediate return risk due to structured buyback terms and customer financing arrangements. As a result, TSLA's revenue recognition policy assumes lower variability in returns, whereas LOW's policy reflects a more direct and material exposure to returns.",
      "llm_answer": "The differences in sales return reserve values between LOW and TSLA reflect distinct approaches to accounting for product return risks. LOW recognizes revenue at the point of sale and records a sales return reserve based on historical return rates, reducing revenue immediately with a gross reserve (page 52). TSLA, however, adjusts reserves for automotive sales with resale guarantees using historical data **plus** expected future market values, incorporating quarterly assessments of vehicle resale values (page 35). This highlights that LOW’s policy is more static, relying on past trends, while TSLA’s approach integrates forward-looking market conditions, indicating a more dynamic revenue recognition framework that accounts for potential value fluctuations. TSLA’s method suggests a conservative stance on resale guarantees, whereas LOW’s approach aligns with standard retail practices of immediate return provisioning.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding TSLA's sales return reserve. The original answer states that TSLA considers its reserves 'immaterial in all periods presented,' meaning no significant dollar value is disclosed or reserved. However, the LLM claims TSLA adjusts reserves using historical data and expected future market values, implying an active and quantifiable reserve process, which contradicts the ground truth. This misrepresents TSLA's actual policy of not setting aside material reserves. Additionally, the LLM introduces the idea of 'resale guarantees' and 'quarterly assessments of vehicle resale values' (citing page 35), but this is not equivalent to a sales return reserve; resale value adjustments relate more to lease accounting or financing guarantees, not direct product returns. The $245 million figure for LOW is correct and matches the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct—only the LOW number ($245M) is accurate and properly attributed. TSLA’s reserve is not quantified because it is deemed immaterial, so any implication of a numerical reserve or calculation method for returns is incorrect. There are no calculations in the question, but the synthesis of reserve values is flawed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly identifies that LOW uses historical return rates and accounts for returns upfront, aligning with standard retail revenue recognition. It also correctly contrasts this with TSLA’s different business model. However, the reasoning fails in asserting that TSLA has a dynamic reserve system based on forward-looking market conditions; this confuses resale value guarantees (a separate financial exposure) with sales return reserves. The original answer emphasizes that TSLA does not record significant reserves due to low return incentives, while the LLM incorrectly suggests an active, complex provisioning system. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the response addresses the core question about differing return risk accounting and links it to revenue recognition policies. The qualitative analysis of LOW’s static vs TSLA’s dynamic approach is conceptually interesting but based on a misinterpretation of TSLA’s disclosures.

      "original_answer": "Costco and PepsiCo both reported an effective tax rate of 24.4% in 2024. However, the composition of their tax expenses reveals different foreign tax burdens: Costco's foreign taxes were $109 million, or 1.1% of total taxes, while PepsiCo's current foreign taxes were $1,406 million, representing 52% of its total current tax expense of $2,694 million.

Costco's foreign tax burden was **1.1%** of pre-tax income, reflecting minimal foreign tax expenses, whereas PepsiCo's foreign tax component included a **-2.5%** rate (indicating tax benefits from foreign operations, such as lower tax rates or credits).

It states that PepsiCo's effective tax rate in 2024 was 19.4%, but the ground truth is 24.4%—matching Costco's rate. This is a major quantitative error. Additionally, the LLM claims PepsiCo had a '-2.5%' tax rate from foreign operations, implying a benefit, but the original answer states PepsiCo's current foreign taxes were $1,406 million, or 52% of its total current tax expense—indicating a substantial foreign tax liability, not a benefit. The LLM incorrectly frames PepsiCo's foreign tax position as favorable due to tax benefits, when in fact the data shows high foreign tax exposure. (2) Number verification: Costco's foreign taxes were $109 million (1.1% of total taxes), which the LLM correctly identifies as 1.1%, though it mislabels it as '1.1% of pre-tax income' instead of 'of total taxes'—a material misrepresentation. PepsiCo's foreign tax component is completely misrepresented: $1,406 million (52% of $2,694 million) is not equivalent to a -2.5% rate. There is no support in the original for negative or beneficial foreign tax impact. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failure: The question requires comparing effective tax rates and analyzing tax expense components to infer foreign tax burden. The LLM fails this synthesis—despite both firms having the same effective rate, it incorrectly suggests a rate difference and draws opposite conclusions about foreign tax exposure. The original emphasizes PepsiCo's much larger foreign tax burden in absolute and relative terms, while the LLM incorrectly infers a tax advantage. (4) Correctness score is low (2) due to major factual and interpretive errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2) due to wrong rates and invented figures. Qualitative accuracy is low (3) because entity names and some percentages are correct, but reasoning and interpretation are flawed.

      "original_answer": "Amazon's cost of sales explicitly includes inbound and outbound shipping costs, which are a major component of its fulfillment expenses. This means that any increases in shipping costs directly raise Amazon's cost of sales, thereby reducing gross margins unless offset by other factors. In contrast, Nike reported that lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs contributed to a 220 basis point gross margin expansion. This indicates that while Amazon's cost structure is sensitive to shipping cost increases, Nike benefited from reduced logistics expenses, leading to improved profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon's lower shipping/logistics costs reduced its cost of sales, contributing to gross margin expansion despite broader challenges like currency-related margin contraction. Nike's logistics cost decrease directly drove gross margin expansion by lowering product costs, contrasting with Amazon's more mixed impact where logistics savings were offset by other factors like higher input costs and currency effects.",

(2) Quantitatively, the LLM introduces no verifiable numbers but misrepresents the direction of impact—claiming Amazon saw logistics savings—while the ground truth contains a specific 220 basis point gross margin expansion for Nike, which the LLM correctly notes but fails to contrast accurately because of its incorrect claim about Amazon. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly assumes Amazon experienced logistics cost decreases, which is not supported by the ground truth, and thus fails to correctly contrast Amazon's cost structure sensitivity with Nike's actual benefit. The correct contrast is that Amazon’s cost of sales is burdened by rising shipping costs, while Nike benefited from falling logistics costs.

The ground truth difference is $1,724 million, but the LLM reports only $2.6 million, which is off by three orders of magnitude. The calculation uses incorrect values: LOW's income tax adjustment is taken as $5,622 million from the ROIC table, but this figure is not the income tax adjustment—it is likely the total tax expense or another related figure, not the adjustment itself. Similarly, HD's implied income tax adjustment is calculated as operating income times effective tax rate ($23,040M × 24.4% = $5,619.36M), which computes the actual tax expense, not an 'implied adjustment.' The term 'income tax adjustment' in the context of ROIC calculations typically refers to a specific add-back or normalization (e.g., cash tax adjustment), not total tax expense. The LLM fails to correctly interpret what 'income tax adjustment' means in this financial context. Furthermore, the multi-hop synthesis between the two companies' filings is based on a misunderstanding of the metric, leading to a completely inaccurate comparison. While the answer attempts to follow a logical structure and references appropriate documents (10-Ks), the entities and metrics are misidentified, and the calculation does not reflect the true adjustment values from the knowledge graph.

(1) All factual elements are correct: PayPal's 2021 minority interest acquisitions were valued at $64 million using a market-based approach that subtracted a control premium from the value paid, based on third-party market analysis. The LLM correctly captures this methodology and the rationale, even though it does not explicitly state the $64 million figure. However, since the question does not explicitly ask for the dollar amount and the focus is on the methodology, this omission does not significantly detract from correctness. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no incorrect numbers or dates are presented, and the $64 million value, while not mentioned, is not required for full credit given the question's focus on methodology. (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts PayPal’s control premium adjustment with JPMorgan’s forward-looking, credit-loss-driven discounted cash flow approach tied to the allowance for credit losses and indemnification assets. It accurately identifies the influencing factors—market-based control premiums vs. credit risk modeling and loss recovery expectations. (4) The answer demonstrates strong multi-hop synthesis by distinguishing between two different companies, asset types, and valuation frameworks from separate filings. The contextual relevance is excellent, directly addressing the differences in valuation methodologies and the factors influencing each. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the explicit $64 million figure, but since the question emphasizes methodology over specific valuation amounts, this does not warrant a lower score.

Specifically, the North America operating income improvement and the reduced International operating loss were attributed to increased unit sales. In contrast, Nike reported a 12% decrease in combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels during its fiscal year 2023, which contributed to revenue declines and a 30% drop in EBIT. Therefore, while Amazon's unit sales growth supported stronger operating results, Nike's unit sales contraction significantly weakened its operating performance.",

According to the ground truth, Amazon's unit sales increased in 2023 and positively impacted operating performance, but the LLM incorrectly attributes a 12% increase in North America net sales to unit sales without citing unit sales growth percentage for Amazon. More critically, the ground truth states that Nike experienced a 12% *decrease* in combined unit sales (wholesale and DTC) in fiscal year 2023, whereas the LLM claims Nike's footwear unit sales increased by 8% and apparel by 7% — this directly contradicts the correct data. These errors completely reverse the direction of Nike's performance trend. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the LLM reports +8% and +7% for Nike, while the correct figure is a -12% decline in total unit sales. There is no mention of Amazon's specific unit sales percentage change, which was not provided in the original answer but should not be fabricated. The 12% figure cited by the LLM for Amazon net sales is not in the ground truth and appears conflated with Nike’s decline. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the contrasting impacts of unit sales on Amazon (positive) vs. Nike (negative). Instead, it incorrectly asserts that both companies had unit sales growth and improved operating performance, missing that Nike’s EBIT dropped 30% due to declining volumes. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses unit sales and operating performance for both companies, but the incorrect data renders the synthesis invalid.

Although marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased by 170 basis points, this was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. In contrast, Walmart’s Sam’s Club segment saw net sales increase by $1.8 billion or 2.2% for fiscal 2024, with comparable sales growth benefiting from increases in transactions and average ticket, particularly in grocery and health and wellness. The Sam’s Club segment also experienced a positive contribution from e-commerce sales, which helped offset declines in fuel sales due to deflation.

This reflects less efficient cost management relative to net sales growth, exacerbated by productivity savings and foreign exchange impacts. In contrast, Walmart's Sam's Club segment reduced operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 152 basis points in 2024, driven by supply chain efficiencies and lapping of prior restructuring charges. The segment's operating margin remained stable despite a 2.2% net sales growth, aided by fuel sales (excluded in \"Excluding Fuel\" metrics) and lower incremental costs.

PayPal's outstanding balance in its merchant loan portfolio was $1.2 billion as of the same date, significantly smaller in scale. The allowance for loan losses at JPM is designed to cover potential credit losses across a broad range of loans, while PayPal's credit risk is concentrated in its merchant finance products like PPWC and PPBL, where repayment depends on merchants' payment processing volumes. The difference in scale indicates that JPM has a much larger and systemically important lending operation, while PayPal’s lending is more specialized and tied to its digital payments ecosystem.",

This indicates a large-scale lending operation with relatively lower risk exposure. In contrast, PayPal's merchant finance portfolio had an allowance of **$160 million** for a total outstanding balance of **$1.2 billion**, yielding a much higher allowance-to-loan ratio of **13.3%**.

The allowance-to-loan ratio of 0.28% is therefore incorrect due to false inputs. PayPal’s allowance is stated as $160 million in the LLM answer, but the original answer does not provide PayPal’s allowance figure at all—only the outstanding balance of $1.2 billion—making the $160 million and the derived 13.3% ratio unsupported and likely incorrect. (2) Calculations cannot be validated because the source numbers are wrong or missing in the ground truth. The original answer does not provide enough data to compute PayPal’s allowance or ratio, so the LLM invented plausible but unverified metrics. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing scale and risk via allowance and portfolio size—but fails in execution because it relies on hallucinated data. The qualitative insight about PayPal’s risk concentration in merchant finance tied to processing volumes is aligned with the original answer, as is the idea that JPMorgan has a broader, diversified lending operation. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses the question’s intent: comparing scale and risk exposure using allowance for loan losses. However, the correctness score is low due to severe quantitative inaccuracies. While the reasoning framework is logical, the use of incorrect numbers undermines the entire analysis, especially in a financial context where precision is critical. Minor credit is given for correct entity identification (JPMorgan Chase, PayPal, merchant finance) and correct date (December 31, 2023).",

The ground truth states that combined Paint Sales were $16,179 million and total Net Sales were $243,188 million, whereas the LLM reports $16,320 million and $245,891 million, respectively—both figures are incorrect. The percentage reported (6.6%) is close but not exact; the correct value is approximately 6.65%, which could be rounded to 6.7% at best, but 6.6% is not sufficiently accurate given the magnitude of the numbers. (2) Specific number verification: HD’s Paint Sales and Net Sales, as well as LOW’s, are not aligned with the ground truth data. For example, if HD and LOW’s Net Sales sum to $159,514M + $86,377M = $245,891M, this already deviates from the true combined Net Sales of $243,188M. Similarly, the Paint Sales sum of $11,203M + $5,117M = $16,320M does not match the true $16,179M. These discrepancies suggest incorrect source data or miscalculations. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly understands the task—aggregating Paint Sales and Net Sales across two companies and computing the percentage contribution—so the logical structure is sound. However, the reasoning fails due to reliance on incorrect underlying data, undermining the synthesis. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4/10) due to major quantitative errors despite correct framing; Quantitative Accuracy is 4 due to incorrect dollar amounts and derived percentage; Qualitative Accuracy is 5 because the approach and entity identification (HD, LOW, fiscal year 2024, Paint Sales, Net Sales) are correct, but data sourcing is flawed; Contextual Relevance is 9 because the answer directly addresses the question’s structure and intent, only failing on data fidelity.",

This 1-month difference implies that PayPal's modified loans have a slightly longer average duration compared to JPMorgan's, as extended terms directly increase the time over which loans are amortized.

It incorrectly states that JPMorgan Chase's 'Other' loan modifications had a 23-month extension, while the ground truth specifies that JPMorgan had two distinct categories: 23 months for single term extensions and 137 months for other-than-insignificant payment deferrals with term extensions. The LLM conflates these, misrepresenting the data. PayPal's 24-month extension is correctly reported. (2) The quantitative accuracy is compromised because the model fails to report the 137-month extension for JPMorgan's significant deferrals, which is a major omission affecting the comparative analysis. The 1-month difference cited (24 vs 23) is misleading because it compares PayPal to the wrong JPMorgan category. Additionally, the mention of JPMorgan's commercial and industrial loan modifications having a 17-month extension is not in the original answer and appears fabricated or misattributed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the original answer draws a nuanced comparison between PayPal’s uniform 24-month extension and JPMorgan’s two-tiered extensions, highlighting that PayPal’s is slightly longer than JPMorgan’s single extensions but much shorter than the 137-month category. The LLM fails to capture this key contrast and instead creates an incorrect comparison and introduces unverified data. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the question about term extensions and their impact on loan duration—and correctly reports PayPal’s number.

      "original_answer": "Elevated consumer debt levels are causing discretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers for Altria, influencing their purchasing behaviors, including brand mix and adoption of smoke-free products. This directly affects Altria's strategy to maintain a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% through 2028 while investing in innovative smoke-free products. Similarly, Walmart notes that consumer debt levels impact buying patterns and disposable income, prompting them to absorb cost increases, reduce prices in certain categories, and focus on opening-price points to maintain customer spending. Both companies are adapting to the same macroeconomic constraint—elevated consumer debt—by adjusting their product and pricing strategies to retain consumers and maintain financial performance.",

      "question": "How do Apple's and Adobe's approaches to security training differ in scope and mandatory requirements, and what do these differences suggest about each company's strategy for mitigating cybersecurity risks?",
      "original_answer": "Apple provides 'general safety, security and crisis management training' to its employees as part of its broader health and safety initiatives, but does not specify frequency or mandatory requirements. In contrast, Adobe requires all employees to complete 'general security awareness training annually,' with additional role-specific training mandated for engineering and security personnel. These differences suggest that while Apple integrates security training into a broader safety framework, Adobe emphasizes formalized, recurring, and role-tailored training as a core component of its cybersecurity risk management strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe mandates annual general security awareness training for all employees and provides additional engineering and security-specific training for certain roles, reflecting a structured, role-based approach to cybersecurity risk mitigation. Apple's disclosures mention general safety, security, and crisis management training but do not specify mandatory security training requirements or scope, suggesting a less detailed or less emphasized strategy in its 2024 10-K. These differences highlight Adobe's proactive, comprehensive approach to employee cybersecurity education, while Apple's focus appears more generalized or less explicitly outlined in the provided documents.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly captures the core differences between Apple and Adobe's security training approaches. It accurately states that Adobe mandates annual general security awareness training for all employees and provides additional role-specific training for engineering and security personnel. It also correctly notes that Apple mentions general safety, security, and crisis management training but does not specify mandatory requirements or frequency. These facts align with the ground truth. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—however, the absence of any incorrect numerical claims earns full credit. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information from both companies' disclosures and draws a logical conclusion about their differing cybersecurity strategies—Adobe's structured, proactive approach versus Apple's more generalized or less explicitly defined one. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly softens the contrast by saying Apple's focus 'appears more generalized or less explicitly outlined,' whereas the ground truth more confidently interprets this as integration into a broader safety framework. This nuance slightly affects qualitative accuracy but does not undermine correctness. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing scope, mandatory requirements, and strategic implications for both companies. Overall, the response is factually accurate, well-reasoned, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth with only minor differences in interpretive tone.",

CAT's consolidated operating profit grew by 64%, while UPS's consolidated operating profit declined by approximately 30.2%. Therefore, CAT's growth rate is significantly higher than UPS's decline rate.",

      "question": "How does Altria's dependency on subsidiary cash flows for liquidity compare to Walmart's funding considerations for its $20.0 billion share repurchase program, and what role does each company's cost of borrowings play in their respective capital allocation decisions?",
      "original_answer": "Altria, as a holding company, is primarily dependent on the capital resources of its subsidiaries to satisfy its liquidity requirements, receiving cash from dividends, distributions, and interest on intercompany loans. At the end of 2023, Altria had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and believed its liquidity position, including access to credit markets and future operating cash flows, was sufficient to meet its obligations and fund dividends, share repurchases, and debt repayments. Walmart, on the other hand, considers several factors when executing its $20.0 billion share repurchase program, including current cash needs, leverage capacity, and the cost of borrowings. As of January 31, 2024, $16.5 billion remained available under the program, which Walmart expects to fund primarily through free cash flow. Both companies factor the cost of borrowings into their capital allocation decisions, but Altria's reliance on subsidiary cash flows reflects a structural dependency, while Walmart's approach is more directly tied to its operational free cash flow generation.",
      "llm_answer": "Altria relies on subsidiary cash flows through dividends, interest payments, and intercompany loans, as it is a holding company dependent on its subsidiaries' operating cash flows. Walmart similarly depends on subsidiary cash flows but emphasizes using free cash flow from operations and access to credit markets for its $20.0 billion share repurchase program. Both companies consider their cost of borrowings in capital allocation: Walmart's lower short-term borrowing rates (5.1% in 2024) and strong credit ratings (e.g., S&P AA) support flexible financing, while Altria's weighted-average long-term debt rate of 4.3% in 2023 influences its debt strategy.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies, particularly in quantitative details not present or incorrect in the ground truth. For example, Walmart's '5.1% short-term borrowing rates in 2024' and Altria's 'weighted-average long-term debt rate of 4.3% in 2023' are not mentioned in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. Similarly, S&P AA rating for Walmart is absent in the original and thus an unsupported addition. These unverified metrics significantly reduce quantitative accuracy. (2) The original answer states Altria had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2023 and Walmart had $16.5 billion remaining on its repurchase program as of January 31, 2024—neither of these key figures is mentioned in the LLM response, indicating omission of critical quantitative data. (3) Qualitatively, the LLM correctly identifies Altria’s structural dependency on subsidiary cash flows due to its holding company status and correctly contrasts this with Walmart’s reliance on free cash flow and credit access. The role of cost of borrowings in capital allocation is appropriately acknowledged for both firms, showing sound multi-hop reasoning across entities. However, the claim that Walmart 'similarly depends on subsidiary cash flows' overreaches—the original emphasizes free cash flow and leverage capacity, not subsidiary flows, making this a mischaracterization. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses both companies, their funding sources, and the role of borrowing costs in capital decisions. Despite incorrect or unsupported numbers, the overall structure and intent align with the question. Correctness score is 6 due to partially accurate reasoning but significant quantitative errors and omissions of key facts from the ground truth.",

      "original_answer": "A $50 million potential decrease in ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits suggests that some previously uncertain tax positions may be resolved within the next year. This would likely result in a corresponding adjustment to ADBE's tax provision, indicating that its prior reserves were potentially overstated, or that the resolution of audits has clarified the adequacy of its tax reserves. This directly supports ADBE's assertion that it regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Similarly, AAPL also evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, though AAPL does not specify a quantitative estimate of potential changes. Both companies thus use ongoing assessments of audit outcomes to guide the sufficiency of their tax reserves, but ADBE provides a specific dollar amount of potential change, while AAPL offers a more qualitative evaluation.",
      "llm_answer": "A $50 million decrease in ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits over the next 12 months would reduce its tax provision adequacy assessment, as lower liabilities would decrease the required tax accruals. Adobe notes this potential reduction is \"reasonably possible\" due to audit resolutions or statute expirations. AAPL similarly evaluates tax reserves by assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes from examinations and changes in tax laws, maintaining provisions for potential adjustments.

Additionally, there was a $240 million impairment related to a Phase 3 study for the treatment of DMD reflecting unfavorable clinical trial results. However, Thermo Fisher Scientific’s 2024 10-K filing only includes a placeholder note about consolidated financial statements without disclosing any specific impairments, investments, or developments in the Biopharma segment.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. The total impairment amount is stated as $3.295 billion, but the ground truth specifies $2.9 billion. This discrepancy arises because the LLM likely miscalculated the sum of the individual impairments: $1.0B (B7H4V) + $475M (Medrol) + $435M (Zavzpret) + $240M (DMD Phase 3) = $2.15 billion in named impairments, with the remaining $750M implied to be from 'other impairments' to reach $2.9B total. The LLM's $3.295B figure does not match this and introduces an unsupported total. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies the causes (development changes, clinical trial results, commercial forecasts), it aggregates unnamed 'other impairments' incorrectly. The $240M DMD impairment is correctly attributed to unfavorable trial results, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM fails to specify the individual program impairments (e.g., $1.0B for felmetatug vedotin, $475M for Medrol), instead bundling them into a general total. (3) The qualitative reasoning about Thermo Fisher is sound: the model correctly notes the absence of specific Biopharma segment impairments in Thermo Fisher’s disclosures and concludes there is insufficient evidence of a link, which matches the ground truth. It references a plausible document location (page 62), though this detail isn't verifiable from the provided context. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the multi-hop question—Pfizer’s financial impact and the lack of connection to Thermo Fisher.

      "llm_answer": "JPMorgan Chase's Principal Transactions Revenue (e.g., $23.7 billion in 2023) is part of Markets & Securities Services and includes adjustments to fair value of securities positions, derivatives, and valuation adjustments, reflecting its role in fixed-income trading and risk management. Charles Schwab's Principal Transactions Revenue ($225 million in 2023) is a subset of Trading Revenue, tied to client fixed-income trading activity and includes unrealized gains/losses on segregated regulatory assets. JPMorgan's line item is broader, encompassing complex derivatives and hedging activities, while Schwab's focuses on client-driven trading with smaller scale. Both present it within their respective revenue segments, but JPMorgan's composition reflects its investment banking and market-making operations, whereas Schwab's aligns with brokerage trading.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies, particularly in the quantitative details. The ground truth does not provide specific dollar amounts for Principal Transactions Revenue for either JPMorgan Chase or Charles Schwab, yet the LLM asserts '$23.7 billion in 2023' for JPMorgan and '$225 million in 2023' for Schwab—these figures are unsupported by the original answer and likely incorrect or misattributed. There is no mention of these numbers in the ground truth, so their inclusion undermines quantitative accuracy. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies that JPMorgan's Principal Transactions Revenue includes valuation adjustments (e.g., CVA, FVA, fair value adjustments), it omits the critical detail that this revenue is presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA/FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income and Equity Markets—this is a key aspect of JPMorgan's presentation and missing from the LLM response. (3) For Charles Schwab, the LLM correctly links Principal Transactions Revenue to client fixed income trading but incorrectly adds that it includes 'unrealized gains/losses on segregated regulatory assets,' which is not mentioned in the original answer and introduces unsupported information. The ground truth emphasizes fair value adjustments of securities positions due to client trading, not regulatory assets. (4) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the contrast between JPMorgan’s complex, valuation-driven approach and Schwab’s client-activity-based model is reasonably captured, showing an understanding of the differing business models. However, the synthesis lacks precision in key disclosures. (5) Contextual relevance is high—the response stays on topic, compares the two firms appropriately, and addresses composition and presentation as asked. Overall, the answer gets the general direction right but fails on specific, important details and introduces unverified numbers and concepts, warranting a moderate correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "KO's increased marketing spending in Asia Pacific contributed to a decline in operating income by $263 million (from $2,303 million in 2022 to $2,040 million in 2023), despite favorable pricing initiatives and the impact of acquired brands. This suggests that the marketing investment did not yield a positive return in terms of profitability in that region. In contrast, PG's marketing spending in Europe and North America supported innovation and market growth, contributing to a high single-digit sales increase in Europe and a low single-digit increase in North America. PG's marketing strategy led to global market share growth in Home Care (+0.8 points) and a 230 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin, despite increased SG&A expenses. Therefore, PG's marketing investment strategy appears more effective in driving both top-line growth and margin expansion compared to KO's Asia Pacific approach.",
      "llm_answer": "KO's increased marketing spending in Asia Pacific contributed to a **decline in operating income** (from $2,303M to $2,040M) and a **reduction in operating margin** (48.9% to 43.2%) in 2023, driven by higher commodity costs, FX headwinds, and increased marketing expenses. Despite favorable pricing initiatives, these factors offset gains, resulting in **no meaningful market share growth** in Asia Pacific.  \n\nIn contrast, PG's marketing investments in **Europe and North America** supported **margin improvements** (e.g., 230 bps net earnings margin increase in Fabric & Home Care) and **market share gains** (e.g., +0.8 points in Europe for Home Care, +0.6 points in Health Care). PG's strategies balanced pricing, productivity, and marketing to enhance margins and expand market share, outperforming KO's Asia Pacific efforts, which were hindered by FX volatility and cost pressures.  \n\n**Conclusion:** PG's marketing strategy in Europe/North America yielded stronger margin improvements and market share growth compared to KO's Asia Pacific initiatives, which faced headwinds that limited effectiveness.",

The LLM also accurately notes KO's margin decline from 48.9% to 43.2%, which, while not in the original answer, is a correct calculation based on the provided figures and adds value. (2) All numbers, dollar amounts, percentages, and basis points are accurate. The LLM correctly calculates the operating margin change and matches the ground truth on PG's 230 bps margin improvement and +0.8 point share gain. It also correctly identifies the regions (Asia Pacific for KO; Europe and North America for PG) and links marketing spending to outcomes. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes KO's marketing spend with declining profitability and lack of market share growth, contrasts it with PG's successful integration of marketing, pricing, and productivity to drive both margins and share, and draws a valid comparative conclusion. The only minor gap is that the ground truth specifies PG's sales growth (high single-digit in Europe, low single-digit in North America), which the LLM omits—this is a small completeness issue but does not undermine the core conclusion.

This leads to an incorrect difference of $33,613 million instead of the correct $36,948 million. The error likely stems from misidentifying the relevant metric in ADBE's 10-K, possibly confusing total share-based compensation with the specific 'Aggregate Fair Value of outstanding RSUs/Shares'. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the core numbers—especially for ADBE—are wrong, and the resulting calculation is therefore invalid.

Since CVS provides Medicare Advantage coverage to beneficiaries under contracts with CMS, and Medicare contracts alone accounted for 73% of CVS's federal government revenues in 2023, this exclusion could directly affect CVS's ability to offer comprehensive respiratory care coverage.

However, the LLM incorrectly states that Lowe's period ends on January 31, 2025, which is outside the 2024 10-K reporting context and factually inaccurate; the correct end date should be January 31, 2024, for a five-year period ending in fiscal 2024. Similarly, the LLM claims Starbucks' period ends on September 29, 2024, but this is also incorrect—the 2024 10-K would report up to the end of fiscal 2024, which for Starbucks is September 29, 2024, but the total return graph typically compares historical performance up to the filing year, not into the future. The ground truth implies a comparison of start dates only, with the difference being 1 year and 3 months between September 29, 2019, and January 31, 2020. (2) The quantitative accuracy is compromised because the end dates are projected into 2025, which is not supported by the 2024 10-Ks. The difference in time periods should be based solely on the start dates—1 year and 3 months apart—but the LLM fails to compute or state this difference explicitly. Instead, it incorrectly emphasizes a one-year difference in end dates, which is not accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly extracting start dates from each company’s filing—but fails in synthesis by misrepresenting the end dates and thus the nature of the comparison. The conclusion that Starbucks' period ends one year earlier is misleading because both companies are reporting five-year periods ending in their respective fiscal 2024 years, just on different calendar cycles. (4) Despite the incorrect end dates and missing explicit calculation of the 1 year and 3 months difference, the LLM captures the core idea that the discrepancy lies in the start dates due to different fiscal year-ends, which maintains moderate qualitative and contextual relevance.

The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention e-commerce or the 'one-year store' criterion from HD's definition, which is included in the ground truth.

This misattribution undermines the core reasoning. Additionally, while P&G’s 170-basis-point increase in SG&A is accurate and correctly tied to marketing costs in the LLM answer, this specific figure is not present in the Original Answer, suggesting the LLM may be hallucinating or referencing external data not in the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the 170-basis-point increase is a precise figure, but since it does not appear in the Original Answer (which focuses on qualitative roles of marketing), its inclusion cannot be verified as aligned with the knowledge graph source. No other numbers are provided or miscalculated, so quantitative accuracy is moderate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing Coca-Cola and P&G’s use of marketing spend across different financial contexts—but fails due to the incorrect attribution of Gillette to Coca-Cola, breaking the logical chain. The synthesis should have emphasized Coca-Cola’s forward-looking valuation assumptions vs. P&G’s operational driver role, but instead misrepresents Coca-Cola’s disclosure.

(2) The numbers for SBUX are accurate: a 5% decline in comparable transactions and a 4% increase in average ticket via pricing strategies, correctly reflecting the ground truth. However, the key error lies in the LOW data — the dollar amounts and direction of change (increase vs. decrease) are wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies the need to compare LOW’s ticket trend with SBUX’s strategy. It also correctly attributes SBUX’s approach to pricing strategies. However, the synthesis fails because the premise for LOW is incorrect — contrasting an alleged increase with SBUX’s strategy misrepresents the actual situation where LOW’s ticket declined while SBUX’s rose. (4) Correctness is scored low (3/10) due to the major factual error in direction and magnitude of LOW’s average ticket change. Quantitative accuracy is very low (2/10) because the percentage change is wrong and unsupported by the cited data. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4/10) as the model understands the metrics and strategies involved but applies them incorrectly. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) because the response addresses both companies and the intended comparison, even if the facts are flawed.",

However, it incorrectly states that Amgen's acquisition of Horizon 'is not explicitly tied to a stated stock-based compensation expense,' when the ground truth clearly includes a $180 million expense for Amgen’s acquisition. This omission leads to a significantly incomplete answer. (2) Quantitatively, the $143 million figure is accurate, but the failure to include the $180 million from Amgen results in a missing $180 million from the total. The final combined total should be $323 million, but the LLM only reports $143 million, making the overall quantitative result incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks for the total across both Amgen and CVS transactions, requiring synthesis of both values.

In contrast, SBUX experienced a 4% decline in average ticket, contributing to a $210 million reduction in comparable store sales. This significant drop in average ticket at SBUX directly impacted international total net revenues, which decreased by $149 million overall, with foreign currency translation and lower product and equipment sales further compounding the decline. Therefore, while LOW maintained stable average ticket performance, SBUX's drop in average ticket had a measurable negative financial impact.",

However, it incorrectly states that SBUX's 4% decline in average ticket led to a 2% decline in comparable store sales — the ground truth specifies a $210 million reduction in comparable store sales due to the ticket decline, not a 2% drop. Additionally, the LLM fails to mention the $149 million decrease in international total net revenues at SBUX, a key financial impact. It also introduces a 3.1% decrease in LOW’s net sales due to lower customer transactions, which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the LOW ticket numbers are accurate ($103.51 to $103.37), but the SBUX figures are misrepresented — the 4% ticket decline’s impact is understated and mischaracterized as a 2% sales decline rather than a $210M reduction. The $149M international revenue drop is entirely omitted. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in linking average ticket changes to revenue impacts, but the multi-hop synthesis is incomplete. The model fails to connect SBUX’s average ticket decline to the specific $210M comparable sales impact and the $149M international revenue decline, missing compounding factors like foreign currency and product sales. For LOW, it introduces unverified reasoning about transaction declines affecting sales, which is not supported in the ground truth. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both companies and the core concept of average ticket impact on revenue. However, due to missing key financial figures, incorrect quantification of SBUX’s impact, and introduction of unsupported claims about LOW’s sales decline, the overall correctness score is reduced to 5. The qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the direction of impact (minimal effect at LOW, negative at SBUX) is correct, but quantitative accuracy suffers from major omissions and misstatements.",

(2) The calculation is mathematically correct ($648.51M - $554.83M ≈ $93.68M), but it is based on a misreading of what the numbers represent. The ground truth treats $648.5 million as the year-over-year increase, not the ending balance. Therefore, the LLM’s quantitative output is factually wrong on the Accenture side. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model connects Oracle and Accenture data across filings and attempts a comparison — but fails in correctly interpreting the nature of the Accenture metric. It treats a reported ending balance as a starting point for calculating change, when the ground truth indicates the increase itself is $648.5 million. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to one correct major fact (Oracle) and one major error (Accenture). Quantitative accuracy is low (3) because of the significant error in the Accenture figure. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) as reasoning structure is logical but based on flawed data interpretation. Contextual relevance is high (8) as the answer addresses the right companies, time period, and intent of comparison.",

      "original_answer": "CAT's 2021 profit increased by $3.491 billion (from $2.998 billion in 2020 to $6.489 billion in 2021), driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, indicating a strategy of passing cost increases to customers through pricing actions. In contrast, LMT's fixed-price contracts require them to absorb cost fluctuations, as profits depend on meeting cost estimates—variations lead to higher or lower profits or even losses. This shows CAT used pricing power to mitigate cost pressures, while LMT managed risks through internal cost control under fixed-price terms.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar's 2021 profit growth was driven by favorable **price realization** (increasing prices to offset supply chain costs and demand pressures), while Lockheed Martin's fixed-price contract structure required disciplined **cost management** to mitigate risks from cost overruns and supply chain disruptions. CAT leveraged pricing power to enhance margins, whereas LMT relied on contractual terms (e.g., termination-for-convenience clauses) and operational efficiency to manage fixed-price obligations, reflecting divergent strategies for balancing cost pressures and profitability.",

The qualitative reasoning and entity accuracy (CAT, LMT, 2021, price realization, fixed-price contracts) are sound and contextually relevant.\n\n2) However, the LLM answer omits the specific quantitative increase in CAT's profit ($3.491 billion rise from $2.998B to $6.489B), which is a key part of the original answer and directly addresses the 'profit increases' mentioned in the question. While the LLM notes profit growth, it does not provide the exact figures or calculation, leading to a lower quantitative accuracy score.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes that CAT’s pricing power and LMT’s fixed-price contract structure represent divergent risk management strategies. It appropriately contrasts external pricing leverage vs. internal cost control, and even adds relevant detail about termination-for-convenience clauses, which enhances contextual understanding (though not in the original answer).\n\n4) The omission of exact financial figures prevents a higher correctness score, as the question specifically asks about 'CAT's 2021 profit increases'—a quantitative claim that requires numerical support.

      "original_answer": "AXP accounts for merchant relationships primarily through risk exposure, noting that spending at airline merchants accounted for approximately 7% of its worldwide billed business, which directly impacts revenue through discount rates and potential losses from non-delivery of services. COF, on the other hand, treats merchant relationships as part of its intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives, with no impairments recorded in 2024. This shows a fundamental difference in financial treatment: AXP reflects merchant relationship value through ongoing revenue risk and exposure, while COF capitalizes and amortizes the value as a balance sheet intangible.",
      "llm_answer": "AXP does not explicitly account for merchant relationships as amortizing intangible assets in its financial statements, instead focusing on disclosures about exposure to risks associated with partner relationships (e.g., airline merchants representing 7% of billed business). COF, however, recognizes merchant relationships as **purchased credit card relationship (PCCR) intangibles** in its balance sheet, which are **amortized over their estimated useful lives** (e.g., 6.1 years for PCCR intangibles in 2024).

No numerical inaccuracies or calculation errors are present. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both AXP’s risk-based disclosure approach and COF’s capitalization and amortization treatment. It correctly identifies the fundamental difference in accounting: AXP does not treat merchant relationships as amortizable intangibles but discloses risk exposure, while COF capitalizes them. (3) Entity accuracy is strong: both companies (AXP, COF), the correct financial concept (PCCR intangibles), and the year 2024 are properly referenced. (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis—linking AXP’s revenue risk disclosure with COF’s balance sheet treatment of intangibles. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that COF recorded no impairments in 2024, a detail included in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "The combined percentage point impact from foreign operations for ACN and ORCL in fiscal 2022 is 2.9 percentage points. ACN reports a 0.8 percentage point increase from non-U.S. operations taxed at other rates. ORCL reports $536 million in tax impact from foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates, which, when normalized to its $1,606 million U.S. federal statutory tax provision, results in a 33.4% effective foreign tax differential (i.e., $536M / $1,606M), or approximately 2.1 percentage points below the U.S. federal statutory rate. These foreign operation effects must be interpreted in the context of other adjustments: ACN reports a 3.0 percentage point increase from other net activity in unrecognized tax benefits and a 3.0 percentage point reduction from excess tax benefits from share-based payments. ORCL reports a $263 million net benefit from settlements and releases and a $441 million expense from domestic tax contingencies, indicating contrasting directional adjustments of $704 million total in offsetting impacts.",

ACN’s adjustments for other tax-related activities (e.g., unrecognized tax benefits, R&D credits) totaled **+3.0% net**, whereas ORCL’s adjustments included significant deferred tax benefits and settlements, resulting in a **net reduction of ~8.8%**.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the calculation and direction of ORCL's foreign operations impact. The original answer states that ORCL's foreign tax impact is $536 million, which when normalized to its $1,606 million U.S. federal statutory tax provision results in a 33.4% effective foreign tax differential, or approximately 2.1 percentage points *below* the U.S. rate—meaning a 2.1 percentage point reduction in effective tax rate. However, the LLM incorrectly reports this as an 8.8 percentage point reduction, which is unsupported by the data. Additionally, the combined impact for ACN and ORCL is stated in the ground truth as 2.9 percentage points (0.8 + 2.1), but the LLM does not compute or mention this total, instead listing only individual components with incorrect values. (2) ACN’s 0.8 percentage point increase is correctly cited. However, ORCL’s foreign impact is grossly miscalculated: $536M / $1,606M ≈ 33.4% of the statutory rate, not an 8.8 percentage point reduction. The 8.8% figure appears to be a confusion with another metric or misapplication of percentage points vs. percent of tax provision. The LLM also fails to mention the $263M benefit from settlements and $441M expense from domestic tax contingencies, instead summarizing as a 'net reduction of ~8.8%', which contradicts the offsetting nature of these adjustments. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize ORCL’s foreign impact by misinterpreting the normalization method (should be relative to statutory tax provision, not absolute rate reduction), and it omits the required calculation of the combined 2.9 percentage point impact. It also mischaracterizes the direction and magnitude of ORCL’s other adjustments, implying a net reduction when the ground truth shows large offsetting items ($704M total) without a clear net direction. (4) Scores reflect partial credit for correctly identifying ACN’s 0.8% foreign impact and attempting to discuss other tax adjustments, but major deductions for incorrect calculations, misstated magnitudes, and failure to compute the combined impact.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified both pre-tax charges: $842 million for PepsiCo related to its cash tender offers and $51 million for Philip Morris related to the OtiTopic, Inc. transaction. These figures match the ground truth exactly, and the combined total of $893 million is accurate, though not explicitly stated in the LLM answer. The classification of charges is also correct—PepsiCo's charge is properly attributed to 'net interest expense and other,' and Philip Morris's charge is correctly placed under 'research and development costs' within 'marketing, administration and research costs.' (2) All numeric values are accurate and correctly formatted. The only minor omission is that the LLM did not explicitly compute or state the combined pre-tax charge of $893 million, which was requested in the question. This affects completeness slightly but does not invalidate the correctness of the provided data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly synthesized information across two different companies (PepsiCo and Philip Morris), identified the correct events (cash tender offers and OtiTopic transaction), and linked each to the appropriate financial impact and statement classification. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in all key aspects except the missing explicit sum. Given that both components are present and correct, the correctness score is reduced only slightly to 9. Quantitative accuracy is perfect (10), qualitative accuracy is high but not perfect due to the missing synthesis of the total (9), and contextual relevance is full (10) as all information directly addresses the question.",
