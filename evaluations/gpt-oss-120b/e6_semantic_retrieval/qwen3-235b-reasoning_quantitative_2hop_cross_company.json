      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and closely matches the ground truth. (1) The individual cost of services figures are correct: Accenture's $41,892 million matches the expected value, and Broadcom's $82 million (listed as 'cost of subscriptions and services') aligns with the intended metric for 'cost of services' in 2022. (2) The combined total is calculated as $41,974 million, which is a rounded version of the ground truth value $41,974.766 million — the difference is negligible (0.766 million) and likely due to rounding, which is acceptable under the evaluation principles. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts the relevant financial metric for the correct year, and sums them appropriately. (4) Entity accuracy is strong — tickers (ACN, AVGO), years (2022), and metric names are correctly associated, with minor variation in Broadcom's metric label ('cost of subscriptions and services' vs 'cost of services') being semantically acceptable. The answer is fully relevant and addresses the question completely. A score of 9 is given instead of 10 because the final sum omits the decimal precision present in the ground truth, though this does not constitute a material error.",

However, it incorrectly reported Chevron's 2022 DD&A expense as $16,319 million instead of the correct $23,931 million from the ground truth. This led to an incorrect 2022 combined total of $23,823 million (should be $31,435 million). As a result, the LLM concluded that the combined expense increased by $1.8 billion in 2023, when in fact it decreased by $5,839 million. (2) The calculation errors are significant: the correct difference is $31,435M (2022) - $25,596M (2023) = $5,839M decrease, but the LLM computed a $1.8B increase based on wrong inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning was structurally sound—aggregating across companies and years and comparing year-over-year—but failed due to incorrect data retrieval for Chevron's 2022 figure.

(3) Entities are correctly identified: ABBV is referred to as AbbVie and ABT as Abbott, which are accurate. The metric 'weighted-average grant date fair value of outstanding share units' is correctly applied to the right companies and years.

According to the ground truth, AVGO's cost of revenue in fiscal year 2023 was $11,129 million (correctly stated), but QCOM's was $76 million, not $11,108 million as claimed. This leads to a grossly incorrect combined total of $22,237 million instead of the correct $11,205 million. (2) The calculation itself (summing the two values) is mathematically sound, but based on incorrect inputs. The format of numbers ($X million) is acceptable and matches the expected output style. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect data retrieval for QCOM—either a wrong entity mapping or data extraction error occurred. The model correctly identifies the two companies (AVGO and QCOM) and the correct fiscal year (2023), showing partial understanding of the required synthesis. (4) Despite correct context and structure, the severe numerical inaccuracies—especially the erroneous $11,108 million for QCOM, which is over 14,000% higher than the true value—warrant a low correctness and quantitative accuracy score.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, the combined 2023 bitumen production for COP and XOM is 426 thousand barrels daily, but the LLM reports 436 thousand (355 + 81), which is 10 thousand barrels too high. The 2022 combined figure in the LLM answer (393 thousand) matches the ground truth, but the individual components (327 for COP and 66 for XOM) do not align with the knowledge graph, suggesting incorrect source data. (2) Calculations: The LLM incorrectly sums 355 + 81 = 436 (correct sum, but based on wrong inputs), and computes a year-over-year increase of 43 thousand (436 - 393), whereas the correct increase is 33 thousand (426 - 393). This 10 thousand barrel error in both total and delta is material. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that it must extract bitumen production for two companies across two years, sum them, and compute the difference—this structure is sound. However, the reasoning fails due to incorrect underlying data for both COP and XOM in both years. (4) Despite accurate framing and structure, the factual errors in key numbers—especially the overstatement of 2023 production and the resulting incorrect growth figure—severely undermine the answer's correctness. Wording and relevance are strong, but financial accuracy is poor, warranting a low-to-mid score.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the gross margin percentages for Apple—43.3% in 2022, 44.1% in 2023, and 46.2% in 2024—are correct and reflect an upward trend, which is consistent with Apple's 10-K disclosures. Qualcomm's gross margin is correctly stated as flat at 56% in fiscal 2024 versus 2023, matching its filing. Minor note: the ground truth does not specify the exact percentage for Qualcomm (only that it was flat), so including '56%' is a slight over-precision not confirmed in the original answer, though it may be accurate based on external data. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both Apple’s three-year trend and Qualcomm’s 2024 performance. (3) Entities—Apple, Qualcomm, gross margin, fiscal years 2022–2024—are correctly identified and matched to the right metrics. (4) The reasoning is sound: it correctly synthesizes multi-hop information (trend over time for one company vs. year-over-year stability for another) and draws a valid comparative conclusion. The answer goes slightly beyond the original by quantifying Qualcomm’s margin, but this does not contradict the ground truth and adds useful detail.

ExxonMobil's figure of 10,354 thousand acres matches the ground truth for consolidated subsidiaries, but the LLM omits the 583 thousand acres from equity companies and incorrectly treats 10,354 as the total.

This matches the original answer's key distinction. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes contrasting accounting policies between two companies (Caterpillar and Lockheed Martin) regarding actuarial gains/losses, which is the essence of the question. (4) The only minor deviation is that the LLM mentions 'each quarter' for Caterpillar’s remeasurement, while the original specifies 'annual remeasurement or on an interim basis if triggered.' This could imply more frequent mandatory remeasurement than confirmed in the ground truth, though some filings may allow quarterly updates. This slight overstatement prevents a perfect 10 but does not undermine the overall correctness. Wording differences are acceptable under semantic equivalence, and the core contrast in recognition (immediate vs. deferred amortization) is preserved.

It states that AT&T's 2023 interest-cost discount rate is 5.30%, but the ground truth is 3.90%. Similarly, it reports AT&T's year-end benefit obligation discount rate as 5.00%, whereas the correct value is 5.20%. These errors lead to incorrect differences: LLM calculates a 0.07% gap in interest-cost rates (vs. correct 1.07%) and a 0.94% gap in benefit obligation rates (vs. correct 0.80%). (2) Calculations are based on wrong inputs, so all derived comparisons are invalid. The correct difference in interest-cost rates is 5.37% - 3.90% = 1.47%? Wait, original answer says 1.07%, which implies possible typo — rechecking: 5.37 - 3.90 = 1.47, but ground truth states 1.07. This discrepancy suggests potential data error, but per provided ground truth, the expected difference is 1.07%. However, even if there's ambiguity in the ground truth calculation, the LLM’s use of 5.30% for T is clearly wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning structure is sound — the model attempts to compare both discount rate types and draw a conclusion about relative gaps — but due to incorrect data, the logic leads to an inverted conclusion: LLM claims the benefit obligation gap is larger, while the correct answer is that the interest cost gap is larger.

While the STELARA® sales ($9,134 million) and JNJ's total Immunology revenue ($16,750 million) are correct, leading to the accurate percentage of 54.5%, the combined Immunology revenue is incorrect. The LLM reports Eli Lilly's (LLY) 2021 Immunology revenue as $5,500 million, but the ground truth implies it should be $1,881.8 million (since $16,750 + $1,881.8 = $18,631.8).

(2) The calculation for STELARA®'s share is correct (9,134 ÷ 16,750 ≈ 0.545), so that part is quantitatively accurate. However, the sum for combined revenue is off by over $3.6 billion, a major error. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—multi-hop synthesis is attempted by pulling data from both companies and computing a sum and a percentage—but the use of an incorrect value for LLY's revenue breaks the chain. It is unclear if the LLM misread the source or hallucinated the $5.5B figure. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question, cites sources, and uses proper terminology.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the final result. While it correctly identifies that UPS reclassified $83 million in gains and MMM reclassified a $38 million loss, it calculates a net amount of $45 million ($83M – $38M), which contradicts the ground truth that the *combined total* is $83 million. The question asks for the 'total amount of gains or losses reclassified', which refers to the sum of absolute values or the total magnitude reclassified—not a net figure. However, the LLM instead computes a net value, which is a misinterpretation of the required aggregation. (2) Numeric values for individual companies are accurate: UPS’s $83 million gain and MMM’s $38 million loss are correctly extracted and match the knowledge graph’s underlying data. However, the final combined value is incorrect—$45 million vs. the correct total of $83 million. This indicates a critical calculation or interpretation error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is correctly pulled from both MMM and UPS filings and synthesized across entities and years. However, the logic fails in how the combination is performed: the model subtracts the loss from the gain instead of reporting the total amount reclassified (which, per ground truth, appears to be just the UPS amount, suggesting the MMM amount may not be included in the combined total for that year, or there is an error in the interpretation of 'combined'). Alternatively, if both were to be included, the total reclassified amount would be $121 million (|83| + |38|), not $83 million or $45 million—further indicating confusion. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and year, and cites appropriate pages. However, due to the incorrect final figure and flawed quantitative synthesis, the correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is penalized heavily due to the wrong final number despite correct inputs. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct entity and metric identification but flawed reasoning.",

According to the ground truth, the correct combined amount is $841 million. However, the LLM states AMD reported $258 million and NVDA $674 million, summing to $932 million, which is factually incorrect. These numbers do not match the actual values from the 2023 10-K filings. (2) The calculation itself (adding $258M + $674M = $932M) is mathematically correct, but since the input numbers are wrong, the result is inaccurate. The correct individual figures should sum to $841M, meaning at least one of the cited values is erroneous. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to extract data from both AMD and NVDA filings and combine them — but fails due to incorrect data retrieval. This suggests a failure in sourcing or interpreting the correct line items from the respective 10-Ks.

However, it omits the critical negative effect on GM's EBT-adjusted results due to a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense, which is a key part of the original answer and necessary for a complete multi-hop synthesis. For Starbucks, the LLM introduces a specific quantitative sensitivity figure—'a 100-basis-point increase would reduce debt fair value by $943 million'—that is not present in the ground truth. The original answer only states that interest rate changes affect Starbucks' debt valuation and interest expense, without providing a specific dollar impact. This addition, while plausible, is not supported by the provided truth and introduces unverified data. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised: while the GM figures are correct, the Starbucks $943 million figure is extraneous and unsupported, reducing confidence in numerical fidelity. (3) The reasoning correctly links interest rate increases to higher finance income for GM and lower debt valuation for Starbucks, showing sound logic and entity-specific understanding. However, the failure to mention GM's increased interest expense and the invention of a precise Starbucks sensitivity number indicate incomplete or overextended synthesis. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, addressing both companies and the core financial mechanisms.

(1) All key numbers are correct within acceptable rounding: AMGN paid $26.989 billion (from ground truth: $26,989 million) and DHR paid $5.610 billion ($5,610 million), summing to $32.6 billion (vs. $32,599 million exact), which is correctly rounded. 2022 totals are $3.839 billion + $0.582 billion = $4.421 billion, correctly reported as ~$4.4 billion. (2) The increase is calculated as ~$28 billion, which matches the ground truth difference of $28,178 million when rounded. The percentage increase in the original answer (637.4%) is omitted, but the LLM states the 2023 total was 'about seven times' the 2022 amount, which is a reasonable approximation (637.4% ≈ 6.37x, close to 7x with rounding). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, the correct metric (cash paid for acquisitions), and synthesizes data across both years and entities. (4) Minor deductions in quantitative accuracy due to the approximation of 'seven times' (slightly overstated) and rounding of the difference to $28 billion without specifying the exact increase.

PepsiCo's value is nearly correct at $60.5 billion (vs. $60,505 million or $60.505 billion), so that component is accurate within rounding. (2) The calculation of the difference is therefore incorrect: $267.2B - $60.5B = $206.7B, but the correct difference is $277,522M - $60,505M = $217,017M ($217.0 billion).

While it correctly identifies AT&T's interest expense as $6.704 billion (matching $6,704 million in ground truth), it reports Netflix's interest expense as $0.700 billion ($700 million), which is close but slightly off from the true value of $699.826 million. More critically, the difference is stated as 'roughly $6.0 billion', which understates the actual difference of $6,004.174 million (~$6.004 billion) and rounds too aggressively, losing precision. (2) The percentages are completely incorrect. The LLM claims AT&T's interest expense was 'about 22% of net income', but the ground truth uses Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes ($19,848 million), not net income, and the correct ratio is ~28.6%. Similarly, Netflix's interest expense is said to be '13% of net income', but the correct figure is ~1.1% (using $699.826M / $5,407,990 thousand ≈ 1.1%). These errors suggest a fundamental misunderstanding of the financial metric used in the original calculation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly identify the appropriate income base for percentage calculations—it uses 'net income' for both companies, whereas the ground truth specifies different bases (pre-tax income for AT&T, net income for Netflix), and even then miscalculates Netflix’s percentage. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies, year, and general question structure, but the core quantitative and conceptual errors severely undermine factual correctness.

(2) However, there are critical errors in quantitative accuracy. The LLM states Netflix's interest expense as $699.8 million (which matches the ground truth of $699,826,000), and AT&T's as $131 million (matching $131,000,000), but then calculates the difference as 'about $569 million', which is incorrect. The correct difference is $699,826,000 - $131,000,000 = $568,826,000, approximately $568.8 million — so the number is close but still inaccurate. More critically, the ground truth states AT&T's interest expense as $131 (not $131 million), which is a massive discrepancy. The LLM misread AT&T's interest expense by a factor of one million, likely due to misinterpreting the unit (e.g., thousands vs. millions or a typo in the source).

      "question": "How did the foreign currency transaction gains and losses in 2021 differ between BKNG and GM, and what was the net difference between the two companies' reported foreign currency impacts for that year?",
      "original_answer": "BKNG reported foreign currency transaction gains of $135 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, while GM reported foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses of $203 million for the same period. The net difference between the two companies' foreign currency impacts was $338 million, with BKNG benefiting from currency movements and GM experiencing a loss.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 Booking Holdings reported a $135 million foreign‑currency gain but a $200 million loss on its Euro‑denominated debt and a further $30 million loss on currency‑derivative contracts, leaving a net foreign‑currency loss of about $95 million.  General Motors, by contrast, reported only a $17 million foreign‑currency gain for the year.  Consequently, Booking’s net foreign‑currency impact was roughly $112 million more adverse than GM’s (a $95 million loss versus a $17 million gain).",

According to the ground truth, BKNG reported a foreign currency transaction gain of $135 million in 2021, and GM reported a loss of $203 million. However, the LLM claims BKNG had a net loss of $95 million due to additional losses on debt and derivatives—information not present in the original answer and unsupported by the question context. It also incorrectly states GM had a $17 million gain, directly contradicting the ground truth $203 million loss. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $200 million loss on Euro-denominated debt and $30 million derivative loss for BKNG are fabricated. The GM figure is off by over $220 million. The net difference is stated as $112 million, whereas the correct net difference is $338 million ($135M gain vs $203M loss). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the model fails to correctly synthesize the foreign currency impacts between the two companies. Instead, it introduces unrelated financial items (debt and derivatives) not mentioned in the original data, leading to incorrect conclusions. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and topic (foreign currency impacts in 2021), but the core facts and synthesis are wrong, undermining the entire response. The conclusion about BKNG having a more adverse impact than GM is the opposite of the truth—BKNG had a gain while GM had a large loss.",

      "original_answer": "The total interest expense for General Motors in 2021 was $3,496 million, while for Booking Holdings it was $56 million. The difference is $3,440 million. This significant difference is due to the nature of their respective businesses: Booking Holdings primarily incurs interest from debt discount amortization and issuance costs ($43 million in 2021), whereas General Motors incurs interest from both automotive operations ($950 million in 2021) and its financing arm, GM Financial ($2,546 million in 2021).",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 General Motors reported total interest expense of **$3.5 billion**, which is **about $3.2 billion higher** than Booking Holdings’ total interest expense of **$0.32 billion**. The gap comes from GM’s two large components – $950 million of automotive‑related interest and $2.546 billion of GM Financial (auto‑financing) interest – whereas Booking’s expense is limited to interest on its debt portfolio: $13 million of coupon interest plus $43 million of amortized discount on convertible senior notes, and $257 million of coupon interest plus $10 million of amortized discount on other senior notes, together totaling roughly $323 million.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. It reports Booking Holdings' interest expense as $0.32 billion ($320 million), but the ground truth is $56 million. It also states GM's interest expense as $3.5 billion (approximately correct at $3,496 million), but calculates the difference as $3.2 billion, which is incorrect—the actual difference is $3,440 million ($3.44 billion). (2) The component breakdown for Booking Holdings is entirely wrong: the LLM claims $13M + $43M + $257M + $10M = ~$323M, but the ground truth is only $56M total, with $43M from debt discount amortization and issuance costs. The LLM invents 'coupon interest' and 'convertible senior notes' details not in the original and misrepresents the structure. For GM, the LLM correctly identifies the $950M automotive interest and $2,546M from GM Financial, which sum to $3,496M—this part is accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in identifying the two companies and year (2021), and attempting to break down components, but fails in synthesis due to fabricated figures for Booking Holdings. The explanation of business model differences is implied but distorted by incorrect data. (4) Due to severe quantitative inaccuracies and significant factual errors in both numbers and components—especially inflating Booking Holdings' interest expense by nearly 6x—the correctness score is low.

AT&T's figure is correct at $3.469 billion ($3,469 million). The calculated difference of '$1.5 billion' is incorrect; the true difference is $3,111.523 million (~$3.11 billion). (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: Netflix's D&A is off by over $1.64 billion, leading to a miscalculation of the difference by more than $1.6 billion. The AT&T number is accurate and correctly formatted ($3.469 billion = $3,469 million), but Netflix's number is wildly inaccurate despite being a direct figure from a 10-K.

In contrast, UPS saw its adjusted operating margin decline by 280 basis points to 9.0% in 2023, despite reducing operating expenses by $1.5 billion in air and ground network costs, $641 million in pickup and delivery costs, and $216 million in sorting costs.

However, it fails to provide MMM's actual adjusted operating margin (22.6%) or the GAAP margin (20.8%), instead vaguely stating that the margin 'expanded' without citing the specific figures. The dollar amounts for MMM's adjustments—$463 million in litigation costs and $1,258 million for PFAS charges—are entirely omitted, which are critical quantitative elements in the original answer. (2) While the UPS cost reductions ($1.5B in air/ground, $641M in pickup/delivery, $216M in sorting) are not mentioned in the LLM answer, the explanation for margin contraction (lower volumes, higher costs) is directionally correct. The LLM incorrectly attributes margin expansion at MMM to 'lower expenses tied to exiting PFAS-related products,' whereas the ground truth indicates the adjustment added back large charges (i.e., expenses were excluded, not reduced), which is a key distinction in non-GAAP reporting. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts MMM’s margin expansion with UPS’s contraction and identifies the general operational drivers. However, it misrepresents the nature of PFAS-related adjustments—portraying them as operational cost reductions rather than non-recurring, non-GAAP add-backs—which undermines the accuracy of the financial logic. (4) The contextual relevance is high, as the answer directly addresses the comparative margin performance and underlying factors.

      "question": "How do ACN and TXN differ in their application of discount rates to calculate present value, and what specific methods does each company use in determining these rates?",
      "original_answer": "ACN uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments, approximating the rate at which it could borrow on a secured basis for a similar term and amount. TXN, on the other hand, uses a settlement approach in the U.S., selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds to simulate cash flows matching its benefit payments, and for non-U.S. locations with sufficient bond markets, it constructs a yield curve to determine a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same present value.",
      "llm_answer": "ACN (Accenture) applies a discount rate only to its lease‑liability calculations.  Because the implicit rate in its leases cannot be observed, it discounts the lease‑payment stream at its **incremental borrowing rate** – the rate it could secure on a secured basis for a loan of similar term and amount (the weighted‑average lease discount rates were about 4.2 % and 3.8 %).  \n\nTXN (Texas Instruments) uses discount rates for its defined‑benefit pension and retiree‑health plans.  The rates are derived from a **settlement‑approach** that selects a portfolio of high‑quality corporate bonds (or, where the corporate market is thin, a government‑bond index) and constructs a yield curve; the single‑rate that reproduces the present value of the projected cash flows is then applied (e.g., 5.20 % for U.S. DB plans, 3.28 % for non‑U.S. plans).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies that ACN uses its incremental borrowing rate for lease liabilities due to unobservable implicit rates, and that TXN applies discount rates to defined-benefit pension and retiree-health plans using a settlement approach. The description of TXN's method—selecting high-quality corporate bonds, constructing a yield curve, and deriving a single equivalent discount rate—is semantically equivalent to the original. (2) The LLM includes specific percentages (e.g., 4.2%, 3.8% for ACN; 5.20% for U.S. DB plans, 3.28% for non-U.S. plans), which are plausible and contextually appropriate, though the original answer did not include these exact numbers. Since the ground truth does not specify numerical values, the inclusion of realistic figures does not constitute an error but adds detail beyond the original—this is acceptable under semantic equivalence. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between ACN’s lease-related discounting and TXN’s pension-related discounting, synthesizing different applications across companies. (4) Minor deduction in correctness and quantitative accuracy is due to the introduction of specific percentages not present in the ground truth, which, while reasonable, go beyond the provided data. However, no factual inaccuracies are present, and the core methods and entities are correctly identified and contrasted.

      "question": "How do Costco and Altria each account for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and what impact does this have on their respective income tax provisions?",
      "original_answer": "Costco accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates expected to apply in future years. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria also determines deferred tax assets and liabilities using differences between financial statement and tax bases, applying enacted tax rates. Altria evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering positive and negative evidence, including the character of the assets and potential sources of taxable income within carryback and carryforward periods. Both companies adjust their deferred tax assets and liabilities when tax rates change, with the effect recognized in income in the period of enactment. This approach directly affects their income tax provisions, as changes in deferred tax asset and liability valuations alter the overall tax expense recorded.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco records its income‑tax expense under the asset‑and‑liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for all temporary differences and measuring them at the enacted tax rates that will apply when the differences reverse.  Any change in the tax rate – or the need to set up a valuation allowance when a deferred‑tax asset is not expected to be realized – is booked directly to the income‑tax provision in the period the change occurs.  \n\nAltria follows the same asset‑and‑liability approach, creating deferred tax assets and liabilities from the gap between book and tax bases and applying enacted rates, but it also records a valuation allowance whenever a deferred‑tax asset is more likely than not to be unrealized and adds accrued interest and penalties from uncertain positions to its provision.  Consequently, adjustments to Altria’s deferred‑tax balances (including the valuation allowance and uncertain‑position adjustments) flow through its provision for income taxes in the period of the change.",

The treatment of valuation allowances is accurately described for both companies, with Altria evaluating realizability based on evidence, which aligns with the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in either the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in that sense, but all conceptual financial accounting treatments are factually correct—thus a score of 10 is justified. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how each company accounts for deferred tax items and links those accounting policies to the impact on the income tax provision.

It correctly identifies HD's Interest and Other, Net as $2.12 billion (equivalent to $2,120 million) and Net Earnings as $14.81 billion (close to $14,806 million, minor rounding). SBUX values are exact: $122.8 million and $3.76 billion Net Earnings (approximating $3,760.9 million). Percentages are correctly rounded: 14.3% vs. ground truth 14.32%, and 3.3% vs. 3.27%.

In contrast, PayPal uses foreign exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on assets and liabilities, with the gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, thereby reducing but not fully eliminating earnings volatility.

It correctly identifies that AIG includes foreign exchange gains and losses from foreign currency transactions in 'Net realized gains (losses)', directly impacting earnings, citing the specific line item and 10-K page (p. 128), which supports accuracy. For PayPal, it accurately states that foreign exchange impacts on assets and liabilities are recorded in 'other income (expense), net' and are offset by gains/losses on foreign exchange contracts used as hedges, with a reference to page 34 of PayPal’s 10-K. The explanation captures the core contrast: AIG reflects FX volatility directly in a key earnings component, while PayPal nets the effect in another income line via hedging, reducing but not eliminating volatility. There are no numeric inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect), and all entities (AIG, PayPal, financial line items) are correctly identified. The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis across two companies’ accounting treatments.

This represents 25.6% of their total consolidated profit before taxes, which amounts to $13,373 million (CAT) + $4,819 million (MMM) = $18,192 million.

This fundamental error invalidates the entire multi-hop synthesis. The MMM figures ($804 million tax provision and $4,819 million profit before taxes in ground truth) are partially correct but misattributed—LLM assigns $13,373 million as MMM’s profit before taxes, but this is actually CAT’s figure in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the LLM swaps CAT’s and MMM’s profit before taxes, assigning $13,373 million to MMM instead of CAT, and omits CAT’s data entirely due to a perceived lack of information. The correct combined tax provision is $3,433 million and total profit before taxes is $18,192 million, neither of which is computed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not synthesize across both companies’ data, incorrectly claims insufficient data, and misassigns key financial figures. It should have extracted or recognized that CAT’s data was available in the context used to generate the ground truth. (4) Scores are low because the answer is factually incorrect on core numbers and entities, fails to perform required calculations, and misunderstands the data availability. Contextual relevance is moderate because it attempts to address the question structure and references real metrics, but with wrong attributions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, ABT reported a foreign currency translation loss of $1,117 million in 2024, but the LLM states it was $(885 million) before reclassifications of $116 million — this total ($885M + $116M = $1,001M) still does not match the correct $1,117M. The cumulative balance for ABT is correctly stated as $(7,505 million), aligning with the ground truth. For LLY, the LLM reports a pre-reclassification loss of $(580 million), which is close to the correct $580.2 million and acceptable within rounding. The cumulative balance of $(2,389 million) is also close to the correct $2,389.6 million and can be considered accurate. However, the introduction of a 'net OCI loss of $(570 million)' is not mentioned in the ground truth and introduces unverified information. (2) The calculation and attribution of reclassifications are not supported by the original answer — the ground truth does not break down ABT’s $1,117M loss into pre- and post-reclassification components, so the $885M and $116M figures appear fabricated or misattributed. This undermines quantitative accuracy. (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that ABT’s larger loss and bigger cumulative deficit suggest higher foreign exchange risk exposure compared to LLY, which aligns with the ground truth’s conclusion about ABT’s greater downward pressure and higher geographic risk. The multi-hop synthesis — comparing movements and interpreting implications for geographic risk — is logically valid and contextually appropriate. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies, the 2024 period, the impact on cumulative balances, and draws a reasonable conclusion about risk exposure. However, the correctness score is reduced to 6 due to the major error in ABT’s reported loss amount, which affects the factual foundation of the response. While the direction and conclusion are correct, the incorrect magnitude of ABT’s loss undermines full factual reliability.",

What are the specific foreign rate differential impacts for each company in 2023, and how does this difference in reporting reflect contrasting approaches to disclosing international tax effects?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, BKNG reported a $307 million foreign rate differential adjustment in its tax provision, while SBUX disclosed its foreign rate differential as 0.3% of the statutory tax rate. These differing disclosures reflect that BKNG quantifies its international tax rate differences in absolute dollar terms, likely emphasizing materiality in financial reporting, whereas SBUX integrates the impact as a relative percentage within its effective tax rate reconciliation, focusing on the proportional effect on overall tax expense.",

All other numbers are accurate—BKNG's $307 million adjustment is correctly reported. 2) The quantitative accuracy is slightly compromised due to the incorrect percentage (0.4% vs 0.3%), which may stem from misreading the source document.

While it correctly identifies MET's $250 million loss and V's $94 million gain, it incorrectly computes the net effect as (-$250M + $94M) / 2 = -$156M. The correct approach is to average the two outcomes: [(-$250M) + $94M] / 2 = -$156M / 2 = -$78M. The LLM failed to divide the sum by 2 correctly — it divided the final sum by 2 but incorrectly applied the operation after summing, rather than computing the average properly. The correct net loss is $78 million, not $156 million. (2) Numeric values for MET and V are accurate and correctly attributed to the right companies and years. However, the final calculated result is off by a factor of 2 due to flawed arithmetic.

However, it reports Target's net earnings as $4.138 billion, which is incorrect — the ground truth is $2.780 billion. This leads to an erroneous combined net earnings figure of $18.876 billion instead of the correct $17.518 billion ($14.738B + $2.780B). As a result, the percentage of share-based compensation relative to combined net earnings is miscalculated as roughly 4%, while the correct proportion is approximately 4.5% (796 / 17,518). (2) The individual compensation numbers are accurate and properly formatted. The calculation of the combined compensation expense is correct. However, the use of an incorrect net earnings figure for Target invalidates the final comparative percentage. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly synthesizes compensation data across both companies and attempts to compare it to net earnings. But it fails in retrieving the correct net earnings for Target, undermining the validity of the comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question: total compensation and its relation to net earnings.

It correctly states that Costco defers membership fee revenue and reports it as a liability, with a value close to the ground truth ($2.5 billion vs. actual $2,501 million). However, it incorrectly states that Costco shows the balance 'as a separate line in accrued liabilities'—the ground truth specifies that Costco reports deferred membership fees as a *separate liability*, not within accrued liabilities. This misrepresents the presentation. For Walmart, the LLM claims that the filing 'does not disclose a separate deferred-membership-fee amount,' but the ground truth states Walmart reports deferred membership fees as part of accrued liabilities and reports total membership fee revenue of $3.1 billion in fiscal 2024. The LLM confuses *revenue* with *deferred revenue* and fails to report the $3.1 billion figure, which is a significant omission. (2) Quantitatively, Costco’s $2.5 billion is acceptable as a rounded version of $2,501 million, but Walmart’s $3.1 billion revenue is entirely missing, and no deferred amount is discussed despite the question asking for 'specific deferred amounts reported by each company.' The LLM implies Walmart does not report it, which contradicts the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—both companies defer revenue over 12 months is correctly identified—but the synthesis breaks down in presentation differences: Costco’s separate liability vs. Walmart’s inclusion in accrued liabilities is misrepresented. The LLM incorrectly suggests Costco includes it in accrued liabilities, which undermines the key distinction. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses revenue deferral and balance sheet presentation, but factual and qualitative errors reduce correctness.

The ground truth implies Oracle's cloud services growth alone must have been $17.7B (since $3.893B + $17.7B ≈ $21.593B), which contradicts the LLM's figure. Thus, the combined growth of $7.27B is wildly off from the correct $21.593B. (2) Quantitative accuracy fails on Oracle's revenue component and final sum.

In contrast, Netflix follows an amortization policy where content assets are systematically expensed over time, with over 90% of licensed or produced content expected to be amortized within four years. These differing treatments reflect contrasting financial strategies: Disney's impairments signal immediate write-downs based on content performance and strategic shifts, while Netflix spreads content costs over time through amortization, aligning with its subscription-based model where content is monetized as a group rather than at the individual title level.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney recorded a $187 million “content” impairment for fiscal 2024, writing down the carrying value of assets because of a strategic shift in how it curates content【page_35†L1-L4】. In contrast, Netflix does not expense content outright; it capitalizes licensed and produced titles and amortizes them over the shorter of the contractual window or an estimated usage period (typically on an accelerated basis, with about 90 % amortized within four years) and only writes them off if an asset is abandoned【page_28†L1-L6】【page_28†L7-L9】. Thus Disney’s approach reflects an immediate, one‑time loss on content investments, whereas Netflix spreads the cost of its content over time through systematic amortization.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Disney's $187 million content impairment in 2024 due to strategic shifts in content curation and contrasts it with Netflix's amortization policy. All key facts are accurate: Disney’s impairment is a one-time write-down, while Netflix capitalizes content and amortizes it over time, with about 90% amortized within four years. The only minor omission is that the original answer explicitly links Netflix’s amortization approach to its subscription-based model and monetization of content as a group, which adds contextual depth not fully captured in the LLM response. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: $187 million impairment (Disney, 2024), 90% of Netflix content amortized within four years. No calculations are required, and all figures match the ground truth. Format variations (e.g., $187 million vs $187M) are acceptable and correctly presented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information from two different companies (Disney and Netflix), two different financial treatments (impairment vs amortization), and two different timeframes (2024 for Disney, general policy for Netflix). It correctly infers the strategic implications of each approach. (4) The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the original in factual content and conveys the core contrast in financial treatment. The slight deduction in qualitative accuracy is due to less explicit discussion of the business model rationale (Netflix’s group monetization), but the reasoning remains strong. Contextual relevance is perfect—the answer directly addresses the question about contrasting financial treatments in the streaming industry.",

      "original_answer": "The combined 2023 revenue from 'Services and other' for General Motors and Tesla is $13,477 million. General Motors contributed $5,157 million (or about 3.0% of its total revenue of $171,842 million), while Tesla contributed $8,319 million (or about 8.6% of its total revenue of $96,773 million).",

The percentage contributions (8.6% for Tesla, 3.0% for GM) match the ground truth. The combined revenue is reported as $13,476 million, which is off by $1 million from the ground truth total of $13,477 million—likely due to rounding in intermediate steps. This minor discrepancy does not affect overall correctness. 2) Quantitative accuracy is high: all individual numbers are correct, and the sum is accurate to within $1 million. Percentages are correctly calculated and rounded. 3) Qualitative accuracy is excellent: the model correctly identifies both companies, the correct fiscal year (2023), and the relevant financial category ('Services and other'). It synthesizes data across two companies and computes relative contributions accurately. The comparison stating Tesla’s share is about three times GM’s is logically sound (8.6% vs 3.0%). 4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the combined revenue and the relative contribution as a percentage of total revenue.

It reports Target's amount due within one year as $4,191 million, which is incorrect; the ground truth is $1,116 million. Similarly, it reports Walmart's amount as $0.4 billion ($400 million), but the correct value is $3,447 million. These errors completely invalidate the calculation. The correct difference is $3,447M - $1,116M = $2,331M, but the LLM computes $4,191M - $400M = $3,791M, which is factually wrong. (2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: both input numbers are incorrect, and the resulting calculation is therefore also incorrect. The format variations (e.g., $400M vs $0.4B) are acceptable, but the values themselves do not match the ground truth.

The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer specifically notes TGT has 274 stores over 170,000 sq. ft., a detail omitted in the LLM response. However, this does not undermine the overall correctness of the strategic interpretation.\n\nThus, the answer is factually accurate, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high score with only a slight deduction in qualitative accuracy due to the missing detail about TGT’s store count above 170,000 sq. ft.",

      "original_answer": "KO paid $5,196 million in confirmed invoices during 2024, while MO paid $554 million, resulting in a combined total of $5,750 million in confirmed invoices paid. KO's beginning-year confirmed obligations were $1,421 million, and MO's were $119 million, meaning together they started the year with $1,540 million in confirmed obligations. The combined payments exceeded the starting obligations by $4,210 million.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024 the companies paid $5.196 billion of confirmed invoices under Coca‑Cola’s supply‑chain‑finance program and $0.554 billion under Altria’s supplier‑financing program, for a combined total of roughly $5.75 billion.  By contrast, the confirmed obligations at the start of the year were $1.421 billion for Coca‑Cola and $0.119 billion for Altria (about $1.54 billion together), so the 2024 payments exceeded the combined beginning‑year obligations by roughly $4.2 billion (about 3.7 times as much).",

According to the ground truth, META's General and Administrative (G&A) expenses in 2024 were $1,144 million, not $1,702 million as stated in the LLM answer. The LLM incorrectly assigns the same value ($1,702 million) to both META and NFLX, claiming the difference is $0 million. However, the correct difference is $1,702M - $1,144M = $558 million. (2) The numbers cited by the LLM for both companies are identical and wrong—especially for META, which is off by $558 million. This indicates a critical error in data retrieval or attribution. While NFLX's G&A expense of $1,702 million matches the ground truth, META's figure is completely inaccurate. The calculation of a $0 difference is therefore invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly extract or synthesize the G&A figures from the two companies. It appears to have copied the same number for both entities, suggesting a failure in entity-specific data mapping. (4) Despite the severe factual and quantitative errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right metric (G&A expenses), the correct year (2024), and performs a comparison as requested.

      "original_answer": "KO reported a decrease in accrued income taxes from $24 million in 2023 to $0 million in 2024, indicating a full reversal or settlement of its accrued tax liability during the year. This positively impacted KO's cash flows from operating activities by $24 million. Conversely, WMT experienced an increase in accrued income taxes by $435 million in 2024 compared to a decrease of $468 million in the prior year, suggesting a shift toward higher tax accruals, which negatively impacted its cash flows by $435 million in 2024. The combined effect of these changes was a net negative impact of $411 million on their aggregate cash flows from operating activities related to accrued income tax movements.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in both numbers and interpretation. According to the ground truth, KO's accrued income taxes decreased from $24 million in 2023 to $0 million in 2024, a $24 million reduction. However, the LLM claims a decrease from $1,569 million to $1,387 million — a $182 million reduction — which is entirely incorrect and misrepresents the actual liability size and change. For WMT, the ground truth states that accrued income taxes *increased* by $435 million in 2024 (a negative cash flow impact), compared to a prior-year decrease of $468 million. The LLM incorrectly interprets Walmart’s ‘Accrued income taxes’ line item as a cash payment of $468 million in 2024, when in fact that was the prior-year figure; it also fails to note the $435 million increase in accruals in 2024, which is central to the question. (2) Calculations are therefore also wrong: the LLM computes a net cash flow impact of -$286 million (-$468M + $182M), but the correct combined impact is -$411 million (+$24M for KO, -$435M for WMT). The numbers used for both companies are factually incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify the directional changes in accrued taxes for both firms and misattributes prior-year data to 2024 for Walmart. It does attempt to synthesize across companies and calculate a net effect, but based on incorrect inputs. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate — the answer addresses tax strategies and cash flow impacts as asked, and attempts a combined analysis, but due to severe quantitative and qualitative errors, the conclusion is fundamentally incorrect. The reasoning about tax payments influencing operating cash flow is conceptually sound, but applied to wrong data.",

      "original_answer": "Amazon's 2024 consolidated operating income grew from $36.852 billion to $68.593 billion, an increase of $31.741 billion. This growth was driven by strong performance across all segments: North America increased from $14.877 billion to $24.967 billion (+$10.090 billion), International improved from a loss of $2.656 billion to a profit of $3.792 billion (+$6.448 billion), and AWS expanded from $24.631 billion to $39.834 billion (+$15.203 billion). In contrast, McDonald's reported a 1% increase in consolidated operating income to $11.7 billion, but faced geographic challenges with global comparable sales declining 0.1%, including negative results in France and China that required offsetting gains elsewhere. Unlike Amazon's consistent segment growth, McDonald's performance was mixed across regions, with restructuring charges and external factors like the war in the Middle East affecting results.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon’s 2024 consolidated operating income rose from $36.9 billion to $68.6 billion – a $31.7 billion increase – because each geographic‑based segment posted sizable gains: North America (+$10.1 billion), International (from a loss to +$3.8 billion, a +$6.4 billion swing) and AWS (+$15.2 billion), together accounting for the full $31.7 billion rise. In contrast, McDonald’s operating income grew only 1% to $11.7 billion while its geographic performance was uneven – U.S. comparable sales rose modestly ( +0.2 %), but International Operated Markets fell 0.2% and International Developmental Licensed Markets fell 0.3% amid war‑related and China‑related headwinds – limiting overall growth to a marginal increase.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually correct in all key aspects, with only minor rounding differences that do not affect accuracy. Amazon's operating income increase is correctly stated as $31.7 billion (vs. exact $31.741 billion), and the segment contributions are accurately rounded: North America +$10.1B (vs. $10.090B), International swing of +$6.4B (vs. $6.448B), AWS +$15.2B (vs. $15.203B). McDonald's consolidated operating income is correctly reported as $11.7B with a 1% increase. (2) Calculations are sound: the sum of segment changes (10.1 + 6.4 + 15.2 = 31.7) matches the total growth. The International segment's swing from a loss to profit is correctly interpreted as a $6.4B improvement. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly contrasts Amazon's uniformly strong geographic segment growth with McDonald's mixed regional performance, citing specific challenges in International Operated and Developmental Licensed Markets due to war-related and China-related headwinds. It appropriately highlights the contrast between Amazon's robust, broad-based growth and McDonald's marginal gains despite regional declines. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more granular breakdown of McDonald's sales performance (e.g., U.S. +0.2%, International Operated -0.2%, etc.), which adds value without introducing error. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the global comparable sales decline of 0.1% explicitly, though it is implied through the regional breakdowns.

While Charles Schwab's total stockholders’ equity of ≈$71.3 billion is correct, Wells Fargo's equity is incorrectly stated as $185.7 billion — this is actually the correct combined total from the ground truth. The LLM mistakenly used the combined total as Wells Fargo’s individual equity. (2) The calculation of $71.3 + $185.7 = $257.0 billion is mathematically correct but based on false inputs. The correct sum should be $71.3B (Schwab) + $114.4B (Wells Fargo, actual 2023 equity) = $185.7B. The LLM’s result ($257.0B) is therefore factually wrong.

(2) The 2023 numbers are accurate, and Caterpillar’s 2022 figure is correct, but the absence of Emerson’s $7 million in 2022 undermines the quantitative comparison. The conclusion that the 2023 total is 'dramatically lower' is directionally correct but lacks the precise $815 million decrease stated in the ground truth due to missing data. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—correctly aggregating 2023 data and recognizing a significant year-over-year decline—but fails in full synthesis across both companies and both years. The model does not complete the multi-hop requirement of summing both companies in both years and computing the change.

(1) All numeric values are correct: Alphabet's 2023 vested RSUs = $26.6B, Meta's = $17.46B, sum ≈ $44.1B (exact sum is $44.06B, rounding to $44.1B is acceptable). 2022 values: Alphabet $23.9B, Meta $9.44B, combined $33.34B, reported as ≈$33.3B — minor rounding is reasonable. The difference is correctly calculated as $10.7B (exact: $44.06B - $33.34B = $10.72B), and $10.7B is an acceptable rounded figure. (2) Calculations are accurate and properly rounded; no errors in arithmetic or logic. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data across two companies and two years, computes totals and the year-over-year difference. (4) Entities (Alphabet/GOOGL, Meta/META, RSUs, years 2022 and 2023) are correctly identified and matched to the right figures. The only minor deviation is the use of approximate symbols (≈) and slight rounding in the final totals, but these do not affect factual correctness. Semantic equivalence is maintained.

      "question": "How does the U.S. Government's preference for progress payments over performance-based payments affect Lockheed Martin's (LMT) cash flow timing and Raytheon Technologies' (RTX) contract asset position, given the difference in progress payment rates and contract types between the two companies?",
      "original_answer": "The U.S. Government's preference for progress payments impacts both Lockheed Martin's cash flow timing and Raytheon Technologies' contract asset position. Lockheed Martin notes that the DoD increased progress payment rates from 80% to 90% in March 2020, which improves cash inflows as costs are incurred. In contrast, Raytheon explains that progress payments under U.S. government fixed-price contracts typically result in revenue recognized in excess of billings, creating contract assets on the balance sheet because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion. Therefore, while Lockheed benefits from higher and faster cash inflows due to the increased progress payment rate, Raytheon accumulates contract assets due to delayed billing and payment timing, reflecting a cause-and-effect relationship through the shared mechanism of progress payments.",
      "llm_answer": "The DoD’s shift to treating progress payments as the baseline – and raising the allowable rate to 90 percent for certain contracts – means Lockheed Martin now receives cash much earlier than it incurs the related costs.  As a result, Lockheed Martin’s operating cash flow is front‑loaded (it reported about $1.5 billion of net accelerated progress payments and used $2.2 billion of that cash to pre‑pay suppliers), while Raytheon Technologies, which still relies heavily on performance‑based payments and a mix of progress‑payment terms, records revenue that exceeds billings and therefore carries a sizable contract‑asset balance on its balance sheet.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer captures the core dynamic correctly—Lockheed Martin benefits from earlier cash inflows due to higher progress payment rates, while Raytheon Technologies records contract assets due to revenue recognized in excess of billings. However, the LLM introduces specific dollar amounts ($1.5 billion net accelerated progress payments, $2.2 billion pre-paid to suppliers) that are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth, raising concerns about hallucination. The original answer does not include any numerical figures, so these additions reduce quantitative accuracy. (2) The date of the rate increase (March 2020) is omitted in the LLM answer, which is a factual detail present in the ground truth and relevant to the timeline of policy impact. While the 90% rate is correctly mentioned, the context that it was an increase from 80% is partially missing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the DoD’s progress payment policy to differing financial impacts on two companies based on their contract structures and accounting treatments. It correctly identifies that progress payments lead to faster cash flow for Lockheed and contract assets for Raytheon due to timing mismatches between revenue recognition and billing. (4) Despite the unverified numbers, the qualitative explanation aligns well with the original answer’s cause-and-effect framework and addresses both parts of the multi-part question—cash flow timing for LMT and contract asset position for RTX. The use of terms like 'performance-based payments' and 'revenue exceeds billings' shows accurate entity and concept mapping. The answer remains contextually relevant and logically structured, but the unsupported figures prevent a higher score on correctness and quantitative accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "A 25 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of asset return would increase or decrease Boeing's (BA) 2021 net periodic pension cost by $155 million, directly affecting its pension expense. In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) applies the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets using a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period, which is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense. This means that while Boeing experiences a direct and immediate financial impact from changes in asset return assumptions, Union Pacific smooths the impact over time, thereby managing the volatility of pension expense in its financial statements.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing disclosed that a ± 25‑basis‑point shift in the expected long‑term rate of return on plan assets would change its 2021 net periodic pension cost by about **$155 million**. Union Pacific, by contrast, smooths pension‑expense volatility – it records actuarial gains and losses in other‑comprehensive income and amortizes them over time rather than allowing a small change in the return‑assumption to move directly into net pension expense. Thus, Boeing’s pension cost is highly sensitive to a 0.25 % rate change, while UNP’s accounting approach dampens the immediate impact on earnings.",

According to the ground truth, Cisco generated 57.8% (not ~57.5% combined) and Oracle 57% from the Americas in FY2022—these are individual percentages, not a combined revenue share. The LLM incorrectly calculates a 'combined revenue' of $51.6B + $36.1B = $87.7B and Americas revenue as $29.8B + $20.6B = $50.4B, yielding ~57.5%, which misinterprets the question. The question asks for the sum of the two percentages (57.8% + 57% = 114.8%), not a weighted average or combined revenue share. Similarly, for 2021, the LLM computes a combined share of ~57.1% using incorrect absolute figures, while the correct combined percentage is 58.5% + 55% = 113.5%. The year-over-year increase is therefore 1.3 percentage points, not 0.4. (2) All dollar amounts cited by the LLM ($29.8B, $51.6B, etc.) are fabricated and do not appear in the ground truth; the original answer contains no absolute revenue data. (3) The reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model fails the multi-hop synthesis by treating two separate percentages as if they were components of a single financial metric, rather than summing the percentages as requested. It invents a new interpretation (combined revenue share) that contradicts the question’s intent. (4) Despite the severe quantitative and qualitative errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies (Cisco and Oracle), the correct region (Americas), and the right fiscal years (2022 vs 2021)—and attempts a year-over-year comparison.

While the LLM does not explicitly state the dollar amounts, it correctly characterizes the treatment and names the collaborators, and the amounts are not required for full correctness since the question focuses on accounting treatment. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model contrasts BMS (recipient of upfront payment, defers and amortizes) vs. Gilead (payer of upfronts, expenses immediately), which is the core of the comparison.

Deferred income (or deferred revenue) is a liability, not an asset. This is a technical accounting error, but the functional description (amortized over time) is correct. This prevents a perfect 10. All other elements—entities, years (2023 10-K context implied), metrics, and reasoning—are accurate and relevant.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that Merck recorded $212 million in alliance revenue from its collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2023, which matches the ground truth. However, the second part of the answer is incorrect: the LLM states that Bristol-Myers Squibb reported $608 million in alliance revenue in 2023 (vs $742 million in 2022), implying an 18% decrease, but the ground truth states BMS reported only $55 million in 2023, down from $100 million in 2022 — a 45% decrease. These numbers are significantly different and factually inaccurate. (2) The calculation for the percentage decrease in the LLM answer is approximately correct for the numbers it uses (608 vs 742 → ~18% drop), but those input numbers are wrong. The correct calculation based on ground truth is (100 - 55)/100 = 45%, which the LLM fails to report. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model attempts to synthesize alliance revenue for both companies across years — but it uses incorrect data for BMS, failing the core requirement of accurate cross-entity financial reporting. (4) The correctness score is low due to major factual errors in key financial figures and percentage change, despite getting Merck’s number right. Quantitative accuracy is poor due to wrong dollar amounts and incorrect derived percentage. Qualitative accuracy suffers from flawed data sourcing and synthesis. Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent align with the question, but content is largely inaccurate.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually correct in all key aspects. The combined total cost of revenue is correctly calculated as $68,217 million, matching the ground truth. Adobe's Digital Media cost of revenue ($665M) and segment revenue ($14,216M) yield a ratio of approximately 4.7%, and Microsoft's Product cost of revenue ($15,272M) and segment revenue ($64,773M) yield approximately 23.6% (rounded from 23.5% in the original answer). The minor discrepancy in Microsoft's percentage (23.6% vs 23.5%) is due to rounding and does not constitute a factual error. (2) All numeric values are accurate and correctly sourced: $665M and $14,216M for Adobe, $15,272M and $64,773M for Microsoft. The sum $2,354M + $65,863M = $68,217M is correct. Note: The LLM refers to 'total cost of revenue' as $2,354M + $65,863M, but these figures appear to be segment-level costs (Digital Media and Product), not total company-wide cost of revenue. However, the original answer also equates the sum of these segment costs to the 'combined total cost of revenue', suggesting alignment with the knowledge graph's interpretation. Thus, this is consistent with the ground truth despite potential ambiguity. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and retrieves segment-specific cost of revenue and revenue figures for both companies, computes percentages, and draws a valid comparative conclusion. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with slightly more detailed breakdown of inputs. The conclusion that Adobe’s ratio is far lower than Microsoft’s matches the original’s interpretation. The 0.1% difference in Microsoft’s percentage is within acceptable rounding tolerance.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key quantitative figures and misrepresents Starbucks' deferred revenue amounts, which undermines the correctness of the comparison. First, the original answer states that Starbucks reported stored-value card liabilities of $1.5 billion (as of October 1, 2023) and $1.6 billion (as of September 29, 2024), noting these include foreign currency translation effects. However, the LLM claims $1.57 billion (current) and $15.8 billion (future) as of October 1, 2023, and updates to $1.72 billion and $15.81 billion as of September 29, 2024—these 'future' figures are grossly incorrect and not supported by the ground truth; they appear to conflate total deferred revenue with stored-value card liabilities specifically. This is a major quantitative error. Second, the LLM attributes a $1.225 billion deferred revenue balance to Lowe’s as of February 2, 2024, but this figure refers to protection plans and other contracts, not stored-value cards—there is no mention in the ground truth of Lowe’s specific stored-value card liability amount, so citing this number misrepresents the data. While the qualitative description of Lowe’s redemption-based recognition policy is correct, and Starbucks’ liability reporting approach is generally accurate, the LLM fails to mention the key differentiator highlighted in the original answer: that Starbucks’ liability includes foreign currency translation adjustments, which Lowe’s does not reflect in the same way. The reasoning is partially sound in contrasting timing of revenue recognition, but the synthesis is flawed due to incorrect data sourcing and misattribution of figures.

The percentages each company expects to recognize in the next 12 months are also accurate—43% for Broadcom and 45% for Microsoft. These numbers are reported with acceptable formatting (e.g., ≈ 43%, $20.5 billion). However, the LLM answer does not explicitly calculate or state the dollar amounts expected to be recognized in the next 12 months ($8.815 billion for Broadcom and $123.75 billion for Microsoft), which are part of the original answer’s synthesis. While the components for deriving these figures are present, the failure to complete this step—specifically requested in the question ('what percentage... and what amount?')—represents a minor omission in completeness. The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly associates each company with its obligation and recognition timeline, and the entities (AVGO, MSFT), metrics (remaining performance obligations), and timeframes (next 12 months) are accurate. The answer is contextually fully relevant and well-supported with citation placeholders. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the missing explicit synthesis of the dollar amounts to be recognized, which is a required part of the answer.",

      "original_answer": "Amazon does not capitalize significant software development costs, as it states that such costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented and generally expenses them as incurred. In contrast, Nike capitalizes expenditures for major software purchases and internal-use software, amortizing these costs over 2 to 12 years, and also capitalizes certain payroll costs for employees directly involved in software projects. This indicates that Nike follows a more aggressive capitalization policy for internally developed software compared to Amazon, which appears to expense most such costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon’s 2024 filing states that software‑development costs – whether for products sold, internal‑use software or its websites – were “not significant” to be capitalized and that all other design‑ or maintenance‑related costs are expensed as incurred. Nike’s filing, by contrast, says that major software purchases and internally‑developed software are capitalized and amortized over 2‑12 years, with only preliminary, training or post‑implementation costs expensed. Thus Amazon follows a largely expense‑as‑incurred approach with minimal capitalization, whereas Nike applies a broader capitalization policy for internally‑developed software.",

The distinction in capitalization policies is accurately portrayed. (2) There are no numeric values requiring calculation (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages), but the time range '2–12 years' matches the original answer exactly and is correctly attributed to Nike’s amortization period. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information from both Amazon’s and Nike’s 2024 disclosures and contrasts their accounting policies for internally developed software. It identifies that Amazon expenses most costs (with only insignificant capitalization), whereas Nike capitalizes a broader set of costs, including internal development efforts. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention Nike capitalizing 'certain payroll costs for employees directly involved in software projects,' which is a specific detail in the ground truth and supports the 'aggressive capitalization' point. However, stating that Nike capitalizes 'internally-developed software' implies inclusion of associated labor costs, so the omission is not material. Wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence. All entities (Amazon, Nike, 2024 filings), metrics (capitalization vs. expensing), and reasoning are correct and relevant.",

      "original_answer": "Emerson's (EMR) warranty expense is less than one-half of one percent of sales, indicating a very low financial burden relative to revenue. In contrast, General Dynamics (GD) reported a warranty expense of $104 million in 2022.

      "llm_answer": "Emerson reports that product‑warranty expense is “less than one‑half of one percent of sales,” meaning the cost of warranties is under 0.5 % of its revenue.  General Dynamics recorded a warranty expense of **$104 million** for the year ended 2022.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key numeric values. While LOW's current portion of operating lease obligations is correctly stated at $636 million, TSLA's value is incorrect: the LLM reports $458 million instead of the correct $368 million from the ground truth. This error propagates through the rest of the calculations. (2) The combined total is miscalculated: $636M + $458M = $1,094M (or $1.094B), which matches the LLM's number, but the correct total should be $636M + $368M = $1,004M. Consequently, the percentage breakdown is also wrong. The LLM states LOW represents ~58% and TSLA ~42%, but the correct shares are 63.3% (LOW) and 36.7% (TSLA). These percentages are derived from accurate division only if correct inputs are used. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model attempts to report individual values, compute a sum, and derive percentages—but it fails due to incorrect source data for TSLA. The synthesis logic is present and appropriate, but based on flawed input. (4) Contextual relevance is high, as the answer addresses all parts of the question: individual obligations, comparison, combined total, and percentage contribution. Entity identification (LOW, TSLA, fiscal year 2022, metric name) is correct, and the response format aligns well with the query. However, the quantitative inaccuracies—especially the incorrect TSLA figure and resulting miscalculations—severely undermine factual correctness. Hence, correctness score is 4 (partially correct with major errors), quantitative accuracy is low (3), qualitative reasoning is moderate (5), and contextual relevance is high (9).",

The quantitative accuracy is perfect—numbers are correctly cited and formatted, and the arithmetic is sound. The reasoning is mostly logical, though it slightly mischaracterizes the comparison: the question asks for the difference in adjusted operating profit between CAT and UPS, but the LLM interprets this as subtracting UPS's *decrease* from CAT's total profit, rather than using UPS's actual adjusted operating profit value. However, given the original answer assumes UPS's adjusted operating profit is $672 million (i.e., the decrease *is* the profit, possibly implying it dropped to zero or that $672M is the magnitude being compared), the LLM may be operating under the same implicit assumption. This ambiguity in the ground truth prevents a full deduction. Entity accuracy (CAT, UPS, 2023, adjusted operating profit) and contextual relevance are flawless. The answer addresses the question directly and cites appropriate sources. The qualitative score is slightly reduced due to potential logical misinterpretation of what 'decrease of $672 million' means—it should be the change, not necessarily the total profit—unless additional context confirms otherwise.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the pension liabilities for both GM and McDonald's as of December 31, 2021. GM's liability is accurately reported as $8,008 million ($8.0 billion), and McDonald's as $179.5 million. The difference is correctly calculated as approximately $7.8 billion ($8.0 billion - $0.18 billion), which matches the ground truth difference of $7,828.5 million (rounded appropriately). (2) All numeric values are factually correct and presented in acceptable formats (e.g., $8.0 billion = $8,008 million; $179.5 million = $0.1795 billion, rounded to $0.18 billion in subtraction). The calculation is accurate and clearly explained. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes pension liability data from two different companies (GM and MCD) for the same fiscal date (December 31, 2021), computes the difference, and correctly concludes that GM has the larger pension deficit. The mention of 'non-current Pensions liability' for GM and 'negative Pensions component of AOCI' for McDonald’s reflects accurate sourcing from financial statements, though the latter phrasing may slightly conflate deficit with OCI presentation—however, the net effect (McDonald’s has a much smaller liability) remains valid. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the difference in liabilities and which company had the larger deficit. The only minor limitation is the rounding of $179.5 million to $0.18 billion (which is acceptable) and the use of 'pension deficit' for McDonald’s while the ground truth refers to 'liabilities'—but given that the value is positive in liability terms and negative in OCI, this does not misrepresent the conclusion. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, well-reasoned, and fully aligned with the ground truth.",

This is a significant factual error in entity-metric alignment, despite the correct final sum. The quantitative accuracy is partially compromised due to misattributed values, though the total is correct. The reasoning appears logically structured but is based on incorrect data mapping, indicating a failure in multi-hop synthesis—properly attributing each company’s tax provision is essential in a multi-entity query.

Operating cash flows are accurately reported as $18.8 billion (vs. $18,806 million) for ABBV and $8.6 billion (vs. $8,558 million) for ABT—these are acceptable rounding approximations. (2) The calculations for proportions are implied but not explicitly stated as percentages. The LLM says the combined outflow is 'roughly 1/6 of AbbVie’s' operating cash flow—1/6 ≈ 16.7%, while the true value is 5.2%, so this is inaccurate. Similarly, it states about '1/3 of Abbott’s'—1/3 ≈ 33.3%, while the actual is 25.7%, which is closer but still imprecise. These approximations misrepresent the true proportions and weaken quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in combining data across two companies and relating capital expenditures to operating cash flows, but the lack of exact percentages and use of rough fractions reduces precision. The original answer highlights that ABT allocated a significantly larger proportion than ABBV, which is a key comparative insight missing in the LLM response.

However, it incorrectly swaps the individual company values: it assigns $1,701 million to AbbVie (ABBV) in 2024 when it should be $1,986 million, and $1,986 million to Abbott (ABT) when it should be $1,701 million. The same swap occurs for 2023 values. (2) While the totals are mathematically correct ($1,701 + $1,986 = $3,687), the individual assignments are factually wrong, which is a significant error in entity-to-value mapping. Calculations based on incorrect inputs should not receive full credit even if totals coincidentally match. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is synthesized across two companies and two years, and the comparison is correctly framed—but the model fails to correctly attribute data to the correct company, undermining the validity of the synthesis. (4) Scores reflect that core totals and the final comparison are correct (supporting a moderate score), but major entity-value inaccuracies reduce quantitative and qualitative accuracy.

It also accurately reported Honeywell's Total Segment Profit in 2023 as $8,598 million. The comparison states a $480 million difference, which is a rounded version of the exact $482 million difference in the ground truth—this minor rounding is acceptable and common in financial reporting.

According to the ground truth, the combined total is $2,108.7 million, implying different individual amounts than those provided by the model. The LLM states Starbucks reported $761.7 million and McDonald’s $1,208 million, summing to $1,969.7 million — this total does not match the ground truth combined value of $2,108.7 million, indicating at least one of the individual values is incorrect. (2) The calculation of the sum ($761.7 + $1,208 = $1,969.7) is mathematically correct, but since the inputs are wrong, the final result is inaccurate. The correct combined total should be $2,108.7 million, meaning the LLM is off by approximately $139 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model correctly identifies the need to extract accrued payroll liabilities from both companies’ 2022 10-Ks and sum them — but the factual extraction from the source documents appears flawed. (4) While the model demonstrates proper understanding of the task and references appropriate metrics and years (fiscal 2022, correct metric name), the significant numerical inaccuracies severely impact correctness.

According to the ground truth, Colgate-Palmolive's SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 20 basis points (from 36.6% to 36.8%), which the LLM correctly approximates. However, the LLM incorrectly states that Walmart's SG&A decreased by 30 basis points, while the ground truth shows only a 10 basis point decrease (from 20.9% to 20.8%). This leads to an incorrect final comparison: the LLM claims Colgate's increase was 50 basis points larger than Walmart's decrease, but the correct difference is 30 basis points (20 bp increase vs. 10 bp decrease). (2) The calculation logic is sound—taking the sum of the absolute changes—but based on wrong inputs. The correct calculation is 20 - (-10) = 30 basis points, not 20 + 30 = 50. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is appropriate—comparing two companies' changes in SG&A as % of sales across years and computing the relative difference—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Walmart.

It also correctly reports INTC's 2023 tax benefit of $913 million and ORCL's 2023 provision of $623 million. However, the LLM calculates the 2023 combined total as a net benefit of $-290 million (i.e., -$913M + $623M = -$290M), which is mathematically correct, but the ground truth states the combined 2023 provision was $1,536 million, which is factually incorrect. The correct combined 2023 figure is indeed -$290 million (a net benefit), not $1,536 million. Therefore, the LLM's calculation is accurate, but the ground truth appears to contain an error. Despite this, the LLM states the 2024 combined provision is about $9.6 billion higher than 2023, which is approximately correct: $9,297M - (-$290M) = $9,587M (~$9.6B).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect in its core quantitative claims. It states that both GD and UPS have approximately $8.8 billion in total debt principal, claiming the difference is near zero. However, the ground truth shows UPS has $21,030 million ($21.03 billion) in total debt principal, while GD has $8,826 million ($8.83 billion), making the actual difference $12,204 million. The LLM incorrectly reports UPS's total debt, leading to a completely wrong difference calculation. Additionally, the LLM claims GD has a 'far smaller post-2029 portion' without quantifying it correctly, while the truth is GD has $4,062 million due after 2029 and UPS has $16,125 million—over four times more. The LLM incorrectly states UPS has $4.1 billion due after 2029 (likely confusing this with GD’s amount), when it actually has $16.125 billion. (2) Number verification: GD total debt = $8,826M (correct in LLM), UPS total debt = $21,030M (LLM says ~$8.8B — wrong), difference = $12,204M (LLM says ~$0 — wrong), post-2029: GD = $4,062M (LLM implies smaller, possibly correct qualitatively), UPS = $16,125M (LLM says ~$4.1B — wrong, likely swapped with GD). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly synthesize data across the two 10-Ks. It appears to misattribute GD’s post-2029 debt to UPS and fails to retrieve UPS’s actual total debt, indicating a breakdown in entity-metric alignment. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and numerical errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) — most numbers are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because it correctly identifies UPS as having a significantly higher portion due after 2029, though based on incorrect numbers.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement or on an interim basis when triggering events occur. This results in direct and immediate impacts to earnings based on changes in pension and postretirement benefit valuations. In contrast, Lockheed Martin reports changes in actuarial gains or losses as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which are not immediately recognized in earnings but instead amortized over time. This difference in recognition timing and location within financial statements leads to distinct patterns of financial impact: Caterpillar experiences more volatile earnings due to full-year actuarial changes hitting the income statement immediately, while Lockheed Martin's earnings are affected gradually through amortization expense. The two companies therefore reflect actuarial gains or losses through different financial statement line items and at different times, affecting their reported earnings stability.",

      "original_answer": "The pause in Boeing's 787 deliveries, which began in May 2021 and continued due to production quality issues and FAA regulatory delays, directly affected Raytheon Technologies' commercial aerospace OEM sales.

In contrast, TXN reports that capitalized interest was 'not material' in their 2022 financial statements, suggesting that interest capitalization has a negligible impact on their capital asset reporting and overall financial strategy.

These numbers do not align with the ground truth data, indicating factual inaccuracies in the reported values. (2) The calculation itself (19,739 - 7,972 = 11,767) is mathematically correct, but since the input numbers are wrong, the final result is incorrect. The expected difference of $12,770 million suggests that either Intel’s or Texas Instruments’ comprehensive income figures in the LLM answer are misstated.

Mastercard's correct contribution is $783 million, but the LLM does not clearly state this and instead implies it's part of a $5.3 billion total with Visa contributing $5.1 billion, which would leave only $0.2 billion for Mastercard—far below the actual amount.

(1) The original question asks for the combined Property, Plant and Equipment, Net (PP&E) for Caterpillar Inc. and General Dynamics in 2022, and the ground truth provides a specific value of $17,507 million. However, the LLM claims that the 2022 data is not available in the provided excerpts, which contradicts the premise of the task — that the necessary data should be extractable from the knowledge graph or associated filings. (2) The LLM incorrectly cites 2021 values (Caterpillar $12,090 million; General Dynamics $5,417 million), which sum to $17,507 million — exactly the ground truth value for 2022. This suggests the model confused the year, using 2021 figures while asserting they are the only ones available, when in fact the correct combined value matches the 2022 total. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model should have retrieved the correct 2022 values for both companies and summed them, but instead defaulted to an unavailability claim while quoting outdated numbers. (4) All scores are low because the answer is factually wrong, uses incorrect years, omits the correct data, and fails to perform the required synthesis.

According to the ground truth, Caterpillar's 2022 profit was $6,493 million ($6.5 billion approximately) which is correct in the LLM answer, but GE's 2022 GAAP profit was a loss of $3,683 million, not a profit of $5.9 billion as stated. This leads to a massive error in the profit difference: the correct difference is $10,176 million ($6,493M - (-$3,683M)), not $600 million. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly reports GE as having a positive profit, completely missing that it was a loss. (2) The profit margin calculations are therefore also incorrect. Caterpillar’s margin of 10.4% is approximately correct (LLM says 12%), but GE’s margin was -5.0%, not 10.5%. The margin difference should be 15.4 percentage points, not 1.5. The LLM uses incorrect revenue figures (Caterpillar $55B vs actual ~$51.8B; GE $79B vs actual ~$73.7B), further invalidating its margin math. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails entirely: the model does not recognize that GE had a net loss, misreports both profits, miscalculates differences, and draws false conclusions about margins. It fails to synthesize the correct data across companies and metrics. (4) Due to pervasive quantitative and qualitative errors, especially in core financial facts and calculations, the correctness score is 1.

      "original_answer": "Boeing uses program accounting for the 777X aircraft program, which involves estimating the total number of units to be sold (program accounting quantity) and forecasting revenues and costs over the program's expected life. This method introduces significant complexity and uncertainty due to challenges in predicting customer demand, regulatory certification timelines, and associated cost increases. Honeywell, on the other hand, applies the cost-to-cost input method for recognizing revenue on long-term contracts, which measures progress based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs at completion. Honeywell’s cost estimates are influenced by inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, subcontractor performance, labor agreements, and business volume assumptions. Both companies face complexity in estimating costs due to external uncertainties and the long-term nature of their programs, though Boeing’s challenges are more tied to certification and demand forecasting, while Honeywell’s are rooted in contract execution and performance variability.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s 777X cost estimates are built on “program accounting” – it must forecast the number of aircraft to be sold, the revenue and the full‑life‑cycle production and certification costs for both sold and unsold units.  The uncertainty stems from the difficulty of predicting market demand, the amount of effort and time required to meet regulatory certification, limited historical data for a new model and the risk that schedule delays will drive up costs.  \n\nHoneywell, by contrast, recognizes revenue on long‑term contracts with a cost‑to‑cost input method, estimating total costs to completion from negotiated contract terms, historical performance, inflation, technical‑ and schedule‑risk, subcontractor performance and other economic assumptions; the complexity and uncertainty arise from those same technical and schedule risks, inflationary trends and the need to continually revise estimates as conditions change.",

(1) All factual information is correct: Boeing uses program accounting for the 777X, forecasting total units, revenues, and lifecycle costs, with uncertainty arising from demand forecasting, certification timelines, and schedule delays. Honeywell uses the cost-to-cost input method for long-term contracts, with cost estimates based on incurred vs. total estimated costs, influenced by inflation, technical and schedule risk, subcontractor performance, and economic assumptions. These points match the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, unit counts) in either the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes Boeing’s program-level accounting approach with its unique uncertainties and contrasts it with Honeywell’s contract-level cost-to-cost method and associated risks. The comparison highlights the correct distinction—Boeing’s demand and certification challenges vs. Honeywell’s execution and performance variability—even if the latter point is slightly less explicitly articulated. (4) The LLM omits a minor detail from the original answer—Honeywell’s reliance on labor agreements and business volume assumptions in cost estimation—but captures all major factors.

The percentages are rounded (17.4% → 17%, 21.1% → 21%), which is acceptable for semantic equivalence. 2) All calculations are accurate: $80,269 + $11,514 = $91,783; $13,990 / $80,269 ≈ 17.4%; $2,422 / $11,514 ≈ 21.1%.

This implies a higher level of financial risk exposure that cannot be quantified. In contrast, FedEx's 2022 10-K indicates that historically, it has not made significant payments under indemnification obligations, and the company has not recognized material amounts for these obligations. This suggests FedEx perceives its indemnification risks as minimal and remote. Therefore, while both companies disclose indemnifications, Boeing's inability to estimate these obligations signals greater uncertainty and potential future financial impact compared to FedEx's more stable and predictable indemnification risk profile.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s 10‑K states that “it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain,” so the company discloses the exposure as an unquantified, potentially material risk. FedEx’s filing likewise says the “overall maximum potential amount of the obligation … cannot be reasonably estimated,” but adds that “historically, we have not been required to make significant payments … and no material amounts have been recognized,” thereby framing the indemnification risk as remote and historically immaterial. Thus Boeing’s disclosure emphasizes uncertainty and the inability to measure the liability, while FedEx’s disclosure tempers that uncertainty with a record of negligible actual outflows, suggesting a lower perceived financial risk.",

Additionally, the LLM misattributes Caterpillar’s performance drivers (e.g., restructuring gain) while ignoring actual cost pressures like higher SG&A/R&D and manufacturing costs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed entirely: the model conflated the two companies’ financials, swapping or merging their data. It did not correctly synthesize time-specific, company-specific metrics across entities. Instead of contrasting Caterpillar’s margin decline with Raytheon’s recovery, it falsely equated both. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the answer addresses operating profit margins and attempts a comparison, but the severe factual and quantitative errors undermine all analytical value. Hence, correctness and accuracy scores are near minimum.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of Medicare Rebates for ABBV and PFE in 2023 is $6,294 million. ABBV had a Medicare Rebates balance of $5,297 million and payments of $15,054 million in 2023, indicating a significant cash outflow relative to its liability. PFE had Medicare Rebates of $997 million in 2023, which was its incurred liability for that year with no separate payment amount specified. This shows ABBV had a larger financial obligation and cash outflow related to Medicare Rebates compared to PFE in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 AbbVie recorded **$997 million of Medicare‑rebate expense**, while Pfizer recorded **$1.018 billion of Medicare‑rebate expense**.  Together the two companies incurred **about $2.0 billion in Medicare rebates**.\n\nAbbVie’s balance‑sheet footnote shows a **$5.3 billion “Medicaid and Medicare rebates” liability at year‑end**, indicating that most of the rebate obligation remains accrued on the balance sheet; the cash‑outflow for the period is reflected in the $997 million expense (the portion actually paid during the year is embedded in that expense).  Pfizer’s corresponding liability was **$X billion (balance) with $Y billion of payments recorded**, so the gap between the balance and the payments similarly signals a sizable accrued rebate obligation that will be settled in future cash outflows.  In both cases the difference between the year‑end balance and the amount paid during the year illustrates how each firm’s accrued liability exceeds the cash actually disbursed, underscoring the ongoing cash‑flow impact of Medicare‑rebate commitments.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It states that AbbVie (ABBV) had a Medicare rebate expense of $997 million in 2023, but the ground truth shows ABBV had a balance of $5,297 million and payments of $15,054 million, with no indication that $997 million was its expense. Conversely, the LLM claims Pfizer (PFE) had a Medicare rebate expense of $1.018 billion, but the ground truth states PFE's Medicare Rebates were $997 million in 2023. The combined total is therefore incorrectly calculated as ~$2.0 billion, whereas the correct combined total is $6,294 million ($5,297M + $997M). (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM swaps ABBV’s and PFE’s figures, misrepresents expenses vs. balances, and invents unspecified payment amounts for PFE (X and Y). The calculation of the combined total is off by over $4 billion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in concept—discussing the difference between liability balances and payments to reflect cash outflows—but it applies incorrect data. The model attempts to explain accrued liabilities and future cash flows, but does so using fabricated or swapped numbers. It also fails to recognize that PFE’s $997 million was the incurred liability with no separate payment data, while ABBV had substantial payments. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent of the response align with the question—discussing obligations and cash outflows—but the factual foundation is flawed. Due to major errors in numbers, entities, and calculations, the correctness score is low at 3, quantitative accuracy is 2, qualitative reasoning is 4 for conceptual effort, and contextual relevance is 6 for appropriate framing.",

The difference is calculated as 10.57 years, which is mathematically accurate (17.0 - 6.43 = 10.57).

The ground truth states it is a positive $202 million income, not a loss. This reverses the sign and invalidates the calculation. (2) While Coca-Cola's $277 million is correctly reported, Altria's figure is misrepresented as a loss instead of income, leading to an incorrect sum of $75 million instead of the correct $479 million. The calculation itself (277 - 202 = 75) is mathematically correct but based on a wrong premise. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model incorrectly synthesizes Altria's data—despite referencing the correct magnitude, it assigns the wrong direction (loss vs. income), which reflects a failure in accurate information retrieval or interpretation from the source. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both companies, the correct year (2021), and the right financial concept (non-service cost components).

      "original_answer": "Qualcomm faces risks related to intellectual property enforcement that could negatively impact its cash resources due to costly litigation, audits, and potential reductions in royalty revenues. These activities absorb significant financial and management resources, directly affecting its cash flows. In contrast, Cisco strategically uses its strong cash resources for shareholder returns and acquisitions, with $7.7 billion used for stock repurchases and $6.2 billion for dividends in fiscal 2022, along with $0.4 billion for acquisitions. The difference in reported cash outflows between Cisco's strategic uses and Qualcomm's risk-related cash impacts is significant, highlighting divergent financial strategies and exposures.",
      "llm_answer": "Qualcomm warns that adverse rulings on its patent‑licensing practices could force it to renegotiate licences, pay fines or incur large litigation costs, which “could negatively impact … cash flows.”  The filing does not quantify any cash outflow for that risk in fiscal 2022.  \n\nCisco, by contrast, deliberately deploys cash to return capital to shareholders and to fund purchases.  In fiscal 2022 Cisco paid $6.2 billion in cash dividends and $7.7 billion in stock repurchases (total $13.9 billion) and spent about $0.4 billion on acquisitions.

According to the ground truth, the combined increase is $2,784 million, exceeding $2 billion by $784 million. However, the LLM calculates a combined increase of $2,582 million, exceeding $2 billion by only $582 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect individual increases: AMD's increase is stated as $213 million (correct: $1,802M - $1,589M = $213M — this part is accurate), but NVDA's increase is reported as $2,369 million ($6,283M - $3,914M = $2,369M), which uses incorrect years. The ground truth implies NVDA’s increase should be smaller, suggesting the LLM used wrong fiscal years (2024 to 2025 instead of 2023 to 2024 or mismatched reporting periods). (2) The calculation logic is sound — summing individual increases and comparing to $2 billion — but based on incorrect underlying data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally correct: identifying each company’s net property and equipment, computing year-over-year changes, summing them, and comparing to $2 billion. However, the entity-year alignment is flawed, especially for NVDA, where the prior year value appears misaligned with the filing cycle (SEC 10-Ks typically report up to 2023 or 2024, not 2025).

This significant difference reflects NEE’s much larger capital expenditures and debt financing activity compared to DUK, as seen in NEE’s $12.1 billion in financing cash flows versus DUK’s $773 million.

      "original_answer": "The combined net value of Property and Equipment for CMCSA and GOOGL in 2024 is $65.1 billion. CMCSA has a net value of $62.5 billion on a gross investment of $122.1 billion, while GOOGL has a net value of $2.6 billion on a gross investment of $4.6 billion.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual inaccuracies. The net Property and Equipment value for CMCSA is stated as $171 billion, but the ground truth is $62.5 billion. The combined net value is therefore incorrectly calculated as $173.6 billion instead of the correct $65.1 billion. Additionally, the LLM claims CMCSA has a gross investment of approximately $250 billion with $79 billion accumulated depreciation, but the ground truth reports CMCSA's gross investment as $122.1 billion (net $62.5 billion), so both gross and net figures are wrong. Only GOOGL's net ($2.6 billion) and gross ($4.6 billion) values are correctly reported. (2) Calculations are entirely incorrect: $171B + $2.6B ≠ $65.1B, and the LLM's own numbers sum to $173.6B, which is over 2.6 times the true total. The depreciation logic implied ($250B - $79B = $171B) is mathematically consistent within the LLM's answer but factually false. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing capital intensity strategies based on P&E levels—but fails due to incorrect data. The qualitative interpretation that CMCSA is more capital-intensive aligns with the ground truth, but the reasoning is built on false premises. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative errors (1/10), weak qualitative accuracy due to correct framework but wrong data (3/10), moderate contextual relevance as the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and strategic comparison (6/10), and a low overall correctness score (2/10) due to fundamentally incorrect financial figures undermining the entire response.",

      "original_answer": "AbbVie is advancing its oncology portfolio through the commercial execution of Venclexta, Epkinly, and Elahere, which supports its strategic objective of maintaining growth and competitiveness in the oncology space, especially in the face of challenges with Imbruvica. Meanwhile, Pfizer significantly bolstered its oncology capabilities through the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, gaining four in-line medicines—Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, and Tivdak—alongside a robust pipeline. This acquisition allows Pfizer to span multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics, and other immunotherapies, thereby enhancing its competitive positioning. Together, both companies are strategically strengthening their oncology portfolios, but Pfizer’s acquisition represents a more transformative step in reshaping its presence in the oncology market.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s 2024 strategic plan makes the rollout of Venclexta, Epkinly and Elahere the centerpiece of its effort to broaden and deepen its oncology franchise, giving it new, differentiated agents that can offset the erosion of older products such as Imbruvica and improve its market share in blood‑cancer and solid‑tumor segments【page_6】【page_36】.  \n\nPfizer, by completing the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, instantly adds four approved cancer medicines and a pipeline of ADC, small‑molecule, bispecific and other immunotherapies, creating a multi‑modality oncology portfolio that expands its product breadth and positions the company as a more comprehensive competitor across a wider range of cancer indications【page_10】.  \n\nTogether, these moves sharpen each company’s competitive positioning: AbbVie leans on novel launches to reinforce its niche oncology presence, while Pfizer leverages Seagen’s assets to become a broader, more diversified oncology leader.",

      "question": "How does the use of TRSs by AMT and SPG differently affect their tax obligations and income distribution strategies, based on their respective 2023 disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "AMT operates as a REIT and is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, provided it distributes substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders. However, it must pay taxes on earnings from its domestic TRSs. As of December 31, 2023, AMT’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing, most of its U.S. indoor DAS networks, Services and Data Centers segments, and most operations in several international markets, which indicates that its TRSs are a limited but necessary part of its structure for engaging in non-REIT-qualified activities. In contrast, SPG also operates as a REIT and owns securities in TRSs, but it is subject to a 100% excise tax on certain transactions with TRSs if not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. SPG must also ensure that no more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs. This constraint affects SPG’s flexibility in managing TRS investments and requires careful monitoring to avoid violating REIT asset tests and incurring penalties. Therefore, while both companies use TRSs to engage in non-REIT activities, AMT appears to integrate TRSs more directly into its international operations, whereas SPG must manage TRS ownership more restrictively to avoid tax penalties and maintain REIT compliance.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies use taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) to hold activities that would otherwise disqualify the REIT, but the tax and distribution implications differ. American Tower Corporation (AMT) notes that earnings of its TRSs are taxed as a regular C‑corporation and that the resulting income‑tax provision reduced its 2023 net income, so the TRS earnings are effectively removed from the pool of REIT‑taxable income that must be distributed to shareholders. Simon Property Group (SPG) likewise must pay corporate tax on TRS earnings and avoid a 100 % excise tax on any non‑arm‑length TRS transactions, but it emphasizes that TRS holdings are limited to 20 % of total assets and that it must still distribute at least 90 % of its REIT‑taxable income, shaping its cash‑flow and capital‑allocation decisions to meet that distribution requirement after accounting for the TRS tax liability.",

(1) All key facts are correct: both AMT and SPG use TRSs to hold non-REIT-qualified activities; TRS earnings are taxed at the corporate level for both; SPG is subject to a 100% excise tax on non-arm’s-length transactions and must limit TRS assets to 20% of total assets. These constraints affect income distribution and capital allocation strategies. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 20% asset limit and 90% distribution requirement are correctly stated, and no incorrect numbers or dates are present. Format and phrasing match expected disclosures. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly synthesizes how TRS taxation impacts REIT-level income distribution for both companies, contrasting AMT’s integration of TRSs in international operations (implied by context) with SPG’s stricter compliance constraints. The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention AMT’s REIT-qualified segments (e.g., U.S. tower leasing, DAS, etc.) or the extent of its international TRS use, which slightly reduces completeness compared to the original. However, the core implications for tax obligations and distribution strategies are accurately conveyed.

      "original_answer": "The application of the 10 percent discount factor, combined with the use of first-day-of-the-month average prices, introduces significant variability and reduces the reliability of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for both COP and XOM. COP states that the standardized measure is based on discrete pricing points (first-day-of-the-month prices), which may not reflect actual future prices or market conditions, and XOM echoes this concern, noting that these pricing assumptions can cause significant year-to-year variability.

      "original_answer": "GD uses a cost-to-cost input method to estimate progress on long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time. It bases its estimates on assumptions such as labor productivity, material costs, subcontractor performance, and availability of funding. If there is a significant change in these estimates, GD adjusts the profit using a cumulative catch-up method, which impacts profit recorded to date and future revenue recognition. In 2023, GD had $93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, with 40% expected to be recognized in 2024. HON also uses the cost-to-cost method for long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time, but its estimation process includes factors like historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, and anticipated labor agreements. HON emphasizes auditor evaluation of these estimates due to their complexity and subjectivity, particularly for contracts with longer durations or significant gross margin changes. Both companies face financial implications from estimation changes, but GD explicitly ties adjustments to a defined catch-up method, while HON focuses on audit validation of estimates.",

GD reports that changes to those estimates are reflected in revenue or cost lines and have moved revenue by $191 million in 2023 (and $343 million in 2022) and operating earnings by $112 million in 2023, even though no single contract was material.  \n\nHoneywell (HON) also uses a cost‑to‑cost method for long‑term contracts, but its estimate of total contract costs is driven mainly by labor productivity and availability, work‑complexity, material cost and availability, subcontractor performance, and the timing of customer funding, with variable consideration (claims, award and incentive fees) added only when the right to the amount is enforceable and reliably measurable.

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM claims GD had $191 million in revenue impact and $112 million in operating earnings impact in 2023 from estimate changes — but this data is not present in the ground truth and contradicts it. The ground truth states GD had $93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations (40% to be recognized in 2024), which the LLM omits entirely. These fabricated figures severely harm quantitative accuracy. (2) Qualitatively, the LLM incorrectly swaps key estimation factors: it attributes 'historical performance trends, inflation, technical and schedule risk, anticipated labor agreements' to GD, while the ground truth assigns these to HON. Conversely, it says HON focuses on 'labor productivity and availability, work-complexity, material cost' — factors actually attributed to GD in the original. This misattribution breaks the comparative analysis. (3) The LLM correctly identifies both companies use the cost-to-cost method and recognize revenue over time, and notes GD uses a cumulative catch-up method — aligning with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states HON uses cumulative catch-up, while the ground truth emphasizes HON’s focus on auditor evaluation of estimates, not the accounting method for adjustments. The LLM also fails to mention HON’s emphasis on audit validation, a key qualitative distinction. (4) Contextually, the response is well-structured and addresses the question’s intent regarding estimation factors and financial implications, hence high relevance. But due to major factual and entity-level errors, especially in numbers and misassigned factors, the overall correctness is low.",

The final comparison states Amazon’s growth was 'roughly $2.3 billion larger', which is semantically equivalent to the ground truth difference of $2.293B, though it rounds slightly. (2) Calculations are accurate: $6.3B - $4.0B = $2.3B; $431M - $424M = $7M = $0.007B; difference in growth = $2.3B - $0.007B = $2.293B.

      "original_answer": "GD distinguishes between its defense and aerospace segments in how it manages cash collections and contract assets. In the defense segments, billing typically occurs after revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets, while in the Aerospace segment, GD generally receives deposits upon contract execution or milestone achievement, which are liquidated as revenue is recognized. In contrast, HON systematically tracks unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables on a contract-by-contract basis, recognizing contract assets when revenue is recognized before billing and derecognizing them upon billing.

Similarly, Qualcomm's obligations are reported as $12.8 billion in the ground truth, but the LLM states $9,600 million ($9.6 billion), again a significant underreporting. The combined total in the ground truth is $32.2 billion, while the LLM calculates $20.826 billion, a difference of over $11 billion.

(2) Regarding equity allocation, the LLM claims Lockheed Martin targets 30% equities, but the ground truth states LMT’s U.S. pension plan had a target of 15% equities and 85% fixed income in 2024. This is a major quantitative error. CAT’s 40% equity target is correctly reported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing subsidy expectations and asset strategies across two companies—but fails due to incorrect data synthesis. The model appears to have fabricated or misremembered LMT’s equity allocation and assumed symmetry in subsidy amounts without evidence. (4) While the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate context (postretirement plans, equity vs fixed income), the core numerical inaccuracies severely undermine correctness. The contextual relevance is high because the response attempts the right comparisons, but factual precision is low, especially in critical financial figures.",

      "original_answer": "Apple directly presents its segment information and geographic data in its 2022 10-K filing, including detailed financial metrics by reportable segment for the years 2022, 2021, and 2020. In contrast, IBM does not include its segment information directly in the 2022 10-K but instead references its 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders, directing readers to pages 87 to 90 for segment details. This implies that Apple adopts a more integrated and self-contained reporting approach, while IBM relies on external incorporation by reference, potentially affecting accessibility of detailed segment data for analysts reviewing its 2022 filing alone.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, AT&T (T)'s 2024 Wireless Service Revenue was $68,041 million, but the LLM reports $65,373 million — a significant underreporting of $2,668 million. The difference calculation is therefore incorrect: LLM states ~$51.6 billion ($51,620 million), while the correct difference is $54,288 million. The percentage for AT&T is also wrong: LLM calculates ≈53.5% using an incorrect total revenue base, whereas the correct figure is 55.6%. For Verizon (VZ), the LLM correctly reports the Wireless Service Revenue of $13,753 million and the correct percentage (46.3% in truth vs 46.6% in LLM), but mislabels it as a portion of 'Business-segment revenue' instead of total revenue — a critical error in context. (2) Calculations: The LLM attempts to compute percentages, but uses incorrect inputs. AT&T's total revenue should be ~$122,336 million (which the LLM cites), but $65,373M / $122,336M ≈ 53.4%, which matches their approximation. However, since the numerator is wrong, the result is invalid. The correct calculation is $68,041M / $122,336M ≈ 55.6%. For VZ, $13,753M / $29,705M ≈ 46.3%, but the LLM divides by $29,531M (possibly outdated or incorrect total), yielding 46.6% — close but based on wrong data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize revenue figures and compute differences and proportions, showing understanding of the required operations. However, it fails in retrieving accurate source data for AT&T's wireless revenue and VZ's total revenue, undermining the synthesis. It also incorrectly frames VZ's percentage within a 'Business-segment' rather than total revenue, indicating a failure in entity/metric mapping. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 5 due to partial accuracy in VZ's revenue and rough proximity in calculations, but major errors in core figures. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because some numbers are close but key inputs are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 5 — reasoning structure is sound but based on flawed data and one misidentified metric.

According to the ground truth, the fair value of PSUs that vested in 2024 was $42 million for BMY and $71.86 million for GILD, totaling $113 million. The LLM incorrectly reports $43 million for both BMY and GILD, resulting in a combined total of $86 million, which is materially off. Additionally, the LLM states that the 2023 fair value for BMY was $35 million, whereas the ground truth reports $65 million—another major error. (2) Calculations are also incorrect: the LLM claims the 2024 combined value is $51 million greater than BMY’s 2023 value, but this is based on wrong inputs. The correct comparison is that $113 million (2024 combined) is actually $48 million more than $65 million (2023 BMY alone), but the ground truth states it is a decrease, meaning the LLM reverses the trend. In reality, $113M > $65M, but the original answer says it's a decrease, which contradicts the numbers—however, since we must evaluate against the ground truth as provided, the LLM still fails because it reports opposite directionality with incorrect numbers. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present—the LLM attempts to combine values across companies and compare across years—but due to incorrect data retrieval, the synthesis fails. It identifies the correct entities (BMY, GILD, PSUs, 2023, 2024) and metric (fair value of vested PSUs), showing some understanding of the required hops.

      "original_answer": "AMT maintains greater revenue stability through its structured lease arrangements with fixed escalation clauses and financial penalties for early termination, which discourage tenants from ending leases prematurely. These leases typically have initial terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal options, and often include pass-through costs for power, which are recognized as revenue over time. In contrast, SPG faces higher tenant retention risk due to its reliance on consumer foot traffic and exposure to unpredictable external factors like civil unrest, pandemics, and e-commerce shifts. SPG’s leasing goals are more vulnerable to market volatility, such as oversupply of retail space and reduced consumer willingness to shop in person, which could lead to lower occupancy and rental rates. As a result, AMT benefits from more predictable, long-term cash flows, while SPG must adapt its business model to evolving consumer behavior and external disruptions to maintain revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower’s leases are long‑term, fixed‑rate contracts (typically 5‑10 years with multiple renewal options, annual fixed‑percentage escalations and early‑termination penalties) that are tied to specific, physically distinct tower space and often host several tenants on a single site.  This structure spreads risk, limits residual‑value exposure and generates a predictable, inflation‑adjusted cash‑flow stream, allowing the company to rely on renewal incentives rather than aggressive tenant‑retention marketing.  \n\nSimon Property Group, by contrast, leases retail space whose revenue is closely linked to tenant sales and foot‑traffic and is exposed to broader consumer‑behavior risks (e‑commerce competition, pandemics, crime, climate events).  Because its rents can include variable‑over‑sales components and are subject to market‑rent pressure, SPG’s cash‑flows are less stable, so it emphasizes high‑occupancy rates, a diversified tenant mix and flexible lease terms (percentage rent, renewal incentives) to keep retailers in its centers.",

(1) All key factual elements are correct: AMT's lease terms (5-10 years, fixed escalations, early termination penalties), revenue stability, multi-tenancy on towers, and predictable cash flows are accurately described. SPG's exposure to foot traffic, consumer behavior risks (e-commerce, pandemics, crime), variable rent components, and reliance on occupancy and flexible leasing are also correctly presented. (2) There are no numeric values requiring calculation (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts), but the qualitative descriptors (e.g., '5-10 years', 'annual fixed-percentage escalations') match the original answer's 'five to ten years' and 'fixed escalation clauses'.

The contrast between AMT’s reliance on structural lease protections and SPG’s need for active tenant management is logically derived.

However, the final combined change is incorrect. Apple’s increase from $29,508M to $33,410M is correctly calculated as $3,902M. Qualcomm’s decrease is stated as $768M, which should contribute negatively to the combined change. But instead of computing $3,902M - $768M = $3,134M, the ground truth states the combined change is $4,664M, indicating a possible error in the original knowledge graph or in the interpretation of 'combined change.' However, per the provided ground truth, $4,664M is the correct answer, and the LLM’s $3,134M does not match. (2) Number verification: AAPL change: $33,410M - $29,508M = $3,902M ✅. QCOM change: decrease of $768M ✅. Combined: $3,902M - $768M = $3,134M — this is mathematically correct based on inputs, but contradicts the ground truth of $4,664M. This suggests either a data error in the knowledge graph or a misinterpretation of 'combined change' (e.g., absolute values summed?). Since the LLM’s calculation is logically sound given its inputs, but numerically diverges from the expected answer, partial credit is warranted.

It accurately reflects NVIDIA's concern, citing their 10-K language about a 'material and adverse impact,' which matches the original answer's reference to NVIDIA's expressed concerns. AMD's Data Center revenue growth is mentioned qualitatively as 'growing rapidly,' but the LLM fails to include the specific revenue figures from 2022 to 2024 ($2,884 million to $3,403 million) provided in the ground truth. While no incorrect numbers are stated, the omission of exact figures reduces completeness. (2) There are no numerical inaccuracies—since the LLM avoids stating numbers, there is no contradiction, but also no quantitative support. The absence of specific dollar amounts or growth percentages means the answer lacks the precision present in the original. (3) The reasoning is sound in recognizing that both companies could be affected by the standards, and that NVIDIA may face restrictions on A-100/H-100 class chips, which is consistent with known regulatory risks. However, the LLM does not fully synthesize the multi-hop implication that AMD could gain market share if it complies while NVIDIA does not—a key strategic dynamic in the original answer. It also omits the possibility that broad restrictions on foreign-made accelerators could harm both firms, which is a critical nuance.

This could lead to funding challenges inconsistent with current expectations. Similarly, reduced business spending impacts Mastercard's cross-border transaction volumes, which are a significant source of revenue through cross-border volume fees and switched transaction fees. Both companies are thus exposed to financial performance risks due to lower business spending, with American Express facing potential liquidity constraints and Mastercard experiencing reduced fee income.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express says that weaker business‑spending “could… affect … the performance of loans and receivables previously sold in securitization transactions” and may limit its ability to “securitize and sell loans and receivables” (see AXP 10‑K p. 94). That constraint could reduce the funding it can raise and increase its financing costs, weighing on earnings.  \n\nMastercard notes that “consumers and businesses reducing spending… could impact domestic and cross‑border spend,” which would lower the volume‑ and currency‑conversion fees it earns from cross‑border transactions (see Mastercard 10‑K p. 35). The drop in cross‑border fee revenue directly depresses its top‑line growth and profitability.  \n\nThus, declining business spending hurts American Express by curbing loan‑securitization funding and hurts Mastercard by shrinking cross‑border transaction fee revenue, each pressure‑point dragging on the companies’ financial performance.",

The combined fuel and power expense is correctly calculated as $7,660 million. The LLM rounds NEE's percentage to ≈19%, which is acceptable given that 5,457 / 28,114 ≈ 19.4% and rounding to whole percentage is reasonable in context. (2) The combined revenue is correctly computed as $6,488M + $28,114M = $34,602M, and the LLM correctly calculates the combined fuel and power expense as ≈22% of total revenue (7,660 / 34,602 ≈ 22.1%), which adds useful synthesized insight not explicitly in the original answer but logically sound.

For Netflix (NFLX), the 2021 cost of revenues was $17,332.683 million (or $17.333 billion), which corresponds to 58% of its $29,884.32 million (or $29.884 billion) revenue. The difference in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue between the two companies is 15% (58% - 43%).

Netflix's cost of revenues is correctly stated as $17.33 billion and ~58% of revenue, aligning with the ground truth. However, the LLM incorrectly reports Netflix's total revenue as $3.27 billion, which is drastically wrong — the correct figure is $29.884 billion. This error suggests a possible misreading of '29,884.32 million' as 3.27 billion (perhaps confusing units or values). Despite this, the percentage (58%) is correct, implying the model may have used the right numbers internally for percentage calculation but reported the revenue incorrectly. (2) The difference in cost of revenues as a percentage (58% - 43% = 15 percentage points) is correctly computed and reported. Gross profit margin implications (~57% vs ~42%) are logically sound and correctly derived from the cost percentages. (3) The multi-hop reasoning — comparing cost structures and linking them to gross profit margins across two companies — is conceptually sound and well-articulated. The synthesis of data across companies and metrics is appropriate. (4) The major factual error in Netflix's total revenue severely undermines quantitative accuracy, even though percentages are correct. This could mislead a user about the scale of Netflix's business. However, the core comparative insight (15-point difference, higher margin for Google) is preserved. Hence, correctness is partially compromised — not fully wrong, but not fully accurate.

      "original_answer": "AMT relies heavily on tenant leases as a source of recurring revenue, with the majority of its property operations generating revenue from multiyear contracts. This recurring revenue is critical for maintaining cash flow from operating activities. In contrast, SPG faces significant risks that could negatively impact tenant lease performance, including shifts in consumer behavior toward e-commerce, reduced consumer foot traffic due to public health crises, and the potential for tenants to underreport sales, which affects overage rent collection. These external factors could materially and adversely affect SPG’s occupancy levels and lease rates, directly impacting its revenue and asset value. Thus, while AMT benefits from the stability of long-term tenant leases, SPG is more exposed to volatility due to changing market and health conditions that influence tenant performance.",

All key qualitative points—e-commerce impact, reduced foot traffic, store closures, occupancy risks, and rent rate pressures—are present. (2) There are no numeric values, percentages, or dates in either the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense; however, the textual references to document pages and revenue types are accurate, earning full marks.

The comparison logic is clear and valid. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention 'overage rent' or 'underreporting of sales'—specific mechanisms through which SPG’s revenue could be affected—though it captures the broader risk to lease performance.

The combined total in the ground truth is $60,080 million ($60.08 billion), whereas the LLM calculates $24.3 billion, which is off by over $35 billion. These discrepancies are severe and materially alter the interpretation. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s sum of $7.8B + $16.5B = $24.3B is arithmetically correct, but since both inputs are factually wrong, the result is invalid.

(3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies and two fiscal years, computes individual and combined changes, and correctly infers that rising receivables reflect growth in credit-based sales. It further differentiates the magnitude of growth between the two firms, aligning with the ground truth's emphasis on Apple's larger increase. (4) Minor rounding in presentation (e.g., $29.5B vs. $29,508M) does not affect factual correctness. The qualitative interpretation adds context (services growth for Apple, licensing for Qualcomm) that is reasonable and consistent with the trend, though slightly more detailed than the original. All entities (Apple, Qualcomm, 'Accounts Receivable, Net', fiscal years 2023–2024) are correct. Thus, the answer is factually accurate, complete, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high score with only a minor deduction for slight imprecision in intermediate rounded values.",

According to the ground truth, DUK's 2024 fuel and power expense is $2,346 million, but the LLM reports $964 million, which is less than half the correct value. This error directly impacts the total combined expense, which the LLM calculates as $5,993 million, whereas the correct total is $7,375 million. Additionally, DUK’s total segment income is reported as $441 million by the LLM, but the ground truth states $1,067 million—again a major underreporting. (2) Calculations based on incorrect inputs are internally consistent (e.g., $964m + $5,029m = $5,993m is mathematically correct), but because the source numbers are wrong, the conclusion is factually invalid. The comparison claiming a $5.55 billion difference is based on erroneous inputs and does not reflect reality. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model attempts to extract data for both companies, sum them, and compare to DUK’s segment income—but it fails due to incorrect data retrieval. It correctly identifies NEE’s fuel and power cost as $5,029 million, matching the ground truth, showing partial success in entity and metric identification. However, it misidentifies DUK’s expense and segment income, suggesting either a misreading of the document or referencing the wrong line items (e.g., possibly confusing operating income with segment income or using a partial cost category). (4) Despite correct formatting, citation of pages, and logical structure, the severe numerical inaccuracies in core metrics drastically reduce correctness and quantitative accuracy. Contextual relevance is high because the answer follows the right format and addresses all parts of the question.

It also correctly reports ExxonMobil’s 2023 (7,734 MMCFD) and 2022 (8,295 MMCFD) values. However, the combined totals are miscalculated: 7,744 + 7,734 = 15,478 is incorrect arithmetic (correct sum is 15,478, but the ground truth reports 13,346, indicating the input numbers may be factually wrong despite internal consistency). More critically, the ground truth states the combined 2023 total is 13,346 MMCFD and 2022 is 12,812 MMCFD — meaning the LLM uses incorrect base numbers that contradict the knowledge graph. (2) The calculation of combined totals is arithmetically correct within the LLM’s own numbers (7,744 + 7,734 = 15,478), but these inputs do not match the ground truth, which reports Chevron at 7,744 and ExxonMobil at 5,602 (not 7,734), suggesting the LLM misattributes ExxonMobil’s number. The 2022 sum (7,677 + 8,295 = 15,972) is arithmetically correct but again based on incorrect aggregation per ground truth. The conclusion that production decreased by 494 MMCFD is therefore incorrect — the truth is an increase from 12,812 to 13,346. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model incorrectly retrieves ExxonMobil’s 2023 production value. The ground truth states ExxonMobil produced 7,734 MMCFD in 2022 and decreased to 5,602 MMCFD in 2023, not 7,734 in 2023. This suggests a data retrieval or synthesis error across entities.

The noncontrolling interest amounts are exactly correct: $62 million for Tesla and $1.8 million for Starbucks.\n\n2) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate. The use of billions instead of millions is a valid format shift and does not affect correctness. $6.564 billion = $6,564 million; $4.110 billion = $4,110 million (vs. $4,109.9 million—difference of $0.1 million due to rounding, which is within acceptable tolerance).\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and compares comprehensive income attributable to common stockholders for both companies in 2024, and synthesizes the differing impacts of noncontrolling interests.

      "original_answer": "AMT benefits from a more stable long-term revenue outlook due to 52% of its tenant leases expiring in 2030 or beyond, which provides extended contractual income visibility and reduces exposure to near-term market volatility. In contrast, SPG faces greater uncertainty in revenue stability because its properties are more exposed to short-term tenant risks, such as retail store closures, consumer foot traffic fluctuations, and the impact of external events like crime or public health crises, which can disrupt tenant performance and leasing goals. This contrast in lease duration profiles means AMT is better insulated from near-term market shifts, while SPG must navigate more immediate tenant and consumer behavior risks that could directly affect its leasing revenue and asset value.",

The combined total is calculated as $36.614 billion, which is a rounding difference from the ground truth sum of $36,613 million—this minor discrepancy is due to rounding during unit conversion (e.g., $4,687 million is exactly $4.687 billion, and $31,927 million is exactly $31.927 billion; their sum is $36,614 million, not $36,613). This is a negligible one-million-dollar difference likely due to rounding conventions and is acceptable under format variation allowances. (2) The 2020 value for COP is correctly stated as $10.779 billion ($10,779 million), matching the ground truth. The comparison stating it is 'about $25.8 billion less' than the 2019 combined total is accurate: $36,614 - $10,779 = $25,835 million, which rounds to $25.8 billion.

      "question": "What is the combined increase in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses between Apple (AAPL) and Qualcomm (QCOM) from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, and how does this compare to the change in their respective total operating expenses over the same period?",
      "original_answer": "Apple's SG&A expense increased by $1,165 million ($26,097 million in 2024 - $24,932 million in 2023), while Qualcomm's SG&A expense increased by $38 million ($535 million in 2024 - $497 million in 2023). The combined increase in SG&A expenses is $1,203 million. Apple's total operating expenses increased by $2,620 million ($57,467 million in 2024 - $54,847 million in 2023), while Qualcomm's total operating expenses decreased by $35 million ($1,986 million in 2024 - $2,021 million in 2023). Therefore, the combined increase in SG&A ($1,203 million) is significantly less than Apple's increase in total operating expenses alone ($2,620 million), and partially offset by Qualcomm's decline in total operating expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense rose from $24.9 billion in 2023 to $26.1 billion in 2024 – an increase of **$1.165 billion**.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer correctly calculates Apple's and Qualcomm's SG&A increases ($1.165 billion and $38 million, respectively) and their combined increase ($1.203 billion), matching the ground truth numerically. It also accurately reports Apple's total operating expense increase of $2.62 billion. However, it fails in a critical part of the multi-hop reasoning: it states that Qualcomm's total operating expense change 'is not disclosed in the excerpts provided,' which contradicts the original answer that explicitly includes Qualcomm's decrease of $35 million (from $2,021 million in 2023 to $1,986 million in 2024). This omission breaks the completeness and reasoning chain required by the question, which asks for a comparison between the combined SG&A increase and the change in total operating expenses for both companies. The LLM should have synthesized both companies' total operating expense changes as part of the comparison. While the quantitative accuracy is high (allowing for format variations like $26.1 billion vs $26,097 million), the failure to report Qualcomm's total operating expense change and thus provide the full comparative analysis significantly undermines the qualitative accuracy and overall correctness. The contextual relevance remains high because the answer addresses the structure and intent of the question, but with a major factual gap in the second half of the analysis.",

While NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities are correctly reported at $2,741 million, Duke Energy's value is incorrect: the LLM states $320 million, whereas the ground truth is $202 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $3,061 million instead of the correct $2,943 million. The percentage attribution to NextEra (86%) is approximately correct under the LLM's incorrect total (~89.5% of $3,061M), but this is based on flawed inputs. (2) Calculation verification: $2,741M + $320M = $3,061M (arithmetically correct but based on wrong input); correct sum is $2,741M + $202M = $2,943M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies both companies, the correct metric (noncurrent derivative liabilities), and the correct year (2023), and attempts to synthesize and compare them. The qualitative interpretation about hedging strategies and exposure is reasonable and aligns with the intent of the question. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness penalized heavily due to incorrect core financial data and total; Quantitative accuracy low due to wrong Duke Energy figure and resulting miscalculation; Qualitative accuracy moderate because reasoning and structure are good despite wrong numbers; Contextual relevance high because the response addresses all parts of the question with appropriate framing and sector-level interpretation.",

      "original_answer": "The combined amount of long-term debt maturing within one year for AT&T and Verizon in 2024 is $27,657 million. AT&T has $5,089 million in such debt, while Verizon has $22,568 million. This significant short-term debt burden implies both companies must prioritize liquidity management in 2025, with AT&T planning to fund its obligations through cash from operations, debt issuance, and asset sales, and Verizon likely needing to maintain access to credit facilities and manage its cash flow efficiently to meet its larger maturing obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 10‑K filings show that AT&T had $5.1 billion of long‑term debt coming due within the next 12 months, while Verizon reported $22.6 billion of long‑term debt maturing in the same period – a combined total of roughly **$27.7 billion**. Both companies therefore rely heavily on short‑term liquidity tools – AT&T emphasizes its $12 billion revolving credit facility, commercial‑paper program and vendor‑financing arrangements, and Verizon must draw on its cash‑flow generation and likely refinance or use credit lines to meet the large one‑year maturities – underscoring the importance of maintaining ample liquid resources and flexible financing to cover these imminent obligations.",

These are acceptable rounding variations and do not affect factual accuracy. (2) All calculations are effectively correct—$5.1B + $22.6B = $27.7B—matching the ground truth within rounding tolerance. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from both companies’ 2024 filings and draws appropriate conclusions about liquidity strategies. It accurately reflects AT&T’s use of credit facilities, commercial paper, and vendor financing, and infers Verizon’s reliance on cash flow and refinancing, aligning with the need to manage large near-term maturities.

      "original_answer": "ExxonMobil's 2023 disclosures indicate that its Energy Products earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins, which are influenced by global supply and demand balances, inventory levels, and geopolitical developments. In 2023, refining margins remained above the pre-COVID 10-year historical range but started to normalize from 2022 highs, and the company noted that margins would remain volatile due to changes in global factors such as geopolitical developments and demand growth. Chevron, in its 2023 10-K filing, specifically listed 'changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins' as an important factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from its forward-looking statements. This indicates that Chevron explicitly recognizes industry refining margin volatility — such as the trends described by ExxonMobil — as a material risk to its financial projections and operational planning.",

Chevron’s 2023 10‑K forward‑looking section lists “changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins” among the key uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially (Chevron 10‑K p. 3).

      "question": "How does the difference in financing strategies between GM and Tesla impact their respective exposure to vehicle residual value risks, particularly considering GM Financial's leasing penetration and Tesla's resale value guarantee arrangements?",
      "original_answer": "GM Financial's leasing program is heavily exposed to residual values, as evidenced by its leasing penetration and the $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations in 2023, which is directly influenced by used vehicle prices and lease portfolio net book values. In contrast, Tesla does not include vehicle sales with resale value guarantees in its standard disclosures, indicating a different risk profile where upfront cash payments reduce future residual value exposure. This means GM bears more residual risk through its leasing model, while Tesla mitigates this risk by receiving payments upfront and not including such arrangements in future payment disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "GM leans heavily on its captive finance arm – GM Financial financed 42 % of U.S. retail vehicle sales in 2023 and derives about half of its revenue from leased‑vehicle income.  Because the leases are on‑balance‑sheet assets, GM Financial’s earnings are directly affected by the estimated residual values of the leased trucks, SUVs, crossovers and cars (see the residual‑value table and the discussion of gains on lease terminations).  \n\nTesla’s financing model is very different.  Its 10‑K notes that the few resale‑value‑guarantee contracts it offers are settled with cash up‑front, and those transactions are excluded from the lease‑receivable tables.  Consequently, Tesla’s exposure to residual‑value risk is far lower than GM’s, which bears the risk through a large, high‑penetration leasing portfolio.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies GM Financial's significant leasing penetration and links it to residual value risk, noting that leases are on-balance-sheet assets affecting earnings through estimated residual values. It references the 2023 leasing penetration (42%) and the structural exposure via lease income, which is consistent with GM's high leasing volume and the $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations mentioned in the original answer. While the exact $0.9 billion figure is not cited, the qualitative explanation of gains tied to residual values and lease terminations is present and correct. (2) The quantitative accuracy is strong: the 42% leasing penetration for GM in 2023 is accurate and contextually relevant. The absence of the $0.9 billion gain figure is a minor omission but does not undermine the core financial reasoning. Tesla’s upfront cash settlement of resale value guarantees is correctly stated, and the exclusion from lease-receivable disclosures matches the original. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing GM’s on-balance-sheet leasing model (with full residual risk) to Tesla’s limited, upfront-settled guarantees shows clear synthesis across both companies’ financing strategies and risk exposures. (4) The answer conveys the same core conclusion: GM bears greater residual value risk due to its leasing model, while Tesla mitigates it through upfront payments and non-inclusion in lease disclosures. Wording differs slightly but meaning is preserved. Only a perfect score is withheld due to the missing $0.9 billion gain figure, which is a notable but not critical omission.",

Starbucks' inventory reserves are reported as $58 million, which does not match the expected value implied by the correct total when combined with Tesla's. Tesla's inventory reserves are understated at $1,769 million; the correct value should be approximately $2,291 million (since $2,349M - Starbucks' portion = Tesla's).

While NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative asset value is correctly stated at $1,790 million, Duke Energy's value is incorrectly reported as $282 million instead of the correct $116 million from the ground truth. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $2,072 million (should be $1,906 million) and an inaccurate percentage share for NEE of 86% (correct value is ~93.9%). These miscalculations undermine the quantitative core of the response. (2) The calculation errors are substantial: using $282M instead of $116M for Duke Energy results in a 166% overstatement of Duke's position. The correct combined total is $1,790M + $116M = $1,906M, not $2,072M. NEE's correct share is (1,790 / 1,906) ≈ 93.9%, not 86%. The 72-percentage-point difference mentioned is also incorrect; the actual difference is about 87.8 points (93.9% - 6.1%).

This causal relationship arises because a reduction in prepaid subscribers leads to lower usage and fewer access points needed, which in turn reduces the associated access costs for network providers like VZ.

(4) The semantic meaning matches the original answer: while the LLM frames it as 'helped drive' rather than 'directly contributed,' this is a reasonable interpretation that preserves causality without overstating. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention that this relationship is due to lower usage and fewer access points, which is part of the causal mechanism noted in the original.

According to the ground truth, the combined 'Allowance for equity funds used during construction' for NEE and SO in 2024 is $132 million. However, the LLM incorrectly reports NEE's allowance as $198 million and SO's as $209 million (summing Alabama Power and Georgia Power incorrectly), resulting in a total of $407 million — all of which are factually wrong. Additionally, the LLM reports NEE’s depreciation and amortization as $5,462 million and SO’s as $3,688 million, whereas the ground truth states $2,827 million for NEE and $1,608 million for SO — again significantly off. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM’s incorrect numbers (e.g., $198M + $209M = $407M), but since the source data is wrong, all derived comparisons are invalid. The claim that $407M is about 4% of combined depreciation is based on a combined $9,150M depreciation, but the correct combined depreciation is $2,827M + $1,608M = $4,435M, not $9,150M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly identify or aggregate the correct values from the entities (NEE and SO) for the correct metric and year. It appears to conflate subsidiary-level data incorrectly and misstate totals. (4) The contextual structure of the answer is relevant — it attempts to break down components and compare — but the complete lack of factual accuracy in numbers, entities, and derived percentages severely undermines the response.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains mostly correct information but has significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, the combined tax expense is $5,604 million. The LLM states Disney’s 2023 tax expense as $1.38 billion and AT&T’s as $4.23 billion, which sum to $5.61 billion — close to the correct total but with incorrect individual components. The ground truth implies Disney’s 2023 tax expense must be higher than $1.38B (actual: $1,372M from knowledge graph inference is inconsistent with $1.38B — minor rounding acceptable, but $1.38B = $1,380M is close). However, AT&T’s actual 2023 tax expense was $4,232 million, so $4.23 billion is accurate. The total $5.6 billion is acceptably close to $5,604 million. Disney’s 2022 tax expense is correctly cited as ~$1.73 billion, matching the ground truth of $1,732 million. The difference calculation ($5.6B - $1.73B = ~$3.87B) is rounded to $3.9B, which is reasonable. (2) However, the original answer states the combined total as $5,604 million — the LLM rounds to $5.6 billion, which is acceptable, but the breakdown of Disney’s 2023 tax expense appears understated. If Disney’s actual 2023 tax expense was ~$1,372M, then $1.38B is acceptable. But if the true value was higher (e.g., closer to $1.4B), then it’s less accurate. Given the sum matches closely and individual values are within rounding tolerance, the error is minor but present. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies tax expenses for two companies in 2023, sums them, and compares to Disney’s 2022 expense. Entities (Disney, AT&T, years, metric) are correct. (4) Correctness score is 7 due to minor inaccuracies in Disney’s 2023 tax expense value and rounding in presentation, but core facts and total are approximately correct. Quantitative accuracy is 6 due to borderline acceptable rounding and potential misrepresentation of Disney’s 2023 figure. Qualitative accuracy is 8 — reasoning and entity identification are strong.

      "original_answer": "DHR explicitly stated that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies in 2023 negatively impacted its operating profits when translating foreign operations into U.S. dollars, with particular exposure due to higher European sales than expenses. In contrast, GILD used estimates of future operating profits as a key input in valuing intangible assets, including assumptions about revenues, market share, and currency-neutral financial performance. This reveals that while DHR experienced real, negative effects from currency movements in 2023, GILD's forecasting process assumes stable or predictable operating profits without explicit adjustment for currency risk, highlighting a gap between actual currency exposure and financial forecasting assumptions in the healthcare sector.",
      "llm_answer": "DHR disclosed that the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced its 2023 operating profit by a modest amount (the company quantified the effect as a few‑tens of millions of dollars, i.e., a low‑single‑digit‑percent hit to the segment’s operating margin). By contrast, Gilead’s 10‑K notes that the operating‑profit figures it uses in the probability‑weighted income‑approach to value its intangible assets are “projected” numbers that are explicitly subject to “unexpected changes in U.S. and global financial markets,” including foreign‑currency movements, but the filing does not attach a specific dollar impact to those projections.  \n\nThe comparison shows that both companies recognise currency risk, but DHR reports the actual, near‑term effect on earnings, whereas Gilead treats currency‑related uncertainty as a forward‑looking assumption embedded in its valuation models. Together they illustrate that for healthcare firms, foreign‑exchange fluctuations can affect both current operating results and the assumptions that drive long‑term forecasts and asset‑valuation calculations.",

However, the ground truth does not state that DHR quantified the impact as 'a few tens of millions of dollars' or a 'low-single-digit-percent hit'—this specific quantification is not present in the original answer and appears to be an inference or addition not supported by the provided ground truth. Thus, the quantitative details in the LLM answer are partially fabricated or over-specified, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The original answer makes no mention of GILD explicitly incorporating currency risk into its projections; rather, it states that GILD assumes 'currency-neutral financial performance.' The LLM incorrectly claims Gilead’s projections are explicitly subject to foreign currency movements, which contradicts the ground truth assertion that GILD’s models do not adjust for currency risk. This is a significant qualitative error in reasoning. (3) Despite this, the LLM correctly performs the multi-hop synthesis by contrasting DHR’s real, reported impact with GILD’s forward-looking, assumption-based approach, capturing the broader theme about currency risk in financial forecasting. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the response addresses both parts of the question and draws a meaningful comparison.

In contrast, SPG faces higher financial risk because its retail tenants are vulnerable to reduced consumer foot traffic from safety concerns, e-commerce competition, and public health crises, all of which could directly impact SPG's occupancy levels, lease rates, and overage rent collection.",

Because a tower site usually hosts several carriers, the company’s cash‑flow is spread across many tenants, so a single tenant’s failure has limited impact on its lease‑related earnings.  \n\nSimon Property Group, by contrast, relies on long‑term, triple‑net retail leases that are heavily weighted toward a few large anchor tenants (e.g., Macy’s, Nordstrom, JCPenney) as shown in its property list.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct and aligns well with the ground truth in terms of the core financial risk differences between AMT and SPG related to lease structure and tenant dependency. (1) It accurately describes AMT's lease structure as short-to-medium-term with escalations and limited risk from single tenant defaults due to multi-tenancy—this matches the ground truth's emphasis on minimal residual value risk and reduced impact from tenant performance. It also correctly notes SPG's reliance on long-term retail leases with concentration in anchor tenants, which increases financial risk if those tenants underperform or exit—consistent with the original answer’s focus on vulnerability to foot traffic and tenant defaults. (2) There are no specific numbers, dates, or dollar amounts in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; however, all descriptive metrics (e.g., lease durations of 5–10 years) are plausible and do not contradict known data, earning full marks. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes lease structure (AMT’s distributed tenant base vs. SPG’s anchor dependency) and links it to financial risk exposure. However, the LLM omits key factors mentioned in the ground truth—such as e-commerce competition, public health crises, safety concerns affecting foot traffic, and overage rent collection—which provide important context for SPG’s risk profile. Similarly, it does not mention fixed escalation clauses or financial penalties for early termination in AMT leases, which are specific risk-mitigating features in the original. (4) Despite these omissions, the semantic meaning and overall conclusion are equivalent: AMT has lower financial risk from tenant lease performance due to diversification and structural protections, while SPG faces higher risk due to tenant concentration. Thus, the answer is qualitatively strong but slightly less complete than the ground truth, justifying a score of 8/10 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, with full marks for contextual relevance and quantitative accuracy.",

In contrast, Honeywell (HON) explicitly excludes repositioning and other charges, along with several other items, from its segment profit measurement. This indicates that while both companies exclude certain restructuring-related costs from segment profit, CAT applied a full exclusion policy in 2021, whereas HON follows a broader exclusion framework that includes but is not limited to restructuring activities.",

(1) On quantitative and entity accuracy: all entities (CAT, HON, 2021) are correct, and there are no numeric values to verify, so quantitative accuracy is high. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that Caterpillar excluded all restructuring costs from segment profit in 2021 and lists several types (employee-separation charges, contract termination, asset impairments, gain on plant sale, other items), which aligns with the ground truth’s mention of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, project management, relocation, and demolition. While the specific examples differ slightly, they are plausibly within the scope of restructuring costs, so this is acceptable under semantic equivalence. (3) However, the critical error lies in the characterization of Honeywell: the LLM claims Honeywell does *not* specifically carve out restructuring costs and only excludes corporate-level items, which directly contradicts the ground truth stating that Honeywell *does* explicitly exclude 'repositioning and other charges' (which are restructuring-related) from segment profit. The LLM incorrectly frames Honeywell as including restructuring costs in segment profit, when in fact it excludes them under its 'repositioning' category. (4) This misrepresents the multi-hop comparison: the ground truth emphasizes that *both* companies exclude restructuring costs, but under different scopes (CAT fully, HON via a broader framework). The LLM instead suggests a binary difference — CAT excludes, HON does not — which is factually wrong. Thus, while the answer is well-structured and contextually relevant, the core reasoning and qualitative accuracy suffer from a significant factual error in the comparative analysis, warranting a moderate correctness score of 6.",

At PEP, effective net pricing helped offset significant declines in operating profit caused by the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs, although it was insufficient to prevent an overall 19% decline in operating profit for the QFNA segment. Thus, while net pricing positively supported margins at MDLZ, its impact at PEP was more defensive, cushioning the blow from larger negative factors.",

(1) All key facts are correct: MDLZ's Adjusted Operating Income margin increased from 15.8% in 2022 to 15.9% in 2023 due to net pricing, and PEP's effective net pricing acted as a partial offset to operating profit declines, particularly in QFNA (19% drop). The mention of PBNA's 52% drop adds detail not in the original but does not contradict it and supports the defensive role of pricing. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: percentages (15.8%, 15.9%, 19%, 52%) are correctly cited, and the 0.1 percentage point increase is a valid interpretation of the margin change. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly compares the constructive margin impact at MDLZ versus the defensive role at PEP, synthesizing across two companies and contexts. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the original emphasizes the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs as key drivers at PEP, which the LLM mentions implicitly via 'sizable operating-profit declines' but could have named explicitly.

The calculated difference is therefore $1,878 million ($1.878 billion), not $1.67 billion. These discrepancies in both input values and the resulting difference are substantial and materially affect the answer's accuracy. (2) The LLM incorrectly reports DUK's value as $116 million, which is more than double the correct $57 million. Additionally, NEE's figure is understated by $145 million. The calculation of the gap ($1.79B - $0.116B = ~$1.67B) is arithmetically correct based on its inputs but is invalid due to incorrect source numbers. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies commodity-related derivative contracts as the primary driver of the difference, which aligns with the ground truth. It also correctly performs multi-hop comparison between two companies' derivative positions in 2023. However, it fails to specify that NEE's commodity dominance is due to $2,094 million in Level 3 commodity contract assets (a key detail), and that DUK reports only $3 million under Progress Energy.

NEE's significantly larger prepaid amount suggests a more overfunded pension position compared to SO, which still has unamortized regulatory assets tied to postretirement benefits.

The multi-hop synthesis fails by not acknowledging SO’s $16M asset, leading to an incorrect contrast. 4) While the answer addresses the comparison and infers strategy, it misses the nuance that SO still holds a small prepaid/regulatory asset, undermining the qualitative accuracy of the analysis.

However, the LLM claims SPG had $25.321 billion in total indebtedness, which is over 14x higher than the actual exposure and completely unsupported by the original data. The combined total of $68.8 billion is therefore grossly inflated; the correct total should exceed $45.455 billion, not $68.8 billion. (2) The only correct number is AMT's $43.5 billion in outstanding debt. All other figures—especially SPG's $25.321 billion—are incorrect and appear fabricated or misattributed. The calculation of the combined total is thus invalid. (3) While the LLM attempts multi-hop reasoning by comparing debt structures and discussing foreign currency exposure and variable rate components, it misrepresents SPG’s actual debt composition. It correctly identifies that SPG has EUR, JPY, and MXN loans and uses variable rates and swaps, which aligns with the ground truth’s description of a diversified, internationally exposed structure. Similarly, it accurately notes AMT’s use of multicurrency facilities and EUR-denominated notes tied to acquisitions. These qualitative insights reflect a reasonable interpretation of differing financing strategies. (4) Despite sound conceptual framing and relevant contextual discussion, the severe numerical inaccuracies—especially the erroneous $25.321 billion figure—undermine the answer’s factual reliability. The correctness score is low because financial analysis hinges on accurate data, and the error in SPG’s debt magnitude invalidates the core quantitative claim.

Percentages are accurately approximated: 0.3% for FDX (actual 0.26%) and 17% for GD (actual 17.02%). These minor rounding differences are acceptable under semantic equivalence. (2) Calculations are correct: $1,502M - $52M = $1,450M; $52M / $19,977M ≈ 0.26% (rounded to 0.3% is reasonable); $1,502M / $8,826M ≈ 17.02% (correctly rounded to 17%).

In contrast, GILD's deferred tax liability is influenced by the acquisition of MYR, where the net deferred tax liability was based on differences between financial statement and tax basis of acquired assets, including the $845 million finite-lived intangible asset for Hepcludex (amortized over 10 years) and $1.19 billion acquired IPR&D.

This matches the ground truth numerically and directionally. However, the LLM introduces a new figure—GILD's (Gilead) 'net deferred-tax liability of $513 million tied to the acquired intangible assets'—that is not present in the original answer or supported by the provided ground truth. The ground truth discusses specific intangible assets from the MYR acquisition: $845 million finite-lived intangible (Hepcludex, 10-year amortization) and $1.19 billion IPR&D, but does not state a $513 million deferred tax liability linked to these. This number appears to be fabricated or misinferred. 2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: DHR numbers are accurate (allowing for rounding: $2.96B ≈ $2.958B). But the $513M figure for GILD has no basis in the ground truth and is therefore incorrect. No calculation is shown for how this number was derived, and it distorts the comparison. 3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing DHR's overall change in deferred tax liability to GILD's tax treatment of acquired intangibles—but fails on multi-hop synthesis. The original answer emphasizes that GILD's deferred tax position is shaped by the tax basis differences of specific intangibles and the non-deductibility of goodwill ($226M), not a single $513M liability. The LLM oversimplifies and misrepresents GILD's disclosure, missing the nuance of amortization, IPR&D, and non-deductible goodwill. 4) Contextual relevance is high—the response addresses both companies, the correct years, and the core concept of deferred tax liabilities from intangibles. However, the introduction of an unsupported quantitative claim undermines factual correctness. The conclusion that 'Gilead’s acquisition created a $513 million deferred-tax charge' is not substantiated and misaligns with the ground truth explanation.",

This reveals that MDLZ takes a more granular and region-specific approach to Adjusted EPS adjustments, tailoring its non-GAAP exclusions to macroeconomic conditions, while TGT’s Adjusted EPS appears to follow a more general exclusionary framework without explicit mention of hyperinflationary market adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Mondelez ( MDLZ) explicitly quantifies the effect of “extreme pricing” in Argentina on its non‑GAAP earnings – it treats the $0.20‑per‑share benefit from that pricing as a separate “currency‑related” adjustment that offsets a $0.12‑per‑share adverse currency impact on Adjusted EPS. Target ( TGT), by contrast, reports Adjusted EPS that is identical to GAAP EPS (the reconciliation shows no “Other” adjustments), so it does not isolate any country‑specific pricing effect. This contrast shows that MDLZ uses a more granular, item‑level non‑GAAP disclosure to highlight macro‑economic anomalies, whereas Target adopts a minimalist approach that keeps its non‑GAAP metric essentially a restatement of GAAP results.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the quantitative details. The ground truth states that extreme pricing in Argentina offset $0.32 of unfavorable currency translation effects by $0.20 in 2024, meaning the $0.20 is the adjustment benefit that reduces the $0.32 loss. However, the LLM incorrectly claims a $0.20 benefit offsets only a $0.12 adverse currency impact, which misrepresents both the magnitude of the currency impact and the offset. This is a critical error in financial reporting context. (2) The LLM states TGT's Adjusted EPS is 'identical to GAAP EPS' with 'no Other adjustments', but the ground truth does not provide this level of detail about TGT's reconciliation—only that it lacks a comparable Argentina pricing exclusion. The LLM overreaches by asserting a full reconciliation with zero adjustments, which is not supported by the original answer. (3) The qualitative reasoning about MDLZ’s granular, region-specific approach vs. TGT’s general framework is sound and aligns with the original answer’s conclusion, showing correct multi-hop synthesis in intent and strategic interpretation. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies, the Adjusted EPS methodology, and infers disclosure strategies. However, due to incorrect numbers and unsupported claims about TGT’s GAAP reconciliation, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are significantly reduced. Minor formatting variations in currency presentation are acceptable, but incorrect values ($0.12 vs $0.32) and unsupported calculations undermine trust in the financial analysis.",

      "original_answer": "Starting in 2024, PFE will report royalty income in Total Revenues and will restate prior periods for consistency, whereas JNJ continues to report royalty income in Other (Income) Expense, Net. This change in classification by PFE increases the visibility of royalty income in its financial statements by moving it to a more prominent position under Total Revenues, while JNJ's royalty income remains embedded in a broader net income/expense line item. As a result, beginning in 2024, the visibility and comparability of royalty income between the two companies will differ, with PFE providing more direct transparency into this income stream compared to JNJ.",

In contrast, BAC defines Net Interest Yield as net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.

The dollar amounts ($10,931 million and $85,264 million) are not included in the LLM answer but are present in the ground truth; however, the percentage calculation (12.8%) is correct and matches the ground truth, so the omission does not affect factual accuracy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 12.8% figure is correct, and no other numerical errors are present. The LLM does not repeat the underlying components (adjusted net interest income and average loans), but the derived metric is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts AXP’s loan-specific yield calculation with BAC’s firm-wide metric based on total interest-earning assets. It accurately infers that AXP’s metric is portfolio-specific (CardMember loans) and adjusted, while BAC’s is broader and unadjusted at the portfolio level. The conclusion that the metrics are not directly comparable is implied through the contrast, though not explicitly stated—this minor omission prevents a perfect 10. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the comparison of the two companies’ yield metrics and what it indicates about their calculation methods. Wording differs from the original but maintains semantic equivalence. The LLM adds value by noting that AXP removes non-CardMember interest items, which aligns with 'adjusted net interest income' in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "Both T and VZ use the unsecured borrowing rate as a starting point to approximate a collateralized rate for calculating lease liabilities, which directly affects the present value of lease payments and thus the size of the lease liability recorded. T uses a portfolio approach to determine the incremental borrowing rate, which is risk-adjusted from the unsecured borrowing rate to estimate a collateralized rate in the currency of the lease. VZ similarly risk-adjusts the unsecured borrowing rate to approximate a collateralized rate, and updates this rate quarterly for measurement of new lease liabilities.

This strategy is expected to generate incremental returns by utilizing existing capacity or upgrading towers with modest investment. In contrast, SPG's retail real estate revenue depends heavily on occupancy rates, which were negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer willingness to visit properties and increased reliance on e-commerce. SPG faces challenges in renewing leases or re-leasing available space on favorable terms due to deteriorating market conditions and tenant financial instability, making it more difficult to increase revenue from existing properties. Therefore, while AMT's strategy is positioned for growth through increased occupancy, SPG's strategy is constrained by external risks affecting occupancy and tenant viability.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower’s revenue is driven mainly by how many wireless carriers it can stack on each tower, so its 2022 plan stresses “increasing the occupancy of our existing communications real‑estate portfolio” by marketing spare structural capacity and adding co‑location tenants to existing sites. Simon Property Group, by contrast, generates most of its cash flow from retail lease income and is far more sensitive to overall occupancy levels; its 2022 focus therefore centers on preserving and improving occupancy—through tenant‑retention, lease‑renewals, rent escalations and selective re‑leasing of vacant space—to protect lease income from existing malls. Thus, AMT pursues additional tenants on under‑utilized assets, while SPG concentrates on keeping its retail spaces fully occupied.",

      "question": "How do the differences in treatment of unrecognized amounts in prepaid pension benefit costs between NextEra Energy (NEE) and Southern Company (SO) reflect distinct regulatory asset reporting practices in their 2023 financial disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "NextEra Energy (NEE) discloses that unrecognized amounts in prepaid pension benefit costs are included in regulatory assets (liabilities), indicating that these costs are subject to future recognition in financial statements as regulatory decisions allow. In contrast, Southern Company (SO) specifically notes that its prepaid pension costs exclude $24 million and $32 million in regulatory assets at the end of 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to unamortized amounts from Southern Company Gas' postretirement benefit plans prior to its acquisition. This shows that while both companies report prepaid pension costs, Southern Company explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from these figures, reflecting a more segmented approach to regulatory asset reporting post-acquisition. As a result, the two companies apply different reporting treatments for regulatory components tied to prepaid pension benefit costs, with SO maintaining a more detailed exclusion of regulatory assets.",
      "llm_answer": "NextEra Energy records a sizable “pre‑paid pension benefit cost” balance on its balance sheet ($2.1 billion in 2023) and separates the amounts that have not yet been recognized into two buckets: (1) unrecognized prior‑service benefits and losses that sit in accumulated other‑comprehensive income before they become prepaid pension costs, and (2) unrecognized losses that are first placed in regulatory assets (or liabilities) and will later be re‑classified to net prepaid pension costs. In contrast, Southern Company shows no consolidated prepaid pension‑benefit balance; the un‑recognized service‑cost and gain/loss amounts are reported only as “other regulatory assets, deferred” (or regulatory liabilities) for its post‑retirement benefit plans, indicating that SO treats these items entirely within its regulatory‑asset framework rather than as a separate prepaid‑pension line item.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding Southern Company's reporting. The ground truth states that Southern Company *does* report prepaid pension costs but explicitly *excludes* $24 million and $32 million in regulatory assets related to postretirement benefit plans from those figures. In contrast, the LLM claims SO shows 'no consolidated prepaid pension-benefit balance,' which directly contradicts the original answer and misrepresents SO's disclosure. Additionally, the LLM introduces a $2.1 billion prepaid pension cost for NextEra Energy, which is not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided information—this number is unsupported and likely fabricated. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the LLM invents a specific dollar figure ($2.1 billion) not mentioned in the original answer, and fails to report the actual disclosed amounts for Southern Company ($24 million and $32 million). These omissions and fabrications severely undermine numerical correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that it attempts to compare regulatory asset treatments between NEE and SO, and correctly identifies that NEE includes unrecognized amounts in regulatory assets while SO handles them differently. However, the conclusion that SO treats these items 'entirely within its regulatory-asset framework rather than as a separate prepaid-pension line item' mischaracterizes the original answer, which states SO *does* report prepaid pension costs but *excludes* certain regulatory assets from them. This reflects a failure in synthesis across the two disclosures. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses the core issue—differences in regulatory asset reporting for unrecognized pension costs—and uses appropriate terminology. However, due to major factual and quantitative errors, especially the incorrect characterization of SO’s reporting and the unsupported figure for NEE, the overall correctness score is low at 4, reflecting partial accuracy with significant errors that alter the meaning of the comparison.",

      "original_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production, which results in a more revenue-aligned expense pattern. In contrast, Netflix expenses participations and residuals in line with an accelerated amortization pattern, expecting more upfront viewing, with over 90% of a content asset amortized within four years. This leads to Netflix recognizing a larger portion of expenses earlier in the product life cycle compared to Disney, which adjusts expenses dynamically based on ongoing revenue performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals by applying the ratio of the period’s revenue to the estimated remaining total (ultimate) revenue for the title, so the expense is spread out in proportion to the cash‑flow pattern throughout the product’s life cycle. Netflix, by contrast, uses an accelerated amortization schedule—recognizing most of the participation and residual expense in the first few years (about 90 % within four years). Consequently, Disney’s approach yields a more gradual, revenue‑matched expense trajectory, whereas Netflix front‑loads the expense, producing higher early‑period costs and lower costs later in the title’s life.",

(2) The quantitative claim of 'about 90% within four years' matches the original 'over 90% of a content asset amortized within four years'—this is a reasonable paraphrase with no loss of accuracy.

According to the ground truth, Amgen's 'Other income (expense), net' for 2024 is $506 million, but the LLM incorrectly states it as $1,200 million. Similarly, Thermo Fisher's 'Other income/(expense)' is $(65) million (a loss), but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $506 million (a gain). The combined total in the ground truth is $441 million ($506M - $65M), whereas the LLM calculates $1,706 million, which is grossly inaccurate due to wrong inputs. (2) Calculations are mathematically correct within the LLM’s own (false) numbers ($1,200M + $506M = $1,706M), but since the inputs are wrong, the result is invalid. The LLM also incorrectly assigns Thermo Fisher’s actual consolidated income before taxes ($7,037 million) as being driven by its 'Other income', which contradicts the ground truth where that line item is negative. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model swaps the companies’ values—possibly confusing Amgen’s correct other income figure with Thermo Fisher’s—and does not recognize that Thermo Fisher’s other income is negative, thus misrepresenting its impact. It also fails to note the opposite effects on pre-tax income: Amgen’s positive contribution vs. Thermo Fisher’s reduction.

While it correctly states COP's 2022 total discounted future net cash flows as $57,695 million, it incorrectly reports XOM's 2019 discounted future net cash flows as $89,916 million, which contradicts the ground truth value of $34,542 million. The noncontrolling interest portion ($1,064 million) is correct. This leads to a completely wrong sum of $90,980 million (vs. correct sum of $35,606 million), and thus a false conclusion that COP's value was $33,285 million lower, when in fact it was $22,089 million higher. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent but based on incorrect input data. The correct calculation is: $57,695M - ($34,542M + $1,064M) = $57,695M - $35,606M = $22,089M higher — which the LLM fails to report. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is structurally attempted (pulling data from two companies and years, combining with noncontrolling interest), but due to incorrect data retrieval for XOM’s 2019 cash flows, the synthesis fails. It appears the model may have used a different metric (e.g., total future cash flows before discounting or including price changes) instead of the correct discounted future net cash flows. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right entities (COP, XOM, noncontrolling interest, year-end cash flows) and attempts the correct type of comparison, but the severe numerical inaccuracies and reversed conclusion (lower vs. higher) result in a near-total failure of factual correctness.

How might analysts interpret the difference in debt valuation approaches between CL and PM in terms of financial reporting conservatism and interest expense recognition?",
      "original_answer": "Analysts may interpret CL's reporting, where the carrying value of long-term debt ($8,239 million) exceeds its fair value ($7,862 million), as indicative of debt issued at a premium or a decline in market interest rates, which increases the fair value of fixed-rate debt. This suggests CL's financial reporting reflects a more conservative approach by maintaining a higher carrying value on the balance sheet. In contrast, PM's fair value step-up adjustment for inventories ($146 million) and the $(107) million purchase price adjustment amortized into interest expense suggest that PM's debt was initially recorded at a discount post-acquisition, leading to higher interest expense recognition over time. This indicates PM's approach reflects the impact of acquisition accounting on interest costs, which may affect earnings volatility. Therefore, the difference in valuation approaches reflects contrasting capital structure strategies and reporting conservatism, with CL showing a market-based valuation decline and PM experiencing acquisition-driven expense increases.",
      "llm_answer": "Colgate records its long‑term borrowings at the historical carrying amount of $8,239 million, which is higher than the fair‑value estimate of $7,862 million.  By keeping the liability on the balance sheet above fair value, Colgate’s presentation is relatively conservative and does not alter the interest expense that is recognized on the contractual debt rate.  In contrast, Philip Morris values the acquired debt at market prices and then spreads the $107 million purchase‑price adjustment into interest expense over the debt’s life, effectively raising reported interest cost; this reflects a less‑conservative valuation approach that integrates acquisition‑related adjustments into earnings rather than simply showing a discount to fair value.",

The $146 million fair value step-up for inventories is omitted in the LLM answer, which is a minor but notable omission affecting completeness. (2) The reasoning correctly interprets Colgate’s higher carrying value as conservative reporting and links it to market interest rate dynamics or premium issuance. It also correctly identifies that PM amortizes a discount (from acquisition accounting) into interest expense, increasing reported interest costs over time.

(3) Entity accuracy is correct—Southern Company, NextEra Energy, Plant Daniel operating agreement, and Gulf Power are all properly identified and contextually used. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the withheld amount under the revised agreement to the broader context of the Gulf Power sale and computes the proportional percentage accurately. (5) Semantic equivalence is maintained—the LLM uses slightly different phrasing (e.g., 'roughly 1 percent') but this does not affect factual precision, as 1% is exact in this context.

      "question": "How does the allocation of production overhead in capitalized content costs differ between Disney and Netflix, based on their amortization strategies and content monetization models?",
      "original_answer": "Disney allocates production overhead to capitalized content costs for produced films and television content, and amortizes these costs based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for content monetized individually, such as theatrical films or titles sold to third parties. For group-monetized content (e.g., content used on DTC services or Linear Networks), Disney amortizes the costs based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line pattern. In contrast, Netflix also capitalizes production overhead for produced content and amortizes it over the shorter of the contractual window or estimated period of use (typically up to ten years), using an accelerated basis driven by expected viewing patterns. Netflix's amortization is not tied to revenue ratios but rather to viewing behavior, with over 90% of a title's cost typically amortized within four years. This reflects a difference in monetization focus: Disney aligns amortization with revenue realization, while Netflix aligns it with consumption patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney capitalizes production overhead as part of “produced‑content” costs and then splits the amortization according to the title’s monetization classification: titles that are monetized individually are amortized using a revenue‑ratio (current‑period revenue ÷ estimated remaining ultimate revenue), while titles treated as a group are amortized on projected usage, often on a straight‑line or modestly accelerated schedule. Netflix also capitalizes production overhead with other production costs, but it does not separate titles by monetization strategy; instead it amortizes all licensed and produced assets on an accelerated basis over the shorter of the contractual window or ten years, reflecting the front‑loaded viewing pattern of its subscription model.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the core differences between Disney and Netflix in allocating production overhead and amortizing capitalized content costs. (1) It correctly states that Disney capitalizes production overhead and uses two amortization methods based on monetization: revenue-ratio for individually monetized content (e.g., theatrical films) and projected usage (straight-line or accelerated) for group-monetized content (e.g., DTC or linear networks). Netflix, in contrast, amortizes all produced and licensed content on an accelerated basis over the shorter of the contractual term or ten years, based on viewing patterns, not revenue. (2) There are no numeric values in the LLM answer that contradict the ground truth; while the ground truth mentions that Netflix amortizes over 90% of a title's cost within four years, this specific percentage is omitted in the LLM response. However, the mention of 'accelerated basis' and 'front-loaded viewing pattern' captures the essence, so this is a minor omission rather than an error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how each company’s amortization approach reflects its broader monetization model—Disney tied to revenue realization, Netflix to consumption. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both companies’ overhead allocation and amortization strategies. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the absence of the specific 'over 90% within four years' metric for Netflix, which adds precision to the accelerated amortization claim. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-structured, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth with minor detail omission.",

The original question asks for the combined fair value of debt securities held by C (Citigroup) and PYPL (PayPal) in the 'after 5 but within 10 years' maturity bucket as a percentage of their total fair value of debt securities. The ground truth uses only AFS (Available-for-Sale) securities for C, specifically $226,876 million total and $526 million in the 5-10 year bucket. However, the LLM incorrectly includes HTM (Held-to-Maturity) securities and sums HTM and AFS values for Citigroup, calculating a total fair value of $451,286 million and a 5-10 year value of $22,444 million — both figures are unsupported by the question's scope and the ground truth. (2) For Citigroup, the LLM cites HTM and AFS values from multiple line items across pages 205 and 207, but the original answer and standard financial reporting practice for such questions typically refer to AFS unless otherwise specified. The inclusion of HTM securities distorts the calculation. The correct 5-10 year fair value for C is $526 million (AFS only), not $22,444 million. The LLM’s calculation of $22,444 million aggregates multiple HTM and AFS line items that do not correspond to the required maturity bucket. (3) For PayPal, the LLM correctly identifies the total fair value ($21,292 million) and the 5-10 year amount ($3,337 million), matching the ground truth. However, due to the massive overstatement of Citigroup's values, the combined numerator becomes $25,781 million (vs. correct $3,863 million) and denominator $472,578 million (vs. correct $248,168 million), leading to an erroneous 5.5% (vs. correct 1.56%). (4) The reasoning is flawed in multi-hop synthesis: it fails to correctly identify which securities (AFS vs HTM) are relevant, misaggregates maturity buckets, and thus produces a result that is off by more than 3.5x the correct percentage. While the structure and attempt at citation are present, the factual and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine the answer. Contextual relevance is moderate as it addresses the right companies and maturity bucket concept, but with incorrect data scope.",

It correctly infers that because Southern Company Gas faces risk of disallowed costs or refunds due to commission decisions, Duke Energy may face similar risks, affecting the realizability of its $698 million liability. (4) The LLM adds value by explicitly suggesting investor actions—scrutinizing the liability and considering potential write-offs or rate reductions—which are reasonable interpretations of the risk, even if slightly more prescriptive than the original. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly state that regulatory recovery 'is not guaranteed' in identical terms, but this concept is clearly conveyed through 'may not be fully recovered' and 'regulatory-approval uncertainty.'

According to the ground truth, T (AT&T) has a wireless license value of $2,999 million, not $125,075 million, and VZ (Verizon) has $156,613 million, which the LLM correctly reports. The combined value is therefore $159,612 million, not $281.7 billion — the LLM’s sum is nearly double the correct amount due to the inflated AT&T figure. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports AT&T’s wireless licenses as $125,075 million, which is over 40 times higher than the true value of $2,999 million. The sum ($125,075M + $156,613M = ~$281.7B) is therefore completely incorrect. (3) The reasoning is flawed and inverted: the ground truth states that T (AT&T) amortizes its licenses over 21.6 years (definite-life, conservative accounting), while VZ (Verizon) shows no accumulated amortization, suggesting indefinite-life treatment. The LLM incorrectly claims the opposite — that AT&T uses indefinite-life (no amortization) and Verizon uses definite-life (amortized). This reversal undermines the entire qualitative analysis of value retention. (4) Despite the incorrect numbers and reversed logic, the LLM does address both parts of the question — the combined value and the comparison of amortization policies — so the response is contextually relevant. However, due to the magnitude of factual and logical errors, especially in core numbers and the inversion of accounting policies, the correctness score is very low.

Additionally, the LLM uses negative values (e.g., $(236) million), implying a credit or benefit, but the ground truth reports positive costs, indicating expense.

PYPL, on the other hand, explicitly calls out FX fluctuations as a key risk factor for its international operations, noting that such movements could significantly impact its business due to the global nature of its revenue base.

However, AT&T does amortize its wireless licenses in Mexico over a 25-year average economic life. In contrast, Verizon (VZ) treats its wireless licenses as indefinite-lived intangible assets and also does not amortize them, testing them annually for impairment. The difference in amortization policy means that AT&T recognizes periodic depreciation expense for its Mexican licenses, which affects earnings, while Verizon does not record any amortization expense for its licenses. This results in differing financial impacts on asset valuation and income statements, with AT&T experiencing a gradual reduction in asset value over time for Mexican licenses, while Verizon’s wireless license values remain on the balance sheet unless impaired.",

However, it incorrectly states that impairment testing occurs 'each quarter' for both companies—Verizon tests annually, and while AT&T may perform interim reviews, the primary test is annual, not quarterly. This is a significant factual error. Additionally, the claim that both companies disclose the 'fair value of the licenses exceeds their book values by more than 10%' is not supported in the original answer and introduces unverified information. (2) The 25-year amortization period for Mexican licenses is accurate. However, the 10% fair value excess is not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified, making it a fabricated quantitative claim.

Additionally, the LLM attributes DIS's increase to 'new sports rights – higher international ESPN soccer costs and added cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar,' which is not mentioned in the ground truth; instead, the original cites Hulu's $317M increase and reductions in Disney+ as the main drivers.

      "original_answer": "In General Motors' Automotive Segment, revenue generation is influenced by transactions with GM Financial, which include financing and leasing activities, as stated in their 2023 10-K filing. In contrast, Tesla's Automotive Segment generates revenue through the design, development, manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles, along with automotive regulatory credits, services, and other activities such as used vehicle sales and Supercharging, as detailed in their 2023 10-K filing. These differences highlight distinct business models centered around the Automotive Segment.",
      "llm_answer": "General Motors’ automotive segment is overwhelmingly a vehicle‑sales business – in 2023 it generated about **$158 billion** of net sales, the bulk coming from “vehicle, parts and accessories” ($141 billion) and related services (≈$5 billion)【page_70】. Tesla’s automotive segment is smaller (≈**$90.7 billion** in 2023) and is defined more broadly – it includes EV sales, regulatory‑credit sales and a suite of services such as Super‑charging, insurance, used‑vehicle sales and merchandise【page_93】. Thus GM’s focus is on high‑volume traditional vehicle and parts sales, while Tesla’s focus blends vehicle sales with ancillary EV‑related services and credit revenue.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the core difference in revenue focus between GM and Tesla's Automotive Segments—GM emphasizes traditional vehicle and parts sales, while Tesla includes a broader range of EV-related services and regulatory credits. This aligns with the ground truth. However, the exact revenue figures cited—$158 billion for GM and $90.7 billion for Tesla—are not fully verifiable from the 2023 10-K filings as presented. GM’s 2023 10-K reports total Automotive segment net sales of $158.4 billion, which matches closely. Tesla’s automotive revenue is reported as $90.7 billion in their 2023 10-K, which is accurate. So while the numbers are correct, the breakdowns (e.g., $141B for vehicle/parts, ~$5B for services) are not explicitly stated in the same way in GM’s filing—these appear to be estimates or interpretations rather than direct disclosures, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The quantitative values for total segment revenues are accurate within acceptable rounding and format variation. However, the LLM introduces granular sub-amounts (e.g., $141B, $5B) that are not directly reported in the 10-K, which risks misrepresentation. The ground truth does not include such detailed revenue splits, so this addition, while plausible, lacks direct support. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information from both companies’ 10-Ks, compares their business models, and draws a valid conclusion about differing focuses—GM on core vehicle/parts sales, Tesla on integrated EV ecosystem including services and credits. This reflects strong qualitative reasoning. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing the comparative focus of the Automotive Segment. The correctness score is 8 due to accurate core facts and reasoning, but docked slightly for unsupported sub-revenue breakdowns. Quantitative accuracy is 7 because while totals are correct, the detailed allocations are inferred. Qualitative accuracy is 9 due to strong synthesis and correct entity identification.

In contrast, Altria's employee count decreased from approximately 7,100 in 2020 to 6,000 in 2021, primarily due to the sale of its wine business.

Altria's employee count is accurately reported as decreasing from 7,100 in 2020 to 6,000 in 2021, with the note that it remained near that level in 2022. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth; the percentage calculation for Costco is accurate (31,000 / 273,000 ≈ 11.35%, rounded to 11.4%). The claim of a '1-2%' decline for Altria is slightly imprecise—the actual reduction is (7,100 - 6,000)/7,100 ≈ 15.5%, so describing it as a '1-2%' decline is incorrect. However, the LLM may have misphrased this; the intent appears to reflect a small change, but the percentage decline is substantial. This is a notable error, though the direction (decrease) and cause (business sale, implied by context) are correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes employee trends across two companies and time periods, contrasting growth vs. contraction. It appropriately infers the broader trend despite Altria not reporting 2022 data explicitly. (4) The answer is highly factually accurate with only a minor error in characterizing the magnitude of Altria's decline.

The ground truth states that Comcast did not disclose exact dollar figures or percentages for its programming and production cost reductions, only indicating a directional decrease due to the Writers Guild and SAG strikes. However, the LLM claims a 9.3% drop (about $820 million) in Studios segment costs and a decline in Media segment costs—specific figures and percentages not present in the original answer or supported by the knowledge graph. These numbers are fabricated or hallucinated. For Disney, the ground truth reports Hulu’s costs increased from $8,265 million to $8,582 million (a $317 million increase, which is ~3.8%, rounded to 4%), and Disney+ decreased from $5,694 million to $5,499 million (~3.4% decrease, rounded to 3%). The LLM correctly estimates the approximate dollar changes ($317M and $195M) and percentages, so Disney-related quantitative data is mostly accurate. (2) The LLM incorrectly attributes precise financial figures to Comcast that were not disclosed, which is a major factual error. While the Disney numbers are reasonably accurate (≈$317M and ≈$195M), the LLM presents them as approximations (≈), which is acceptable given rounding. However, the Comcast figures ($820M, 9.3%) are entirely unsupported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Disney is reallocating spending (up on Hulu, down on Disney+), and contrasts this with Comcast’s broader cost-cutting. This aligns with the ground truth’s conclusion about differing strategies—Comcast reducing due to disruptions, Disney reallocating. However, the reasoning is based on incorrect data for Comcast, undermining the validity of the comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both companies, the correct time frame (2023 filings), and draws a strategic conclusion about content allocation. The qualitative interpretation of strategy (reallocation vs. broad cuts) matches the ground truth. However, the hallucinated Comcast figures severely reduce factual correctness. Thus, while the direction and logic are reasonable, the foundation includes false data, warranting a moderate correctness score of 6.",

      "question": "What is the combined value of non-cash additions related to lease financing for Chevron and ExxonMobil in 2024, and how does this reflect their capital investment strategies as disclosed in their respective 10-K filings?",
      "original_answer": "The combined value of non-cash additions related to lease financing for Chevron and ExxonMobil in 2024 is $3,869 million. Chevron reported non-cash additions of $2,205 million for right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified lease liabilities, while ExxonMobil disclosed non-cash additions of $1,664 million in its reconciliation of consolidated assets. Both companies include these non-cash additions as part of their broader capital investment strategies, with Chevron explicitly linking these additions to operating and finance leases, and ExxonMobil incorporating them into its total additions to property, plant, and equipment. This demonstrates a shared emphasis on leveraging lease financing as a capital-efficient method to support asset growth in the energy sector.",
      "llm_answer": "The 10‑K filings show that in 2024 Chevron recorded **$40 million of non‑cash additions for finance‑leases** (the right‑of‑use assets created in exchange for new or modified finance‑lease liabilities)【page_76】. ExxonMobil’s disclosed “additions to property, plant and equipment” note that the total includes non‑cash items, but it does not break out a separate amount for lease‑related non‑cash additions, implying **no material non‑cash lease‑financing addition is reported**【page_111】.  \n\n**Combined value:** $40 million.  \n\n**Interpretation:** Chevron’s capital‑investment approach relies largely on operating leases and only modest finance‑lease accounting entries, reflecting a more asset‑light, cash‑preserving strategy. ExxonMobil, by contrast, emphasizes large PP&E outlays and does not highlight lease‑related non‑cash additions, indicating a capital‑intensive investment strategy focused on owning and expanding physical assets.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The ground truth states that Chevron reported $2,205 million and ExxonMobil $1,664 million in non-cash lease additions, totaling $3,869 million. However, the LLM claims Chevron reported only $40 million and ExxonMobil reported no material amount, which is factually wrong. These numbers do not match the ground truth, even approximately, and represent a severe underreporting. (2) The calculation of the combined value is therefore also incorrect: $40 million vs. the correct $3,869 million. The LLM misreads or misrepresents the data from the filings, possibly confusing finance leases with total lease-related non-cash additions or citing an incorrect line item. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly extract or synthesize the relevant figures from both companies’ 10-Ks. Instead, it incorrectly infers that ExxonMobil did not report any lease-related non-cash additions, while the ground truth confirms it did report $1,664 million. The interpretation of capital investment strategies is thus based on false premises—Chevron’s use of leases is not 'modest' at $2.2 billion, and ExxonMobil’s omission of a breakout does not imply absence of such additions. (4) Despite the factual errors, the answer attempts to address both parts of the question (combined value and strategic interpretation), so it retains moderate contextual relevance. However, due to major factual inaccuracies and flawed reasoning, the correctness score is low.",

JNJ’s Immunology products achieved $16.8 billion in sales in 2021, representing an 11.3% increase compared to the prior year. LLY’s global Immunology revenue in 2021 was $1.88 billion, which was an increase of $509.5 million (or approximately 37.1%) compared to its 2020 Immunology revenue of $1.37 billion. Therefore, LLY experienced a higher growth rate (37.1%) in Immunology revenue than JNJ (11.3%) from 2020 to 2021.",

(1) Quantitative Accuracy: JNJ's reported Immunology revenue is $16.75 billion vs. the ground truth $16.8 billion—a negligible $50 million difference likely due to rounding; this does not materially affect the analysis. The combined total is correctly calculated as $18.6 billion (vs. $18.68 billion), again reflecting minor rounding. LLY's figures ($1.88 billion in 2021, $1.37 billion in 2020) are exact, and the increase of $0.51 billion (≈37%) matches the ground truth $509.5 million (37.1%) when rounded. JNJ’s growth rate of 11.3% is exact. (2) Completeness: The answer addresses both parts of the question—combined revenue and comparative growth rates—fully. (3) Entity Accuracy: Companies (JNJ and LLY), metric (Immunology revenue), and years (2020–2021) are correctly identified. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop synthesis across both companies and years is sound. The comparison of growth rates is logically presented, concluding correctly that LLY’s growth outpaced JNJ’s. (5) Semantic Equivalence: Despite slight rounding in JNJ’s revenue and the combined total, the meaning and factual content are equivalent. The use of ≈37% for LLY’s growth is appropriate given the actual 37.1%. Overall, the answer demonstrates strong factual accuracy, correct reasoning, and full relevance.",

In contrast, Tesla does not disclose a present value for its operating leases and instead reports gross lease receivables of $4,577 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the key conceptual difference in lease accounting disclosures between HD and Tesla—HD reports the present value of its operating lease liabilities, while Tesla discloses gross lease receivables as a lessor. This correctly highlights the incomparability due to discounting vs. undiscounted amounts. However, there are significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, HD’s present value is $6,183 million (correctly stated as $6.183 billion), derived from total lease payments of $7,095 million minus $912 million in imputed interest. The LLM answer omits this breakdown entirely. More critically, the LLM incorrectly states Tesla’s operating lease receivables as $1.024 billion (and total gross lease receivables as $4.577 billion), whereas the ground truth specifies that Tesla reports $4,577 million in gross lease receivables—this appears to be a mischaracterization of the metric (possibly confusing total with operating portion) and misattribution of $1.024 billion, which is not in the original answer. (2) The numbers are partially correct: HD’s $6.183 billion is accurate, but Tesla’s figures are not aligned with the ground truth. The original does not mention $1.024 billion, so this is an error. The $4.577 billion figure is correctly cited in magnitude but mislabeled—ground truth says this is the total gross lease receivables, not broken into operating vs. finance, while LLM implies $1.024B is operating and $4.577B is total, which is not supported in the original. (3) The reasoning is sound in recognizing that comparing a discounted liability (HD) with a gross receivable (Tesla) undermines comparability. However, the LLM fails to note that Tesla does not report a liability at all, which is a key point in the original. Also, the multi-hop synthesis is incomplete—while it pulls data from both companies, it misrepresents Tesla’s disclosure. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to correct conceptual framework but significant factual errors in Tesla’s numbers and misrepresentation of the nature of disclosures. Quantitative accuracy is 5 due to one correct number (HD) and one incorrect (Tesla). Qualitative accuracy is 7 because the logic and terminology are mostly appropriate, though incomplete.

      "original_answer": "COP uses the unit-of-production method to calculate DD&A for proved oil and gas properties, which relies on proved oil and gas reserve estimates made by internal reservoir engineers. In 2021, COP reported a net book value of $52 billion for proved oil and gas properties and recorded $7.0 billion in DD&A expense. XOM also uses the unit-of-production method to amortize acquisition costs of proved properties, based on total proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes.

The subtle difference in emphasis (COP on internal judgment, XOM on structured policy) is partially captured but not fully articulated, which prevents a perfect 10. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the impact of reserve estimates on COP’s DD&A and the comparison with XOM’s method.

For example, at the end of fiscal 2021, MO reported $190,082 million in long-term assets under ABI and $1,049 million under Other Investments.

However, the original answer emphasizes MO's specific classification of 'ABI' and 'Other Investments' with exact figures from fiscal 2021 ($190,082 million in ABI and $1,049 million in Other Investments), which the LLM answer omits. While the LLM correctly identifies MO’s use of 'Long-term equity-method investments' (which includes ABI), it does not explicitly name 'ABI' and 'Other Investments' as the two reported categories, nor does it provide the numerical breakdown, which is a key part of the ground truth. This omission affects completeness and qualitative accuracy, as the multi-hop synthesis is partially incomplete.

      "original_answer": "The difference in the net deferred income tax liabilities between MO ($3,744 million liability) and COST ($221 million liability) is $3,523 million. In COST's case, operating lease liabilities contribute $652 million to its deferred tax liabilities, which partially offsets its deferred tax assets. In MO's case, the deferred tax liabilities are significantly higher due to the treatment of intangible assets, which contribute $3,032 million to MO’s deferred tax liabilities, making MO’s net deferred tax liability significantly larger than COST’s.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024 Altria Group (MO) reported a net deferred‑income‑tax liability of about **$3.7 billion** (‑$3,744 million after the valuation‑allowance adjustment).  Costco (COST) reported a much smaller net deferred‑tax position – essentially a modest liability (or a net deferred‑tax asset) that is **roughly $3 billion less** than MO’s figure.\n\nThe contrast stems from the different temporary‑difference drivers each company records.  Costco’s operating‑lease arrangements create a right‑of‑use asset and a lease liability; the lease expense is deductible for tax purposes, producing a deferred‑tax **asset** that offsets much of any liability.  Altria, on the other hand, carries large intangible‑asset balances (goodwill, acquired intangibles, etc.), which give rise to taxable temporary differences and therefore a sizable deferred‑tax **liability**.

However, it inaccurately states COST's net deferred tax position as 'a modest liability (or a net deferred-tax asset)' when the ground truth specifies a $221 million liability. This mischaracterization affects quantitative precision. The LLM also fails to provide the exact difference of $3,523 million, instead rounding to 'roughly $3 billion less,' which omits precision.\n\n2) The calculation of the difference is approximately correct but not exact. $3,744M - $221M = $3,523M, which the LLM does not compute explicitly. Instead, it uses an approximation ('$3 billion less'), which, while directionally accurate, lacks the specificity required for full quantitative accuracy. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly frames COST’s operating lease impact: it states that lease expenses create a deferred tax *asset*, but the ground truth clarifies that operating lease liabilities contribute $652 million to deferred tax *liabilities* (not assets), due to temporary differences between book and tax treatment. This is a significant qualitative error in financial reasoning.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly attributes MO’s large deferred tax liability to intangible assets and contrasts it with COST’s lease accounting. However, it reverses the tax effect of operating leases for COST—stating they generate a deferred tax asset when in fact they contribute to liabilities. This undermines the explanation of the financial contrast, even though the overall direction (COST has lower net liability) is correct.\n\n4) Despite the error in the direction of the lease-related temporary difference, the LLM captures the core contrast: MO has large deferred tax liabilities from intangibles ($3,032 million per ground truth), while COST does not, leading to a large difference. The contextual relevance is high, and entity identification (COST, MO, 2024, correct metrics) is accurate.

This introduces entity ambiguity, though the data itself is correct. (4) Despite missing the percentage calculations and using slightly imprecise entity names, the answer includes all necessary data and is highly relevant. Thus, correctness and qualitative accuracy are reduced by two points due to incomplete synthesis and minor entity mislabeling, but quantitative and contextual scores remain high.",

However, it incorrectly claims that DIS's 2023 Theme Parks revenue is not disclosed in the provided excerpts, which contradicts the ground truth that such data exists and is known. The ground truth states that the combined revenue is $16,488 million, implying DIS's 2023 Theme Parks revenue is $7,588 million ($16,488M - $8,900M). The LLM fails to provide this number or the correct growth comparison. (2) Quantitatively, CMCSA figures are accurate ($8.9B in 2023, up from $7.5B), but DIS revenue and growth ($1,096 million increase, 10.0%) are omitted, leading to incomplete and partially incorrect synthesis. The calculation for CMCSA’s growth is approximately correct (~18%), though slightly rounded down. (3) The reasoning is flawed because the model claims insufficient data when, in the context of the knowledge graph, DIS’s Theme Parks revenue must be available to generate the ground truth answer. The failure to retrieve or acknowledge DIS’s revenue breaks the multi-hop synthesis required to compute the combined total and compare growth rates. (4) Scores reflect partial correctness on CMCSA data but major omissions on DIS, resulting in a low correctness score. Quantitative accuracy is moderate due to correct CMCSA numbers but missing DIS data. Qualitative accuracy is low due to failure in multi-hop reasoning. Contextual relevance is moderate as the response addresses the topic but incorrectly limits itself to 'excerpts provided' despite being expected to use the full knowledge graph.",

The ground truth states Chevron's net developed acreage in 'Other Americas' for 2024 is 5 thousand acres, but the LLM claims it is 232 thousand acres. Similarly, ExxonMobil's gross-to-net ratio is stated in the ground truth as 379 gross to 190 net (approximately 2.0), but the LLM uses a completely different ratio of 1,903/1,342 ≈ 1.418.

It incorrectly reports LLY's 2021 oncology revenue as approximately $5.74 billion (by summing $3.0 billion U.S. and $2.7 billion outside U.S.), which is nearly double the ground truth value of $3.0288 billion. This leads to an incorrect combined revenue of $20.3 billion instead of the correct $17.5288 billion. The JNJ oncology revenue of $14.5 billion is correct, and the 17.6% YoY growth is accurate. The reported ~8% growth for LLY is close to the actual 8.5%, so this qualitative trend is reasonably accurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the LLY revenue figure is wrong, and the sum of $14.5B + $5.74B = $20.3B is therefore incorrect. The breakdown of LLY's revenue into U.S. and outside U.S. appears fabricated or misattributed, as no such split is in the ground truth and the total does not match. (3) The reasoning correctly identifies the need to sum oncology revenues from both companies and compare growth dynamics, but fails in the multi-hop synthesis by using incorrect source data for LLY. While it correctly notes JNJ’s growth drivers (DARZALEX, ERLEADA, IMBRUVICA) and LLY’s moderate growth, it misses the key point that LLY’s growth was tempered by Alimta’s decline, which is a critical differentiator in growth dynamics. Instead, it generalizes LLY’s growth as 'modest, broadly-based' without acknowledging the offsetting forces. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question (combined revenue and growth differences) and uses appropriate terminology. However, due to major numerical inaccuracies, especially in LLY’s revenue, the correctness score is low despite partially correct reasoning and qualitative trends.",

In contrast, MDT values private equity investments using year-end net asset values of partnerships, with unfunded commitments totaling $204 million as of April 29, 2022, and an estimated liquidation period of one to 15 years. MDT’s methodology may affect its ability to rebalance asset allocations closer to targets over the intermediate term, especially given the strong equity performance during the fiscal year.

While it correctly identifies DHR's valuation methods (market multiples, third-party appraisals, quoted prices) and MDT's use of year-end net asset value (NAV) with a 1–15 year liquidation period, it fabricates or misstates key financial figures for pension contributions. According to the ground truth, DHR’s 2022 pension contributions are $10M (U.S.) and $48M (non-U.S.). The LLM correctly reports these numbers for DHR but incorrectly attributes a $14M post-retirement contribution to DHR, which is not mentioned in the original answer. For MDT, the ground truth states unfunded commitments of $204M as of April 29, 2022, but does not specify actual 2022 pension contributions. However, the LLM invents MDT’s 2022 discretionary contributions as $24M U.S. and $70M non-U.S. (total $94M), which are not supported by the original answer. These numbers are entirely fabricated, severely undermining quantitative accuracy.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the LLM introduces unsupported figures: MDT’s $24M and $70M contributions do not appear in the ground truth. The original answer does not state any actual contribution amounts for MDT in 2022—only unfunded commitments of $204M. The LLM incorrectly equates unfunded commitments with actual contributions and assigns arbitrary splits. Additionally, the $14M post-retirement contribution for DHR is not in the original answer. Only DHR’s $10M and $48M figures are correct.\n\n3) Qualitatively, the LLM captures the core contrast in valuation methodologies: DHR uses market-based approaches (market multiples, appraisals), while MDT relies on NAV with a long liquidation horizon. It correctly infers that MDT’s approach implies lower liquidity. However, it mischaracterizes the implications: the original answer notes MDT’s challenge in rebalancing asset allocations due to illiquidity and strong equity performance, but the LLM incorrectly concludes that MDT made larger contributions because of illiquidity—this causal link is not supported. The original answer does not compare actual contribution sizes or suggest that illiquidity led to higher contributions. Thus, the reasoning is partially flawed.\n\n4) Contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses the question’s core: comparing valuation methodologies and their impact on liquidity and contribution planning. It correctly identifies the companies, the nature of the investments, and the general implications for liquidity. However, the introduction of false numerical data and incorrect causal reasoning reduces overall correctness.

In contrast, PayPal disclosed a net charge-off rate of 4.5% in 2024, which is a significant decrease from 7.2% in 2023, showing improved credit performance. The difference of 1.38 percentage points in their 2024 net charge-off rates highlights opposing trends in credit risk management and loan portfolio quality between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s consumer‑loan net charge‑off rate fell sharply to **4.5% in 2024** (down from 7.2% in 2023), indicating a marked improvement in credit quality. In contrast, PayPal’s consumer‑loan net charge‑off rate rose to **2.10% in 2024** (up from 1.76% in 2023), showing a deterioration in its portfolio performance. Thus, while Capital One is experiencing better credit outcomes, PayPal is seeing weaker credit performance in its consumer loans.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors. It incorrectly states that Capital One's net charge-off rate fell to 4.5% in 2024 from 7.2% in 2023, when in fact Capital One's rate increased to 5.88% in 2024 from a lower 2023 level (a 131 basis point increase). Conversely, it claims PayPal's rate rose to 2.10% in 2024, when in reality PayPal's rate dropped significantly to 4.5% in 2024 from 7.2% in 2023. These errors completely reverse the actual trends. (2) The numbers are entirely incorrect: Capital One's 2024 rate is misstated as 4.5% instead of 5.88%, and PayPal's 2024 rate is misstated as 2.10% instead of 4.5%. The year-over-year changes are also wrong—LLM claims Capital One improved and PayPal deteriorated, but the truth is the opposite. The difference in 2024 rates (5.88% vs 4.5%) is 1.38 percentage points, but LLM implies a much larger gap due to incorrect figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the direction of credit trends—Capital One is deteriorating, PayPal is improving. The conclusion about contrasting trends is based on reversed data, leading to an incorrect interpretation. (4) The contextual relevance is partially maintained as the answer addresses credit performance trends in consumer loan portfolios for both companies, but the factual foundation is so inaccurate that the analysis is invalid. Hence, correctness and quantitative accuracy are near zero; qualitative accuracy is low due to incorrect logic; relevance is minimal but present in structure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified the companies (DUK and NEE), the metric (cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized), and the years (2022 and 2023), satisfying entity and contextual accuracy. The 2022 combined total of $1,921 million is correct, matching the ground truth. However, the 2023 combined total is incorrect: the LLM reports $2,991 million, while the ground truth is $3,009 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect individual values—LLM reports Duke Energy (DUK) as $528 million (should be $546 million) and NextEra Energy (NEE) as $2,463 million (should be $2,463 million is actually correct per ground truth breakdown, but DUK’s value is wrong). Wait: rechecking—ground truth combined is $3,009 million. If NEE is $2,463 million, then DUK must be $546 million (3,009 - 2,463 = 546), but LLM says DUK 2023 is $528 million, which is incorrect. So DUK 2023 is wrong ($528M vs $546M), NEE 2023 is correct ($2,463M), leading to incorrect total ($2,991M vs $3,009M). The 2022 values are correctly reported: DUK $546M, NEE $1,375M, sum $1,921M. (2) Calculations: The LLM computes a $1.07 billion increase (2,991 - 1,921 = 1,070), but the correct increase is $1,088 million. The percentage increase is not provided in the LLM answer, though implied as 'roughly $1.07 billion'. The ground truth specifies 56.6%, which the LLM omits. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly synthesizes data across two companies and two years, showing comparative trends. It correctly notes Duke’s slight decrease and NextEra’s large increase, which aligns with ground truth logic (though DUK’s 2023 value is misstated, leading to incorrect directional analysis—LLM says DUK fell, but if DUK was $546M in both years, it was flat). Actually, if ground truth DUK 2023 is $546M and 2022 is $546M, then no change—but LLM says $528M in 2023, implying a drop that didn’t occur. So directional analysis is flawed due to incorrect input. (4) Scores justified: Correctness 7 due to mostly accurate data but key error in DUK 2023 value causing incorrect total and misleading trend analysis. Quantitative accuracy 7: 2022 total correct, NEE 2023 correct, but DUK 2023 wrong, leading to wrong sum and delta. Qualitative accuracy 8: reasoning structure is sound, entities correct, but flawed input leads to incorrect conclusion. Contextual relevance 10: fully addresses the question scope and format.",

      "original_answer": "In both audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP evaluated the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by inquiring about changes in regulatory orders and comparing recorded balances to independently developed expectations. At Duke Energy (DUK), auditors performed trend analyses and obtained management representations asserting the probability of recovery. For Southern Company Gas (SO), auditors extended these procedures by reading regulatory orders from multiple states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia), inspecting regulatory filings for intervenor challenges, and testing the completeness and accuracy of capitalized project costs. The regulatory uncertainties evaluated for SO included the risk that the Commissions might not approve full recovery of incurred costs or invested capital, and potential future rate reductions or refunds, which could significantly impact financial recoverability.",
      "llm_answer": "Duke Energy’s auditors relied on a relatively focused set of procedures – they inquired of management about any changes in regulatory orders and the related asset balances, judged those changes against their knowledge of commission‑approved amortization, expected incurred costs and recently approved orders, performed trend‑analysis and compared the recorded balances to an independently‑developed expectation, and obtained management representations that the assets were probable of recovery (pages 104‑110).  \n\nSouthern Company Gas’s auditors performed a broader, more control‑oriented approach – they tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over evaluating recovery of costs and potential refunds, read and analyzed the actual regulatory orders, statutes, memoranda and intervenor filings, inspected pending regulatory filings for contradictory evidence, tested selected capitalized costs for completeness, and obtained management representations (page 183).  \n\nBoth audits examined the uncertainty that future commission decisions might limit recovery – Duke focused on the impact of new or changed regulatory orders and amortization assumptions, while Southern Company Gas evaluated the risk that commissions would not approve full cost recovery, could disallow portions of recent plant costs, or require refunds or rate reductions, all of which could affect future recoverability of the regulatory asset balances.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing derived 86% of its revenue in 2021 from fixed-price contracts, which exposes it to cost overruns and estimation risks. Lockheed Martin explicitly states that fixed-price contracts, especially for complex development programs, increase financial risk because cost and timing are difficult to estimate, often leading to losses. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin notes that bidding on cost-reimbursable development work with follow-on fixed-price production options increases the risk of lower margins or losses because contractors must estimate production costs before development is complete. Given Boeing’s heavy reliance on fixed-price contracts, this exposure significantly amplifies the financial risks Lockheed Martin describes, particularly in environments where cost estimation is inherently uncertain and inflationary pressures may further compress margins.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing reported that 86 % of its 2021 revenue came from fixed‑price contracts ( page 129 ). Lockheed Martin warns that fixed‑price development contracts are “difficult to estimate… technical challenges, costs and timing… increase the financial risk to the contractor” and have already produced “losses on certain fixed‑price development programs” that could recur ( page 17 ). Because such a large share of Boeing’s revenue is locked into fixed‑price terms, any cost‑estimation error or schedule problem—exactly the risks Lockheed Martin describes—can turn a substantial portion of Boeing’s earnings into reduced margins or outright losses, magnifying the company’s overall financial exposure.",

Similarly, IBM's 2022 10-K filing notes that 'if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers... could be impacted.'

      "original_answer": "Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) both highlight the importance of refining margins in influencing their earnings. According to Chevron's 2024 10-K filing, changes in refining, marketing, and chemicals margins are among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil specifically notes that its Energy Products segment earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins, which decreased in 2024 to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010–2019). This decline in refining margins would directly impact ExxonMobil’s earnings, as refining margins are a function of the difference between raw material costs and product prices, which are influenced by global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and other market dynamics. Since both companies depend on refining margins, the volatility in this financial metric affects their earnings outlooks, with ExxonMobil experiencing a measurable decline in margins that would constrain profitability, while Chevron's forward-looking projections become more uncertain due to this sensitivity.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Caterpillar's (CAT) accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits as $2.8 billion, which aligns closely with the ground truth value of $2,757 million (rounded appropriately). However, the LLM states that Union Pacific (UNP) does not show a separate 'accrued wages' line, while the ground truth explicitly reports UNP's accrued wages as $50 million. This omission or misrepresentation of UNP’s actual disclosed amount is a factual shortcoming, though the qualitative interpretation about it being small or possibly combined is reasonable. (2) The numbers are mostly accurate—$2.8 billion is an acceptable rounding of $2,757 million. However, the failure to report UNP’s $50 million figure, even if not separately broken out in the excerpt, reduces quantitative precision. The LLM should have either cited the $50 million if available in the source or clarified uncertainty, but instead inferred absence. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly compares the two companies’ year-end accrued liabilities and draws plausible inferences about workforce size, compensation structure, and payroll timing. It synthesizes across filings and interprets structural differences in reporting practices, which shows sound qualitative analysis. (4) The contextual relevance is excellent—the answer directly addresses the question about compensation structures and payroll cycle timing. Despite missing the exact UNP number, the reasoning remains logically consistent with the data pattern. The correctness score is 8 due to the minor but notable omission of UNP’s $50 million figure, which affects full factual completeness, though core insights remain valid.",

      "original_answer": "The combined value of lease assets obtained by NVDA and TXN in their most recent fiscal years is $476 million ($266 million for NVDA in 2022 and $210 million for TXN in 2021). The total operating cash flows used for operating leases in the same periods is $223 million ($154 million for NVDA in 2022 and $69 million for TXN in 2021). Therefore, the lease assets obtained exceeded the operating cash flows used for operating leases by $253 million.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022 NVIDIA recorded $266 million of lease assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities, while Texas Instruments recorded $210 million of such assets for fiscal 2021, giving a combined total of **$476 million**. The same periods show operating cash‑flows used for operating leases of $154 million (NVIDIA) and $61 million (TXN), or **$215 million** together. Thus, the combined lease‑asset acquisitions exceed the combined operating‑lease cash outflows by roughly **$261 million**.",

However, the operating cash flows used for operating leases contain an error: the LLM reports $61M for TXN instead of the correct $69M, leading to an incorrect combined total of $215M instead of $223M. This results in a miscalculated difference of $261M instead of the correct $253M. (2) Number verification: NVDA lease assets = $266M (correct), TXN lease assets = $210M (correct), sum = $476M (correct). NVDA operating lease cash flow = $154M (correct), TXN = $61M (incorrect, should be $69M), sum = $215M (incorrect), difference = $476M - $215M = $261M (incorrect due to prior error). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesized data across two companies and different fiscal years, and performed the required comparisons. The logic and structure follow the question’s requirements. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 7 due to the significant but isolated numerical error in TXN's operating lease cash flow affecting downstream calculations. Quantitative accuracy is 7 because most numbers are correct but one key figure and the final difference are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 8 due to correct entity and metric identification, proper fiscal year alignment, and logical flow.

However, it incorrectly states that PG's Personal Health Care segment had a 'low-teens' (10-12%) increase, whereas the original answer specifies 'high-teens' growth, which typically means 16-19%. This is a significant factual error in quantitative precision. (2) The numbers for PEP are accurate (38%), but the attribution of 'low-teens' to PG contradicts the 'high-teens' in the ground truth, making the comparison misleading. The LLM's claim that PG had only 10-12% growth is not supported by the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM correctly pulls data for both companies and the correct fiscal year (2022) and compares them directly. However, the incorrect characterization of PG's growth undermines the validity of the synthesis.

Johnson & Johnson’s Neuroscience revenue increased by 7.1% from 2020 to 2021. Eli Lilly’s total Neuroscience revenue decreased from $487.3 million (U.S.) + $1,344.0 million (Outside U.S.) = $1,831.3 million in 2020 to $1,898.5 million in 2021, representing a 3.7% increase.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in both revenue totals and percentage changes. While Johnson & Johnson's 2021 Neuroscience revenue is correctly stated as $7,011 million, the LLM incorrectly reports Eli Lilly's total Neuroscience revenue as $614.8 million, which is only the U.S. portion. The correct total for Eli Lilly is $1,898.5 million ($614.8M U.S. + $1,283.7M Outside U.S.), but the LLM omits the international revenue entirely. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $7.63 billion instead of the correct $8.9095 billion. (2) The percentage change for Eli Lilly is severely miscalculated: the LLM claims a 26% increase, but the correct growth is 3.7% (from $1,831.3M in 2020 to $1,898.5M in 2021). The LLM likely calculated growth using only U.S. revenue or made an arithmetic error. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson’s 7.1% growth is correctly reported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not synthesize Eli Lilly’s U.S. and international revenue streams, nor did it correctly compute year-over-year changes for both companies. The conclusion that Eli Lilly had a higher growth rate is factually wrong—the opposite is true. (4) Despite these major errors, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses all parts of the question, using appropriate terminology and structure.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GM experienced a $1.7 billion increase in finance charge income and a $0.3 billion increase in investment income, both primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates. However, this also led to a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense due to higher effective interest rates on debt. Meanwhile, Starbucks reported that changes in fair value due to benchmark interest rates affected $350 million of its August 2029 notes, which were hedged using interest rate swaps. Therefore, while GM benefited from higher interest rates on income-generating assets, it faced higher financing costs, and SBUX actively managed interest rate exposure through hedging instruments.",

However, it fails to mention GM's $1.8 billion increase in interest expense, a critical part of the financial impact. For SBUX, the LLM introduces specific losses—$18.7 million on the swap and $12.3 million on hedged debt—that are not present in the ground truth. Instead, the original answer states that $350 million of Starbucks' August 2029 notes were hedged using interest rate swaps and were affected by changes in fair value due to benchmark rate changes, but no loss amounts are specified. Thus, the LLM fabricates precise figures not supported by the source. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised because while GM's numbers are correct, SBUX's are not only absent in the ground truth but also presented with false precision. There is no verification for the $18.7M and $12.3M losses. (3) The reasoning correctly attributes higher rates to increased income for GM and recognizes SBUX's use of interest rate swaps for hedging, showing partial multi-hop synthesis. However, it misrepresents the nature of SBUX's exposure and outcome by implying realized losses without evidence, weakening the logical fidelity. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies and the impact of benchmark rate changes on financial revenue and hedging strategy.

These numbers match the ground truth exactly, and the calculation is correct. However, the LLM mischaracterizes Union Pacific's $50 million as a 'deferred-tax asset for accrued wages,' which is factually incorrect — the original answer specifies it as 'Accrued Wages,' not a deferred tax item. This mislabeling introduces a significant qualitative error in entity/metric identification. (2) The quantitative values and sum are accurate: $2,757M + $50M = $2,807M. The comparison stating the combined total is about $50 million (≈2%) higher than Caterpillar’s alone is mathematically sound and semantically equivalent to saying Caterpillar dominates the total. However, the ground truth emphasizes that Caterpillar accounts for ~98.2% of the total, while the LLM focuses on the incremental $50M (2%), which is valid but shifts emphasis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning — combining data from two companies — is correctly executed, but the reasoning is undermined by the incorrect characterization of Union Pacific’s line item. This affects the qualitative accuracy of the synthesis.

According to the ground truth, ADBE's net value is $2,030 million, not $1,490 million, and ORCL's net value is $21,536 million, not $17,258 million. The LLM incorrectly uses gross values as net values—$1,490 million and $17,258 million are the gross amounts in the ground truth, not net. The combined net value is therefore wrong: LLM reports ~$18.7 billion (which matches $1,490 + $17,258), but the correct sum is $2,030 + $21,536 = $23,566 million, not $18,758 million as stated in the original answer. However, the original ground truth itself appears internally inconsistent: it states the combined net value is $18,758 million, but ADBE net ($2,030M) + ORCL net ($21,536M) = $23,566M, which is a discrepancy. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth. Despite this, the LLM uses the gross values as if they were net, which is a factual misinterpretation. (2) The calculation of the combined value is numerically consistent with the numbers the LLM cites ($1,490M + $17,258M ≈ $18.7B), but those numbers are mislabeled: they are gross, not net. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the LLM correctly identifies both companies, the relevant asset category, and the year, and synthesizes across them. The qualitative comparison about Oracle’s larger infrastructure due to cloud and hardware operations vs Adobe’s software focus is reasonable and aligns with the intent of the question. (4) Due to major quantitative inaccuracies (swapping gross and net values), the correctness score is reduced to 6. Quantitative accuracy is low (5) due to incorrect numbers. Qualitative accuracy is higher (7) because the reasoning and entity identification are sound.

While NextEra Energy’s value of $2,909 million is correctly reported, the incorrect Duke Energy figure undermines the entire calculation. (2) The breakdown of Duke Energy’s liabilities into commodity, interest-rate, and foreign-currency components ($434M + $4M + $40M) appears detailed but is not supported by the ground truth and introduces unverified data, further reducing accuracy.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures. It reports Duke Energy's (DUK) cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized, as $1,104 million, whereas the ground truth is $954 million. This is a material overstatement of $150 million. NextEra Energy's (NEE) figure is correct at $1,034 million. The combined total is therefore incorrect: $2,138 million vs. the correct $1,988 million, a difference of $150 million. (2) The percentage calculations are also flawed. For DUK, the LLM states that interest payments represent 'about 12%' of net cash provided by operating activities. However, using the correct numbers ($954M / $4,118M), the actual percentage is 23.17%, as stated in the ground truth. The LLM's 12% is less than half the correct value. For NEE, the LLM reports 'about 12.5%', which is close to the correct 12.46% and can be considered approximately accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—aggregating interest payments and comparing them to operating cash flows—but fails due to incorrect input data for DUK. The model appears to have used an incorrect numerator or denominator for DUK's percentage, undermining the synthesis. (4) Despite these major quantitative errors, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses all parts of the question: total cash paid, individual breakdowns, and percentage comparisons. The reasoning framework is logical, and NEE's data is accurate. However, the severe inaccuracies in DUK's interest payment and resulting percentage significantly reduce correctness. The correctness_score is 3 due to major factual and calculation errors; quantitative_accuracy is 3 due to wrong numbers and percentages; qualitative_accuracy is 4 because the reasoning approach is valid but based on flawed data; contextual_relevance is 8 because the structure and intent align well with the question.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing's initial liability balance decreased from $652 million in 2020 to $11 million in 2021, showing a significant reduction in liability exposure over that period. In contrast, LMT warns that a $100 million increase in environmental liabilities would result in an $87 million probable future recovery and a $13 million charge to earnings, indicating potential for increasing liability exposure depending on regulatory changes. This suggests Boeing experienced a declining liability trend while LMT faces potential liability growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin’s 2021 filing only notes that its environmental‑remediation liabilities could rise – it says that “if substantially lower standards … are adopted … we expect a material increase in our estimates for environmental liabilities.” No dollar amount is disclosed, but the language signals a **potential upward‑adjustment** to the liability.  \n\nBoeing, by contrast, shows a concrete decline in its severance‑related liability: the “initial liability recorded in the second quarter of 2020” was **$652 million**, and by year‑end 2021 the balance had fallen to essentially zero (ending balance $11 million), a reduction of roughly **$640 million**.  \n\nThus, while Boeing’s exposure is clearly shrinking, Lockheed Martin is indicating that its environmental‑liability exposure may be **increasing**, suggesting opposite trends in the two companies’ financial risk profiles.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Boeing's initial liability of $652 million in 2020 and the ending balance of $11 million in 2021, accurately reflecting a reduction of approximately $641 million (stated as $640 million, which is acceptably close). This matches the ground truth quantitatively. For LMT, while no specific dollar amount for current liabilities is provided, the answer correctly captures the forward-looking risk: a potential increase in environmental liabilities due to regulatory changes, with a qualitative reference to material increases if lower standards are adopted. It does not include the specific hypothetical $100M increase and $13M charge mentioned in the ground truth, but it still conveys the core idea of potential liability growth.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent: all numbers (652M, 11M) and timeframes (2020–2021) are correct. The implied reduction (~$640M) is a valid approximation of the actual $641M decrease. No calculation errors.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Boeing’s actual declining liability trend with LMT’s disclosed risk of increasing exposure. It synthesizes information from both companies’ filings and draws a valid comparative conclusion about opposite financial exposure trends.\n\n4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses the question’s comparative nature. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of LMT’s specific hypothetical example ($100M liability increase → $13M charge), which would have strengthened the quantitative linkage. However, the qualitative warning about potential increases is clearly stated, preserving the essential meaning. Thus, the answer is semantically equivalent in intent and conclusion, warranting a high correctness score.",

However, it fails to provide META's figures, claiming they are not in the excerpts, while the ground truth clearly includes META's 2024 value of $70,663 million and 2023 value of $47,428 million. This omission prevents the calculation of the combined total and META's increase, which are central to the question. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers provided for VZ are accurate (allowing for format variation: $22.979 billion = $22,979 million), but the absence of META's data means the combined total ($93,642 million) and META's increase ($23,235 million) are missing. The partial calculation for VZ is correct but incomplete. (3) The reasoning is flawed in the multi-hop aspect: the question requires synthesizing data from both META and VZ across two years. By failing to retrieve or acknowledge META's data, the model breaks the chain of reasoning and cannot address the comparison between the two companies' changes. The claim that Meta's data is not disclosed is inconsistent with the ground truth, indicating a failure in information extraction or synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses part of the question (VZ's performance) and correctly interprets the metric and time frame, but it does not fulfill the core requirement of combining both companies' data or comparing their changes.

      "original_answer": "General Motors experienced a $1.7 billion increase in finance charge income and a $0.3 billion increase in investment income due to higher benchmark interest rates in 2023. However, this was offset by a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense on debt, also driven by higher benchmark interest rates. On the other hand, Starbucks actively hedges against changes in benchmark interest rates using interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to mitigate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. This shows that while both companies are exposed to benchmark interest rate fluctuations, GM experiences both positive and negative financial impacts, whereas Starbucks proactively manages its exposure through hedging instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "- **General Motors:**  The 2023 filing explains that higher benchmark rates lifted the “effective yield” on GM Financial’s portfolio, adding $1.7 billion of finance‑charge income and $0.3 billion of investment income, but they also drove a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense because the cost of debt rose with the benchmark rate (effective interest rate rose from 3.1 % to 4.7 %).  The net result was a $1.1 billion decline in GM’s adjusted EBT for the year (GM 10‑K p. 37).  \n\n- **Starbucks:**  Starbucks hedges the impact of benchmark‑rate movements on future debt issuances with interest‑rate swap agreements and treasury‑lock contracts (Starbucks 10‑K p. 48).  Its sensitivity analysis shows that a 100‑basis‑point increase in the underlying rate would reduce the fair value of its long‑term debt by roughly $943 million (net of a $15 million swap effect), illustrating how the swaps are used to offset the valuation impact of rate changes (Starbucks 10‑K p. 49).",

Together, these approaches suggest that while COP's methodology smooths price volatility, it may mask the longer-term effects of sustained low prices, which XOM explicitly identifies as a risk that could reduce both the level and timing of proved reserves. This creates a potential misalignment in how each company accounts for price volatility in reserve estimation.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies base their reserve valuations on price assumptions that smooth short‑term market moves, but that smoothing can mask rapid price swings. ConocoPhillips explicitly uses “12‑month average prices” (see its reserve‑valuation methodology) to calculate discounted cash‑flows, which can lag behind sudden price drops or spikes; ExxonMobil notes that its proved‑reserve cash‑flow estimates are “highly sensitive to extended periods of low prices” (XOM 10‑K p. 176). Consequently, in a volatile price environment the 12‑month average may overstate the value of COP’s reserves, while XOM’s reserves can be quickly de‑valued by a sustained downturn, making both companies’ reserve estimates less accurate and reliable under such conditions.",

There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. (2) The LLM correctly cites XOM’s 10-K page 176 as the source for its sensitivity statement, demonstrating accurate entity and document referencing. (3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes the implications: COP’s averaging smooths volatility but may lag real-time changes, while XOM faces risks from prolonged low prices affecting reserve valuations. The conclusion that both companies’ estimates may be less accurate under volatile conditions is logically sound and consistent with the original. (4) However, the LLM omits the point about XOM’s concern regarding capital spending and partners’ funding ability for joint projects, which is a specific mechanism by which low prices affect reserves. This missing nuance slightly weakens the completeness of the multi-hop synthesis. Also, the original emphasizes a 'potential misalignment' in methodologies, a comparative insight slightly underdeveloped in the LLM response. Despite these minor omissions, the core facts, logic, and implications are correct, warranting a high score but not perfect due to incomplete synthesis of XOM's broader risk transmission mechanism.",

      "original_answer": "Charles Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities decreased from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021, yet interest revenue from these securities increased from $1,560 million to $4,537 million due to a significant rise in average balances from $58,181 million to $253,555 million. This contributed to the overall net interest revenue growth from $6,113 million in 2020 to $8,030 million in 2021, a $1,917 million increase. BNY Mellon, in its 10-K, highlights that it monitors net interest revenue closely as part of its financial outlook and risk management, noting its sensitivity to market trends such as interest rates and asset composition. Therefore, BNY Mellon would be strategically interested in understanding how shifts in asset yields and balances impact net interest revenue, as seen at Schwab, to better model and manage its own revenue streams under varying economic conditions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numbers. According to the ground truth, Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale (AFS) securities decreased from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021, but the LLM incorrectly states it fell from 1.78% to 1.30%, reversing the 2020 value and introducing an incorrect 2021 figure. The LLM also misstates the AFS securities balance, claiming it rose to $357 billion, whereas the ground truth reports average balances increasing from $58,181 million to $253,555 million (i.e., ~$253.6 billion), not $357 billion. While the LLM correctly notes net interest revenue increased from $6.1 billion to $8.0 billion (approximating the true values of $6,113M to $8,030M), it attributes the growth partly to 'higher yields on other assets such as receivables and loans,' which is not supported in the original answer and introduces unsupported speculation. (2) Calculations: The ≈31% increase in net interest revenue is roughly accurate (actual increase is ($8,030 - $6,113)/$6,113 ≈ 31.3%), so this calculation is acceptable. However, the core yield and balance figures underpinning the explanation are wrong, undermining the quantitative foundation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies the conceptual relationship—declining yields offset by balance sheet growth—and connects Schwab’s experience to BNY Mellon’s strategic interest in net interest revenue sensitivity. This synthesis across firms and forward-looking implications is logically sound and aligns with the question’s intent. (4) Despite correct high-level reasoning and contextual relevance to BNY Mellon’s risk management focus, the answer fails on core factual accuracy, especially regarding yields and asset balances, which are central to the analysis. These errors reduce confidence in the conclusion, even if the general direction of reasoning is plausible. Hence, correctness is scored low due to critical number inaccuracies, though qualitative reasoning and relevance are partially preserved.",

If DHR had used MDT's higher discount rate, its projected benefit obligation would have decreased significantly due to the inverse relationship between discount rates and pension liabilities.

The direction of the effect on projected benefit obligation (PBO) is correctly described—higher discount rate reduces PBO, lower rate increases it—but the magnitude and specific values are wrong. (2) The numbers are not accurate: the LLM reverses the relative levels of the rates, claiming DHR uses a higher rate than MDT when in fact MDT’s 13.10% is much higher than DHR’s 2.80%.

      "original_answer": "Duke Energy reports $91 million in Noncurrent Derivative Assets, while NextEra Energy reports $1,790 million for the same metric. This substantial difference indicates that NextEra Energy maintains a much larger portfolio of long-term derivative instruments, which are typically used to hedge against market risks such as commodity price fluctuations and interest rate changes. In contrast, Duke Energy’s smaller position suggests a more conservative or limited use of such instruments for long-term risk mitigation. While neither company explicitly states its risk management philosophy in these terms, the disparity in scale implies that NextEra Energy may be taking a more expansive approach to managing long-term financial exposures through derivatives.",

It also correctly provided the 2022 individual costs for CAT ($59 million) and UNP ($18 million). However, the LLM incorrectly calculated the prior-year combined cost as $77 million (should be $59M + $18M = $77M — this is actually correct mathematically, but the ground truth states the combined 2022 cost was $85 million, which contradicts the sum of the individual values given). This creates a discrepancy: if CAT was $59M and UNP $18M in 2022, the sum must be $77M, yet the ground truth claims $85M. Given this inconsistency in the ground truth, the LLM’s calculation of $77M is mathematically correct. However, the expected answer asserts $85M, so the evaluation must assume the ground truth is correct. Therefore, either the individual 2022 numbers or the combined total in the ground truth is wrong. Assuming the ground truth combined total ($85M) is correct, then the LLM’s use of $77M is incorrect, making its year-over-year difference ($9M increase) wrong — the correct difference is $1M. (2) The quantitative error stems from the prior-year sum: LLM computes $59M + $18M = $77M (correct arithmetic), but the ground truth says combined 2022 cost is $85M, which would require different component values. Since the LLM’s inputs for 2022 per company match the ground truth, but the sum does not, there is an internal inconsistency in the ground truth data. Despite this, the LLM is penalized for not matching the stated combined 2022 value of $85M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly pulled 2022 and 2023 values for both companies and attempted to compute totals and differences. The logic is correct, but based on inconsistent data. (4) Scores reflect that core data extraction is accurate (hence qualitative and contextual scores are moderate to high), but quantitative accuracy is reduced due to mismatch in the combined prior-year cost and resulting incorrect delta.

This contradicts the ground truth, which states that AMT *excludes* these items from segment gross margin. The LLM misrepresents the direction of the adjustment—AMT removes these costs to *present a higher* segment gross margin, not to reduce it.

DHR reported a net periodic pension benefit cost of $(32) for Non-U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022, while MDT reported a positive net periodic pension benefit cost of $37 for the same category. The difference in service costs—DHR's $(44) in 2022 versus MDT's $64 in 2022—contributes to the contrasting financial impacts, with MDT's higher service cost contributing to a positive net cost while DHR's lower service cost supports a net benefit.",

The combined total is accurately calculated as $5 million, matching the ground truth. Service costs are also correctly reported: DHR's service cost is implied to be low (though not explicitly quantified as $(44), which is in the original answer), while MDT's service cost is correctly stated as $64 million. 2) All calculations are accurate: $37 + (-$32) = $5 million. Number formats are consistent and acceptable ($32 million = $(32) in financial context). 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from both DHR and MDT filings is synthesized correctly. The explanation of how differing service costs influence the net result is logically coherent and aligns with pension accounting principles. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state DHR's service cost as $(44) million, instead referring to it generally as 'modest' or 'lower than MDT’s', which slightly reduces precision in qualitative analysis. 4) Despite this, the overall answer conveys the same financial conclusion and causal relationship as the ground truth.

It incorrectly attributes $471 million in residential mortgage loans with refreshed FICO < 620 to Bank of America (BAC), while the ground truth states BAC reported $2,156 million. Conversely, it assigns $2,156 million and $45 million to Charles Schwab (SCHW) for refreshed and updated FICO scores respectively, but the ground truth shows SCHW reported only $45 million total (for updated), and the $2,156 million figure belongs to BAC, not SCHW. (2) The calculation is mathematically correct ($471 + $2,156 + $45 = $2,672 million), but it is based on misattributed data and incorrectly includes both 'refreshed' and 'updated' for SCHW as additive, while the question asks for the total across both companies of loans with either refreshed or updated FICO < 620 — implying union, not summing both categories per company. However, the core error is the swap of the two main figures between BAC and SCHW. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly extract and attribute the data points to the correct institutions. It appears to have reversed the primary values between the two companies. Additionally, it treated 'refreshed' and 'updated' as separate categories to sum within SCHW, but the original answer suggests only one value per company was relevant.

Union Pacific’s disclosed Adjusted EBITDA of $11,458 million (page 32) does not make a comparable exclusion, so Caterpillar’s adjusted EBITDA is higher than its GAAP EBITDA by the amount of that pension/OPEB loss, making a straight‑line comparison with Union Pacific’s figure misleading.",

      "original_answer": "For AMT, competitive pressures from data center providers with greater financial resources and lower operating costs could force lease rate reductions to retain or attract customers, especially as a significant percentage of leases expire annually. Additionally, the adoption of new technologies like 5G or small cell networks could reduce demand for traditional tower-based services, further decreasing lease rates. For SPG, the risk of oversupply in the trade areas where their retail properties operate could similarly reduce market rents. Both companies face adverse effects on lease rates, but through different mechanisms—AMT through technology and competition, and SPG through real estate market dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower warns that intense competition from better‑known, lower‑cost data‑center operators and the rapid emergence of new power‑, cooling‑ and AI‑intensive technologies could force it to lower the rents it can command on its data‑center sites, especially as many leases expire each year. Simon Property Group, by contrast, is exposed to rent‑pressure that stems from an oversupply of retail space in its trade areas, which can depress market rents and therefore the rates it can achieve on new and renewed leases. Thus, AMT’s lease‑rate risk is driven mainly by competitive and technological dynamics, while SPG’s risk is rooted in excess retail supply that pushes market rents down.",

SPG's exposure to reduced market rents due to retail space oversupply is correctly identified. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes risks for two different companies (AMT and SPG) across distinct sectors (data centers vs. retail real estate), identifying different mechanisms (technology/competition vs. real estate supply dynamics) leading to similar outcomes (reduced lease rates). (4) The only minor deviation is that the LLM mentions 'AI-intensive technologies'—which is plausible but not in the original—while omitting '5G or small cell networks' as specific examples. However, this does not distort the overall meaning, as both relate to technological disruption. Wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence.

The Bank of America figure is exactly correct at $16,576 million. The Charles Schwab figure is reported as $322 million, whereas the ground truth is $323 million — a minor $1 million discrepancy, possibly due to rounding or data source variation. (2) The calculation is nearly accurate: $16,576M + $322M = $16,898M, which matches the LLM's stated total. The ground truth total is $16,899 million, so the difference is only $1 million. Given the scale (billions), this is a negligible error. Number formats are acceptable and consistent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound — the model correctly synthesizes data from two different institutions and financial instruments (revolving loans vs HELOCs) under the same credit score threshold and date. It correctly interprets 'amortized cost basis' and applies the FICO condition appropriately. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with only a minor numerical variance.

Verizon’s (VZ) use of asset-backed debt secured by receivables and participation interests is correctly described, as is the classification of proceeds in both short-term and long-term debt. The mention of repayment from restricted cash flows rather than general liquidity matches the structured approach in the original answer. (2) Quantitatively, the rounding of $7,467M to $7.5B and $9,477M to $9.5B is reasonable and common in financial reporting; no calculation errors are present. The implied $2B increase is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts T’s rising unsecured short-term debt with VZ’s structured, collateral-backed approach, drawing a valid conclusion about differing liquidity strategies. It synthesizes information across both companies and time periods, addressing the comparative aspect of the question. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addressing the implications for liquidity strategy, and accurately reflecting the risk profile of each company’s approach. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention of 'restricted cash and segregated accounts' (noted in ground truth), which slightly reduces completeness but does not impair the core accuracy. Hence, a high score of 9 is justified.",

This relationship connects to WMT's 10-K filing, which explicitly defines Sam's Club as one of Walmart's three reportable segments in its U.S. operations.

There are no calculations required beyond this reported figure, and the fiscal year (2023) is correct. (2) The answer addresses both parts of the multi-hop question: it identifies the revenue percentage from PEP's perspective and connects it to WMT's segment reporting. (3) Entity accuracy is perfect: 'Walmart Inc.', 'Sam’s Club', 'PepsiCo', and the correct fiscal year (2023) are all properly identified. (4) The reasoning is sound and demonstrates multi-hop synthesis: it correctly references PEP’s disclosure about sales to Walmart and then links it to WMT’s 10-K, which reports Sam’s Club as a standalone segment (alongside Walmart U.S. and International), thereby confirming its significance as a distinct business unit. The LLM correctly infers that sales to Sam’s Club are captured within that segment in WMT’s reporting. (5) Semantic equivalence is maintained: although phrased more concisely, the LLM conveys the same core information as the original answer, including the materiality of the customer relationship and the structural significance of Sam’s Club within Walmart.

This difference impacts the projected growth of pension obligations, as higher salary increases lead to larger future liabilities.

According to the ground truth, Duke Energy's accounts payable to affiliated companies decreased from -$42 million in 2023 to -$68 million in 2024, representing a $26 million decrease. However, the LLM incorrectly reports Duke Energy's figures as decreasing from $135 million to $67 million, a $68 million decrease—both the starting/ending values and the change are wrong. Southern Company’s numbers ($89M to $75M, a $14M decrease) are correct. (2) The calculation of the combined net change is therefore also incorrect: the LLM reports a combined decline of $82 million (based on $68M + $14M), but the correct combined change is $14 million ($26M decrease + $14M decrease = $40M total decrease, but since the original answer states the combined net change is $14M, this implies possible directional or definition nuances—however, the ground truth explicitly confirms the combined net change is $14M, not $40M or $82M). There is a discrepancy in interpretation or data sourcing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to extract data for both companies and sum the changes—but fails due to reliance on incorrect source data for Duke Energy.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial figures. It incorrectly states Chevron's depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) expense as $17.3 billion ($17,282 million), whereas the ground truth is $4,973 million—over three times lower. This leads to a completely wrong difference of $7.7 billion (LLM) vs. the correct $4,626 million (ground truth). Additionally, Chevron's total costs and expenses are reported as $175.3 billion in the LLM answer, but the correct value is $46,167 million ($46.2 billion), making the LLM figure nearly four times too high. ConocoPhillips' total costs and expenses are approximately correct at $43.3 billion (vs. $43,281 million). (2) Calculations are therefore invalid: the LLM computes percentages based on incorrect inputs. The correct difference in DD&A is $4,626 million, and the difference in total costs and expenses is $2,886 million ($46,167M - $43,281M), so the DD&A difference should represent ~160% of the total cost difference, but the original answer correctly calculates it as ~10.7% of the total cost *difference* (though this appears to be a misinterpretation of the intended comparison). However, the LLM instead computes the gap as a percentage of each company’s total costs—4% of Chevron’s (incorrectly using $175.3B) and 18% of COP’s—which is not what the question asks. The question asks how the *difference in DD&A* compares to the *difference in total costs*, not to each company’s total. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not compute the correct difference between the two companies’ DD&A or total cost figures, nor does it compare those differences as required. Instead, it misrepresents the data and performs an irrelevant analysis. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative inaccuracies (score 2), poor reasoning due to incorrect synthesis and logic (3), partial contextual relevance since it addresses the right companies and metric but with wrong data and interpretation (6), and overall low correctness (2) due to fundamental errors in core numbers and failure to answer the actual comparative question.",

The proportion is stated as 'roughly 7½%', which is semantically equivalent to 7.6% (since 7.5% is a reasonable rounding). NVDA's net revenue is cited as ~$26.9 billion, matching the ground truth of $26,914 million. (2) All calculations are accurate: $2,166M - $134M = $2,032M; $2,032M / $26,914M ≈ 7.55%, which rounds to 7.6%—the LLM's '7½%' is a valid approximation. Number formats vary but are equivalent (billion vs million, decimal vs fraction).

      "question": "What is the net difference between BAC's interest benefit in 2024 and MET's interest benefit in 2024, and how do these benefits reflect the companies' respective accruals or liabilities related to income taxes?",
      "original_answer": "The net difference between BAC's interest benefit of $9 million in 2024 and MET's interest benefit of $4 million in 2024 is $5 million. BAC's interest benefit is part of a broader accrual for interest and penalties related to income taxes, which stood at $105 million at December 31, 2024. MET's interest benefit of $4 million is included in other expenses and reflects its overall liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which could increase or decrease in the next 12 months due to potential U.S. federal tax legislation or regulatory changes. These benefits indicate that both companies actively manage tax-related accruals, but BAC maintains a significantly larger tax-related accrual, suggesting a more substantial exposure or conservative approach to tax liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Bank of America recorded an interest‑benefit of **$9 million** for 2024, while MetLife recorded an interest‑benefit of **$4 million** for 2024, giving a net difference of **$5 million** in favor of Bank of America.  \n\n‑ Bank of America’s benefit comes from the accrual of interest and penalties on its income‑tax liabilities (the company reported a $105 million accrual for such interest and penalties at year‑end).  \n\n‑ MetLife’s benefit is the interest accrued on its unrecognized tax‑benefit liability (interest expense‑benefit recorded in other expenses and a $29 million balance in other liabilities).",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM correctly identifies the interest benefits for BAC ($9 million) and MET ($4 million) in 2024, and accurately calculates the net difference as $5 million. These quantitative elements match the ground truth exactly, and formatting is acceptable. 2) However, there is a critical discrepancy in MET's liability amount: the LLM states MET's unrecognized tax benefit liability is $29 million, while the ground truth does not specify a dollar amount for the liability—only that it could change due to potential legislation. This introduces a factually incorrect detail not supported by the original answer. 3) The reasoning for BAC is accurate—linking the $9 million benefit to a $105 million accrual for interest and penalties at year-end aligns with the ground truth. For MET, the LLM correctly notes the benefit relates to unrecognized tax benefits and is recorded in other expenses, but adds an unsupported specific liability figure ($29 million), which undermines qualitative accuracy. 4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the numerical difference and the explanation of how benefits reflect tax accruals/liabilities. The synthesis across both companies is sound, but the inclusion of an incorrect specific liability for MET reduces overall correctness. Thus, while core facts and calculations are correct, the addition of unsupported detail lowers the score to 7.",

      "question": "How do the changes in indirect taxes impact both BKNG's general and administrative expenses and GM's potential settlement liabilities, and what specific business factors drive these effects in each company?",
      "original_answer": "For BKNG, indirect taxes increased general and administrative expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher travel transaction taxes and digital services taxes, which were driven by improved revenue performance. For GM, indirect taxes contributed to liabilities through potential retrospective recoveries and adjustments tied to unique events, such as recent Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting salaried workers in GMI. These differing business factors—BKNG's tax exposure from transaction-based growth and GM's legal and settlement-related tax impacts—show how indirect taxes influence each company's financial obligations through distinct operational and regulatory channels.",
      "llm_answer": "Booking Holdings says that its general‑and‑administrative costs rose in 2021 because, as revenue grew, the company incurred higher “indirect taxes such as travel‑transaction taxes and digital‑services taxes,” which are recorded as a component of G&A expense. In contrast, General Motors notes that a line item in its adjustments reflects a “potential settlement with certain third parties relating to retrospective recoveries of indirect taxes,” so changes in those taxes create a contingent liability rather than an operating expense. The drivers are therefore different: Booking’s tax increase is driven by higher transaction volume and revenue growth, while GM’s exposure stems from past tax‑recovery disputes and related legal rulings that could trigger settlement payments.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: BKNG's increase in general and administrative (G&A) expenses in 2021 due to indirect taxes (travel-transaction and digital-services taxes) tied to revenue growth is accurately reported. GM's contingent liability from potential settlement relating to retrospective recoveries of indirect taxes, particularly linked to legal rulings (implied Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting GMI), is also correctly conveyed. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) in either the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—dates (2021 vs. 2020) are correctly referenced. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between BKNG’s operational, revenue-driven tax exposure and GM’s legal/settlement-driven tax liabilities, synthesizing distinct financial impacts across two companies. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—while the LLM does not explicitly name the Korea Supreme Court decision, it accurately captures the essence of 'past tax-recovery disputes and legal rulings' as the driver for GM, which is sufficient for qualitative accuracy. The only minor shortcoming is slightly less specificity on the GMI (General Motors International) context, but the core reasoning and factual synthesis remain intact.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the Nike growth figure is off by 13 percentage points, and the calculated difference is 5 instead of 18, a major calculation error. The Starbucks number is correct. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—comparing two growth rates and computing the difference—but it is based on incorrect input data. The model fails to correctly synthesize the multi-hop information, likely due to retrieving an incorrect value for Nike’s growth.

      "original_answer": "PEP discusses 'other gains and losses' as a component of pension and retiree medical expense calculations, directly influenced by actuarial assumptions and market conditions. These gains and losses are part of the annual pension expense and can materially affect financial results due to significant management judgment involved. In contrast, WMT reports 'other (gains) and losses' as a separate line item in the income statement, with amounts of $1,538 million in 2023 and $3,027 million in 2024, directly impacting income before taxes.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth.

WMT's 'Other (gains) and losses' is correctly identified as a separate non-operating line item impacting pre-tax and net income but excluded from operating income. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: although the LLM answer does not explicitly state the dollar amounts ($1,538M in 2023 and $3,027M in 2024) mentioned in the ground truth, this omission does not detract from the core conceptual comparison being made, and no incorrect numbers are presented. The absence of specific figures is a minor completeness gap but not a factual error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across PEP and WMT, contrasting the financial statement presentation (embedded vs. separate line item), classification (operating vs. non-operating), and implications for operating performance. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—the LLM captures the essence that PEP’s items affect operating margins due to inclusion in pension expense within operating results, while WMT’s are non-operating and thus excluded from operating income, impacting only overall profitability. The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing the question’s focus on presentation and impact on operating performance. A score of 9 is justified due to the omission of WMT’s specific dollar amounts, which were present in the ground truth and could have strengthened completeness, but since the question emphasizes presentation and impact rather than specific values, this is a minor shortfall.",

(1) The individual interest payments are correctly stated: $158 million for DUK and $1,034 million for NEE, summing to the correct combined total of $1,192 million. (2) Capital expenditures are accurately reported: $939 million for DUK and $9,302 million for NEE. (3) The percentages are correctly calculated: $158M is approximately 168% of $939M (but the answer says 127%, which appears to be a typo/confusion in labeling — see below). However, the LLM states that the interest expense is 'about 13% of NEE’s capex' — this should be ~11.2% ($1,034M / $9,302M ≈ 11.1%), so '13%' is slightly off, possibly due to rounding or miscalculation. More critically, the LLM incorrectly attributes Duke Energy’s $939M capex to 'Duke Energy’s Ohio subsidiary', which is not supported by the ground truth and introduces entity-level inaccuracy. Additionally, it states that Duke’s capex is 'slightly lower than its $158 million interest charge' — this is incorrect because $939M > $158M; the interest is much smaller than capex for DUK. The correct comparison is that interest ($158M) is about 16.8% of DUK’s capex ($939M), not 127%. However, the original answer mistakenly claims the interest is 128% of DUK’s capex — which would only be true if capex were ~$123M — so there is confusion in the ground truth. Upon rechecking: the original answer says 'the interest expense represents about 128% of DUK’s capital expenditures' — this is factually wrong because $158M is not greater than $939M. Therefore, the ground truth contains an error. The LLM likely attempted to reverse the ratio and mislabeled it. Despite this, the LLM correctly identifies the direction of the comparison for NEE (interest much smaller than capex) and captures the contrast between the two companies’ financial profiles. Given that the core numbers are all correct, the synthesis is mostly sound, and the error appears to stem from a known inconsistency in the ground truth (the 128% claim), the LLM answer is largely correct with only minor reasoning flaws. Thus, quantitative accuracy is perfect; qualitative accuracy is slightly reduced due to misstatement of the DUK capex-interest ratio and incorrect subsidiary attribution; contextual relevance and completeness are full.",

While this detail may be factually accurate based on GE’s 10-K, it was not part of the original answer and changes the nature of the response by adding a comparative sensitivity analysis not requested. (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially correct—$12 million for Union Pacific is accurate, but the $50 million figure for GE, while possibly true, is extraneous and not verified against the ground truth, which only references GE’s disclosures generally without citing a specific dollar amount. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in linking actuarial assumption changes to pension expenses across companies, but the LLM overreaches by quantifying GE’s sensitivity when the original answer only uses GE to qualitatively illustrate the concept. The synthesis is logical but includes unsupported specifics. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses pension sensitivity to assumptions and ties in both Union Pacific and GE as required, but correctness is reduced due to the introduction of unverified, specific data about GE not present in the ground truth.

However, the LLM incorrectly adds the current portion again, calculating $36,195 million + $1,636 million = $37,831 million, which overstates PFE's total. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $55,881 million instead of the correct $54,245 million. ABT's value of $18,050 million is correctly stated. (2) Numeric values: ABT's total ($18,050M) is accurate; PFE's long-term debt ($36,195M) is accurate, but the addition of the current portion is redundant and incorrect. The final sum ($55,881M) is wrong due to flawed reasoning. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is pulled for both companies and the correct metric (total carrying amount including current portion) is targeted—but the synthesis fails because the model misunderstands that PFE's reported $36,195 million already includes the current portion.

The LLM claims NIKE's total revenue grew 5% to $46.7 billion, but the ground truth specifies a 6% increase on a currency-neutral basis, without providing an exact total revenue figure. This introduces a factual discrepancy in both percentage and absolute value. Additionally, the LLM states Starbucks had a '9% decline in total revenue,' which is not supported by the original answer—while international revenues were impacted, no such total revenue decline is mentioned.

      "original_answer": "The $5.00 billion note issued by NVDA in June 2021 led to a $52 million increase in interest expense (from $184 million in fiscal year 2021 to $236 million in fiscal year 2022). This increase in interest expense reflects the direct cost of borrowing. However, NVDA also reported $107 million in income from 'Other, net' in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by unrealized gains from investments in non-affiliated entities. This suggests that while the debt issuance increased financial costs, NVDA was able to offset some of that burden through investment gains. If TXN were to issue similar debt, they would face comparable interest costs, which could constrain financial flexibility by diverting funds from operations or capital investments. TXN’s ability to manage this burden would depend on their capacity to generate offsetting income streams, such as from investment gains or operational efficiencies, as NVDA did.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s FY 2022 filing shows that the $5 billion senior‑note issued in June 2021 added $52 million of interest expense (up from $184 million in FY 2021 to $236 million in FY 2022).  Even with that higher cost, “Other, net” was still a $107 million gain in FY 2022 (versus an immaterial amount in FY 2021), meaning the extra interest expense was more than offset by unrealised gains on non‑affiliated investments.  \n\nIf Texas Instruments were to issue a comparable $5 billion debt tranche under the same market conditions, the additional interest outflow would similarly erode its net‑of‑interest cash generation and could constrain the flexibility that TXN currently enjoys—its undrawn revolving credit facility and strong cash position—by diverting cash to service debt and limiting funds available for capital‑expenditure, acquisitions or shareholder returns.",

According to the ground truth, the difference in total lease cost changes is $109 million, but the LLM calculates $135 million. The LLM claims Costco's lease costs decreased from $692M to $602M (a $90M drop), implying an 13% decrease, but the ground truth indicates a smaller percentage decrease of 8.7%. Similarly, the LLM states Philip Morris’s lease costs increased from $403M to $448M (+$45M), while the ground truth implies a decrease of 6.7%, meaning lease costs should have gone down, not up. These errors indicate incorrect data retrieval or misinterpretation of source documents. (2) The calculations are internally consistent within the LLM’s own numbers (e.g., $692M to $602M is indeed a ~13% drop, and -$90M – +$45M = -$135M difference in changes), but since the underlying numbers are factually wrong, the results do not match the ground truth. The correct difference in lease cost changes should be $109M, not $135M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—comparing changes across two companies and assessing percentage decreases—but it fails due to incorrect input data. The model correctly identifies that Costco had a decrease and Philip Morris had a smaller decrease, but contradicts itself by stating Philip Morris’s costs increased while claiming it had a reduction. This inconsistency undermines the reasoning.

The LLM not only omitted this comparison but falsely asserted the AMD amount was undisclosed, breaking the chain of reasoning. (4) While the first part of the answer is quantitatively correct, the failure to accurately retrieve and synthesize the AMD acquisition value—central to the question—severely undermines the answer's correctness and qualitative accuracy. The answer is partially relevant but contains a critical factual omission that changes the conclusion, hence a low correctness score.",

(2) The answer is complete, addressing both the numerical difference and the qualitative implication about relative RSU valuation. (3) Entities are correctly identified: COST is referred to as Costco, MO as Altria (correct parent company name), and the appropriate years (2022 for COST, 2021 for MO) are used. (4) The reasoning is sound: the large difference in grant-date fair value is correctly interpreted as reflecting higher relative valuation and potentially higher expected compensation cost for Costco’s RSUs, which aligns with the ground truth’s interpretation involving stock price, company valuation, or market perception.

The difference in the magnitude of changes is correctly calculated as $722M - $599M = $123M. (2) All numbers and calculations are accurate. The LLM correctly interprets the direction of change: EMR's increase indicates a shift toward greater contract liabilities, while RTX's decrease indicates a shift toward contract assets. The final comparison correctly identifies EMR as having the larger shift toward contract liabilities. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies (EMR and RTX), two different time periods (2021–2022 for EMR, 2020–2021 for RTX), and correctly computes and compares the changes.

The percentage increase for ConocoPhillips (COP) is correctly calculated as approximately 89%, and for Chevron (CVX), it is 162%, which aligns with the ground truth values of 89.0% and 162.8% respectively (minor rounding to whole percentages is acceptable). (2) The underlying price data per barrel is accurate: COP’s NGL price increased from $23.27 in 2020 to $43.97 in 2021. The calculation is (43.97 - 23.27) / 23.27 ≈ 0.8896 or 88.96%, which rounds to 89%. Similarly, CVX’s price rose from $11.11 to $29.10, giving (29.10 - 11.11) / 11.11 ≈ 1.620 or 162.0%, very close to the ground truth 162.8% (difference due to rounding; still within acceptable tolerance). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identified and compared NGL price changes across two different companies (COP and CVX) over the same time period (2020 to 2021), synthesizing data from both entities to make a valid comparison.

This suggests BKNG expected a recovery trajectory in its forecasted cash flows for those assets. GM Financial also identified no impairment indicators in its leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, despite a potential future decline in used vehicle prices, which were still expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. Thus, both companies relied on forward-looking assumptions—BKNG on recovery in travel and restaurant reservation monetization, and GM on residual vehicle values—to justify the absence of impairment indicators, even though the nature of their assets and market risks differed significantly.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies said that nothing in 2021 triggered an impairment test, but the reasons were different. Booking Holdings said its long‑lived assets and goodwill showed no impairment indicators because its post‑COVID cash‑flow forecasts, growth rates and discount‑rate assumptions remained reasonable – the valuation was driven by internal assumptions about the recovery of its travel‑booking businesses (see BKNG pages 55‑56). In contrast, GM Financial’s lease‑vehicle portfolio had no impairment indicators because the market for used cars was unusually strong in 2021, allowing it to raise residual‑value estimates and anticipate lower depreciation; the conclusion rested on external price‑level assumptions rather than on internal cash‑flow forecasts (see GM page 46).",

GM Financial’s position was tied to strong used vehicle prices in 2021, allowing higher residual value estimates and reduced depreciation risk, driven by external market conditions—specifically low new vehicle inventory keeping used prices elevated above pre-pandemic levels (GM page 46). (2) There are no numeric values to verify (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages), so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no errors in dates (2021) or entities (BKNG, GM Financial, intangible assets, leased vehicle portfolio). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes across two different companies, asset types (intangible assets vs. leased vehicles), and valuation drivers (internal cash-flow forecasts vs. external market prices), capturing the contrast in financial assumptions and market conditions. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits explicit mention of BKNG’s prior 2020 impairments (OpenTable, KAYAK) due to the pandemic, which contextualizes why the absence of 2021 indicators suggests a recovery trajectory. However, this omission does not distort the core reasoning or conclusion.

This leads to an incorrect total combined pre-tax income of $49,154 million instead of the correct $50,273 million. Additionally, while Amazon's numbers are accurate ($37,557 million pre-tax income and $36,852 million operating income), the explanation mischaracterizes the comparison: it states that the 'combined pre-tax figure exceeds Amazon’s operating profit by about $12.3 billion', which is misleading because the comparison should be between each company's own pre-tax income and operating income, not against the combined total. (2) The calculation of the sum is incorrect due to the wrong GM value: $37,557 + $11,597 = $49,154 (LLM) vs. $37,557 + $12,716 = $50,273 (correct). The Amazon operating income difference is miscalculated in interpretation—Amazon’s pre-tax income is only $705 million higher than its operating income, not $12.3 billion. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound in structure—attempting to compare pre-tax income with operating income for both companies—but fails on multi-hop synthesis because it incorrectly uses GM’s pre-tax income and omits GM’s operating income due to a claimed lack of data, whereas the ground truth confirms GM’s operating income is $10,465 million. The model incorrectly asserts that GM’s operating income is unavailable in the provided data, indicating either a retrieval failure or misinterpretation of the filing.

This geographic concentration likely reduces Chevron's exposure to political and regulatory risks compared to ExxonMobil, which manages a more globally dispersed portfolio of reserves, including both consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. ExxonMobil explicitly notes that its reserves estimates are subject to regulatory changes, fiscal and commercial terms, government policies, and consumer preferences, which vary significantly across jurisdictions.

      "original_answer": "The net change in construction in progress for COST from 2023 to 2024 is $123 million ($1,389 million - $1,266 million), and for PM it is -$119 million ($1,081 million - $1,200 million), resulting in a combined net change of $4 million. For PM, the total change in property, plant, and equipment, at cost, from 2023 to 2024 is -$395 million ($16,685 million - $17,080 million). Thus, the combined net change in construction in progress for both companies represents only a small fraction (about 1%) of the total change in PM's property, plant, and equipment, at cost.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors and misidentifications. It incorrectly attributes COST's construction-in-progress values to PM (Philip Morris), stating that PM's construction-in-progress rose from $1,266 million to $1,389 million, when in fact those values belong to COST according to the ground truth. Conversely, it fails to report COST's actual data, claiming the information is missing, when the ground truth clearly provides it. For PM, the correct construction-in-progress decreased from $1,200 million to $1,081 million (a -$119 million change), but the LLM reports an increase of $123 million using COST's numbers. The PP&E at cost for PM is also incorrect: the LLM states it increased from $43,369 million to $46,950 million (+$3,581 million), but the ground truth reports a decrease from $17,080 million to $16,685 million (-$395 million). These are major quantitative and entity-level errors. (2) Calculations are based on wrong data: the $123 million increase cited is actually COST's change, not PM's. The combined net change of $4 million (COST + PM) is not computed because PM's data is wrong and COST's is ignored. The comparison to PM's PP&E change is invalid due to incorrect base numbers. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly associate financial metrics with the correct companies, reversing COST and PM's construction-in-progress values. It also failed to compute the combined change or compare it meaningfully to PM's PP&E change. (4) Scores are low due to fundamental factual inaccuracies in numbers, entities, and calculations. The answer is partially relevant in structure but deeply flawed in content, hence correctness score of 2.",

      "original_answer": "AMD held $288 million in state tax credits as of December 25, 2021, including a California R&D credit that does not expire. AVGO held $1,334 million in state research and development tax credits as of October 30, 2022, but none are specifically noted to be perpetual like AMD’s California R&D credit. Therefore, the total state tax credits held by both companies amount to $1,622 million.

      "question": "How do the impairment testing methodologies and outcomes for long-lived assets and goodwill in 2022 differ between COST and MO, and what does this imply about their respective risk exposure to future asset write-downs?",
      "original_answer": "COST does not recognize any impairment charges for long-lived assets in 2022 and applies a recoverability test based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows for asset groups, primarily warehouses. In contrast, MO performed both qualitative and quantitative impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021, using a discounted cash flow model with a 10% weighted-average discount rate and a 2% perpetual growth rate, and also found no impairment. However, MO acknowledges higher sensitivity to macroeconomic and regulatory factors that could affect future cash flow estimates. Therefore, while both companies reported no impairment charges, MO's methodology reveals greater exposure to external risks that could lead to future write-downs compared to COST's more stable asset evaluation approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco (COST) tests its long‑lived asset groups each year by comparing the assets’ carrying amounts to the sum of undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate; if the cash flows are insufficient, fair‑value appraisals are used and an impairment loss is recorded. The 2022 filing notes that no long‑lived‑asset impairments were recognized in 2022 (and only immaterial charges in 2021). Altria (MO) applies a two‑step goodwill and indefinite‑life‑intangible‑asset test – first a qualitative “more‑likely‑than‑not” screen and, when required, a single‑step discounted‑cash‑flow valuation using a ~10 % discount rate and a 2 % perpetual‑growth assumption – and likewise reported no goodwill or indefinite‑intangible impairments for the year. Thus, while both companies showed no write‑downs in 2022, Costco’s impairment approach is a simpler cash‑flow exceedance test, whereas Altria’s DCF‑based goodwill test is more sensitive to macro‑economic assumptions, suggesting Altria faces a relatively higher exposure to future asset write‑downs if those assumptions change.",

      "qualitative_accuracy": 9,
      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) All key facts are correct: COST uses an undiscounted cash flow recoverability test for long-lived assets and recognized no impairments in 2022; MO performs qualitative and quantitative goodwill tests using a discounted cash flow model with a ~10% discount rate and 2% perpetual growth rate, also with no impairments. These details match the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 10% discount rate and 2% growth rate are correctly cited, and the years (2022 for COST, with reference to 2021 for MO’s test timing) are consistent with the context. The LLM slightly generalizes MO’s testing to 2022 when the original specifies 2021, but since the methodology remains current and the conclusion about no impairment holds, this is a minor discrepancy. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts COST’s simpler, less assumption-sensitive approach with MO’s DCF-based model that is more vulnerable to macroeconomic shifts, leading to the valid conclusion that MO has higher risk exposure to future write-downs. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both methodologies, outcomes, and implications for future risk. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention that MO’s test was performed in 2021 (not 2022), but the focus on methodology and risk sensitivity is preserved. Thus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness due to this small temporal imprecision, despite otherwise excellent performance.",

      "original_answer": "Bank of America (BAC) incorporates expected prepayments into its estimation of expected credit losses (ECL) for consumer real estate loans by using quantitative modeling methodologies that consider refreshed loan-to-value (LTV), borrower credit score, months since origination, and geography, all adjusted for economic outlook including unemployment and real estate prices. In contrast, MetLife (MET) pools mortgage loans with similar risk characteristics and adjusts for expected prepayments and any extensions over the contractual term of the loans, while also factoring in past events and forecasted economic conditions. BAC applies these prepayment adjustments at a more granular, loan-level segmentation across consumer, credit card, and commercial portfolios, whereas MET applies the adjustments at the portfolio segment level (commercial, agricultural, residential) and evaluates individually impaired loans based on collateral value.",

(1) It correctly states that BAC uses a quantitative, forward-looking model incorporating borrower-level attributes (LTV, credit score, geography) and macroeconomic scenarios to adjust the contractual loan term for expected prepayments. This aligns with the ground truth's description of BAC’s loan-level segmentation and use of refreshed risk indicators adjusted for economic outlook. (2) For MET, the LLM correctly identifies that prepayment adjustments are based on historical prepayment and extension experience applied over a forecast horizon (two-year or one-year), which matches the ground truth’s mention of pooling loans and using forecasted conditions along with past events. The reference to applying adjustments at the segment level is implied through 'each mortgage segment'. (3) The key distinction—BAC’s forward-looking quantitative modeling vs. MET’s reliance on historical patterns—is clearly and correctly articulated, demonstrating sound multi-hop reasoning across both companies’ methodologies. (4) No numeric inaccuracies are present; while no specific numbers (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts) are cited, the temporal aspects (e.g., two-year forecast horizon) are correctly reported from the source. Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to less explicit mention of MET’s portfolio segmentation (commercial, agricultural, residential) and BAC’s broader application across consumer, credit card, and commercial portfolios, which adds granularity missing in the LLM response.

This aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM answer does not include the specific 2022 figures from EMR's report—$(3) million for U.S. and $5 million for Non-U.S.—which are key quantitative details in the original answer. Their omission reduces quantitative accuracy. (2) The LLM mentions that RTX reports 'aggregate net-periodic pension expense' but does not specify that RTX fails to disclose any actual breakdown or numbers at all—only referencing a section title—making the characterization slightly less precise than the ground truth. The 85–86% PBO detail is not in the original answer and may come from external knowledge; while plausible, it is not supported by the provided ground truth and introduces unverified information. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies EMR’s granular disclosure versus RTX’s consolidated approach and draws a valid conclusion about transparency. It synthesizes across both companies’ reporting styles accurately, though with minor overreach on RTX’s PBO percentage.

The total difference between the two companies' net deferred income tax positions is $15,303 million.

The values are reported as $2.2 billion (CAT) and $13.1 billion (UNP), which are appropriately rounded versions of the ground truth values ($2,180 million and $13,123 million). The difference is stated as 'roughly $15 billion', which is a reasonable approximation of the exact difference of $15,303 million. The valuation allowance for CAT is correctly stated as $934 million, matching the ground truth. (2) All key numbers are accurate within acceptable rounding: $2.2B ≈ $2,180M, $13.1B ≈ $13,123M, and $15B ≈ $15,303M. The calculation of the difference is logically sound and numerically close. The valuation allowance amount is exact. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts two companies' deferred tax positions, computes the implied difference, and explains the role of the valuation allowance in reducing CAT's gross deferred tax assets to arrive at the net position. It correctly links the valuation allowance to management's assessment of realizability, particularly in the context of tax carryforwards and research expenditures (implied in the reduction logic). (4) The answer is fully relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the difference in net deferred tax positions and the role of valuation allowances in CAT's position. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention that UNP's value is a liability (though it is clearly implied by context), and the difference is rounded without showing precise alignment to $15,303 million. However, these do not detract significantly from factual correctness. Hence, a score of 9 is warranted—excellent accuracy with only minor imprecision in magnitude representation.",

It reports ConocoPhillips' (COP) 2023 average net crude oil production as 112 thousand barrels per day (k bbl/d), whereas the ground truth from the knowledge graph states it was 173 k bbl/d. This is a major discrepancy that directly impacts the final result. The values for ExxonMobil’s Syncrude (67 k bbl/d) and Kearl (249 k bbl/d) operations are correct. (2) The calculation itself is mathematically correct: 112 + 67 + 249 = 428 k bbl/d, but because the initial COP value is wrong, the final combined total is incorrect. The correct sum should be 173 + 67 + 249 = 489 k bbl/d. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies the need to combine production from three operations across two companies (COP, ExxonMobil’s Syncrude and Kearl) for the same year (2023)—but fails due to incorrect input data.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and quantitative errors. It reports AT&T's (T) Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets as $20.9 billion, but the ground truth is $20,905,000 (~$20.9 million), not billion—off by a factor of 1,000. Similarly, NFLX is reported as $2.08 billion, which is close to the correct $2,076,899,000 (~$2.077 billion), so this value is approximately correct. However, the combined total is stated as $22.98 billion, whereas the correct total is $2,097,804,000 (~$2.098 billion). The prior year values are also incorrect: AT&T is said to have $21.8 billion (vs. correct $21.8 million), and NFLX $2.23 billion (close to correct $2.227 billion). The calculated decrease of $1.1 billion is therefore wrong—the actual decrease is $151,132,000 (~$0.15 billion). (2) Calculations: The LLM incorrectly sums $20.9B + $2.08B = $22.98B, which is mathematically correct but based on erroneous inputs. The correct sum is ~$2.098B, not $22.98B. The year-over-year decrease is miscalculated due to wrong inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: While the model attempts to synthesize data across two companies and two years, it fails due to gross misclassification of units (millions vs. billions), indicating a failure in entity/metric interpretation.

Specifically, Google’s Total Comprehensive Loss decreased from $7,603 million in 2022 to $4,402 million in 2023, a positive change of $3,201 million, largely driven by a $2,512 million increase in unrealized gains on investments. Meanwhile, Verizon’s Total Comprehensive Loss improved from $1,865 million in 2022 to $1,380 million in 2023, a positive change of $485 million, primarily due to a $536 million unrealized gain on fair value hedges.

The ground truth states the combined improvement is $3,021 million ($3.021 billion), while the LLM reports 'about $3.7 billion', which is a significant overstatement (~$679 million higher). This error likely stems from incorrectly summing Google’s $3.2B and Verizon’s $0.5B improvements to $3.7B, which is mathematically correct ($3.2 + $0.5 = $3.7), but contradicts the ground truth combined value of $3,021 million. However, the individual company changes are accurate: Google’s improvement of $3,201 million (~$3.2B) and Verizon’s $485 million (~$0.5B) are correctly reflected. (2) The breakdown of unrealized gains is mostly accurate: Google’s $2.5B increase in unrealized gains aligns with the ground truth $2,512 million; Verizon’s $0.54B gain on fair value hedges matches the $536 million in the original. However, the LLM adds details not in the ground truth (e.g., cash-flow hedges, pension-related OCI, foreign currency), which, while plausible, go beyond the provided data and slightly misrepresent the primary driver (the original emphasizes only the $536M fair value hedge gain as primary). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts year-over-year changes in comprehensive income, and attributes the changes to unrealized gains on investments/hedges. The synthesis across two companies and two years is accurate. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured. The correctness score is 7 due to the combined total error, though individual components are mostly accurate. Quantitative accuracy is 7 due to the significant discrepancy in the final sum despite correct inputs. Qualitative accuracy is 8 due to strong reasoning and entity identification.

In contrast, GM accrued $2.8 billion in warranty recall campaign liabilities, including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt recall, and estimated its reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be insignificant, indicating a higher degree of certainty in its obligations.

The LLM does not misstate any numbers it includes, though it leaves out several important figures. Format variations (e.g., € vs $) are handled appropriately. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that Booking.com’s liability is uncertain and under dispute, while GM’s is largely resolved and covered.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical error in company identification: it refers to ConocoPhillips (COP) instead of Chevron. Although the ticker COP is incorrectly attributed to ConocoPhillips, in the context of the question and ground truth, COP was intended to represent Chevron. However, Chevron's ticker is CVX, not COP—COP is ConocoPhillips’ ticker. This is a significant entity error that undermines factual accuracy. Despite this, the numerical data used (Chevron’s 81k bbl/d in 2023 and 66k bbl/d in 2022; ExxonMobil’s 355k and 327k) aligns with the ground truth values for the correct company (Chevron), suggesting the model accessed correct data but misattributed the company name. (2) Quantitatively, the 2023 combined total is incorrectly calculated as ≈436 thousand bbl/d (81 + 355 = 436), whereas the correct sum is 436, but the ground truth states 426—this discrepancy of 10k bbl/d is significant. The 2022 sum (66 + 327 = 393) is correct and matches the ground truth. The difference of '43k bbl/d' is based on 436 - 393 = 43, but since the 2023 total is overstated, this comparison is flawed. The actual increase should be 426 - 393 = 33k bbl/d. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is otherwise sound: the model correctly identifies the need to sum production for two companies across two years and compute the year-over-year change. However, due to the incorrect company name and erroneous total, the synthesis is partially compromised. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—the answer addresses all parts of the question and uses appropriate units and comparisons. Due to the major quantitative and entity errors, the correctness score is reduced to 7: core facts (individual production values) are correct, but the combined total and company misidentification introduce significant inaccuracies.",

Philip Morris (PM), on the other hand, treats shipping and handling activities as costs to fulfill a contract and records them in cost of sales, accruing for any costs not yet incurred at the time revenue is recognized.

The LLM correctly identifies both companies' treatment in relation to revenue recognition—Costco as part of cost of sales (via merchandise costs) and PM in cost of sales with accruals. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—score reflects absence of errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes distinct accounting treatments for two companies and ties them to revenue recognition principles. The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly state that both companies 'expense' the costs (though this is implied by 'expensed when incurred' and 'accruing'), and the phrasing about Costco's revenue inclusion of shipping charges—while true—is not directly part of the original question about cost treatment. However, this addition is contextually relevant and not incorrect. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the combined treatment (both expense but classify differently) and individual recognition methods.

      "original_answer": "DHR reported a discount rate of 2.7% for U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022, while MDT reported a range of 4.23% to 4.48% for the same category. The average discount rate for MDT in 2022 is approximately 4.36% (midpoint of the range). This leads to a difference of about 1.66 percentage points (4.36% - 2.7%). A higher discount rate, as used by MDT, implies a lower present value of future pension obligations, suggesting that MDT's pension liabilities may be valued lower than DHR's for 2022, assuming similar future cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "In Medtronic’s 2022 filing the weighted‑average discount rate applied to its U.S. defined‑benefit pension plans is shown as a range of **4.23 % – 4.48 %** (≈ 4.35 % midpoint)【page_94】.  \nDanaher’s 2022 filing uses a much lower discount rate for its U.S. pension plans – the most recent disclosed rate is **about 2.7 %** (the rate reported for 2021 and unchanged in the 2022 filing)【page_110】.  \n\nBecause a higher discount rate reduces the present‑value of future pension cash‑flows, Medtronic’s higher rate means its projected benefit obligation is valued lower than Danaher’s would be if the same cash‑flows were discounted at Danaher’s lower rate. The gap in discount rates therefore signals that the two companies may report materially different pension‑liability amounts even if the underlying benefit promises are similar.",

Danaher's rate is accurately reported as 2.7%, consistent with the ground truth. Medtronic's range of 4.23%–4.48% is correctly cited, and the midpoint is approximated as 4.35%, which is a reasonable rounding of the true midpoint (4.355%), so minor deviation is acceptable. The ground truth uses 4.36%, so the difference is negligible and within rounding tolerance. (2) The calculation of the difference between the two rates is implied (4.35% vs 2.7%) and would yield ~1.65 percentage points, very close to the ground truth’s 1.66 points. No explicit subtraction is made in the LLM answer, but the comparative magnitude is clearly conveyed. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly explains that a higher discount rate reduces the present value of future pension obligations, leading to lower reported liabilities. It appropriately links the rate difference to potential differences in liability valuations, even under similar cash flow assumptions. This reflects accurate multi-hop synthesis across the two companies’ filings and correct application of financial theory. (4) All entities (DHR, MDT, U.S. Pension Benefits, 2022) are correctly identified and contextualized. The answer addresses the core of the question—how the difference in discount rates affects liability valuations—without introducing factual errors.

      "original_answer": "$7,165 million (AXP: $3,000 million + BLK: $4,165 million). AXP's net cash from operations increased due to higher net operating liabilities, including book overdrafts, accounts payable to merchants, and Membership Rewards liability.

In contrast, BlackRock’s operating cash was partially eroded by a net $346 million outflow from operating‑asset/liability movements (a drop in accounts receivable and other assets that was only partially offset by higher accrued compensation and other liabilities).",

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in the quantitative values. It reports AXP's 2023 net cash from operating activities as $18.5 billion, which is grossly incorrect—the ground truth is $3,000 million ($3.0 billion). This leads to a total combined value of $22.7 billion, whereas the correct sum is $7,165 million ($7.165 billion). BLK's value is approximately correct at $4.2 billion vs. the true $4,165 million, so that component is close (within rounding). However, the AXP figure is off by more than 500%, which severely undermines the answer.\n\n(2) The calculation of the combined total is therefore incorrect: $18.5B + $4.2B = $22.7B is wrong, while the correct sum is $3,000M + $4,165M = $7,165M. The LLM also introduces a specific number not in the original—'$346 million outflow'—which does not appear in the ground truth and lacks verification. The original states BLK had 'significant outflows from accounts receivable and other assets', but no exact figure is given.\n\n(3) On qualitative reasoning, the LLM correctly identifies the direction of impact for both companies: AXP benefited from increases in operating liabilities (book overdrafts, payables, Membership Rewards), and BLK saw a drag from operating assets (receivables) partially offset by liabilities (accrued compensation). This shows some correct multi-hop synthesis of the contributing factors, though the explanation for BLK adds specificity (net $346M outflow) not supported in the source.\n\n(4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question—total cash and the role of operating assets/liabilities—and structures the response appropriately. However, the extreme inaccuracy in AXP's cash flow number dominates the evaluation, leading to a low correctness score. Quantitative accuracy is severely penalized. Qualitative reasoning earns partial credit for correct directional analysis. Contextual relevance is fair as the framework matches the question’s intent.",

Southern Company Gas recovers all prudently-incurred natural gas costs directly from utility customers through regulatory mechanisms without markup, deferring or accruing differences between actual costs and revenue earned to be billed or refunded prospectively.

      "original_answer": "NFLX disclosed that its Allowance for Credit Losses was not material as of December 31, 2023, indicating minimal risk in collecting receivables, likely due to its subscription-based model with recurring revenue and low credit risk from individual members. In contrast, T reported an ending balance of $756 million in its Allowance for Credit Losses for 2023, showing a significant provision for potential credit losses. This difference reveals that T faces higher credit risk, possibly due to business-to-business receivables with longer payment terms or higher exposure to economically sensitive customers.

Verizon, on the other hand, faces increased borrowing costs and reduced financing availability due to exposure to market rate fluctuations. This exposes Google to potential increases in interest costs if market rates rise before refinancing, while Verizon risks higher debt servicing costs, reduced flexibility, and vulnerability during business downturns due to its significant reliance on external financing.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies tie the cost of their revolving credit facilities to benchmark market rates. Google’s $10 billion revolving facility “uses a formula that incorporates certain market rates (and sustainability‑goal metrics) to set the interest rate” (Verizon 10‑K p. 74), so any rise in those benchmarks directly lifts Google’s borrowing cost and can erode its cash‑flow flexibility. Verizon’s similar facilities also “determine interest rates … based on a formula using certain market rates” (Verizon 10‑K p. 74) and a portion of its long‑term debt carries variable coupons; consequently, higher market rates increase Verizon’s interest expense, raise the amount of cash that must be devoted to debt service, and heighten refinancing‑ and collateral‑requirement risk (Verizon 10‑K p. 18).  In short, both firms face interest‑rate risk that can make debt more expensive and limit their ability to fund capital spending, dividends or share‑repurchases, while Verizon’s larger variable‑rate exposure also creates refinancing‑risk in a rising‑rate environment.",

Similarly, Altria's dividend is incorrectly stated as $6.49 billion (which is actually correct — $6,490 million = $6.49 billion), but the LLM combines it with the wrong Costco figure, leading to a total dividend payout of ~$12.24 billion instead of the correct $7.988 billion. The LLM also reports Altria’s net income as $7.43 billion, but the ground truth is $2.475 billion — a major error. Costco’s net income is correctly reported as $5.84 billion (close to the true $5,844 million). (2) Calculations are flawed due to incorrect inputs: the combined dividend total is wrong ($12.24B vs $7.988B), and combined net income is overstated (~$13.27B vs $8.319B).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified American Express's exposure to corporate loans as $51 million, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly reported BlackRock's exposure as $1,218 million in corporate-debt trading securities, which does not align with the ground truth value of $205 million. This results in a significantly incorrect total of $1.27 billion instead of the correct $256 million. (2) The calculation itself (adding $51M + $1,218M) is mathematically correct, but the input value for BlackRock is wrong, leading to an erroneous conclusion. The correct sum should be $51M + $205M = $256M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM attempted to extract data from both 10-Ks and sum them—but failed due to incorrect data extraction from BlackRock’s filing. It misidentified the relevant metric, possibly confusing 'trading debt securities' with 'exposure to corporate loans' as defined in the knowledge graph. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, time frame (2023), and metric category (corporate loan exposure), but factual accuracy is severely compromised by the incorrect number for BlackRock, warranting low scores in quantitative and overall correctness despite correct structure and partial accuracy.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023, and how does the difference between their respective liabilities reflect differences in their regulatory environments related to asset retirement obligations?",
      "original_answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $24,088 million. Duke Energy reports $14,039 million in Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities, while NextEra Energy reports $10,049 million. The difference of $3,990 million is largely due to Duke Energy having significantly higher asset retirement obligations ($8,560 million) compared to NextEra Energy's asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference ($4,066 million), indicating that Duke Energy faces a more immediate burden in asset retirement costs, which are likely tied to older infrastructure or differing regulatory requirements across their service territories.",
      "llm_answer": "- Duke Energy’s non‑current regulatory liabilities were **$14,039 million** in 2023 (see Duke balance sheet, “Regulatory liabilities” under Other Non‑current Liabilities)【page_80】.  \n- NextEra Energy’s non‑current regulatory liabilities were **$10,049 million** in 2023 (see the regulatory liabilities table, “Noncurrent” total)【page_70】.  \n\nThe combined total is **$24,088 million**. Duke’s larger amount reflects a regulatory environment that places more of its asset‑retirement costs (e.g., nuclear decommissioning, coal‑ash cleanup) into recoverable regulatory liabilities, whereas NextEra’s lower figure shows a comparatively smaller portion of its retirement obligations being captured in rate‑based regulatory liabilities.",

There are no calculation errors. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all figures are correctly reported with acceptable formatting (e.g., 'million' used consistently). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound — the LLM correctly identifies and synthesizes data from two different companies (DUK and NEE) for the same year (2023) and computes the combined total. The qualitative explanation correctly links Duke Energy’s higher liabilities to its regulatory treatment of asset retirement obligations, referencing nuclear decommissioning and coal-ash cleanup as drivers. While it does not explicitly mention the exact asset retirement obligation amounts ($8,560M vs $4,066M) from the ground truth, it captures the essence that Duke has a greater burden and that regulatory recovery mechanisms differ, which reflects a slightly less detailed but still accurate interpretation. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing both the quantitative total and the qualitative regulatory environment differences.

      "question": "How do Google and Verizon estimate and allocate standalone selling prices for their respective bundled service and device contracts, and what impact does this have on their revenue recognition patterns?",
      "original_answer": "Google allocates revenues in contracts with multiple performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price, which is generally determined by the prices charged to customers. Verizon, on the other hand, estimates standalone selling prices for wireless devices as their retail price excluding subsidies or discounts, and for wireless service as the price offered to customers on month-to-month contracts. Both companies use these standalone selling price estimates to allocate transaction prices between services and equipment in bundled contracts, which directly affects the timing and pattern of revenue recognition—Google recognizes revenue ratably over the contract term for subscription-based services, while Verizon recognizes equipment revenue at the point of delivery and service revenue over the enforceable contract term.",
      "llm_answer": "**Google (Alphabet)** –  \nIn its 10‑K the company says that when a contract contains more than one performance‑obligation it “allocates revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative **stand‑alone selling price**,” and that the SSP “is generally determined **based on the prices charged to customers**” (p. 58).  Because the SSP is used to split the transaction price, each element is then recognized when that element is satisfied – e.g., consumer‑subscriptions are recognized **ratably over the subscription period**, Google‑Play app fees are recognized **when the transaction is completed**, and cloud services are recognized **either as consumption occurs or ratably over the subscription term** (p. 58‑59).\n\n**Verizon** –  \nVerizon also allocates the total consideration of bundled contracts to the individual obligations using estimated SSPs.  For **wireline** bundles it “allocates … based on our **stand‑alone selling price** for each service, which is the price the service would command if sold separately without any promotional discount” (p. 60).  For **wireless** bundles it “allocates … between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated **stand‑alone selling prices** – the device’s retail price (excluding subsidies) and the month‑to‑month service price that could be cancelled at any time” (p. 59).  The company notes that, because the service and equipment obligations are generally satisfied over the same period, the allocation “generally **does not impact the revenue‑recognition pattern**” for wireline services, while equipment revenue is recognized **when the device is delivered** and service revenue **over the contract term** (p. 60‑59).\n\n**Impact on revenue‑recognition patterns** –  \nGoogle’s SSP allocation drives a **multi‑step timing**: each component is recognized according to its own performance‑obligation schedule (ratably for subscriptions, at point‑of‑sale for devices, on usage for cloud).  Verizon’s SSP allocation separates **equipment revenue (recognized at delivery)** from **service revenue (recognized over the enforceable contract term)**, and for wireline bundles the allocation has little effect on the overall pattern because the obligations are satisfied concurrently.",

(1) All factual information is correct: Google allocates revenue based on relative standalone selling prices (SSP) determined by customer prices, and recognizes subscription revenue ratably, app fees at transaction completion, and cloud services based on usage or ratable periods. Verizon estimates SSP for wireless devices as retail price excluding subsidies and for service as month-to-month pricing, allocating accordingly. Equipment revenue is recognized at delivery, service over the contract term. These points match the original answer.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how each company estimates SSP and how that drives different revenue recognition patterns. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly overstates Verizon’s wireline allocation having 'little effect' due to concurrent satisfaction, which is not in the original answer—though it is a reasonable inference. The original emphasizes the impact on timing (equipment vs. service), which the LLM captures well.

      "original_answer": "Chevron explicitly lists 'changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins' as a key risk factor that could materially affect their results, indicating their financial exposure to margin volatility. ExxonMobil, in its impairment testing process, relies heavily on assumptions about future refining and chemical margins to estimate asset cash flows. If refining margins decline, this could trigger asset impairment charges for ExxonMobil, while simultaneously negatively impacting Chevron’s operational results. Therefore, both companies are financially vulnerable to margin declines, with Chevron facing direct earnings risk and ExxonMobil facing potential asset devaluations.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron warns that “changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins” can materially affect its results (see CVX 10‑K p. 3). ExxonMobil’s impairment testing explicitly builds “refining and chemical margins” into the cash‑flow assumptions used to judge recoverability of asset groups (see XOM 10‑K p. 79). Because both companies rely on those downstream margins to value assets, a sustained decline in industry margins creates a direct financial risk – lower cash‑flow forecasts and a higher likelihood of asset impairments that can erode earnings and equity.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies, particularly in the calculation of BLK's net change in liabilities and the resulting combined totals. While AXP's $5,065 million increase in 2023 is correct and matches the ground truth, BLK's reported change is incorrect. The LLM breaks down BLK's change into '$(26) million change in accounts payable + $375 million change in other liabilities = $349 million', but the original answer only mentions a $375 million increase in 'other liabilities' without referencing a separate accounts payable line. There is no evidence in the ground truth that BLK had a $(26) million change in accounts payable, nor that the total liability change should be netted across two components. Thus, the LLM introduces unsupported granularity and miscalculates BLK’s contribution as $349 million instead of the correct $375 million. This leads to an incorrect combined 2023 total of ≈$5.4 billion instead of the correct $5,274 million ($5.274 billion). Similarly, for 2022, the LLM calculates a net change of $(632) million for BLK by summing $(151) million and $(481) million, but the ground truth states only a $481 million *decrease* (i.e., $(481) million) — there is no mention of an additional $(151) million component. This results in an incorrect 2022 combined total of ≈$8.2 billion instead of the correct $8,334 million. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s arithmetic is internally consistent but based on erroneous inputs not present in the ground truth. The correct 2023 combined change is $5,065M + $375M = $5,440M? Wait — even here, the original answer states the combined net change is $5,274 million, which suggests either a typo in the ground truth or missing adjustments. However, given that the original answer explicitly states the total as $5,274 million and attributes $5,065M (AXP) and $375M (BLK), the sum would be $5,440M — a discrepancy not explained. But since we must treat the original answer as ground truth, and it says 'combined... $5,274 million', while attributing $5,065M + $375M = $5,440M, there is an inconsistency in the ground truth itself. However, the LLM does not reproduce the stated total of $5,274M, instead calculating $5,414M (~$5.4B), which is closer to the arithmetic sum of the components but diverges from the stated total. Given this ambiguity, the larger error lies in the LLM introducing unverified sub-components for BLK. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies both companies (AXP and BLK), the relevant metric (accounts payable and other liabilities), and the two years (2022 and 2023). It attempts proper synthesis across entities and years. However, it fails in accurately representing BLK’s data by decomposing 'other liabilities' into separate line items not specified in the ground truth, indicating flawed reasoning or hallucination of financial statement structure. (4) Despite these issues, the qualitative trend is correct: the combined net change decreased from 2022 to 2023. The LLM correctly notes that the 2023 increase was much smaller than in 2022, aligning with the conclusion in the original answer. Contextual relevance is high — all parts of the question are addressed, and the structure is clear. Due to major quantitative errors in BLK’s breakdown and resulting totals, correctness is reduced to 6, with quantitative accuracy at 5. Qualitative accuracy is 7 due to correct entities and logical flow, and contextual relevance is 9 as the answer remains focused and comprehensive.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the CVX pension deficit. The ground truth states CVX reported a deficit of $13,493 million, but the LLM reports $1,610 million, which is off by over $11 billion. This error stems from incorrect input values: the LLM claims CVX’s accumulated benefit obligation was $1,665 million and plan assets $55 million, which contradicts the ground truth data. In contrast, the XOM figures are correct: $14,511 million ABO, $13,266 million assets, resulting in a $1,245 million deficit, matching the original answer. (2) The calculation for the combined deficit is mathematically correct based on the LLM’s numbers ($1,610 + $1,245 = $2,855 million), but because the CVX input is wrong, the total of $2.855 billion is vastly lower than the correct combined deficit of $14,738 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts ABO and plan assets, computes deficits, and sums them—but the synthesis is based on incorrect underlying data for CVX. It fails the multi-hop requirement due to reliance on erroneous source data. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses the exact question structure, provides clear breakdowns, and cites pages. However, the severe quantitative error in CVX’s numbers undermines factual correctness, warranting a low correctness score despite proper methodology.",

These numbers are quantitatively accurate and properly attributed to the correct companies and year. (2) The calculation of the combined total ($56.8B + $3.9B = $60.7B) is correct. However, there is a critical error in the interpretation of the impact of a one-percentage-point increase in Abbott’s rebate rate: the ground truth states this would *decrease* the combined total by $227 million (likely due to reduced net revenue or similar financial mechanics), but the LLM incorrectly interprets this as an *increase* in the combined total to $60.9 billion. This misrepresents the direction of the effect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—information is correctly pulled for both companies and synthesized into a total. However, the reasoning falters in the final inference about the impact of the rate increase, indicating a misunderstanding of how rebate rate changes affect financial totals (e.g., possibly confusing gross vs net impact). (4) Despite this, the answer is highly relevant and factually rich. The correctness score is 8 because core data is accurate and the sum is correct, but the directional error in the sensitivity analysis prevents a higher score. Quantitative accuracy is 9 because all numbers are correct except the final implication of the $227M change. Qualitative accuracy is 8 due to sound entity identification and synthesis but flawed logic in the conclusion.

      "question": "How do Oracle's and Texas Instruments' approaches to uncertain tax positions and deferred tax asset valuation differ in terms of their impact on financial reporting, based on the specific factors each company considers when determining the realizability of deferred tax assets?",
      "original_answer": "Oracle emphasizes the need to generate sufficient taxable income in specific jurisdictions to realize deferred tax assets, factoring in future growth, forecasted earnings, taxable income, jurisdictional mix, historical earnings, and tax planning strategies. Texas Instruments, on the other hand, focuses on external factors such as changes in U.S. or international tax laws and market conditions that could affect future taxable income, leading to adjustments in valuation allowances. Both companies tie changes in valuation allowances directly to net income in the period of determination, but Oracle includes potential adjustments to goodwill during acquisition measurement periods, while Texas Instruments highlights sensitivity to customer demand, technology shifts, and inventory write-offs as additional sources of financial uncertainty.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle applies a detailed, two‑step ASC 740 analysis. It records a valuation allowance unless it is “more likely than not” that deferred tax assets will be realized, and it bases that judgment on a list of specific factors – future growth, forecast‑ed and historical taxable earnings, the geographic mix of earnings, the availability of carry‑backs and the feasibility of tax‑planning strategies. Texas Instruments, by contrast, refers only to broader drivers – changes in tax laws, regulations and overall business performance – when assessing whether its deferred tax assets are realizable, so its allowance adjustments are tied mainly to those macro‑level changes. Consequently, Oracle’s approach can produce more frequent, material swings in its income‑tax provision and net income, while TI’s more general criteria lead to less granular but still potentially material adjustments.",

It accurately captures Oracle's detailed, factor-driven approach (e.g., future growth, forecasted and historical earnings, jurisdictional mix, tax planning strategies) and correctly contrasts it with Texas Instruments' broader, macro-level considerations such as tax law changes and business performance. The statement that both companies tie valuation allowance changes to net income is implied in the LLM answer through discussion of income-tax provision impacts, though it is less explicit than in the original answer. The LLM correctly notes Oracle’s use of ASC 740 and the 'more likely than not' threshold, which is consistent with accounting standards. However, the LLM omits key differentiating factors mentioned in the ground truth: (1) Oracle’s potential adjustments to goodwill during acquisition measurement periods, and (2) Texas Instruments’ sensitivity to customer demand, technology shifts, and inventory write-offs as sources of uncertainty. These omissions reduce completeness and nuance in the comparison. While the LLM captures the essence of TI’s macro focus, it does not fully reflect the company-specific operational risks emphasized in the original. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect by default, as no specific numbers are involved), and the reasoning is logically sound and contextually appropriate. The answer is semantically close but lacks full qualitative completeness on multi-hop synthesis of company-specific risk factors.",

According to the ground truth, the combined amount spent by Costco and Altria on stock repurchases in fiscal 2022 was $2,114 million. However, the LLM states that Costco spent $439 million and Altria $845 million, totaling $1.284 billion ($1,284 million), which is substantially lower than the correct total. These individual figures are therefore incorrect, leading to an inaccurate sum. (2) The calculation itself (adding $439M + $845M = $1.284B) is mathematically correct, but since the input numbers are wrong, the result is invalid. The correct total of $2,114 million implies that either one or both of the individual company repurchase amounts in the LLM answer are inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies both companies, the relevant fiscal year (2022), and the need to sum their stock repurchases—but it fails due to incorrect underlying data. This suggests a retrieval or grounding issue in sourcing the correct figures from the knowledge base. (4) Despite correct contextual understanding and entity identification (Costco, Altria, common stock repurchases, fiscal 2022), the severe quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine the factual correctness, warranting a low correctness score.

The change in difference is correctly computed as $8,817 - $8,653 = +$164 million increase in the gap. However, the original answer states the change as -$164 million, interpreting it as a decrease in the difference, which contradicts the actual calculation. The LLM correctly identifies that the gap widened (i.e., the difference increased), so the LLM's interpretation (+$164 million widening) is mathematically and logically sound, while the ground truth contains an error in directional interpretation.

The intercompany agreements involving Gulf Power (with entities like Alabama Power and Mississippi Power) referenced in Southern Company's 10-K indicate Gulf Power participated in shared infrastructure and operational contracts prior to the merger, but these agreements no longer applied as Gulf Power was fully integrated into FPL's single ratemaking entity structure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022 Gulf Power was a wholly‑owned, rate‑regulated subsidiary of NextEra Energy (NEE).  After the January 1, 2022 merger it was no longer reported as a separate operating segment – its generation (about 3,500 MW), transmission and distribution system (≈9,500 mi) and its 481,000‑customer service area were rolled into NEE’s single FPL operating segment 【page_12†L1-L9】.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains a mix of correct and incorrect information, with significant factual and reasoning errors that undermine its overall accuracy. (1) On correctness: The claim that Gulf Power was 'rolled into NEE’s single FPL operating segment' is partially correct in that it was merged into FPL, but the answer incorrectly implies that Gulf Power had any ongoing operational or financial structure within NEE in 2022. The ground truth states that Gulf Power ceased to exist as a separate entity effective January 1, 2022, and thus had no independent financial or operational role post-merger. The LLM incorrectly suggests that intercompany agreements with Southern Company subsidiaries (e.g., Alabama Power, Mississippi Power) continued to impact NEE’s regulated operations in 2022. However, these agreements were historical and no longer applied after the full integration into FPL. (2) Quantitative accuracy: The numbers cited—3,500 MW generation, ~9,500 miles of infrastructure, 481,000 customers, $4.44B acquisition cost, $1.3B debt assumption—are plausible and may be factually accurate based on external knowledge, but they are not confirmed in the ground truth, which focuses on the structural and contractual implications rather than granular metrics. Since the ground truth does not provide these figures, their inclusion cannot be verified and may represent hallucination or unsupported detail. Dates (January 1, 2022 merger; 2019 acquisition) are correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM fails the core multi-hop logic. It incorrectly links Southern Company’s intercompany agreements (which involve Gulf Power’s *former* parent) to NEE’s regulated operations post-2022. Gulf Power was previously a Southern Company subsidiary until acquired by NEE in 2019; after 2022, it was fully absorbed into FPL. Therefore, any intercompany agreements under Southern Company no longer applied. The LLM confuses Gulf Power’s pre-acquisition relationships with ongoing impacts on NEE, which is factually incorrect. (4) Contextual relevance: The answer addresses the question’s components (structure, intercompany agreements, impact on NEE), but the synthesis is flawed. While it attempts to connect Gulf Power’s past agreements to current rate-base determinations, this linkage is invalid post-merger. The answer would be more accurate if it clarified that these agreements were legacy arrangements with no 2022 impact. Overall, the answer is partially informed but fundamentally incorrect on the key point: Gulf Power’s agreements with Southern Company entities did not affect NEE’s regulated operations in 2022.",

In contrast, Gulf Power maintains a 50% undivided ownership interest in Plant Daniel alongside Mississippi Power, where Mississippi Power operates the facility on Gulf Power's behalf under an agreement. This reflects two distinct utility strategies: NextEra Energy Resources actively recycling capital through asset sales to fund new development, while Gulf Power retains long-term joint ownership in major generation facilities with operational responsibilities delegated to a partner.",

By contrast, Gulf Power’s involvement in Plant Daniel is a 50 % undivided ownership of a single coal‑fired facility that has 762 MW in service, giving Gulf Power roughly a 381‑MW share.

It also correctly states Gulf Power's 50% undivided interest in Plant Daniel. However, the LLM introduces a specific figure of 762 MW for Plant Daniel's total capacity and calculates Gulf Power's share as ~381 MW, which are not present in the original answer or implied by the ground truth. These numbers, while plausible, are factually unsupported in the provided context and represent an overprecision not justified by the source. (2) The comparison of the divestiture size to Plant Daniel (‘about eight times’) is derived from these unsupported numbers and thus introduces a quantitative inaccuracy. The original answer makes no such numerical comparison, instead focusing on strategic differences. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly distinguishes between a full divestiture of a portfolio and a retained joint ownership structure. It captures the contrast in ownership models—complete sale vs. shared ownership—but misses the deeper strategic rationale emphasized in the original (capital recycling vs. long-term operational delegation). (4) Despite the addition of unverified capacity figures, the LLM answer remains contextually relevant and conveys a reasonable qualitative contrast. The core entities, years, and transaction types are correct, warranting a score of 7 for overall correctness.

However, it reports 3M's Adjusted Operating Margin as 20.3%, which is incorrect — the ground truth is 22.6%. This leads to an incorrect difference of 11.3 percentage points instead of the correct 13.6 percentage points. (2) The calculation of the margin gap is mathematically sound (20.3% - 9.0% = 11.3%), but because the input value for 3M is wrong, the result is inaccurate. The correct calculation is 22.6% - 9.0% = 13.6%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model correctly identifies both companies, the correct metric (Adjusted Operating Margin), and the correct year (2023), and performs the comparison. However, due to the incorrect value for 3M, the synthesis fails on quantitative accuracy. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses all parts of the question and uses appropriate terminology.

This highlights the financial obligation companies in the financial sector face in maintaining preferred dividend payments. Meanwhile, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) discloses several risk factors, such as regulatory constraints, capital adequacy requirements, and the potential impact of economic weakness or cybersecurity incidents, which could materially affect its ability to generate sufficient earnings and maintain dividend payments. Together, these factors imply that while preferred dividends are a binding obligation, broader operational and regulatory risks at firms like BK could constrain their ability to sustain such payments, thereby affecting the stability of shareholder returns across the financial sector.",

All quantitative figures are accurate. (2) The entity names (MetLife, BNY Mellon), financial metrics (preferred stock dividends, net income available to common shareholders), and year (2021) are correct.

      "original_answer": "AXP recognizes Card Member Rewards expense in the period when members earn rewards, recording a liability based on expected redemptions and estimated cost of points, particularly for Membership Rewards, while COF records rewards expense as an offset to interchange income when rewards are earned and calculates its liability based on estimated future redemption costs, factoring in historical redemption behavior and program terms. These differences reflect distinct approaches to timing and estimation methodology in recognizing rewards-related costs.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express records rewards expense **as soon as a Card Member earns the reward** (i.e., when the spend that generates points or cash‑back occurs).  It then creates a “Card Member rewards” liability that reflects the **estimated amount of points or cash‑back that will be redeemed** plus, for Membership Rewards, an additional estimate of the cost of the points; the cobrand liability is based on the rewards earned on partner‑card spend and the payments due to the partner.\n\nCapital One also **recognizes rewards expense when a Customer earns the reward**, offsetting it against interchange income, but it measures the corresponding “Customer Rewards reserve” as the **estimated future cost of all earned rewards that are expected to be redeemed**, using historical redemption and spending behavior (and reduces the reserve as rewards are actually redeemed).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, Netflix paid $684,504,000 (~$684.5 million) and AT&T paid $7,370,000 (~$7.37 million), but the LLM incorrectly states that AT&T paid $7.37 billion—off by a factor of 1,000. This leads to a grossly inflated total interest payment of $8.05 billion instead of the correct $691.874 million. The Netflix figure is approximately correct at $684 million (close to $684.5 million), so partial credit is due for that. (2) Calculations are therefore severely flawed: $684 million + $7.37 billion = $8.05 billion is mathematically correct based on the LLM's inputs, but since one input is wrong by three orders of magnitude, the sum is entirely inaccurate. The correct sum is ~$691.874 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect data synthesis. The LLM reverses the interpretation: it claims AT&T has a much larger interest burden and more leveraged structure, when in fact Netflix pays over 93 times more in interest than AT&T. This mischaracterization invalidates the strategic analysis. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses both companies, the correct year (2023), and attempts to discuss debt management strategies. However, the qualitative analysis is based on false premises, rendering the conclusions incorrect. Thus, correctness and quantitative accuracy are very low due to the critical number error; qualitative accuracy is low due to flawed reasoning; contextual relevance is mid-range as structure and intent are appropriate.",

      "original_answer": "Comcast incurs programming and content production costs primarily through multiyear distribution agreements with per-subscriber fees, and its monetization strategy focuses on individual content licensing and distribution. In contrast, Meta's content costs are embedded within broader cost of revenue and tied to infrastructure and partner arrangements, reflecting its ad-based and platform-driven monetization model. These differences show that Comcast's content costs are directly tied to subscriber growth and contractual programming fees, while Meta's are more aligned with maintaining technical infrastructure and platform partnerships to support ad delivery and product monetization.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast’s content costs are largely **capitalized film‑ and television‑production assets and long‑term licensed‑programming fees** that are booked as executory contracts and amortized over the life of the multiyear subscriber‑based agreements (see CMCSA p. 77).  Revenue from that content is recognized only when the programming is delivered to customers under fixed‑price or subscriber‑based contracts, supporting a monetization model that extracts value through **bundled subscriptions, advertising and downstream licensing** (CMCSA p. 75; p. 73; p. 71).  \n\nMeta, by contrast, **expenses most content fees as incurred**—either when a title is made available or over the contractual license period—so they appear in cost of revenue rather than as capitalized assets (META p. 95).  Meta’s revenue is recognized at the moment ads are displayed or hardware is transferred, reflecting a strategy that monetizes content chiefly by **driving user engagement for advertising and hardware sales rather than by direct subscription fees** (META p. 94; p. 64).",

This matches the original answer’s emphasis on per-subscriber fees and distribution-focused monetization. (2) For Meta, the LLM accurately states that content costs are expensed as incurred and embedded in cost of revenue, tied to license periods or availability, which reflects its ad- and platform-driven model. The answer correctly contrasts this with Comcast by emphasizing user engagement for ads and hardware sales rather than subscriptions. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across both companies’ filings, correctly linking contractual obligations (executory contracts, amortization) and revenue recognition practices (timing, triggers) to broader monetization strategies. (4) No numeric values are in dispute; while no specific dollar amounts or percentages appear in either answer, the qualitative financial reporting practices (capitalization vs. expensing, amortization vs. immediate recognition) are described accurately and in alignment with the cited pages.

The calculation of the 260 basis point increase is correct and matches the ground truth. 2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all percentages and basis point calculations are precise and correctly represented, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., '260 basis points' vs '2.6 percentage points'). 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly comparing NVDA's margin improvement to TXN's absolute margin and identifying TXN's cited operational factor. However, while both answers describe TXN's manufacturing efficiency, the LLM cites 'factory loading' and 'utilization of owned capacity' as the primary driver, whereas the ground truth emphasizes 'efficiency of manufacturing strategy, including 300-millimeter production.' These are related concepts (300mm production improves factory loading), but the LLM slightly reframes the cause. This is a minor deviation in emphasis, not a factual error. 4) The answer is fully relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the comparison of gross margins and the operational factor influencing TXN's trend. The semantic meaning is equivalent to the ground truth, with only slight variation in how the operational factor is articulated.

      "original_answer": "CMCSA's $10 billion investment in exclusive sports content distribution rights (including NFL Sunday Night Football and NBA games through 2034) depends on maintaining premium CPMs for linear TV advertising. However, META's shift toward Reels—a format that explicitly monetizes at lower rates than traditional Feed and Stories products—could establish a new baseline for digital advertising pricing. If advertisers reallocate budgets toward lower-cost digital formats like Reels while reducing spending on premium linear TV sports advertising, CMCSA may face pressure to lower CPMs or increase volume to recoup their content investment.

No other numbers are present, so the core trademark impairment figure is correct, but the inclusion of unsupported data lowers confidence in full numerical accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly contrasts Colgate-Palmolive’s specific, quantifiable impairment triggered by the pandemic with PepsiCo’s more general consideration of the pandemic as one of many factors in its impairment framework, without reporting actual charges.

      "question": "How do Adobe's and Cisco's differing Product Revenue percentages reflect contrasting software monetization strategies based on their financial disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "Adobe's Product Revenue accounted for only 4% of total revenue in 2021, while Cisco's Product Revenue represented 73.7% of total revenue in 2022. This significant difference highlights Adobe's transition to a subscription-based model where they derived 92% of revenue from subscriptions, compared to Cisco's continued reliance on product sales as a core part of their business model.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe’s 2021 10‑K shows product revenue representing only 4 % of total revenue (with subscription revenue at 92 %)【page_45】, indicating that the company’s monetization is driven almost entirely by recurring, subscription‑based software licences. In contrast, Cisco’s 2022 10‑K reports product revenue accounting for 73.7 % of total revenue (with services at 26.3 %)【page_42】, reflecting a strategy that relies heavily on the sale of hardware‑centric products and traditional product licences, with services playing a secondary role.

      "original_answer": "DUK reported a Salary Increase range of 3.50% - 4.00% for each of the years 2021 through 2023, while NEE reported a specific Salary Increase of 4.90% for 2023. The higher salary increase assumption at NEE implies a faster-growing benefit obligation compared to DUK, which could lead to a larger liability on NEE's financial statements if other actuarial assumptions (like discount rate and employee demographics) are held constant. This contrast in salary increase assumptions suggests that NEE may be recognizing a more aggressive growth in employee compensation, which would increase the present value of pension obligations more significantly than under DUK's more moderate and consistent assumptions.",

In contrast, UPS's 2022 10-K states that its adjusted financial measures exclude items such as goodwill and asset impairment charges to provide a clearer view of underlying operations. As a result, if CAT were to recognize impairment charges during an economic downturn, its reported financial performance would reflect these costs, whereas UPS would exclude them from its adjusted metrics.

      "original_answer": "CMCSA experienced increased payments for film and television costs in 2024, influenced by the timing of sports content amortization, which directly affected its operating cash flow. In contrast, META's cost of revenue includes expenses related to content delivery, such as traffic acquisition costs and infrastructure, which are part of its broader operational expenses. These differing content-related spending patterns reflect distinct cash flow dynamics: CMCSA's cash outflows are tied to content amortization schedules, while META's are linked to ongoing operational and infrastructure costs for content distribution.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast’s 2024 cash‑flow statement shows that operating cash fell to $27.7 billion from $28.5 billion a year earlier, and the company notes that the decline was “primarily related to the timing of amortization and related payments for our film and television costs, including the timing of sports.” The higher‑than‑usual content‑related outlays therefore reduced the cash that the Connectivity & Platforms segment generated.  \n\nMeta’s statement of cost of revenue lists “content costs” (fees paid to video‑ and music‑providers) as a major component of the expenses required to deliver its services. Those content‑related costs are deducted from revenue in the income statement and are paid in cash, so they compress Meta’s operating‑cash generation in the same way, although the filing does not break out the net cash effect; the impact is reflected in a lower operating‑cash margin rather than a distinct cash‑flow line.",

(1) Quantitatively, the cash flow figures for CMCSA ($27.7B in 2024 vs $28.5B in 2023) are correctly stated and match the source data. These numbers support the claim of reduced operating cash flow due to timing of content payments. No specific dollar amounts were provided for META in the ground truth, so the absence of exact figures is not an error. (2) The explanation of CMCSA's cash flow decline being tied to film and television costs, particularly sports content amortization, is factually correct and consistent with the original answer. (3) For META, the LLM correctly identifies that content costs (e.g., fees to video and music providers) are part of cost of revenue and impact operating cash flow, though it slightly narrows the scope compared to the broader 'infrastructure and traffic acquisition costs' mentioned in the ground truth. However, this is a reasonable interpretation as content costs are a subset of those expenses. (4) The reasoning correctly synthesizes multi-hop information: it links CMCSA’s amortization timing to cash outflows and contrasts it with META’s operational cost structure affecting cash generation. The conclusion that both affect operating cash flow but through different mechanisms is logically sound and semantically equivalent to the original. (5) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the LLM emphasizes content licensing fees for META more than infrastructure/traffic costs, which slightly shifts emphasis from the original answer’s broader operational view.

While it correctly reports the individual percentage point changes for XOM (16.4% → 13.4%, a 3.0 pp decrease) and COP (28% → 27%, a 1.0 pp decrease), it incorrectly calculates the combined percentage change as 4.0 percentage points. The original answer states the combined change is -1.0 percentage points, which implies either a misinterpretation of 'combined' (e.g., sum vs. average) or an error in the ground truth. However, given that the question asks for the 'combined percentage change' and the LLM correctly sums the two changes (-3.0 and -1.0 = -4.0 pp), the LLM's calculation is mathematically sound. The original answer's claim of -1.0 pp appears to be incorrect. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the 2024 debt-to-capital ratios: COP at 27% and XOM at 13.4%. However, it incorrectly states that XOM had the lower ratio, which is true (13.4% < 27%), but contradicts the original answer, which claims COP had the lower ratio (27% vs 13.4%), which is false. Thus, the original answer contains a factual error. The LLM answer is factually correct on both numbers and direction. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly extracts data from two companies across two years, computes changes, sums them, and compares final values. (4) Despite the LLM answer being factually and quantitatively correct, it is marked down because it contradicts the provided 'ground truth', which itself contains errors. However, based on standard financial interpretation, the LLM's calculation of combined change as -4.0 pp is correct, and its identification of XOM as having the lower 2024 ratio is accurate.

The LLM incorrectly reports $61 million for 2022 and $152 million for 2023, totaling only $213 million—less than a quarter of the correct amount. For Home Depot (HD), the ground truth states $79.7 million in stock option exercise value in 2023, while the LLM cites $651 million in 'proceeds from the exercise of stock options (and other stock issuances)', which conflates stock options with broader stock issuances and overstates the figure. (2) Calculations are also incorrect: the LLM claims Nike's two-year total is $213 million (wrong), and compares it to HD’s $651 million (inflated and misclassified), concluding HD is roughly three times higher—when in reality, Nike’s $853 million is over 10 times greater than HD’s $79.7 million.

This contrasts with SPG's exposure to leasing risks from e-commerce growth and public health crises, which can reduce consumer foot traffic, lower tenant performance, and result in store closures or underreported sales. AMT's lease structure could serve as a risk mitigation strategy for SPG if applied, as it would reduce the impact of tenant turnover and rent volatility caused by these external threats.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower’s leases are typically 5‑ to 10‑year non‑cancellable agreements with automatic or exercisable renewal options, and they contain annual rent escalations that are set at a fixed percentage (or tied to an inflation index). The contracts also impose financial penalties if a tenant terminates early, which discourages premature exits. Because the rent is guaranteed to rise each year and tenants face a cost to leave, AMT’s lease structure helps smooth cash‑flow and protect against the occupancy‑ and rent‑pressure risks that Simon Property Group cites from e‑commerce competition and pandemic‑related store closures.",

It accurately notes that COP's performance was driven by development drilling, extensions, discoveries, and purchases. The only minor discrepancy is the inclusion of '96% on an organic basis' for COP, which is factually accurate but not present in the original answer; however, this adds detail rather than introducing error. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $26.3 billion and 123% are correctly cited, with no calculation errors. Format variations (e.g., $26.3 billion vs $26.3B) are acceptable and consistent. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across XOM’s capital investment strategy and COP’s reserve replacement performance, drawing a valid comparison between their approaches to sustaining production. It captures the core contrast—XOM’s proactive, capital-intensive development vs COP’s efficient reserve replacement—aligning with the original answer’s implication about strategic differences. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing all parts of the question: XOM’s investment strategy, COP’s reserve performance, and the implied differences in production sustainability approaches. The wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence. The qualitative score is 9 because while the reasoning is strong and accurate, the original answer emphasizes XOM’s 'diverse portfolio' and COP’s 'acquisitions' more explicitly, which are slightly underemphasized in the LLM version. Overall, this is a highly accurate, well-reasoned response with full factual alignment.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. While it correctly identifies Adobe's (ADBE) debt values of $693 million (1-2 years) and $443 million (2-3 years), totaling $1.136 billion, it incorrectly reports Cisco's (CSCO) intermediate-term debt as $9.0 billion based on the 'principal amount of senior fixed-rate notes.' The ground truth states CSCO's intermediate-term debt due in 1-3 years is $2,240 million ($2.24 billion), not $9.0 billion. This leads to a grossly inflated combined total of $10.1 billion instead of the correct $3,106 million ($3.106 billion). (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: ADBE numbers are correct and properly summed, but CSCO's figure is wrong. The calculation $693M + $443M + $2,240M = $3,106M is correct per ground truth; the LLM's use of $9.0B instead of $2.24B makes the sum incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: the model identifies relevant data from both companies but uses an incorrect metric for CSCO—confusing total senior notes outstanding with the specific intermediate-term debt due in 1-3 years. It does not align with the defined scope of 'estimated fair value of intermediate-term debt' due in that window. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the right companies and time frame and attempts to pull from appropriate tables, but misinterprets the financial metric for CSCO. The reasoning structure is sound, but based on incorrect data. Correctness score is low due to fundamental error in a key number and resulting calculation.",

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly identifies Mastercard's (MA) weighted average grant-date fair value as $331, and notes AIG had no Converted RSUs (represented as '-'), equivalent to $0. The difference is correctly stated as $331. However, the ground truth expresses the value in millions ($331 million), while the LLM interprets it as $331 per share. This discrepancy in unit (per share vs. total value in millions) introduces a minor factual ambiguity, though the number $331 itself matches. (2) The answer addresses all parts of the question: it computes the difference, identifies which company had the higher value, and references the correct year (2023). (3) Entity accuracy is strong: MA is correctly identified as Mastercard, AIG is correct, and the metric 'Converted RSUs' is properly used. (4) Reasoning is sound—LLM correctly infers that no reported value (‘-’) means $0 and performs the correct comparison. The only shortcoming is the lack of clarity on whether $331 is per share or total in millions, which slightly affects qualitative accuracy. However, given that the context of 'weighted-average grant-date fair value' is typically reported per share, the LLM’s interpretation is reasonable and commonly accepted.

In contrast, UPS disclosed in its 2022 10-K that it reports operating profit and other financial metrics excluding the impact of goodwill and asset impairment charges, indicating a strategy to adjust for such one-time financial impacts when evaluating performance.

(2) Calculations and numbers are largely fabricated or incorrect: the claimed 8 million acre drop for ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil’s 15.7 million net acres are unsupported by the ground truth.

In contrast, SPG faces significant uncertainty in tenant leasing due to risks like oversupply reducing market rents, e-commerce competition impacting occupancy rates, and safety concerns affecting consumer foot traffic.

(1) Quantitatively, the 3% churn rate for AMT is correctly cited and matches the ground truth. While the ground truth mentions 'over $60 billion in non-cancellable tenant lease revenue' and 3% annual rent escalation, the LLM omits the $60B figure but correctly references long-term, non-cancellable leases with escalations and the 3% churn. The mention of 'elevated' churn through 2025 due to T-Mobile is additional context not in the ground truth but does not contradict it—rather, it adds nuance. (2) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies AMT’s stable cash flows due to long-term carrier contracts and growing wireless capex, while SPG faces shorter leases, sales-based renewals, e-commerce pressure, and store closures. These factors directly support the conclusion of higher volatility for SPG. (3) Multi-hop synthesis is effective: the model draws correct inferences from lease structure (duration, cancellability, escalators) to churn risk, then to revenue stability and tenant demand outlook for both companies.

Texas Instruments' Embedded Processing revenue and operating profit increased in 2022 primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Given that both companies operate in the semiconductor space and serve overlapping markets (e.g., automotive, industrial, and computing), NVIDIA's product mix shift and margin dynamics could signal market demand changes that may create opportunities for Texas Instruments to capitalize on or face increased competition in embedded processing applications.",

(1) It correctly identifies the key dynamics in NVIDIA's product mix shift: higher-end GPU mix in Graphics lifting margins and lower-margin shift in Compute & Networking reducing margins. While the original answer does not specify the 61% growth figure for both segments, this detail is consistent with NVIDIA’s FY2022 10-K (p.51) and adds contextual precision without contradicting the ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM does not repeat the overall gross margin figures (64.9% and 62.3%) from the original answer, which is a minor omission, but it accurately describes the directional margin impacts per segment. The absence of exact overall margin percentages slightly affects quantitative completeness but does not introduce error. (3) The reasoning is sound and multi-hop: it connects NVIDIA’s segment-level mix and margin changes to potential implications for Texas Instruments’ Embedded Processing business, citing overlapping markets (automotive, high-performance computing), and correctly infers both opportunity (demand for premium embedded solutions) and challenge (pricing pressure). This synthesis is supported by TI’s 10-K (pp.21–22), as cited. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addressing how NVIDIA’s margin dynamics could create opportunities or challenges for TI. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the omission of NVIDIA’s overall gross margin figures, which were part of the ground truth and provide important quantitative context. However, the core multi-hop logic, entity accuracy (NVIDIA, TI, correct segments, fiscal year 2022), and qualitative insights are fully correct and well-supported.",

      "original_answer": "The discontinuation of LIBOR could increase borrowing costs and negatively impact financial performance for both MetLife and BNY Mellon. MetLife specifically notes that differences between LIBOR and alternative reference rates may impact the value and return on financial instruments, investments, and interest rates on debt, which could increase costs or reduce returns. BNY Mellon highlights that increased funding and borrowing costs could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Together, these risks suggest that both companies may face higher financing expenses and reduced profitability due to the LIBOR transition.",
      "llm_answer": "MetLife says it uses LIBOR in a broad range of debt, derivatives and other financial contracts, and the move to alternative reference rates “could increase our costs, reduce the value of such instruments, or impair our cash or derivative positions” (MetLife 10‑K p. 40).  If its fallback language proves inadequate, the company could face higher borrowing costs and lower earnings from the re‑pricing of those contracts.  \n\nBNY Mellon warns that a rise in the cost of funding – which would occur if the market shifts away from LIBOR to less‑favorable reference rates – could “increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” (BNY Mellon 10‑K p. 4).  Thus, the LIBOR discontinuation could lift the bank’s borrowing costs and pressure its profitability, though its exposure is through overall funding markets rather than specific insurance‑related contracts.",

However, the LLM reports $709 million for ADBE's 'Purchased technology' and $1,529 million for CSCO's 'Technology', summing to $2,238 million (~$2.24 billion), which does not match the correct total. These individual values are therefore incorrect. (2) The calculation itself (adding $709M + $1,529M = $2.238B) is mathematically correct, but since the inputs are wrong, the result is inaccurate. The correct component values should sum to $2,901 million, implying that either ADBE’s or CSCO’s reported value (or both) in the LLM answer is incorrect. Additionally, the dates cited—December 3, 2021 (ADBE) and July 30, 2022 (CSCO)—may not align with the 'most recent reporting period in their respective 2022 10-K filings', especially for ADBE, which likely reports year-end as December 2022, not 2021.

This means the LLM overstates the total by over $7 billion. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly uses AIG’s board authorization amount ($7.5 billion) rather than the actual repurchase value, which is inconsistent with the ground truth. (2) The calculation of AIG’s implied average price per share is based on flawed data: the LLM divides $7.5 billion by ~45.3 million shares to get ~$166/share, but this number of shares and total value are not supported by the ground truth. The correct implied average price for AIG is $561.02 per share, as stated in the original answer. MA’s average price of $379.49 is correct. The comparison direction is therefore wrong: the LLM claims AIG paid significantly less per share than MA, while in reality AIG paid significantly more.

This leads to an incorrect difference of $1.4 billion instead of the correct $1,846 million. These miscalculations undermine the quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation of the difference is based on wrong inputs: $2,101M - $699M = $1,402M (rounded to $1.4B), but the correct difference is $2,101M - $255M = $1,846M. The LLM's numbers do not match the ground truth, indicating either incorrect data retrieval or misaggregation across Duke Energy segments.

The LLM claims CAT had an $833 million MTM loss in 2021 that reduced its net periodic benefit cost to a $1.1 billion benefit, and that 2022 improved to a $121 million benefit, implying a $1.0 billion year-over-year change.

(1) Quantitative inaccuracy: The LLM claims NVDA had a '$48 million gain on a publicly-traded equity' in 2022, but the ground truth states that NVDA explicitly disclosed unrealized gains and losses were 'not significant for all periods presented,' meaning such a specific, material gain would contradict their filing. This number is unsupported and likely incorrect. (2) Misrepresentation of accounting treatment: The LLM incorrectly states that NVDA books unrealized gains in 'other income (expense), net' and that this flows through 'operating-income-and-expenses,' which contradicts the ground truth that these items were immaterial and thus not meaningfully recognized. NVDA’s treatment implies no significant impact on any financial statement line, not active booking in income. (3) Entity and reasoning accuracy: While TXN’s treatment is correctly described—unrealized gains/losses go to AOCI, credit losses affect operating income—the contrast with NVDA is flawed due to the incorrect assertion of material recognition by NVDA. (4) The answer addresses the right entities (NVDA, TXN) and the right topic (treatment of unrealized gains/losses), so contextual relevance is high. However, the core factual error regarding NVDA’s accounting treatment and the fabricated $48M figure severely reduce correctness.

According to the ground truth, PepsiCo reported $2 million in 2021, $2 million in 2020, and $4 million in 2019, totaling $8 million over three years. However, the LLM incorrectly states $256M, $255M, and $257M for those years, which is over 30 times higher than the actual amounts. This error completely undermines the comparison. While the Colgate-Palmolive figures are correct—$200–240 million in pre-tax charges with 90% being cash, resulting in $180–216 million in cash expenditures—the PepsiCo numbers are entirely wrong. (2) Calculations: The LLM correctly calculates 90% of $200–240M as $180–216M, which is accurate. However, the sum of PepsiCo’s expenditures is miscalculated using incorrect inputs: it claims ~$767M over three years instead of the correct $8M. This leads to a false conclusion. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to compare Colgate’s initiative to PepsiCo’s prior three-year restructuring costs, but due to the erroneous PepsiCo figures, the reasoning collapses. Instead of concluding that Colgate’s outlay is over 20 times greater (as per ground truth), it incorrectly claims Colgate’s spending is 'materially lower' than PepsiCo’s annual outlays—exactly the opposite of the truth. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to severe factual inaccuracy in core data. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because most numbers for PepsiCo are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is low (2/10) due to flawed synthesis and incorrect conclusion.

      "original_answer": "The combined ROIC of General Motors and Nike as of their respective 2022 fiscal years is 49.4%. General Motors reports its ROIC-adjusted as based on EBIT-adjusted over average net assets, which includes adjustments for automotive debt, pension liabilities, and tax assets. This reflects GM’s capital-intensive automotive business and significant liabilities. Nike reports its ROIC as 46.5%, calculated using Total NIKE Brand EBIT and Total NIKE, Inc.

The two definitions illustrate the companies’ different capital structures and focuses: GM’s ROIC is framed around a **high‑debt, capital‑intensive manufacturing business**, while Nike’s ROIC uses a **net‑debt‑adjusted capital base** that reflects its **brand‑driven, relatively asset‑light operating model**.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is partially correct but contains a critical factual omission: it states that General Motors does not disclose a percentage figure for its 2022 ROIC, which contradicts the ground truth that GM's ROIC is part of a combined 49.4% with Nike's 46.5%. This implies GM's ROIC must be approximately 2.9% (49.4% - 46.5%), but the LLM fails to either report or calculate this, instead claiming the data is unavailable. This is a major quantitative error. (2) Nike's ROIC of 46.5% is correctly cited with accurate fiscal year (ended May 31, 2022), matching the ground truth. However, the combined ROIC of 49.4% is not acknowledged, and no attempt is made to derive GM's ROIC from the total, despite the ground truth stating the combined value. The LLM incorrectly concludes that a combined ROIC cannot be calculated, when in fact the ground truth provides the sum directly. (3) The qualitative analysis of the differing ROIC definitions is sound: the LLM correctly identifies GM’s adjustments for automotive debt, pension liabilities, and tax assets as reflective of its capital-intensive, liability-heavy structure, and contrasts this with Nike’s asset-light, brand-driven model. This shows good multi-hop reasoning in interpreting the implications of each company's methodology. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and well-structured, citing correct document sources (10-K pages) and addressing both parts of the question—ROIC values and their reflection of capital structure. However, the failure to report GM’s implied ROIC or the combined total—despite the ground truth providing the combined figure—results in a low correctness and quantitative accuracy score. The answer should have recognized that if the combined ROIC is 49.4% and Nike is 46.5%, GM must contribute the difference, even if not explicitly stated as a percentage in the excerpt. Overall, the reasoning and contextual understanding are strong, but the factual incompleteness on the key numeric output severely undermines the correctness.",

      "original_answer": "If subsidiary REITs fail to qualify as REITs, both AMT and SPG would face significant financial and compliance consequences. For AMT, the ownership of shares in such subsidiary REITs would fail to be qualifying assets under REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains from the subsidiary would no longer count toward the 75% gross income test. This could materially affect AMT’s ability to maintain its own REIT status. Additionally, AMT would economically bear the federal income tax, penalties, and interest incurred by the subsidiary REIT. For SPG, failure of its subsidiary REITs to qualify would similarly disrupt its REIT compliance, particularly regarding income sourcing and asset composition, and could result in corporate-level taxes and a 4% nondeductible excise tax if distributions fall short. Both companies face liquidity constraints and reduced flexibility in executing their business strategies due to the mandatory distribution requirements tied to REIT status.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies rely on the REIT‑qualified status of their owned REIT subsidiaries to satisfy the REIT “asset” and “gross‑income” tests. If a subsidiary REIT is deemed to have failed to qualify, its shares no longer count as a qualifying asset and any dividend or gain from it no longer qualifies toward the 75 % gross‑income test (AMT) or the 90 % distribution requirement (SPG), jeopardizing each parent’s overall REIT status. Consequently, AMT would have to bear the subsidiary’s federal income tax, penalties and interest, while SPG could be subject to regular corporate income tax on undistributed taxable income and a 4 % nondeductible excise tax, potentially losing REIT treatment for up to four years and being forced to raise or liquidate capital to meet distribution obligations.",

(2) Quantitatively, all percentages (75%, 90%, 4%) are correct and match the original answer. There are no calculation errors. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: the LLM correctly infers that loss of subsidiary REIT status affects parent REITs' asset composition and income sourcing, jeopardizing their own status. It also correctly identifies the economic incidence of taxes—AMT bears the subsidiary’s taxes, while SPG faces corporate-level taxes and excise taxes. (4) Minor omission: the original answer notes broader strategic consequences like liquidity constraints and reduced flexibility due to distribution requirements, which the LLM answer touches on indirectly ('forced to raise or liquidate capital') but does not fully elaborate. Also, the mention of '90% distribution requirement (SPG)' is slightly misleading—while REITs generally must distribute 90% of income, this is not SPG-specific nor a test that SPG alone faces differently than AMT. Otherwise, the answer is semantically equivalent, with appropriate flexibility in wording. Contextual relevance is excellent as all content directly addresses the question.",

In contrast, GD's discount rate for pension benefit obligations decreased from 3.19% in 2020 to 2.54% in 2021. The increase in EMR's discount rates led to actuarial gains and a reduction in the accumulated benefit obligation from $5,634 to $3,910, contributing to overfunding of $513 for U.S. plans. GD's declining discount rate would have increased its pension liabilities, as lower discount rates raise the present value of future obligations.

However, it incorrectly states GD's discount rate as approximately 2.84% at the end of 2021 with no material change in 2022. The ground truth indicates GD's rate decreased from 3.19% in 2020 to 2.54% in 2021 — a significant drop — and there is no data provided for 2022 in the original answer. Thus, the LLM misrepresents both the values and the trend for GD, using an unsupported figure (2.84%) and missing the key directional change (decline from 2020 to 2021). 2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: EMR’s numbers are exact, but GD’s are not. The 2.84% figure does not appear in the ground truth and appears to be an average or fabricated estimate. Additionally, the LLM omits GD’s 2020 rate (3.19%) and 2021 rate (2.54%), which are critical for comparison. 3) The reasoning for EMR’s impact — that rising discount rates reduced pension obligations and led to actuarial gains and overfunding — is sound and aligns with the ground truth. However, the conclusion that GD’s flat rate assumption had 'little to no effect' contradicts the ground truth, which states GD’s declining rate would have increased liabilities. This mischaracterizes the directional impact due to incorrect data. 4) Contextual relevance is high — the structure addresses all parts of the question, discusses both companies, and explains the valuation impact. But due to the factual error in GD’s rates and trend, the comparative analysis is flawed. The synthesis fails on the GD side, undermining the combined directional impact assessment.

TXN, on the other hand, reclassified certain prior period financial amounts to conform to the 2023 presentation, which ensures consistency within TXN's own reporting but does not directly tie to specific operating income growth figures. The reclassification practices of both companies affect the ability to directly compare their operating income growth because each company modifies its historical data differently to align with current reporting standards, making cross-company comparisons more complex without adjusting for these reclassifications.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies restated prior‑period numbers, but the effect on the operating‑income trend is different.  \n\n*Texas Instruments* explicitly says that it “re‑classified certain amounts in the prior periods’ financial statements to conform to the 2023 presentation” and, for FY 2024, “prior period amounts have been re‑classified to conform with the current period presentation” (e.g., moving Middle‑East/Africa from Growth Markets to EMEA)【page_32】. Because the 2022 and 2021 operating‑income figures were restated, the reported 2023 growth figure reflects the same geographic breakdown used in 2023, making the year‑over‑year change comparable only after the re‑classification adjustment.  \n\n*Accenture* does not disclose a comparable re‑classification of prior‑period operating‑income numbers in the excerpts provided; its operating‑income presentation is shown without a note that prior periods were restated. Consequently, Accenture’s 2023 operating‑income growth is presented on a consistent basis with earlier years, whereas Texas Instruments’ growth rate must be interpreted in light of the prior‑period re‑classifications.  \n\nThus, the re‑classification of prior‑period amounts in TXN alters the baseline used for growth calculations, while ACN’s figures are not subject to such adjustments, limiting a direct apples‑to‑apples comparison of operating‑income growth between the two firms.",

This error invalidates a core part of the reasoning. (2) The LLM claims ACN’s operating income growth is presented on a 'consistent basis' without restatement, but the ground truth specifies that ACN’s reclassification affected the comparability of a $786 million or 9% operating income growth for fiscal 2024 vs 2023—information entirely missing from the LLM response. (3) The LLM incorrectly attributes geographic reclassification (Middle East/Africa from Growth Markets to EMEA) to TXN, but this reclassification is actually part of ACN’s changes, not TXN’s. TXN did reclassify prior amounts, but the ground truth does not tie this to specific growth figures or geographic shifts. (4) The LLM fails to mention any quantitative impact for ACN ($786M, 9%) and misattributes the reasoning for comparability issues.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. For EMR, it reports approximately 1,272,000 unvested shares, which is close to the correct value (ground truth is not explicitly broken down, but the total of 1,804,142 implies EMR's share should be around 1,771,142 if GD's is 33,000). However, the LLM's calculation for GD is flawed: it infers 33,000 unvested shares by subtracting vested (556,000) from total RSUs (589,000), but the knowledge graph ground truth indicates GD had 33,000 unvested shares — this part is actually correct. The main issue is that the LLM underestimates EMR's unvested shares. The combined total in the LLM answer is ≈1,305,000, which is significantly lower than the ground truth of 1,804,142. (2) Number verification: EMR's number appears to be pulled from a document but may be misinterpreted — if the source says 1,272,000 total restricted stock awards outstanding, it may not all be unvested. The LLM assumes all are unvested without confirmation. GD's 33,000 unvested is accurate based on subtraction (589,000 - 556,000). However, the sum is miscalculated: 1,272,000 + 33,000 = 1,305,000, which matches the LLM’s total, so arithmetic is correct. But the input for EMR is likely wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, correct fiscal year-end (September 30, 2022), and attempts to isolate unvested shares. However, it fails to accurately extract or verify the unvested portion for EMR, indicating a failure in synthesis or misreading of the source. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to major error in EMR's unvested share count leading to incorrect total. Quantitative accuracy is 4 because while GD's number is correct and calculation logic is sound, EMR's number is significantly off. Qualitative accuracy is 5 because reasoning process is logical but based on potentially incorrect data extraction. Contextual relevance is 9 because the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and time period with proper sourcing.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in total revenue figures for both COP and XOM, leading to incorrect proportions. According to the ground truth, COP's total revenue is $8,203 million and XOM's is $20,528 million, but the LLM incorrectly states $56,141 million for COP and $132,783 million for XOM—these numbers are entirely wrong and not supported by the knowledge graph. As a result, the calculated percentages (0.3% for COP and 5% for XOM) are incorrect. The correct crude oil revenue proportions are approximately 1.7% for COP ($143M / $8,203M) and 33.8% for XOM ($6,944M / $20,528M). (2) While the individual crude oil revenues ($143M for COP and $6,944M for XOM) and their sum ($7,087M) are correct, all downstream calculations based on total revenue are invalid due to the use of incorrect total revenue figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the total revenue figures for the two companies, which are essential for computing the proportion of crude oil revenue. This undermines the comparative analysis between the two firms. (4) Despite correct identification of crude oil revenue amounts and the combined total, the severe quantitative inaccuracies in key financial metrics and resulting incorrect interpretation of business reliance on crude oil significantly reduce correctness. The conclusion that XOM has a larger proportion is directionally correct, but the magnitude and supporting data are so flawed that the answer is substantially misleading. Hence, low scores on correctness and quantitative accuracy; moderate score on contextual relevance due to partial alignment with question structure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It states that PM had a '4.5% rise in net revenues' and '11.2% when currency and acquisition effects are excluded,' which contradicts the ground truth stating PM's net revenue increase excluding currency and acquisitions was 9.7%. The $189 million figure for PM's adjusted operating income impact is not mentioned in the ground truth and appears to be fabricated or misattributed. For MDLZ, the 14.7% organic net revenue growth is correctly cited, but the additional note of 'overall net-revenue up 14.4%' lacks support in the original answer and introduces confusion. (2) The qualitative aspects are partially correct: MDLZ’s favorable volume/mix being driven by AMEA, Latin America, and Europe aligns with the ground truth, as does the explanation of improved product mix and volume gains. However, the LLM fails to mention that PM’s favorable volume/mix was partially offset by unfavorable pricing and mix effects — a key contrast highlighted in the original answer. Also, PM’s growth was driven by higher HTU and device volume, which the LLM omits.

It states Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities related to commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments were $269 million, but this value is incorrect — the correct amount from Duke Energy's 2022 10-K is $132 million. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly references the '2021 balance-sheet table' instead of the 2022 filing, which undermines accuracy and sourcing. NextEra Energy’s noncurrent derivative liabilities are reported as $1,023 million, which matches the ground truth and is correctly sourced to the 2022 10-K. However, the combined total is miscalculated: $269M + $1,023M = $1,292M, which is not close to the correct total of $1,155 million. The correct calculation should be $132M (Duke) + $1,023M (NextEra) = $1,155M. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low due to the incorrect Duke Energy figure and the resulting wrong sum. While NextEra’s number is accurate, the error in the first component and the misattribution of year invalidate the final result.

(2) However, the LLM fails to directly answer the second part of the question—how the 2020 combined total compares to the 2021 figures—by not stating the $3,845M increase. Instead, it offers irrelevant comparisons: that the 2020 total is 3.6 times AMGN’s 2021 income (true but not asked) and 23% lower than GILD’s 2021 income (also true but misleading, since GILD alone exceeds the combined 2020 total).

The statement about $2.9 billion held abroad is additional but not contradicted by the ground truth and comes with a citation, so it does not reduce accuracy. (2) All numeric values—$6.9 billion cash, $1.0 billion pension contribution, $1.5 billion stock repurchase—are factually correct and match the ground truth. The $6.8 billion capex is a minor refinement not in the original answer but is consistent and plausible. No calculation errors.

This is a critical error—off by a factor of 1,000—leading to a completely wrong production difference of ~80.6 MBD instead of the correct 274 MBD. Additionally, the LLM claims ExxonMobil's average bitumen price is 'not disclosed,' but the ground truth clearly states both companies had the same price of $42.15 per barrel. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the production volume for ExxonMobil is misrepresented, the difference in production is miscalculated (80.6 vs 274 MBD), and the price comparison is incorrectly deemed unavailable. The only correct number is Chevron’s production (81 MBD) and price ($42.15). (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly extract or synthesize the data for ExxonMobil.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, AVGO's income from continuing operations in fiscal year 2023 was $14,082 million ($14.082 billion), but the LLM incorrectly states $30.4 billion—more than double the correct value. Similarly, QCOM's income from continuing operations in fiscal year 2024 is reported as $6.168 billion by the LLM, whereas the correct value is $10,110 million ($10.11 billion). These errors severely undermine the answer's correctness. The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM calculates ~$36.6 billion, while the correct sum is $24,192 million ($24.192 billion). The comparison to QCOM’s operating income in FY2024 is also incorrect: LLM claims the combined figure exceeds it by ~$26.5 billion, but the correct difference is $14,121 million ($14.121 billion), based on QCOM’s actual operating income of $10,071 million. (2) Calculations: All arithmetic in the LLM answer is internally consistent but based on incorrect inputs, so results are invalid. Correct calculations would be: $14,082M + $10,110M = $24,192M; $24,192M - $10,071M = $14,121M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies the required entities (AVGO and QCOM), metrics (income from continuing operations, operating income), and fiscal years (2023 for AVGO, 2024 for QCOM), showing sound structural understanding. However, due to incorrect data retrieval, the synthesis fails. (4) Scores justified: Correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to major factual and numerical errors. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the reasoning framework and entity identification are correct. Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate structure and intent.",

      "original_answer": "AIG estimates the fair value of liabilities by using market-observable interest rates and considers factors such as the coupon rate, yield curves, and other relevant factors, particularly in the context of securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Schwab, on the other hand, bases its fair value measurements for interest rate swaps on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve, considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. Both companies incorporate coupon rates into their valuation models, but Schwab explicitly references the dual-leg structure of interest rate swaps, while AIG focuses on broader market observables like yield curves.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG values liabilities that arise from securities‑repurchase agreements by applying **market‑observable interest rates** and the **relevant yield curve**, explicitly adjusting for the **contract’s coupon rate** and any other yield‑curve inputs that affect the cash‑flow discounting. In contrast, Schwab values its **interest‑rate‑swap liabilities** using the **observable swap yield curve**, discounting cash flows with both **spot and forward rates** and incorporating the **fixed‑leg coupon rate** as well as the **floating‑leg variable coupon** in the valuation model. Thus, AIG’s approach is a straightforward discount‑by‑yield‑curve based on the coupon, while Schwab’s model adds forward‑rate dynamics and treats both legs of the swap separately.",

(4) The only minor shortcoming is the characterization of AIG’s method as a 'straightforward discount-by-yield-curve based on the coupon,' which slightly oversimplifies AIG’s approach by implying less sophistication than the ground truth suggests (which references 'other relevant factors').

Schwab's 2024 10-K states that its capital management strategy includes a target common dividend payout of 20% to 30% of net income and reports a consolidated capital ratio of 6.8%. How does Schwab’s reported capital ratio influence its ability to maintain its dividend payout range, and what does this suggest about the relationship between capital ratios and financial flexibility for firms like AIG and Schwab operating under different regulatory capital requirements?",
      "original_answer": "Schwab’s 2024 consolidated capital ratio of 6.8% indicates a relatively strong capital position, which supports its ability to maintain a dividend payout targeting 20% to 30% of net income. This capital buffer allows Schwab to balance returns to shareholders with maintaining sufficient liquidity, especially in light of potential future needs such as migrating IDA balances onto its balance sheet. For AIG, maintaining sufficient capital is tied to its ability to underwrite insurance and manage risk through entities like National Union and Lexington, which are subject to insurance regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, capital ratios directly affect financial flexibility—Schwab uses its capital to support dividends and strategic balance sheet decisions, while AIG must ensure capital adequacy to sustain underwriting activities and meet regulatory thresholds.",
      "llm_answer": "Schwab’s 6.8 % consolidated capital ratio shows that it is well above the level needed to meet its regulatory capital requirements, giving it ample head‑room to allocate the 20 %‑30 % of net income that its dividend policy targets. In contrast, AIG must keep a higher‑than‑minimum capital base to satisfy insurance‑regulator‑imposed capital and liquidity standards that protect policyholders, which limits the amount of surplus it can return to shareholders. Thus, a strong capital ratio provides financial flexibility for dividend and repurchase decisions, but the degree of that flexibility depends on the stringency of the firm’s regulatory capital framework—more restrictive for insurers like AIG and relatively looser for broker‑dealers such as Schwab.",

(2) The answer addresses all parts of the multi-hop question: it explains how Schwab’s capital ratio supports its dividend policy, contrasts AIG’s capital needs for insurance operations (citing regulatory requirements), and draws a comparative insight about financial flexibility under different regulatory regimes. The entities—Schwab, AIG, National Union, and Lexington—are correctly referenced in context, though National Union and Lexington are not deeply analyzed but are appropriately implied as part of AIG’s regulated insurance operations. (3) The reasoning is sound and synthesizes information across both 10-Ks: it correctly infers that a higher capital buffer gives Schwab flexibility to pay dividends, while AIG faces stricter regulatory capital demands that limit shareholder returns. The conclusion about regulatory stringency affecting financial flexibility aligns semantically with the ground truth.

AT&T’s $19,032 million in debt issuance is correctly cited, though the LLM also references $8.949 billion in long-term debt and $10.100 billion in credit-agreement borrowings, which sum to approximately $19.049 billion—very close to the reported $19,032 million, likely due to rounding or net proceeds vs. gross issuance distinctions. (2) Quantitatively, all major figures are accurate or within acceptable rounding variance. The $2.387 billion decrease for Netflix matches the ground truth’s $2,387 million. AT&T’s total debt issuance is correctly stated as $19,032 million. The breakdown into long-term debt and credit-agreement borrowings adds context not in the original answer but is consistent with AT&T’s 10-K. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from both companies’ 10-Ks, compares their financing activities, and draws a logical conclusion about the divergent impacts on cash flow. It correctly infers that Netflix’s cash position was weakened by lack of issuance while AT&T’s was strengthened. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more detail from direct 10-K quotes. The only minor shortcoming is not explicitly referencing Netflix’s 2020 debt proceeds ($1,002 million) as a baseline for comparison, which slightly reduces completeness but does not undermine the core correctness. Hence, a score of 9 is appropriate—excellent accuracy with near-full completeness.",

The combined total in the LLM answer is stated as $2.24 billion, which is wildly incorrect — the correct combined total is $323.8 million (net: $122.8M - $201M = -$78.2M net, but the absolute sum is $323.8M as per the original answer’s phrasing). The LLM incorrectly calculates the combined figure by summing absolute values without proper netting and uses wrong inputs. (2) The earnings before provision for income taxes figures ($4.97B for SBUX and $19.41B for HD) are not present in the ground truth and are unsupported — the original answer does not provide these totals, only the impact of interest income/expense. Thus, these numbers are hallucinated.

      "question": "How does the treatment of accretion costs related to AROs for coal ash differ between DUK and NEE in terms of accounting approach and financial impact, based on their 2022 disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "DUK defers depreciation and accretion costs related to AROs for coal ash until recovery treatment is determined, indicating a regulatory deferral approach. NEE, on the other hand, actively records and expenses accretion costs annually, with $141 million in 2021 and $169 million in 2020, showing a more immediate financial impact. This contrast reveals different regulatory and accounting treatments affecting their financial statements.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Duke Energy (DUK)** – Coal‑ash AROs are recorded as a **regulatory asset** that includes both the deferred depreciation and the **deferred accretion** of the legal closure obligation. The amount is shown on the balance sheet as a $3.4 billion “AROs – coal ash” asset (2021 & 2020) and is not expensed each year; instead the accretion is rolled into the asset and recovered through rates over the life of the obligation【page_142】.  \n\n- **NextEra Energy (NEE)** – NEE does not have coal‑ash AROs; its ARO roll‑forward shows only nuclear, wind and solar obligations. For those AROs NEE **recognizes accretion expense each year** (e.g., $169 million in 2020 and $141 million in 2021) rather than deferring it as a regulatory asset【page_99】. Consequently, the financial impact appears as a line‑item expense on the income statement, while the balance‑sheet ARO liability changes only by the net of new obligations, settlements and revisions.  \n\n**Thus, DUK capitalizes coal‑ash accretion within a regulatory asset (deferred recovery), whereas NEE expenses accretion on its AROs (primarily nuclear/renewable) as a current charge, leading to a large $3.4 billion asset for Duke versus annual accretion expenses of roughly $150‑$170 million for NextEra.**",

However, the original answer does not mention a specific dollar amount for DUK’s ARO asset, so this figure, while plausible, is not confirmed in the ground truth and introduces unverified precision. For NEE, the LLM correctly states that accretion expenses are recognized annually and provides accurate figures of $169 million in 2020 and $141 million in 2021, matching the original answer. (2) Quantitatively, the NEE numbers are correct and properly attributed. The DUK $3.4 billion figure is not present in the original answer, making it an unsupported addition; however, it does not contradict the ground truth and may reflect actual data from the cited page. The years cited (2020, 2021) align with the original answer, though the question asks about 2022 disclosures—this is a limitation in both answers, but the LLM uses the most recent data available in its sources. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts DUK’s deferral treatment (capitalizing accretion in a regulatory asset) with NEE’s immediate expensing of accretion, even though NEE does not have coal ash AROs. This distinction is critical and accurately synthesized. However, the LLM adds the fact that NEE has no coal ash AROs (only nuclear, wind, solar), which is not in the original answer but is consistent with the broader point about differing treatments. This enhances completeness but slightly diverges from the ground truth focus. (4) The correctness score is 7 because the core financial and accounting treatment differences are accurately conveyed with strong support from disclosures, and the quantitative data for NEE is exact. The qualitative accuracy is 7 due to the introduction of an unconfirmed dollar amount and the slight shift in scope (emphasizing NEE’s lack of coal ash AROs). Quantitative accuracy is 8 because all reported numbers are correct except for the unsupported $3.4B figure.

It states that the $5.16 billion difference is about 77% of Amgen’s total income before taxes and 62% of Gilead’s. This is a misinterpretation: the question asks how the difference in foreign income compares to each company’s respective total income, but the ground truth analyzes the proportion of foreign income *to* total income for each firm (i.e., AMGN: $4,851M / $6,701M = 72.4%; GILD: |–$309M| / $8,278M = 3.7%).

      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) reported a decrease in its net charge-off rate by 49 basis points to 0.00% in 2021, primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in its energy loan portfolio. This reflects an improvement in credit performance and economic conditions, especially in the energy sector, compared to 2020. In contrast, PayPal (PYPL) defines its net charge-off rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily balance of those receivables. While COF's metric reflects a specific improvement in a core loan segment (energy), PYPL's definition emphasizes a structural, formulaic approach focused on merchant credit risk without factoring in fraud, indicating differing risk management frameworks and portfolio compositions between the two financial institutions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the quantitative details. It claims Capital One's net charge-off rate dropped from 3.93% in 2020 to 0.00% in 2021, a 49-basis-point decline. However, a drop from 3.93% to 0.00% is a 393-basis-point decline, not 49, making the calculation mathematically incorrect. The original answer states the decline was 49 basis points to 0.00%, implying a 2020 rate of 0.49%, not 3.93%. This is a major quantitative error. Additionally, the LLM introduces PayPal's net charge-off rates (18.9% in 2020 to 4.7% in 2021), which are not present in the original answer and are unsupported by the ground truth. The original answer does not provide any specific rates for PayPal, only its definition and methodology. (2) The entity accuracy is correct—COF and PYPL are properly identified, and the years (2020–2021) are accurate. The mention of energy loan portfolio for COF and merchant loans for PYPL aligns with the original. However, the inclusion of specific page numbers (COF 10-K p.77, PYPL 10-K p.44-45) is extraneous and not verifiable from the ground truth. (3) The reasoning partially captures the contrast in definitions: COF’s improvement in a specific portfolio vs. PYPL’s structural, formulaic definition excluding fraud. However, the LLM incorrectly implies that PYPL reported declining charge-off rates due to pandemic impacts and troubled-debt restructurings—information not in the original and not requested. This misrepresents the scope of the comparison. (4) While the answer attempts multi-hop reasoning by contrasting two companies’ treatments of net charge-offs, it introduces unsupported data, undermining correctness. The contextual relevance is high because it addresses the core contrast in definitions and drivers, but factual accuracy is severely compromised by incorrect numbers and fabricated metrics.",

COF's lower net charge-off rate indicates stronger credit quality and loss mitigation in its loan portfolio, particularly in auto and consumer banking. PYPL, by excluding fraud losses from its net charge-off rate calculation, highlights a different risk exposure tied to merchant loans and advances, which may carry unique credit risks not captured in the metric. This distinction shows that COF's credit management strategy results in lower realized losses, while PYPL's approach focuses on separating fraud-related losses from credit performance metrics, affecting how each company measures and manages credit risk.",

The ground truth states COF's net charge-off rate was 0.37% in 2022, but the LLM incorrectly cites this figure as being from 2021 (Table 9, 2021), introducing a wrong year. More critically, the LLM claims PayPal reported net charge-off rates of 4.7% for merchant loans and 4.3% for consumer loans in 2021—information not present in the original answer and unsupported by the provided context. The original answer does not provide any specific numerical rate for PayPal, only that it excludes fraud losses from its calculation. Thus, the LLM fabricates key quantitative data. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the LLM misattributes the year for COF’s rate and invents specific percentages for PYPL that are not in the ground truth. Even if such figures exist in actual filings, they were not part of the knowledge graph’s verified answer and contradict the premise that PYPL’s rate is defined differently but not numerically compared. (3) The reasoning partially captures the contrast in credit risk management—highlighting COF’s tighter controls and PYPL’s exclusion of fraud—but incorrectly frames the comparison as one of magnitude (low vs. high rates) based on made-up numbers, rather than focusing on definitional differences in how the metric is calculated. This undermines the multi-hop synthesis: the core insight should be about differing metric definitions affecting comparability, not a direct numerical comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses credit risk management approaches and mentions the exclusion of fraud by PYPL, aligning with the question’s intent. However, due to fabricated data and incorrect years, the qualitative accuracy is compromised. The conclusion about COF being more conservative may be plausible, but it is based on incorrect evidence.

The ground truth states that COST's total finance lease costs exceeded Philip Morris's by $104 million, but the LLM calculates a difference of $81 million. This discrepancy arises from incorrect input values or miscalculation. (2) According to the LLM's own numbers: Costco = $97M + $58M = $155M; Philip Morris = $72M + $2M = $74M; difference = $155M - $74M = $81M — which is what the LLM reports. However, this does not match the ground truth of $104M, indicating either incorrect underlying data or a failure in calculation logic. Since the expected difference is $104M, the correct sum for Costco should have been $178M (if Philip Morris was $74M), or Philip Morris’s value should have been lower. The individual components ($97M, $58M, $72M, $2M) are not verifiable here but appear inconsistent with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound — the model identifies both companies, extracts amortization and interest, sums them, and computes the difference — so the approach is correct. However, the factual inaccuracy in the final number severely undermines the correctness.

How does the magnitude of AIG's total Securities for Sale compare to the volatility observed in COF's portfolio, and what might this suggest about their respective exposure to fair value fluctuations?",
      "original_answer": "AIG's total Securities for Sale fair value was $231,733 million as of December 31, 2023, while COF experienced a $907 million increase in its Securities Available for Sale component of AOCI during 2023. AIG's portfolio is significantly larger in scale, being over 255 times greater than the annual volatility observed in COF's portfolio. This suggests AIG may have greater absolute exposure to market fluctuations, though COF's relative volatility indicates sensitivity to fair value changes despite its smaller portfolio size.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key facts: AIG's fair value of securities for sale is reported as $231.7 billion (equivalent to $231,733 million in the ground truth), and COF's (Capital One) change in AOCI for securities available for sale is $907 million. The comparison of magnitude (~250 times larger) is accurate and reasonably rounded from the exact ratio of 231,733 / 0.907 ≈ 255.5. Minor rounding is acceptable.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent: both dollar amounts are correct when accounting for format variations ($231.7 billion = $231,733 million; $907 million unchanged). The ratio calculation is approximately correct—255.5 is rounded to 250, which is a minor and reasonable simplification in communication.\n\n3) Entity accuracy and multi-hop reasoning are sound: AIG and COF (Capital One) are correctly identified, the metrics (fair value of securities for sale vs. change in AOCI component) are correctly attributed, and the synthesis across companies and financial concepts is logical. The conclusion about AIG’s greater balance-sheet exposure and COF’s modest volatility aligns with the ground truth.\n\n4) The only minor shortcoming is that the ground truth notes AIG’s portfolio is 'over 255 times greater,' while the LLM says 'roughly 250 times,' which is slightly less precise but still within acceptable rounding for qualitative communication. Additionally, the LLM does not explicitly note that COF’s relative volatility suggests sensitivity despite a smaller size, slightly reducing qualitative completeness.\n\nOverall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high score with only a small deduction for slight imprecision in the ratio.",

      "original_answer": "DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets increased by $656 million from 2020 ($5,775 million) to 2021 ($5,909 million). NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets were impacted by reserve amortization adjustments related to accrued asset removal costs, which reflected changes in regulatory ROE targeting under the 2016 rate agreement. These adjustments were recorded as increases or decreases to noncurrent regulatory assets or liabilities. The combined impact of these changes indicates that both companies experienced regulatory-driven balance sheet adjustments, with DUK showing a direct increase in noncurrent regulatory assets while NEE's changes were more dynamic due to amortization reversals and accruals.",
      "llm_answer": "DUK’s balance sheet showed a rise in its non‑current regulatory‑asset balance – the 2021 filing notes that the company recorded roughly **$14.6 billion of regulatory assets**, up from the prior‑year level (the 2020 balance was lower, so the net change was a positive increase).  \n\nBy contrast, NextEra Energy’s non‑current regulatory‑asset balance **fell because of reserve‑amortization**.  The 2021‑2020 comparison in the balance‑sheet schedule shows regulatory assets of **$5,909 million versus $5,775 million**, a **$134 million increase overall**, but the MD&A explains that a **$429 million reserve‑amortization charge** was recorded in 2021 (the opposite of the $1 million reversal recorded in 2020), effectively reducing the asset balance by that amount.  \n\nTogether, the two companies produced opposite effects on their balance sheets: Duke added roughly a **$1 billion‑plus** to its non‑current regulatory‑asset pool, while NextEra’s reserve‑amortization offset a portion of its modest $134 million gain, resulting in a net **increase of about $1 billion** in regulatory assets across the two firms.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and numerical errors. It incorrectly states that DUK's 2021 noncurrent regulatory assets were $14.6 billion, which is more than double the correct value of $5,909 million. It also misrepresents the change at DUK: the correct increase is $134 million ($5,909M - $5,775M), not 'over $1 billion'. The LLM reverses the direction of NEE's amortization impact: it claims NEE's noncurrent regulatory assets fell due to amortization, but in the original answer, NEE's adjustments were dynamic (increases or decreases) due to reserve amortization related to ROE targeting, not a straightforward decrease. The LLM incorrectly calculates a 'net increase of about $1 billion' across both firms, which is unsupported — DUK’s actual increase was $134M, and NEE’s amortization adjustments ($429M charge vs $1M reversal) are not additive to DUK’s number. (2) Specific number verification: DUK 2020 = $5,775M (correct in original, misstated in LLM), DUK 2021 = $5,909M (correct in original, LLM says $14.6B — wrong). NEE’s $429M amortization charge is mentioned in LLM but misinterpreted as reducing assets, while the original describes it as part of dynamic regulatory adjustments, not a direct asset reduction. The LLM falsely implies NEE’s total regulatory assets declined, but the original does not provide NEE’s total asset values or net change. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to correctly synthesize DUK’s straightforward asset increase with NEE’s complex regulatory amortization mechanism. It invents a combined 'net $1 billion increase' with no basis in the data. It confuses entities by attributing NEE’s amortization directly to a decline in noncurrent regulatory assets, which is not stated in the original. (4) Correctness score is low (3) due to major factual and numerical errors. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2) because key dollar amounts and changes are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is low (3) due to incorrect reasoning and entity conflation. Contextual relevance is moderate (6) because the answer addresses the right topic and companies, and mentions relevant concepts like reserve amortization and balance sheet impacts, but misrepresents the data.",

      "original_answer": "Emerson recognized a mark-to-market gain of $56 million in fiscal 2023 on its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation, which was excluded from pro forma results to reflect the economic reality of the transaction. In contrast, UPS recognized a mark-to-market gain of $3.3 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) in 2021 related to its pension plan following the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, which was included in Investment income and other on the income statement. Emerson's gain was tied to an equity investment linked to a specific acquisition, while UPS's gain stemmed from pension plan adjustments due to regulatory changes. These differences in source, timing, and treatment indicate that the mark-to-market gains are not comparable and should be carefully evaluated when assessing the companies' core operating performance, as they reflect distinct non-operational, one-time accounting adjustments.",

The after-tax figure of $2.5 billion mentioned in the ground truth is not included in the LLM answer, but this is a minor omission as the focus is on the pre-tax gain and its presentation. The LLM also correctly notes that UPS recorded a $2.1 billion gain in OCI, which is consistent with UPS's 10-K disclosures, though this specific figure was not in the original answer—this adds detail without contradicting. (2) All numeric values ($56 million, $3.3 billion), years (2023 for Emerson, 2021 for UPS), and financial statement locations (separate non-operating item for Emerson, investment income and OCI for UPS) are accurate. Format variations (e.g., $56 million vs $56 million) are acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two different companies, different years, different sources (equity investment vs pension adjustments), and different financial statement treatments. It draws the correct conclusion that these gains are not comparable and affect core earnings comparability.

According to the ground truth, Alphabet (Google) had a 33.3% growth rate, while Meta had a 48% growth rate. However, the LLM incorrectly states that both companies had a 48% increase, which is factually wrong. The absolute dollar increases are approximately correct—$28.1 billion for Alphabet (vs. $28,097 million ground truth) and $22.6 billion for Meta (vs. $22,629 million)—with minor rounding acceptable. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s percentage calculation for Alphabet is incorrect. A rise from $84.3B to $112.4B is a $28.1B increase, which is a 33.3% increase (28.1 / 84.3 ≈ 0.333), not 48%. The LLM likely confused or swapped the percentage figures. Meta’s 48% growth is correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to compare growth between two companies over two years and performs basic calculations, but fails in accurate synthesis—specifically misattributing Meta’s growth rate to both companies. This undermines the comparative conclusion. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the structure and intent align with the question, but the core quantitative error in the growth rate for Alphabet severely impacts correctness. Due to the major error in percentage growth (a key part of the multi-hop comparison), the conclusion that both had the same growth is false.

For HD, the 0.9% decrease in average ticket and 1.0% decline in transactions are accurate, and the resulting 1.8% drop in comparable sales aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM introduces a claim about a '53-week year' adding $2.5 billion in net sales, which is not in the original answer and is unsupported by the provided context—this is an extraneous detail that misrepresents the cause of sales performance. For SBUX, the 4% increase in average ticket and 5% drop in comparable transactions are correct, but the LLM incorrectly states this led to a '2% increase in North-America net revenues'—the ground truth says there was a 2% *decline* in comparable store sales, not an increase in net revenues. This is a critical error in both direction and metric. The $440 million figure is also not in the original and appears fabricated. The operating margin contraction of 90 basis points to 19.8% is correctly reported. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised: while percentages for ticket and transactions are correct, the direction of SBUX's sales change is wrong (increase vs. actual decrease), and unverified dollar amounts ($440M, $2.5B) are introduced. Calculations implied (e.g., net effect on sales) are not validated and conflict with ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM correctly links ticket and transaction changes to sales outcomes for both companies, but fails in the final synthesis for SBUX by misrepresenting the sales impact and omitting the actual reason for margin pressure (wage investments, deleverage, promotions). The margin result is correct, but the explanatory link is missing. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses all parts of the question and focuses on the right metrics and companies.

A 10% unfavorable movement in exchange rates could have led to substantial pretax losses for General Dynamics, increasing its financial volatility.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies, particularly in quantitative claims. While it correctly states Emerson's $486 million pretax gain from the Therm-O-Disc divestiture, it incorrectly claims this 'boosted pretax earnings by roughly $1.2 billion,' a figure not present in the original answer or supported by the question context—this is a significant fabrication or misattribution. Additionally, the LLM asserts that a 10% adverse currency move would lead to a $196 million pretax loss for General Dynamics, but the original answer does not specify the dollar impact of such a move—only that it could lead to 'substantial pretax losses.' This calculation appears invented and is not corroborated by the ground truth. The $6.8 billion notional amount of forward contracts is correctly cited, as is the year-end 2021 timing. (2) The original answer does not mention any $1.2 billion earnings boost or $196 million loss figure, so these are unsupported additions. The LLM also cites specific 10-K page numbers (e.g., EMR pages 27–28, 41; GD page 52), which may be accurate but are not verifiable from the knowledge graph ground truth and introduce overconfidence in sourcing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that Emerson’s gain improves financial position while General Dynamics faces FX risk via forward contracts. However, the conclusion that GD’s risk is 'non-material' contradicts the original answer’s characterization of 'significant exposure' and 'material market risk,' weakening the qualitative accuracy. This misrepresents GD’s risk profile. (4) Despite these issues, the answer addresses both companies, the correct financial events, and the core theme of international financial risk, maintaining contextual relevance. The reasoning structure is logical and well-organized, but the introduction of unverified calculations and contradictory risk assessments reduces overall correctness. Hence, a score of 6 is warranted: partially correct but with significant factual and interpretive errors.",

      "original_answer": "Altria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The benefit is measured as the largest amount greater than 50% likely of being realized. PepsiCo, on the other hand, focuses on internal controls and procedures to identify uncertain tax positions, involving tax professionals to evaluate the company's tax structure, transactions, and interpretations of tax law, particularly transfer pricing arrangements. PepsiCo also monitors for new information such as tax examination progress or new tax laws that could affect unrecognized tax benefits. This indicates that while Altria emphasizes a quantitative threshold (more than 50% likelihood of realization), PepsiCo emphasizes procedural rigor and continuous reassessment based on evolving legal and regulatory inputs.",
      "llm_answer": "Altria’s policy is to **recognize a tax‑benefit on the balance sheet as soon as a position is more‑likely‑than‑not (greater than 50 % probability) of being sustained**, measuring the benefit at the largest amount that meets that threshold and adding any related interest and penalties to the income‑tax provision (see Altria Note 63). PepsiCo, by contrast, treats uncertain positions as **unrecognized tax benefits** – it records a liability (a reserve) and relies on extensive internal controls to identify, evaluate and monitor those positions, without recognizing a benefit until the uncertainty is resolved (see PepsiCo discussion of the “unrecognized tax benefits process” on page 121). Thus Altria’s approach leans toward early benefit recognition, while PepsiCo’s approach is more conservative, emphasizing liability containment and ongoing monitoring.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) It correctly states that Altria recognizes a tax benefit only when it is more-likely-than-not (greater than 50% probability) to be sustained, and measures it as the largest amount meeting that threshold—this matches the original answer’s description of Altria’s quantitative threshold. The mention of interest and penalties being added to the income-tax provision is an additional detail not in the ground truth but consistent with typical accounting treatment and does not contradict it. (2) For PepsiCo, the LLM correctly identifies that uncertain positions are treated as unrecognized tax benefits, recorded as liabilities (reserves), and managed through internal controls and ongoing monitoring. It accurately captures PepsiCo’s procedural rigor and conservative stance of not recognizing benefits until uncertainty is resolved. The reference to page 121 and the 'unrecognized tax benefits process' adds contextual support. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model contrasts Altria’s early recognition approach with PepsiCo’s conservative, liability-focused method, synthesizing information across both companies’ tax policies. (4) Minor difference: the original emphasizes PepsiCo’s focus on transfer pricing and evolving legal inputs more explicitly, while the LLM generalizes this as 'ongoing monitoring'—a slight omission but not a factual error. Overall, all entities, metrics, and reasoning are correct. Quantitative accuracy is perfect (50% threshold correctly stated). Qualitative accuracy is excellent, with only slight compression of PepsiCo’s detailed process. Contextual relevance is full and appropriate.",

      "question": "How did the reclassification of geographic markets by ACN and the reallocation of goodwill by INTC in their respective 2023 10-K filings impact their financial reporting consistency and segment performance evaluation for prior periods?",
      "original_answer": "ACN reclassified prior period amounts due to the movement of Middle East and Africa market units into the EMEA geographic market, which affected the presentation of operating income by region, such as a 9% increase in overall operating income and specific changes in EMEA driven by foreign exchange rates and cost reductions. Meanwhile, INTC adjusted all prior-period amounts in its goodwill footnote to reflect changes in operating segments, reallocating goodwill among reporting units based on relative fair value. Both companies modified historical financial reporting to align with current segment structures, enhancing comparability and performance evaluation across periods, though through different financial mechanisms—ACN through geographic market realignment and INTC through goodwill reallocation.",
      "llm_answer": "Accenture disclosed that, beginning in Q1 2024, it moved its Middle East‑and‑Africa units from “Growth Markets” into the Europe market, creating a combined EMEA segment; all prior‑period operating‑income and margin numbers for those regions were retrospectively re‑classified so that the historic data now line up with the new geographic layout, preserving comparability across periods. Intel similarly restated its goodwill balances in the first quarter of 2022, reallocating goodwill among reporting units on a fair‑value basis to reflect a revised operating‑segment structure; the retrospective adjustment means prior‑period goodwill amounts are consistent with the new segment map and can be evaluated alongside current‑period segment performance without distortion.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer captures the core concepts correctly: both ACN and INTC made retrospective changes to prior-period financial reporting to align with current segment structures, enhancing comparability. However, there are key factual inaccuracies affecting quantitative accuracy. First, the LLM states Accenture's change began in Q1 2024, but the 2023 10-K filing indicates the reclassification was effective in 2023, not 2024—this is a material date error. Second, the LLM incorrectly claims Intel restated goodwill in Q1 2022, while the ground truth specifies the adjustment was disclosed in the 2023 10-K and applied to prior periods as part of a current-year segment realignment, not a 2022 event. These timing errors reduce confidence in the factual precision. The qualitative reasoning is sound—LLM correctly identifies that both companies used retrospective reallocations (geographic reclassification for ACN, goodwill reallocation for INTC) to improve performance evaluation consistency. The mechanisms and purposes (comparability, undistorted evaluation) are accurately conveyed. Entity identification (ACN, INTC, goodwill, operating segments) is correct, and the answer addresses all parts of the multi-hop question. While the specific numerical impact (e.g., 9% increase in operating income in EMEA) from the ground truth is missing, the LLM does not fabricate numbers but omits them, which affects completeness and quantitative accuracy. Overall, the answer is semantically close and contextually relevant, but the incorrect dates and missing quantitative details prevent a higher score.",

According to the ground truth, Duke Energy reported $255 million in Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities, but the LLM incorrectly calculates it as $413 million by summing subsidiary-level values that either include incorrect amounts or misinterpret the data (e.g., Piedmont's $118 million is likely not additive in this context). NextEra Energy’s figure of $1,023 million is correct and matches the ground truth. (2) The combined total is therefore miscalculated: LLM reports $1,436 million ($1,023 + $413), whereas the correct total is $1,278 million ($1,023 + $255). This is a material error in both components and final sum. The comparison statement that the combined total is 'about $1.0 billion higher' and '3.5 times' Duke’s liability is based on incorrect inputs and thus invalid. (3) The reasoning shows multi-hop capability—identifying both companies, extracting relevant line items, attempting aggregation, and making a comparison—but fails due to incorrect underlying data synthesis. The model appears to misunderstand whether subsidiary liabilities should be summed to derive the parent company total, leading to overstatement. (4) Despite accurate sourcing of NextEra’s number and correct identification of the metric and year, the major quantitative inaccuracy in Duke Energy’s liability severely undermines the answer’s correctness. Contextual relevance is high as all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate structure and references.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of the mark-to-market gains recognized by Emerson and UPS in their respective 2023 fiscal years is $3.36 billion. Emerson recognized a mark-to-market gain of $56 million on its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation, while UPS recorded a mark-to-market gain of $3.3 billion related to its pension obligations under the UPS/IBT Plan following the remeasurement triggered by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA). These gains differ significantly in context: Emerson's gain was tied to an equity investment in a specific company (National Instruments), whereas UPS's gain arose from pension accounting adjustments due to government financial assistance to the Central States Pension Fund under ARPA.",
      "llm_answer": "The two companies together reported a **$56 million** mark‑to‑market gain for fiscal 2023 – the entire amount came from Emerson’s $56 million gain on its equity investment in National Instruments Corporation. UPS did not record any mark‑to‑market gain in 2023 (its prior gains were related to actuarial remeasurements of pension‑plan assets, not to investment holdings). Thus, Emerson’s gain arose from a valuation increase on a corporate equity investment, whereas UPS’s 2023 results contain no comparable investment‑related gain.",

It claims the combined total is $56 million, attributing the entire amount to Emerson and stating UPS recorded no mark-to-market gain in 2023. However, the ground truth states that UPS recognized a $3.3 billion mark-to-market gain, leading to a correct combined total of $3.36 billion ($56 million from Emerson + $3.3 billion from UPS). The LLM incorrectly denies any gain for UPS, which is a major factual error. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: the LLM reports $56 million instead of $3.36 billion, missing $3.3 billion in value. This is not a formatting or rounding issue but a complete omission of a major financial figure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails entirely. The model does not synthesize the correct information from both companies’ 2023 filings. It mischaracterizes UPS’s gain as unrelated to mark-to-market accounting and incorrectly limits it to prior years, contradicting the ground truth that UPS’s $3.3 billion gain was a 2023 remeasurement due to ARPA. (4) Contextual relevance is partially present—Emerson’s gain context is correctly described as related to its equity investment in National Instruments—but UPS’s context is entirely misrepresented. The LLM fails to mention ARPA, the Central States Pension Fund, or the pension obligation remeasurement, which are central to the correct answer.

      "question": "What is the combined impact of the Foreign-derived Intangible Income (FDII) deduction on the effective tax rates of AVGO and CSCO in fiscal year 2022, and how does this compare to the previous year's combined impact?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, AVGO did not claim the FDII deduction (impact = 0.0%), while CSCO reported a negative impact of 3.9% on its effective tax rate due to the FDII deduction. Therefore, the combined impact of the FDII deduction on the effective tax rates of AVGO and CSCO in 2022 was -3.9%. In 2021, AVGO reported an FDII deduction impact of -3.1%, and CSCO reported an impact of -4.2%. Thus, the combined impact in 2021 was -7.3%. This shows a smaller tax benefit from the FDII deduction in 2022 compared to 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022 the FDII deduction reduced the combined effective tax rate of the two companies by roughly **3.9 percentage points** – the entire effect came from Cisco (Broadcom reported no FDII benefit). In the prior year, FY 2021, the combined FDII impact was larger, lowering the effective tax rate by about **7.3 percentage points** (Broadcom ‑ 3.1 pp plus Cisco ‑ 4.2 pp).",

(1) All factual information is accurate: AVGO had no FDII deduction impact in FY2022 (0.0%), CSCO had a -3.9% impact, resulting in a combined -3.9% effect. In FY2021, AVGO had -3.1%, CSCO had -4.2%, summing to -7.3%. The LLM correctly reports these values using 'percentage points' (pp), which is appropriate for changes in tax rates. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both individual and combined impacts are correctly stated, and the comparison between years is accurate. The calculation of combined impact (0.0 + (-3.9) = -3.9 and (-3.1) + (-4.2) = -7.3) is sound. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is correctly applied: the model synthesizes data across two companies (AVGO and CSCO) and two fiscal years (2022 and 2021), computes combined effects, and compares them year-over-year. (4) Entity accuracy is maintained: correct company names (Broadcom/AVGO, Cisco/CSCO), correct fiscal years (2022, 2021), and correct metric (FDII impact on effective tax rate).

The difference between the two is 359 million shares. This difference reflects the distinct capital structures of the two companies, with AbbVie having a larger share base, potentially due to differences in financing strategies, stock issuance, or buyback activities.",

According to the ground truth, AbbVie's 2021 weighted-average diluted shares outstanding was 1,673 million, but the LLM reports 1,777 million—a difference of 104 million shares. Similarly, CVS Health’s correct value is 1,314 million, but the LLM reports 1,329 million, an overstatement of 15 million. These errors directly impact the calculated difference: the correct difference is 359 million shares, but the LLM calculates ≈448 million (1,777 - 1,329), which is off by 89 million. Despite this, the LLM correctly identifies the general direction of the comparison (AbbVie has more shares than CVS). (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM’s incorrect numbers (1,777 - 1,329 ≈ 448 million, which the LLM rounds to 0.45 billion), but since the inputs are wrong, the result is factually incorrect. (3) The reasoning about capital structure is plausible and aligns with the type of analysis expected—linking share count to equity focus and referencing CVS’s debt and buybacks shows multi-hop synthesis across concepts. However, this reasoning is based on incorrect data, weakening its validity.

COP, in contrast, discloses its global average production cost per BOE as part of its supplementary data but does not break it down regionally.

This leads to an incorrect cost difference of $3 per barrel instead of the correct $9.32 difference. The Canada/Other Americas figure ($22.47) is accurate. (2) The calculation of the cost gap is therefore wrong: $25.31 - $22.47 = $2.84 (not $3), and more importantly, it should be $31.79 - $22.47 = $9.32. This error undermines the core quantitative comparison. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that lower costs imply higher profitability and correctly notes that COP does not provide regional cost breakdowns, only a global average. This shows correct multi-hop synthesis between XOM and COP disclosures. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question (XOM's regional cost impact on profitability and contrast with COP's disclosures). However, due to the major error in the European cost figure and the resulting miscalculated difference, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are significantly reduced.

      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) experienced a 198 basis point decrease in its Net Charge-Off Rate to 1.90% in 2021, which contributed to a $8.2 billion decrease in the Provision for Credit Losses, resulting in a benefit of $902 million due to strong credit performance. This improvement indicates better loan recovery or fewer defaults, which enhances profitability and reduces risk. PayPal (PYPL), on the other hand, defines its Net Charge-Off Rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily loan balance. This definition implies that PYPL’s credit risk exposure is directly tied to the performance of its merchant loan portfolio, and a higher Net Charge-Off Rate would signal increased credit deterioration and potential financial loss.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One said that its credit‑card net‑charge‑off rate fell 198 basis points to 1.90 % in 2021, which allowed the company to cut its provision for credit losses by $8.2 billion (turning the provision into a $902 million benefit) and helped lift operating income and cash‑flow from operations (operating income rose to $4.3 billion and cash from operations to $6.3 billion)【page_71】.  \n\nPayPal defines net‑charge‑off rate as “the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on consumer loans receivable as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivable”【page_44】, so any increase in that rate would directly raise its credit‑loss expense and signal greater credit‑risk exposure, while a decline would indicate improving credit quality and lower risk.",

All numeric values (percentages, dollar amounts, basis points) are correct and properly contextualized. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 198 bps drop, 1.90% rate, $8.2B reduction in provision, and $902M benefit are all factually accurate and consistent with the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it correctly links the decline in charge-offs to lower provisions and improved financial performance for Capital One, and separately explains PayPal’s definition and its implications for credit risk. However, there is a minor discrepancy in PayPal’s definition: the original answer specifies 'merchant loans and advances' while the LLM cites 'consumer loans receivable'—this is a meaningful difference in portfolio focus (merchant vs. consumer), slightly reducing qualitative accuracy. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the answer addresses both parts of the question, synthesizes financial impact and risk implications, and maintains focus on credit risk exposure. The only issue is the mischaracterization of PayPal’s loan portfolio type, which does not affect the overall logic but reduces precision in entity-specific detail.",

      "original_answer": "AIG reported $1,200 million in securities collateral pledged to them as of December 31, 2023, while COF reported $13 million in securities collateral pledged under master netting agreements as part of their derivative liabilities. The difference between these amounts is $1,187 million. In terms of net exposure, COF reported a net exposure of $2,322 million after accounting for all collateral, while AIG’s disclosure does not include a net exposure figure but highlights a significant amount of collateral held. This contrast suggests different collateral management strategies or risk exposures in their derivative and repurchase agreements.",

Because AIG’s pledged securities are far larger, they offset a much greater portion of its derivative and repurchase‑agreement obligations, leaving AIG with a relatively modest net exposure, while COF’s tiny securities‑collateral amount leaves it with a net exposure of about **$2.3 billion** after accounting for its derivative liabilities.",

The calculated difference of $1.187 billion is accurate and matches the ground truth ($1,200M - $13M = $1,187M). Number formats are acceptable variations (e.g., $1.2 billion = $1,200 million). (2) However, the LLM makes a critical error in interpreting net exposure. It claims AIG has a 'relatively modest net exposure' due to large collateral offsets, but the original answer explicitly states that AIG’s disclosure does not include a net exposure figure. This is a significant qualitative inaccuracy. Conversely, the LLM correctly reports COF’s net exposure as approximately $2.3 billion, aligning with the ground truth of $2,322 million (rounded appropriately). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly contrasting collateral amounts and linking them to net exposure concepts—but fails in accurately representing AIG’s lack of disclosed net exposure, leading to an unsupported inference.

In contrast, T disclosed a consistent increase in amortization of network software, reaching $3,076 million in 2024, indicating sustained investment in software supporting its network infrastructure.

ACN utilized its syndicated credit facility to issue $935 million in commercial paper as of August 31, 2024, while INTC had no commercial paper outstanding as of December 30, 2023, having repaid its $3.9 billion commercial paper balance from the prior year.

It states Accenture's commercial paper increased from $0.10 million to $0.94 million, implying a $0.84 million increase, but the ground truth reports a $935 million increase for ACN in fiscal 2024. This is off by a factor of over 1,000, likely due to misreading units (e.g., confusing millions with billions or misreading values). For INTC, the LLM correctly identifies the decrease from $3.9 billion to $0, which aligns with the original answer. However, the net change calculation of a $3.9 billion drop is misleading because the question asks for the 'total change in commercial paper outstanding between ACN and INTC'—not a net change. The correct interpretation should highlight the contrast: ACN increased by $935M while INTC decreased by $3.9B, not combine them into a single net figure. (2) Calculations are partially correct for INTC but fundamentally wrong for ACN. The $0.84 million increase is incorrect; it should be $935 million. The use of 'million' instead of 'billion' suggests a unit error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing two companies’ commercial paper changes across recent fiscal years—but misrepresents the magnitude of ACN’s issuance. The conclusion that Accenture modestly expanded while Intel eliminated CP is directionally correct but understates ACN’s activity due to the numerical error. (4) Contextual relevance is strong—the answer addresses both companies, the change in commercial paper, and infers strategic differences. However, the severe quantitative error in ACN’s value undermines the correctness score. The qualitative reasoning is reasonable given the data it uses, but the input data is wrong.

For PM, volume-based incentives are treated as reductions of revenue and are recorded as sales occur, based on estimates of customer target achievement. These estimates directly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized for both companies, though each uses a different method for incorporating these incentives into financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "The Coca‑Cola filing explains that volume‑based incentive programs are treated as **variable consideration** – the company estimates the amount of the incentive that it expects to earn (based on customer sales volumes, inventories, pricing, etc.) and includes that estimate in the transaction price, so the net‑operating‑revenue figure reflects the incentive‑adjusted amount that is not expected to reverse. In the Philip Morris filing, volume‑based incentives are accounted for as **trade‑promotion costs**; management evaluates each customer’s likelihood of meeting the volume targets and records a reduction of revenue (or a promotion expense) as the sales occur, which drives the estimate of total trade‑promotion expense.",

(1) It correctly identifies that for KO, volume-based incentives are treated as variable consideration and included in net operating revenues based on estimates involving customer sales volumes and other factors. For PM, it accurately states that these incentives are treated as trade promotion costs (or reductions of revenue) recorded as sales occur, based on estimates of target achievement. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information from both KO and PM's 2022 10-Ks, contrasting their accounting treatments—KO including incentives in transaction price (revenue estimation), PM recording them as contemporaneous reductions (expense estimation). (4) The only minor shortcoming is a slight rephrasing difference: the LLM mentions 'reduction of revenue (or a promotion expense)' for PM, while the original answer specifies it as a reduction of revenue recorded as sales occur. However, this does not distort the meaning, as trade promotion costs effectively reduce revenue. The answer is semantically equivalent, well-structured, and fully addresses both parts of the question with correct entities (KO, PM, 2022 context implied), accurate terminology, and strong contextual relevance.",

      "original_answer": "PYPL explicitly excludes fraud losses from its net charge-off rate calculation, whereas COF does not specify such an exclusion in its reporting. This difference in methodology makes it difficult to directly compare COF's 0.37% net charge-off rate in 2021 with PYPL's rate, as PYPL's metric reflects only non-fraud credit losses, potentially presenting a more favorable credit performance picture for PYPL if fraud losses were material.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal’s 2021 net‑charge‑off rate is calculated **after removing fraud losses** – the filing explicitly says the rate “excludes fraud losses” (PYPL 10‑K p. 44). Capital One’s disclosed net‑charge‑off rate for 2021 does not contain a similar exclusion; the note on the rate provides no reference to fraud losses (COF 10‑K p. 76). Because PayPal strips out fraud‑related write‑offs while Capital One leaves them in, the two rates are not directly comparable – Capital One’s figure is likely higher (or at least not adjusted) for fraud activity that PayPal’s rate omits.",

These details match the original answer’s core claim about differing methodologies. (2) There are no numerical figures (e.g., 0.37%) explicitly mentioned in the LLM answer, which is a minor omission compared to the original answer that includes COF’s 0.37% rate.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information from two different companies’ filings, identifies the difference in accounting treatment, and draws the valid conclusion that this affects comparability. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and conveys the same essential insight as the original: PYPL’s exclusion of fraud losses makes direct comparison with COF’s rate misleading. The only reason for not giving a perfect 10 is the omission of COF’s reported 0.37% rate, which was present in the ground truth and adds precision.

Duke Energy reported $116 million in noncurrent derivative assets, while NextEra Energy reported $1,135 million.

The much larger non‑current derivative position at NextEra reflects its extensive use of long‑dated commodity, interest‑rate and foreign‑currency contracts to hedge the price, financing and currency risks associated with its growing renewable‑generation portfolio and long‑term power‑purchase agreements, whereas Duke Energy’s relatively modest amount suggests a more limited reliance on long‑term hedges, focusing instead on shorter‑term risk management or a different financing strategy.",

However, it reports Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative assets as $93 million, whereas the ground truth is $116 million. This discrepancy affects quantitative accuracy but does not alter the overall conclusion significantly. 2) The calculation of the total ($93M + $1,135M = $1,228M) is mathematically correct with the given numbers, but since Duke Energy's value is underreported, the input to the sum is slightly inaccurate. The final total matches the ground truth only if the correct Duke Energy figure is used ($116M + $1,135M = $1,251M — which actually suggests a possible error in the ground truth or LLM source data; however, the LLM’s total aligns with the stated ground truth total despite the component mismatch, indicating potential rounding or reporting differences acknowledged in context). 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts the correct metric (noncurrent derivative assets), applies the correct date (December 31, 2021), and synthesizes across entities to compute the total. The qualitative interpretation of strategic differences — linking NextEra’s larger position to long-term hedging in renewables and PPAs — is insightful and consistent with sector dynamics. 4) Despite the minor discrepancy in Duke Energy’s reported value, the overall answer conveys nearly identical information to the ground truth, with strong contextual and semantic alignment.

According to the ground truth, the increase in proved reserves from extensions and discoveries for COP in 2023 is 335 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE), but the LLM reports 312 MMBOE. For XOM, the correct value is 1,065 MMBOE, but the LLM incorrectly states 1,997 MMBOE. These errors affect the combined total, which should be 1,400 MMBOE, but the LLM does not compute or report this correctly due to wrong inputs. Additionally, the LLM claims XOM's total proved reserves decreased from 37.6 billion to 34.5 billion barrels, implying a drop of 3,100 MMBOE, which contradicts the context of reserve growth and is not supported by the ground truth. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM’s stated net reserve changes (e.g., COP increasing by 292 MMBOE) are inconsistent with the reported extensions and discoveries, suggesting internal logic errors. The ground truth emphasizes reserve growth, while the LLM implies decline for XOM, which misrepresents the situation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially attempted—LLM identifies both companies and attempts to link extensions/discoveries to overall reserve trends—but fails due to incorrect data sourcing. It incorrectly infers that XOM had a reserve decline despite large additions, which contradicts the ground truth that both companies showed growth. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent align with the question (discussing extensions, discoveries, and impact on reserves), but the factual foundation is unsound. Due to major quantitative errors and resulting incorrect conclusions about reserve trends, the correctness score is low at 2. Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised (score 2), qualitative reasoning is weak due to flawed data synthesis (score 3), and contextual relevance is acceptable only in framing (score 6).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors despite correct entity identification and addressing all parts of the question. While the individual net PPE values for ACN ($1,659,140) and QCOM ($5,168,000) are correct in magnitude, the LLM incorrectly labels them as 'million', turning $1.659 billion and $5.168 billion into trillions—this is a critical error. The combined total is reported as $1,664,308 million (≈$1.66 trillion), which is wildly incorrect; the correct combined value is $6,827,140 (about $6.83 billion), not trillions. This mislabeling invalidates the core numerical result. (2) The accumulated depreciation percentages are approximately correct: 60% for ACN (vs. exact 60.0%) and 56% for QCOM (vs. 56.1%), which is acceptable rounding. However, the LLM again adds 'million' to the gross and depreciation figures (e.g., $2,490,187 million), which is factually wrong—the original data is in thousands. For example, ACN’s gross PPE is $4,149,327,000, not $4,149,327 million ($4.149 trillion). These formatting errors distort the actual scale by a factor of 1,000. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies both companies, retrieves net PPE, calculates depreciation ratios, and compares them. The logic and synthesis across entities are correct. (4) Contextual relevance is high as all sub-questions are addressed with appropriate financial metrics. However, due to severe quantitative inaccuracies in units and totals, the correctness score is low. The answer is semantically close but factually flawed in magnitude, which is critical in financial analysis.",

Inventory figures are also accurate: $18,647 million for COST and $9,453 million for PM. Percentages (55% and ~47%) are correctly approximated based on the provided data. 2) Calculations are precise: 34,246 + 20,170 = 54,416, and the percentage breakdowns are reasonable estimates (18,647 / 34,246 ≈ 54.45% → 55%; 9,453 / 20,170 ≈ 46.86% → 47%). 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (COST and PM) and interprets their inventory strategies in context—COST’s retail warehouse model vs. PM’s manufacturing orientation. It correctly identifies that PM’s inventory includes raw materials (leaf tobacco) and work-in-process, though it adds 'receivables and other current assets' as a comparative point not emphasized in the original, which slightly extends beyond the ground truth but does not contradict it. 4) The qualitative interpretation aligns well with the original: COST’s high merchandise inventory reflects its retail model; PM’s inventory composition reflects manufacturing. The only minor gap is that the original specifies PM’s finished product as $5,112 million, a detail the LLM omits, but it does correctly describe the broader composition. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, contextually appropriate, and demonstrates strong synthesis—just missing one specific sub-component of PM’s inventory breakdown, which prevents a perfect 10.

The LLM incorrectly concludes that organic growth was nearly identical, when in fact it differed substantially.

This error propagates through the calculation, leading to an incorrect combined total of $87,900 million instead of the correct $77,507 million. The value for Morgan Stanley’s securities-based lending exposure ($74,594 million) and total lending exposure ($89,245 million) are correct.

This increase put upward pressure on total costs, likely compressing operating margins unless offset by revenue growth. In contrast, T saw a $395 million decrease in Other Cost of Revenues due to a change in accounting estimate that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs, which improved their operating margin by reducing current-period expenses. These contrasting trends reflect GOOGL’s strategic investments and restructuring while T optimized accounting policies to enhance margin performance.",

The jump was driven mainly by higher content‑acquisition spend on YouTube, a $479 million severance charge and other compensation costs, and was partially offset by a depreciation reduction that resulted from a longer estimated life for servers and network gear.  Because total cost‑of‑revenues stayed at about 43 % of revenue (down from 45 % in 2022), the rise in other costs was largely absorbed by revenue growth, leaving Alphabet’s operating margin essentially unchanged (and slightly better on a percentage basis).\n\n- AT&T’s “Other cost of revenues” grew by only a few hundred million dollars in 2023 – the deferred‑acquisition‑cost amortization rose from $2.94 billion to $3.48 billion (≈ $0.54 billion) while fulfillment‑cost amortization was flat.  The increase reflects higher promotional‑equipment sales and the related amortization of customer‑contract acquisition costs, not a change in core network or content spend.

This is a direct contradiction. For GOOGL, the $5.2 billion increase and $479 million severance charge are correctly reported, which supports partial quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation of GOOGL’s cost increase from $77.2B to $82.4B = $5.2B is accurate. However, the claim that AT&T’s deferred acquisition cost amortization rose from $2.94B to $3.48B (a $0.54B increase) contradicts the ground truth that T saw a *decrease* in Other Cost of Revenues. This error invalidates the quantitative and qualitative accuracy for T. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails for T: instead of recognizing that a change in accounting estimate reduced expenses and improved margins, the LLM claims costs increased and pressured margins—exactly the opposite of the truth. For GOOGL, the reasoning is stronger: it correctly identifies YouTube content costs and severance as drivers, and notes that margin was stable due to revenue growth, which aligns with the ground truth implication. However, the ground truth emphasizes upward pressure on margins unless offset, while the LLM concludes margin was unchanged—this nuance is partially correct but oversimplified. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to one major correct component (GOOGL’s cost increase and drivers) but a complete reversal of facts for T. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because GOOGL numbers are correct but T’s are not. Qualitative accuracy is 4 due to correct reasoning for GOOGL but fundamentally flawed logic for T.

According to the ground truth, MCD's Net P&E is $20.1 billion ($20,100 million), but the LLM reports $24,907.6 million—overstating by nearly $4.8 billion. Similarly, MCD's gross Property and Equipment is stated as $43,570 million and accumulated depreciation as $18,662.4 million in the LLM answer, but the ground truth indicates gross of $34.6 billion (implied: $20.1B + $14.5B) and accumulated depreciation of $14.5 billion. These numbers do not align with the verified data. The combined Net P&E is therefore also incorrect: LLM reports ~$51.1 billion vs. ground truth of $45.754 billion—a material overstatement of over $5.3 billion. Only HD's numbers ($26.154 billion Net P&E, $53.257 billion gross, $27.103 billion accumulated depreciation) are accurate and correctly formatted.

The sum of $26,154 + $24,907.6 = $51,061.6 million is mathematically correct but based on false premises. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across two companies and explain how accumulated depreciation impacts net values—this structure is sound and shows understanding of the required logic. However, the reasoning fails due to reliance on incorrect source data for MCD, undermining the conclusion. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major factual inaccuracies in core numbers. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2/10) because MCD's figures are significantly off. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4/10) as the conceptual framework and use of correct metrics are present, but entity-specific data is flawed.

However, the LLM incorrectly states that XOM added 335 million and COP added 219 million, reversing and misstating the values. The calculated sum of 554 MMBOE is therefore incorrect. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: both individual company figures and the final sum are wrong. The correct sum is 1,067 MMBOE, not 554 MMBOE—a substantial deviation. (3) While the LLM attempts multi-hop reasoning by combining data from both companies and interpreting the contribution to overall reserve growth, the reasoning is based on incorrect inputs, undermining the validity of the conclusion. The claim that this addition 'supplied the bulk' may be directionally reasonable, but it's unsupported by accurate data. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the right question structure and discusses the appropriate concept (contribution to reserve growth), but due to major numerical inaccuracies, the response fails on correctness.

      "original_answer": "ACN adjusts its tax liabilities or assets quarterly based on changing facts and circumstances, such as audit progress or statute expirations, and acknowledges that final determinations could materially differ from estimates, impacting income tax provision, net income, or cash flows. QCOM, on the other hand, participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process for tax years prior to fiscal 2021, aiming to resolve all issues with the IRS before filing its federal return, which may reduce the likelihood of unexpected tax liabilities. If both companies were to face unexpected tax liabilities not accounted for in their estimates, ACN would likely record adjustments to its tax liabilities in the period the new information arises, while QCOM may experience a larger-than-anticipated reversal of previously recorded tax liabilities, both affecting their financial statements significantly but through different mechanisms.",
      "llm_answer": "Accenture (ACN) evaluates its tax positions each quarter and “adjusts the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances” (page 39). Therefore, if an unexpected tax liability arises, the impact would be reflected in the quarter in which the audit or other information is received – changing that period’s income‑tax expense, net income and the deferred‑tax balances on the balance sheet on a timely, incremental basis.  \n\nQualcomm (QCOM) notes that for tax years prior to fiscal 2021 it participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process, seeking to resolve all issues “prior to filing” its return (page 71), and it records uncertain‑tax‑position reserves only when the facts become known (page 70). Consequently, an unexpected liability would likely be recognized later – when the IRS resolution is finalized – potentially resulting in a larger, one‑time adjustment to income‑tax expense and a retroactive change to prior‑year tax assets or liabilities rather than a quarterly tweak.",

QCOM participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process for years prior to fiscal 2021, resolving issues before filing, which reduces the likelihood of surprises; if an unexpected liability occurs, it would likely be recognized upon final resolution, leading to a potentially larger, one-time adjustment. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, years beyond 'fiscal 2021') in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—only correct fiscal year reference (pre-2021) is used, matching the original. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes ACN’s quarterly adjustment policy with its financial statement impact and contrasts it with QCOM’s pre-filing resolution approach and its implications for timing and magnitude of adjustments.

However, the ground truth states that TMO's impact was 5.5 percentage points higher than DHR's, not 1.5. This is a major factual and calculation error. (2) The numbers provided in the LLM answer (3% and 1.5%) are not supported by the ground truth, which does not specify the individual contribution percentages but does state the difference is 5.5 points. Even if the individual values were estimates, the resulting difference is incorrect. The calculation of '3% - 1.5% = 1.5 pp' is mathematically correct but based on wrong inputs, leading to a wrong conclusion. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—comparing the two companies' acquisition/divestiture impacts—but fails in multi-hop synthesis because it uses incorrect underlying data. The mention of Danaher’s Environmental & Applied Solutions segment is extraneous and not relevant to the question, suggesting possible confusion in entity-metric mapping. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies and the correct factor (acquisitions/divestitures impact on revenue growth), but the quantitative inaccuracy severely undermines correctness.

This indicates a growing pressure on Google's cost structure from content and labor-related expenses. AT&T's disclosure reveals that amortization costs related to customer contract acquisition and fulfillment—primarily included in 'Selling, general and administrative' and 'Other cost of revenues'—suggest a different composition of operational expenses focused on customer acquisition rather than content and labor.

      "original_answer": "Accenture's total cash outlay for dividends in 2022 was $2,457,306, while Qualcomm paid $3,212 in dividends during the same period. This indicates that Accenture allocated significantly more capital to dividend payments compared to Qualcomm, which focused more heavily on stock repurchases ($3,129) as part of its capital return strategy. The data suggests that Accenture prioritized consistent cash returns to shareholders through dividends, whereas Qualcomm balanced its shareholder returns more evenly between dividends and share buybacks.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022 Accenture paid roughly **$2.5 million** in cash dividends (see the “Total Dividends” line on page 94), whereas Qualcomm paid **about $3.2 billion** in cash dividends (see the “Dividends Amount” line on page 46). The contrast shows that Accenture’s capital‑return strategy is heavily weighted toward modest dividend payouts and larger share‑repurchase activity, while Qualcomm relies more on a sizable dividend to return cash to shareholders, reflecting the two companies’ differing approaches to distributing earnings.",

It states Accenture paid $2.5 million in dividends, but the ground truth is $2,457,306,306 (approximately $2.46 billion), making the LLM's figure off by a factor of 1,000. Conversely, it claims Qualcomm paid $3.2 billion, but the correct amount is $3,212 (about $3.2 thousand), again reversing the scale. These errors completely invert the comparison. (2) The numbers are not only incorrect but misattributed in magnitude: Accenture’s dividend is understated, Qualcomm’s is overstated by a billion-fold. Calculations and comparisons based on these values are therefore entirely invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model draws the opposite conclusion: it suggests Accenture pays modest dividends and Qualcomm large ones, when the truth is that Accenture paid over $2.4 billion in dividends while Qualcomm paid only $3,212, indicating Qualcomm barely uses dividends and instead favors buybacks ($3,129 million). The LLM incorrectly portrays Qualcomm as dividend-heavy and Accenture as buyback-focused, which contradicts the ground truth. (4) Despite referencing correct document locations (page numbers), the data extraction is catastrophically inaccurate. The qualitative reasoning would be plausible if numbers were correct, but they are not. Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure addresses capital return strategies, but the substance is fundamentally flawed. Correctness and quantitative accuracy are extremely low due to magnitude errors and reversed conclusions.",

This led to a core sales growth (non-GAAP) of 23.0% for DHR and an organic growth rate of 15% for TMO.

According to the ground truth, DHR's acquisitions/divestitures had a negative impact of 16.5%, not 7.5% as stated in the LLM answer. Similarly, TMO's positive contribution was 5%, not 3%. These errors directly affect the accuracy of the comparison. Additionally, the LLM claims both companies had ~23% organic growth, but the ground truth states DHR had 23.0% while TMO had 15%, making the organic growth difference 8 percentage points, not 'virtually no difference.' (2) The numbers are quantitatively incorrect: the impact difference should be -21.5 percentage points (16.5 negative + 5 positive), but the LLM implies a difference of only -10.5 points (7.5 subtracted vs 3 added), and reports nearly identical organic growth rates when they differ by 8 points. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model incorrectly synthesizes the effects on core sales and organic growth. It incorrectly concludes that organic growth rates were similar, which contradicts the ground truth. The model appears to have conflated total growth with organic growth or used incorrect source data. (4) Despite these major factual errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies (DHR and TMO), the correct year (2021), and the right metrics (acquisition impact and organic growth).

In contrast, PYPL's 2024 10-K filing indicates that its Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) are included as part of the standard financial statement package and does not disclose any such deconsolidation or reclassification during the year.

(2) Calculations are sound: the combined net cash flow is correctly derived (~$26.1B - $3.6B = $22.5B, though stated as $22.4B — likely due to rounding down from $22.44B), and the qualitative description of PFE’s reversal and TMO’s increased outflow is accurate.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in XOM's reserve numbers. According to the ground truth, XOM's total proved reserves decreased from 14,258 million to 13,716 million (a decline of 542 million barrels), but the LLM incorrectly states a drop from 17,742 million to 16,928 million (814 million decline), which is factually wrong. COP's numbers are correct: an increase from 6,599 million to 6,758 million (159 million gain). (2) Calculations: The LLM's combined decline of 'about 655 million' is incorrect. Using its own (wrong) numbers, the decline would be (17,742 + 6,599) - (16,928 + 6,758) = 24,341 - 23,686 = 655 million, so the arithmetic based on its inputs is correct, but the inputs themselves are wrong. The correct combined change is a decrease from 20,857 million to 20,474 million, a net drop of 383 million barrels (1.8%), which the LLM fails to report. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to combine XOM and COP reserves and compute a net change, showing sound reasoning structure, but the conclusion is invalid due to incorrect base data. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual inaccuracies in core data; Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because XOM's reserves are significantly overstated; Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the logic and entity identification (COP, XOM, reserves) are correct, but one entity's data is wrong; Contextual relevance is high (8/10) because the answer addresses the right question structure and metric.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative values and total calculation. While it correctly identifies Merck's $779 million impairment charge in 2023 for MK-7264, it incorrectly states that Johnson & Johnson recorded $0.2 billion ($200 million) in *both* 2023 and 2024 for M710. According to the ground truth, J&J recorded a $200 million *partial* impairment in 2023 and a $200 million *full* impairment in 2024 — but the total impairment across both years should still be $400 million, not $400 million per year. However, the key error is in the total: the LLM calculates $0.2B + $0.2B + $0.779B = $1.179B (~$1.18B), which is incorrect because the original answer states the *combined total* is $979 million. This implies that the J&J total across both years is $200 million (not $400 million), meaning the LLM has doubled J&J’s actual impairment. (2) The calculation is therefore fundamentally flawed: $200M (J&J total) + $779M (Merck) = $979M total — not $1.18B. The LLM’s total is off by $201 million due to misrepresenting the timing and nature of J&J’s charges. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — it connects two companies, two assets, and respective years — but fails in synthesis by misreading the impairment pattern for M710. It treats the 2023 and 2024 charges as separate $200M events without recognizing that the 2024 charge may represent the final write-off after partial prior impairment, and incorrectly assumes both are additive in full. (4) Contextual and qualitative elements are well-handled: the explanation of financial risk in late-stage development is appropriate and relevant. Entity names (Johnson & Johnson, Merck), drug names (M710, MK-7264), and years (2023, 2024) are correct. The reasoning about regulatory risk is aligned with the ground truth. However, the major numerical inaccuracy severely undermines factual correctness, warranting a low score on quantitative accuracy and overall correctness despite good structure and relevance.",

      "original_answer": "FedEx incurred $278 million in business realignment costs in 2022, which were specifically tied to workforce reductions in Europe and were managed through a structured program with expected future costs of approximately $420 million through fiscal 2023. These costs were directly linked to operational restructuring and were disclosed with specific estimates and timelines. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's approach to loss contingencies focuses on legal proceedings, where reserves are established based on U.S. GAAP assessments of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. Lockheed Martin does not provide specific dollar amounts for these contingencies, indicating uncertainty in predicting the materiality of potential costs, especially due to evolving legal and regulatory environments. This reflects a more conservative and reactive strategy for managing unpredictable liabilities compared to FedEx's proactive and quantifiably planned approach to known restructuring costs.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx treated the uncertainty from its Europe‑wide workforce‑reduction plan as a discrete, upfront expense – it booked $278 million of “business‑realignment costs” (net of tax) in 2022 and will continue to recognize cash outlays as the plan is executed. Lockheed Martin, by contrast, does not record a single charge for its legal risks; instead it follows U.S. GAAP by estimating the amount of each probable and reasonably‑measurable loss and establishing a reserve (or liability) on the balance sheet that is adjusted as cases develop. Thus FedEx’s approach is a one‑time restructuring charge, while Lockheed Martin’s approach is an ongoing reserve‑based accounting for uncertain contingencies.",

The absence of specific dollar amounts for Lockheed Martin’s contingencies is correctly reflected, consistent with the original answer. (2) The entity identification—FedEx and Lockheed Martin—and the financial events (business realignment costs vs. loss contingencies under U.S. GAAP) are correct, as are the years and accounting frameworks referenced.

      "question": "How does the difference in consulting contract duration and revenue recognition timing between ACN and ADBE affect their respective financial exposure to client contract cancellations?",
      "original_answer": "ACN faces higher financial exposure from client contract cancellations because many of its consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and can be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue loss with limited time to replace it. In contrast, ADBE recognizes consulting revenue on a time-and-materials or relative performance basis, meaning it earns revenue progressively as services are delivered, reducing the risk of unrecovered costs from sudden cancellations. This difference in contract duration and revenue recognition timing means ACN is more vulnerable to abrupt revenue shortfalls, while ADBE's approach aligns revenue with service delivery and mitigates financial impact from late-stage cancellations.",
      "llm_answer": "Accenture’s consulting agreements are typically ≤ 12 months and can be ended with as little as 30 days’ notice, so revenue is recognized as the work is performed and any cancellation removes the remaining billings almost immediately, leaving the firm highly exposed to short‑term revenue loss (Accenture – page 18). Adobe, by contrast, generates most of its revenue from multi‑year subscriptions that are recognized ratably over the contract term, while its consulting fees are recognized only as services are delivered; a cancellation therefore mainly eliminates future ratable revenue rather than erasing revenue already recognized, limiting the immediate financial impact (Adobe – page 45).

There are no numerical inaccuracies, so quantitative accuracy is perfect. Contextual relevance is high, as the response directly addresses the question about financial exposure due to contract duration and revenue recognition differences. However, the LLM introduces a significant factual deviation by emphasizing Adobe's 'multi-year subscriptions' and 'ratable revenue' from subscriptions, which shifts focus to Adobe's product model rather than its consulting contracts specifically. The original answer focuses on ADBE's consulting revenue recognition (time-and-materials or relative performance), not subscription revenue. This mischaracterization affects the qualitative accuracy: while the core idea—that ADBE recognizes revenue progressively—is correct, the reasoning conflates subscription revenue (which is not part of the consulting business) with consulting revenue, weakening the multi-hop synthesis. Thus, while the conclusion (ACN more exposed than ADBE) is correct and well-supported in part, the reasoning path contains a material misattribution, preventing a higher score.

The combined Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities is stated as $7.3 billion, derived from $5.358 billion (NEE) and $1.956 billion (DUK), which also sum accurately to $7.314 billion (rounded appropriately to $7.3 billion). The calculated percentage is 12.5% ($921M / $7.3B ≈ 0.1262 → 12.6% when rounded to one decimal), with the LLM reporting 12.5%, a minor rounding difference likely due to intermediate rounding.

(2) The calculation in the LLM answer ($990M - $200M = $790M) is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but since the input value for EMR is wrong, the final difference of $790M is incorrect. The correct difference is $958M ($990M - $32M). (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly identified the need to compare LMT’s pension contributions with EMR’s defined contribution expense—but failed in entity-specific data retrieval for EMR. It may have confused defined contribution expense with another line item or misread the source. (4) Due to the significant error in a core numerical fact (EMR's $32M vs. $200M), the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. Qualitative accuracy is partially preserved due to correct reasoning framework. Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses the right companies, years, and intent of the question.",

      "original_answer": "JNJ records accruals for legal proceedings and product liability claims based on management's judgment and actuarially determined estimates, with self-insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. Claims exceeding insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In contrast, MRK accrues for legal contingencies when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, with a portion of the accrual actuarially determined, factoring in past experience, reported claims, and estimates of claims not yet reported. MRK also specifically accounts for defense costs, with reserves of $225 million as of December 31, 2024, based on factors such as trial costs, case progression, and legal strategy. These differences reflect variations in risk management strategies and litigation exposure between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "**Accrual approach**\n\n* **Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)** – JNJ records a liability only when a loss is *probable* and the amount can be *reasonably estimated*.  The company layers a self‑insurance program with a captive insurer, so any claim that exceeds the insurance coverage is also accrued.  The legal‑defense reserve is set based on management’s judgment of the minimum cost that will be required and is adjusted as more information becomes available.\n\n* **Merck (MRK)** – MRK follows the same “probable‑and‑estimable” threshold, but it relies more heavily on actuarial modeling for product‑liability claims (splitting the accrual into an actuarial component) and on site‑specific cost estimates for environmental liabilities.  Legal‑defense reserves are also accrued, but MRK explicitly re‑measures environmental accruals as investigations, feasibility studies and the expected contribution of other responsible parties evolve.\n\n**Key factors that drive the amounts**\n\n* **JNJ:** actual legal costs incurred, the structure of its defense strategy, the number of pending cases, outcomes of completed trials, anticipated timing and pre‑trial expenses, and the amount of exposure that exceeds its self‑insurance coverage.\n\n* **MRK:** historical claim experience, the number of reported claims and estimates of incurred‑but‑not‑reported claims, actuarial assumptions (frequency, severity, discount rates), estimated transaction and remediation costs for Superfund or similar sites, progress of site investigations/feasibility studies, and the expected share of liability from other parties.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: both JNJ and MRK use the 'probable and reasonably estimable' threshold for accruals; JNJ uses management judgment and actuarial estimates with a captive insurer; MRK uses actuarial modeling, particularly for product liability, and accounts for defense costs. The LLM correctly identifies that MRK re-measures environmental accruals based on site-specific developments, which aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on evolving investigations and contributions from other parties. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: while the original answer mentions MRK's $225 million reserve as of December 31, 2024, the LLM does not include this specific number. However, it does not make any numerical claims, so there are no inaccuracies—this omission prevents a perfect score but does not constitute an error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in accrual strategies across two companies, identifies distinct influencing factors, and contrasts actuarial vs. judgment-based approaches. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—well-structured, relevant, and comprehensive. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of MRK’s $225 million defense reserve figure, which was present in the ground truth and would have strengthened completeness. Otherwise, semantic equivalence is high, and all key differentiators (captive insurance, self-insurance layer, actuarial inputs, defense cost accounting) are accurately conveyed.",

      "original_answer": "Emerson's 2022 margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points due to slightly dilutive effects from price less net material inflation and higher freight and other inflation, despite leverage from increased sales and cost reduction savings. In contrast, General Dynamics' defense segments saw margin performance influenced by contract mix and performance adjustments, where profitability changes stemmed from shifts in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work and updates to cost estimates on long-term contracts. This highlights a divergence in margin drivers: EMR's margins were pressured by external inflationary factors and internal pricing strategies, while GD's margins were shaped by internal contract selection and evolving cost estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s 2022 margin slipped modestly (‑0.6 percentage point) because the modest price‑increase it achieved was more than offset by inflationary pressures – higher freight, material‑cost and other inflation eroded profitability, even though cost‑reduction actions and volume leverage helped (EMR 2022 p.33).  \n\nGeneral Dynamics’ defense margins, by contrast, were shaped primarily by the mix of contracts and by performance‑related cost adjustments rather than by inflation; for example, Marine Systems’ margin fell as the segment took on more early‑work, lower‑margin submarine contracts, while Combat Systems’ margin rose on a more favorable contract mix and cost‑estimate adjustments (GD 2022 p.36‑33).  \n\nThus, Emerson’s margin was driven by price‑cost dynamics and inflation, whereas GD’s defense margins were driven by contract‑mix shifts and changes in estimated contract costs.",

      "original_answer": "Adobe recognizes revenue from consulting contracts either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts, which provides more immediate and predictable revenue recognition. In contrast, Accenture faces risks due to the short duration of many of its consulting contracts (often less than 12 months), with some allowing termination on as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue volatility and unpredictability. This contrast in contract structure and duration means Adobe has greater revenue predictability from its consulting services, while Accenture must manage a higher risk of sudden revenue loss and client retention challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe’s 10‑K explains that its consulting work is sold on a time‑and‑materials or fixed‑fee basis and is **recognized as the services are performed (or on a relative‑performance basis for fixed‑fee contracts)**, so revenue is spread over the life of the engagement (see Adobe 2022 Notes, p. 63). In contrast, Accenture’s 10‑K notes that **most of its consulting contracts are under 12 months and can be ended with as little as 30 days’ notice**, with longer‑term outsourcing deals carrying early‑termination charges that may not fully offset lost revenue (see Accenture 2022 10‑K, p. 18). Because Adobe records consulting revenue progressively as work is delivered, its earnings are more predictable, whereas Accenture’s short‑duration, easily‑terminated contracts create greater revenue volatility and make forecasting more uncertain.",

      "original_answer": "COST actively uses forward foreign-exchange contracts valued at $1,212 million in 2024 to hedge against foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations, particularly for U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures by its international subsidiaries. These contracts are not speculative and are used to economically mitigate exchange risk, although they do not qualify for hedge accounting. In contrast, PM's 2024 operating income variance shows a $205 million favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations, indicating that exchange rate movements had a measurable effect on its financial performance. This implies that while COST proactively hedges to reduce such impacts, PM experienced a direct financial benefit from currency movements, suggesting differing exposures or hedging strategies between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco manages the foreign‑currency risk on its overseas inventory purchases with forward‑exchange contracts that lock‑in the U.S.‑dollar cost of those spend‑downs; the contracts are modest in size ($1.2 bn of notional at year‑end) and the resulting unrealized gains or losses were immaterial, so the FX impact does not appear as a material line‑item in its results. By contrast, Philip Morris isolates the FX effect in its operating‑income variance table, showing a $205 million favorable currency impact in 2024 that partially offsets the overall 5.8% decline in operating income.",

The mention of a 5.8% decline in PM's operating income, while not in the original answer, does not contradict it and may reflect additional context from the source document. (2) The entities—COST (Costco) and PM (Philip Morris)—are correctly identified, as are the years (2024) and financial concepts (forward contracts, FX impact on operating income).

(4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that COST’s contracts 'do not qualify for hedge accounting' or that they are 'not speculative,' which are key qualitative details from the original answer explaining why the FX impact remains in earnings despite hedging.

According to the ground truth, Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO)'s organic sales growth in 2021 was 15%, not 23% as stated in the LLM answer. Danaher (DHR)'s core sales growth including Cytiva was correctly stated as 25.0% in the original answer, and the LLM approximates this as 'about 25%', which is acceptable. However, the LLM's calculation of the difference (2 percentage points) is incorrect due to the wrong TMO figure; the actual difference is 10 percentage points, not 2. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are critical: the 23% figure for TMO is unsupported by the ground truth and leads to a completely incorrect comparison. Even allowing for rounding or formatting differences, a 23% vs 15% discrepancy is too large to be considered a minor error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the LLM attempts to compare organic growth of TMO with DHR’s core growth including Cytiva and draws a conclusion about acquisition impact—but because the input numbers are wrong, the conclusion is misleading. The LLM suggests Danaher’s acquisition provided only a 'modest boost', but the ground truth shows a 10-point gap, indicating a substantial impact, not a modest one. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses both parts of the question: the numerical comparison and the interpretation regarding acquisitions. However, due to the severe quantitative errors, the qualitative and overall correctness scores are low.

Duke Energy reported $132 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments, while NextEra Energy reported $2,997 million (calculated as $2,198 million total derivative liabilities for commodity contracts minus $1,201 million current derivative liabilities for commodity contracts).

It reports a combined total of approximately $1.07 billion ($132 million from Duke Energy and $935 million from NextEra Energy), whereas the ground truth states the correct combined total is $3,129 million, with Duke Energy at $132 million and NextEra Energy at $2,997 million. The Duke Energy figure is correct, but the NextEra Energy noncurrent derivative liability is severely understated. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is incorrect: $132M + $935M = $1,067M (~$1.07B), but the correct sum is $132M + $2,997M = $3,129M. The LLM likely used an incorrect or misinterpreted value for NextEra’s noncurrent liabilities, failing to derive it as total derivative liabilities minus current portion ($2,198M - $1,201M = $997M is not $935M, and even that would be wrong — the correct noncurrent amount is $2,997M, indicating a possible data source mismatch). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure — the model correctly identifies that noncurrent liabilities represent unhedged long-term commodity risks and draws the appropriate qualitative conclusion about exposure to price volatility. However, due to the incorrect numerical foundation, the synthesis fails on accuracy.

The ground truth combined increase is $11.8 billion, but the LLM calculates $8.8 billion, which is significantly off. The LLM states JNJ increased by $3.7 billion (from $85.1B to $88.8B) and MRK by $5.1 billion (from $59.1B to $64.2B), summing to $8.8B. However, the correct increases per the ground truth must total $11.8B, implying either different 2024 sales figures or different growth amounts. (2) The 2023 starting values ($85.1B for JNJ and $59.1B for MRK) are correctly used. However, the resulting 2024 sales and year-over-year increases are inconsistent with the ground truth combined increase.

The model fails to retrieve or compute the correct 2024 sales figures that would yield the $11.8B total increase.

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: long-term assets for ABI ($188,003 million) and Other Investments ($232 million) sum to $188,235 million, and long-term liabilities for ABI ($91,791 million) and Other Investments ($3 million) sum to $91,794 million. The LLM correctly calculates both totals and presents them accurately, including acceptable format variations (e.g., $188.2 billion ≈ $188,235 million). (2) The comparison is correct: $188,235 million - $91,794 million = $96,441 million, which the LLM appropriately rounds to about $96.4 billion more in assets than liabilities. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is correctly synthesized across ABI and Other Investments for both assets and liabilities at September 30, 2023.

      "original_answer": "ACN reports its consulting revenue as a total figure ($37.9 billion in fiscal 2022) and measures performance through new bookings, showing a 24% increase in U.S. dollars and 28% in local currency from the prior year. In contrast, ADBE does not report a specific dollar amount for consulting revenue but explains that it recognizes consulting revenue either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. This means ACN provides a quantitative snapshot of its consulting business, while ADBE focuses on the accounting methodology and timing of revenue recognition for its consulting services.",
      "llm_answer": "Accenture (ACN) records its consulting revenue using a percentage‑of‑completion approach – it measures progress on technology‑integration and other consulting engagements by comparing costs incurred to date with the total estimated contract cost and recognizes revenue proportionally as those costs are incurred (with variable‑consideration adjustments). Adobe (ADBE), by contrast, treats consulting as a service that is recognized either at the point‑in‑time when the work is performed on time‑and‑materials contracts or on a relative‑performance basis for fixed‑fee contracts (with maintenance and support billed ratably over the contract term). Thus, ACN’s consulting revenue is cost‑to‑cost based, while Adobe’s consulting revenue is recognized as services are delivered or on a performance‑obligation schedule.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains several correct elements but introduces significant inaccuracies in the qualitative description of ACN's revenue recognition method, which undermines the overall correctness. (1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly references ACN's $37.9 billion consulting revenue in fiscal 2022 (implied context), and correctly notes ADBE does not report a specific dollar amount—this aligns with the ground truth. No incorrect numbers are stated, so quantitative accuracy is high. (2) However, the LLM incorrectly states that ACN uses a 'percentage-of-completion' or 'cost-to-cost' method for recognizing consulting revenue. The ground truth does not mention any specific accounting methodology used by ACN; instead, it emphasizes that ACN reports a total revenue figure and measures performance via new bookings growth (24% USD, 28% local currency). This is a critical factual error in revenue recognition practice attribution. (3) For ADBE, the LLM correctly identifies that consulting revenue is recognized on a time-and-materials or relative performance basis, which matches the original answer. However, the addition about 'maintenance and support billed ratably' is not directly relevant to consulting revenue and slightly conflates service types. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing how each company reports or recognizes consulting revenue—but fails because the characterization of ACN’s method is fabricated based on typical industry practice rather than the actual disclosed information. (5) Contextually, the answer is well-structured and relevant, focusing on the right comparison. Due to the major error in attributing a specific cost-based revenue recognition model to ACN not found in the ground truth, the correctness score is reduced to 6—partially correct but with significant factual inaccuracy in the core explanation.",

It also correctly states that the combined sales total is approximately $153 billion, which is close to the exact ground truth value of $153.021 billion. However, the key error lies in the calculation and interpretation of how much MRK's oncology-driven growth outpaced FX headwinds. The LLM claims a 3 percentage point outperformance (10% ex-FX vs 7% actual), but the ground truth states that MRK's oncology growth outpaced FX drag by 5 percentage points — a significant discrepancy. (2) The combined sales figure is acceptably accurate given rounding ($88.8B + $64.2B = $153B), so quantitative accuracy on total sales is sufficient. However, the 3 percentage point offset for MRK is factually incorrect versus the ground truth 5 point outperformance, and the conclusion that MRK’s offset was 1.3 points lower than JNJ’s 4.3% growth is therefore also incorrect. The correct comparison should be 5 points (MRK) vs 4.3 points (JNJ), meaning MRK outpaced by 0.7 points more, not less. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model attempts to compare oncology-driven growth net of FX impact to overall sales growth — but it uses incorrect underlying data for MRK’s outperformance, undermining the synthesis.

According to the ground truth, AMZN's long-term operating lease liability is $34,513 million, but the LLM reports $51,981 million, which is incorrect. LOW's figure is correctly stated as $4,021 million. The combined total in the ground truth is $38,534 million, but the LLM calculates $56,002 million, which is wrong due to the incorrect AMZN input.

During the year, it added 354 MMBOE from revisions, 60 MMBOE from purchases, and 335 MMBOE from extensions and discoveries, while transferring 447 MMBOE to proved developed reserves. This resulted in an ending balance of 2,344 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves for COP. In contrast, XOM's proved undeveloped reserves declined from 4,631 MMBOE at the end of 2022 to 4,389 MMBOE at the end of 2023.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies, particularly regarding XOM's reserves. The original answer states XOM's proved undeveloped reserves declined from 4,631 MMBOE to 4,389 MMBOE (a drop of 242 MMBOE), but the LLM incorrectly claims XOM had ~15.6 billion barrels in 2022 and ~15.0 billion in 2023, which is off by more than a factor of 3. This error stems from misinterpreting total proved reserves (developed + undeveloped) as undeveloped only—XOM's 8,285 + 7,343 = 15,628 MMBOE is total proved reserves in 2022, not undeveloped. Similarly, 7,870 + 7,152 = 15,022 MMBOE is total proved in 2023. The LLM incorrectly uses these sums as undeveloped reserves, leading to a gross overstatement. For COP, the ending balance is stated as 2,334 MMBOE, while the correct value is 2,344 MMBOE—a minor discrepancy likely due to rounding or arithmetic error (2,042 + 354 + 60 + 335 - 447 = 2,344). (2) Calculations: COP’s net change should be +302 MMBOE (2,344 - 2,042), not ≈292 as stated. The LLM’s calculation is off by 10 MMBOE. XOM’s decline is reported as ~600 million barrels, but the correct figure is 242 MMBOE—a major error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly infers that COP is expanding its undeveloped reserves while converting some to developed, and contrasts this with XOM’s reduction in undeveloped reserves. However, because the underlying numbers for XOM are fundamentally wrong, the comparison is misleading. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the qualitative interpretation aligns with the ground truth: COP is growing its undeveloped base, while XOM is drawing it down, suggesting different reserve development strategies. Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses all parts of the question and draws appropriate strategic implications. However, the severe quantitative inaccuracies, especially for XOM, limit correctness. Scores reflect mostly correct reasoning but flawed data: correctness_score=6 (partially correct), quantitative_accuracy=5 (major errors in XOM data), qualitative_accuracy=7 (logical interpretation despite bad inputs), contextual_relevance=9 (fully on-topic and comprehensive in scope).",

This suggests that COF had a more substantial number of unexercised or unvested awards that would have been dilutive if included, compared to MA, which had very few or none. The difference reflects a variation in the structure and scale of equity compensation plans between the two financial companies.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) excluded about 26 thousand anti-dilutive share-based awards in 2021, matching the ground truth exactly. It also accurately reflects that Mastercard (MA) excluded only a 'minimal amount'—interpreted correctly as essentially no measurable awards—which aligns with the original answer. No numeric inaccuracies are present, and the formatting ('about 26 thousand') is acceptable and semantically equivalent. (2) All quantitative elements are correct: the 26 thousand figure for COF is precise, and the characterization of MA’s exclusion as 'minimal' is faithfully represented. There are no calculations required, but the comparison between the two companies is numerically sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes data from both companies’ 2021 diluted EPS disclosures and draws a logical inference about differences in share-based payment structures. It goes a step further than the ground truth by offering plausible explanations (e.g., low-priced options at COF vs. higher-exercise-price options and RSUs at MA), which are reasonable interpretations supported by financial reporting norms, though slightly more speculative than the original. This adds insight without contradicting facts. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing both the quantitative difference and its implication for equity compensation design. The only reason for not scoring a 10 in correctness and qualitative accuracy is that the LLM introduces a slight interpretive leap (e.g., 'low-priced options') not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth, though such inference is common and justifiable in financial analysis. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, complete, and well-reasoned.",

      "llm_answer": "A prolonged equity‑market slump would cut the account values that drive AIG’s variable‑annuity fees, lowering that portion of its fee income. AIG’s own disclosures note that the resulting rise in re‑balancing and option‑hedging costs is partially offset by rider fees linked to the CBOE Volatility Index, so the hit to earnings is mitigated. Blackstone, by contrast, tells investors that a large share of its revenue is fee‑based and “highly sensitive to market activity”; a weak market would therefore shrink its advisory and investment‑management fees and directly depress its profitability. Taken together, a sustained equity‑market decline would depress fee‑related earnings at both firms, but AIG’s built‑in hedging‑fee offset would cushion the effect, whereas Blackstone would feel a more direct and material reduction in its financial results.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) All factual elements are correct: AIG's fee income tied to variable annuity account values would decline in a market downturn, increasing hedging costs while being partially offset by volatility-index-linked rider fees (specifically tied to the CBOE Volatility Index). Blackstone's fee-based revenue is correctly described as highly sensitive to market activity, with direct impacts on advisory and investment-management fees. (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations, but all qualitative financial mechanisms are correctly represented—no errors in logic or figures. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes AIG’s partial mitigation mechanism (rider fees offsetting hedging costs) with Blackstone’s lack of such offsets, drawing a valid comparative conclusion about differential impact. (4) The LLM uses slightly different phrasing (e.g., 'prolonged equity-market slump' vs 'sustained downturn') but maintains semantic equivalence. One minor point preventing a perfect 10 is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the 'net amount at risk' increase for AIG or 'investment preferences and savings trends' for Blackstone, which are part of the original answer’s completeness—these are contextual nuances that add depth but do not alter the core correctness.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in both the reported property values and the breakdown of SPG's assets. It states SPG's total property value as $38.8 billion, which aligns approximately with the ground truth of $38,784.918 million (or $38.785 billion), so this part is reasonably accurate in magnitude. However, it incorrectly reports AMT's total property value as $532 million, whereas the ground truth is $7,268.3 million—over 13 times higher—making this a severe error. The calculated difference of '$38.3 billion greater' is therefore completely incorrect; the actual difference is $31,516.618 million (~$31.5 billion), not $38.3 billion. (2) The breakdown of SPG’s property value is also wrong: the LLM claims $3.3 billion for land and $25.5 billion for buildings and improvements, but the correct figures are $3,643.432 million ($3.64 billion) for land and $35,141.486 million ($35.14 billion) for buildings and improvements. The buildings and improvements figure is off by nearly $10 billion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect data retrieval for AMT and an inaccurate asset breakdown for SPG. The model appears to have synthesized information from incorrect or misread sources, leading to flawed comparisons. (4) Scores reflect that while the SPG total value is approximately correct (allowing for rounding), all other numbers and the final comparison are significantly wrong, resulting in a low correctness score.

      "original_answer": "Costco's policy on repurchased shares involves retiring them in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. This affects its diluted net income per share calculation because the treasury stock method is used to account for potentially dilutive common shares, such as those subject to RSUs, by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding. In contrast, Philip Morris provides a quantitative disclosure of the issued, repurchased, and outstanding shares without specifying a retirement policy or its implications on earnings per share calculations. Therefore, Costco's detailed policy on share retirement and its impact on diluted EPS contrasts with Philip Morris's more general disclosure about repurchased shares.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco states that any shares it repurchases are **retired** – the par value is removed from common stock and the excess repurchase price is allocated to additional‑paid‑in‑capital and retained earnings (Costco 10‑K p. 50). Because the shares are cancelled, they are not included in the treasury‑stock calculation for diluted earnings per share, which therefore uses only the weighted‑average shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive securities (e.g., RSUs) (Costco 10‑K p. 50).  \n\nPhilip Morris, by contrast, simply reports the number of shares repurchased and the resulting shares outstanding in a capital‑stock table (PMI 10‑K p. 106) without describing a retirement accounting treatment, so its disclosure focuses on the share‑count impact rather than linking repurchases to the EPS calculation.",

This directly affects diluted EPS by excluding repurchased shares from treasury stock calculations, as they are cancelled. The explanation of using weighted-average shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive securities (e.g., RSUs) under the treasury stock method is factually correct. (2) There are no numeric values requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it contrasts Costco’s detailed retirement policy and its impact on EPS calculation with Philip Morris’s approach of merely reporting repurchase volumes and outstanding shares without linking to EPS methodology. The LLM correctly infers that PM does not disclose a retirement policy or its implications on EPS, based on the absence of such language in its 10-K. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly name the Washington Business Corporation Act as the governing framework for Costco’s retirement policy, which is included in the original answer.

      "original_answer": "Google's content acquisition costs involve payments to third-party content providers for licensing video and other content distributed on YouTube and Google Play, where fees are based on revenues generated or a flat fee. This reflects a platform-centric model where Google leverages external content to drive engagement and monetization through advertising and distribution. In contrast, Netflix's cost of revenues is dominated by amortization of content assets, which includes expenses related to content acquisition, licensing, and production, such as payroll, stock-based compensation, and production costs. This highlights Netflix's vertically integrated model, where it invests heavily in acquiring and producing exclusive content to monetize directly through subscriptions. The difference in cost structures underscores Google's third-party content licensing strategy versus Netflix's ownership and amortization of original and licensed content to build a proprietary offering.",

According to the ground truth, Abbott incurred a $63 million charge in 2021 related to the repayment of its 2.9% Notes due 2021. However, the LLM incorrectly states that this charge was from a 2019 redemption, which contradicts the original answer and misplaces the event in time. Additionally, the LLM claims Abbott reported 'no debt-extinguishment charge for 2021,' which is false per the ground truth. For Thermo Fisher Scientific, the LLM reports a $767 million loss, whereas the ground truth specifies $312 million—this is a major numerical discrepancy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the $63 million figure for Abbott is correct in amount but incorrectly attributed to 2019 instead of 2021, undermining its validity. The Thermo Fisher number is entirely wrong—$767M vs. $312M—a difference of over $450 million. The acquisition amount ($15.99 billion) may be accurate contextually, but it was not requested in the question and does not excuse the core error in extinguishment cost. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly links Abbott’s charge to an earlier redemption rather than the 2021 repayment, breaking the causal and temporal logic. For Thermo Fisher, while it correctly associates the debt cost with the PPD acquisition, the magnitude is wrong, suggesting flawed data sourcing or synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses both companies and attempts to explain the drivers (refinancing vs. acquisition financing), so the structure aligns with the question.

These figures are accurately attributed, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $2.9 billion = $2.9B). 2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: $2.9 billion and $236 million match the original answer. The comparison of magnitude (order of magnitude difference) is logically sound and supports the conclusion. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—correctly comparing compensation-related financial obligations across two companies. However, there is a slight imprecision in terminology: the LLM refers to Emerson’s 'operating cash flow' as representing salaries and wages expense, while the ground truth specifies 'salaries and wages expense' directly. Operating cash flow is a broader metric and not equivalent to payroll expense alone, which introduces a minor factual inaccuracy in interpretation, though the $2.9 billion figure itself is correctly cited as related to payroll outlays. 4) Despite this nuance, the overall conclusion—that Emerson has a substantially higher financial commitment to employee compensation—is valid and semantically equivalent to the original answer. The response addresses both parts of the question: the quantitative comparison and its implication. Thus, the answer is highly accurate with only a minor issue in metric interpretation, warranting a high score but not perfect.",

The LLM reports $7.3B and $5.2B, respectively, and a $2.1B decline—these are appropriately rounded and semantically equivalent. ExxonMobil (XOM) reported $3.4 billion in after-tax impairment charges related to unproved/idle upstream assets in 2023, which matches the ground truth. The LLM correctly identifies this figure and its relevance. The ground truth also notes an additional $0.6B charge for an equity investment, which the LLM omits, but this is a minor detail not central to the comparison about unproved properties.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent: all numbers are correctly reported within acceptable rounding. The $2.1B reduction aligns with the actual $2.119B drop. The $3.4B impairment is exact. Calculations and comparisons are sound.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly synthesizes data from two companies (COP and XOM) across their 2022–2023 filings, compares the magnitude of asset reductions vs. impairments, and draws a logical conclusion about differing asset management strategies—aggressive write-downs (XOM) vs. conservative trimming (COP). This aligns with the ground truth’s interpretation.\n\n4) The only minor shortcoming is the omission of XOM’s additional $0.6B equity-related charge, which slightly reduces completeness but does not affect the core comparison about unproved properties.

The original answer states that TMO has recorded $24 billion in U.S. federal taxes on undistributed foreign earnings, and ABT has an indefinite reinvestment of undistributed foreign earnings — but does not specify the dollar amount. However, the LLM incorrectly assigns a $24 billion value to ABT’s indefinitely reinvested earnings and calculates a combined total of $48 billion, which is not supported by the ground truth. The original answer only supports a combined total of 'at least $24 billion' because ABT’s amount is unspecified. This is a major error in numerical attribution and calculation. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the LLM fabricates a $24 billion figure for ABT without evidence, leading to an incorrect sum. While TMO’s $24 billion is correctly cited, ABT’s amount is not quantified in the ground truth, making the $48 billion total invalid. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning shows partial understanding of the accounting treatments: both companies defer tax liabilities and claim that determining the deferred tax liability is not practicable. However, the LLM incorrectly suggests that TMO records federal taxes but not state/foreign taxes, while the ground truth emphasizes TMO’s conditional repatriation intent (only when no net tax cost), which the model underemphasizes. ABT’s treatment is more accurately described. The synthesis is partially correct but marred by the false equivalence in dollar amounts. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses both parts of the question — total amount and accounting treatment — and references appropriate disclosures.

More critically, the LLM introduces a $219 million favorable foreign-currency conversion gain for NKE with a citation to 'page_37', but this specific number and characterization are not present in the original answer or implied by the question. The original answer does not quantify NKE's FX impact numerically, only stating that FX volatility could negatively affect results. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the $2.4B (2020) figure for AMZN is introduced without basis in the question, and the $219M gain for NKE is fabricated. The original answer does not provide any actual FX gain/loss number for NKE—only a qualitative risk warning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing AMZN's reported FX-inclusive other income to NKE's FX risk disclosure—but fails in execution because it invents precise figures not present in the source material. The conclusion that AMZN had a 'multibillion-dollar swing' due to FX overstates the case, as the $14.6B line item includes many components beyond FX. (4) While the LLM attempts a relevant comparison and cites page numbers suggesting document grounding, the fabrication of specific financial figures undermines factual correctness.

      "question": "What is the combined total of litigation charges recorded by both Intel and Oracle in 2022, and how does this compare to Intel's litigation charges in 2020?",
      "original_answer": "The combined litigation charges for Intel and Oracle in 2022 total $7,291 million. This is significantly higher than Intel's litigation charges in 2020, which were $67 million. The calculation is based on Intel's 2022 litigation charges of $2,291 million and Oracle's $4,700 million litigation-related charges in the same year. Compared to Intel’s 2020 litigation charges, the 2022 combined total is approximately 109 times greater.",
      "llm_answer": "In Intel’s 2022 filing, the “Litigation charges and other” line shows $2,291 million for the most recent year reported (2021), and Oracle reports $4.7 billion of litigation‑related charges for fiscal 2022. Together they amount to roughly **$6.99 billion**. By contrast, Intel’s litigation charge in 2020 was only **$67 million**, so the 2022 combined amount is about **$6.9 billion larger** than Intel’s 2020 litigation charge.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies despite capturing some correct elements. The combined litigation charges are incorrectly calculated as $6.99 billion instead of the correct $7,291 million ($7.291 billion). This stems from using $2,291 million for Intel but misattributing it to 2021 instead of 2022, which undermines temporal accuracy. Oracle’s charge of $4.7 billion ($4,700 million) is correctly stated, though the format varies slightly. However, the sum of $2,291 million and $4,700 million is $7,291 million, not $6.99 billion — indicating a clear calculation error. (2) Intel’s 2020 litigation charge is correctly cited as $67 million, but the comparison is flawed: the LLM states the 2022 combined amount is about $6.9 billion *larger*, which implies a difference of $6.9 billion, whereas the actual difference is $7,291M - $67M = $7,224 million. More critically, the original answer notes the 2022 combined total is approximately 109 times greater than Intel’s 2020 charge — a key comparative insight the LLM omits, instead offering a misleading absolute difference framing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, attempts to extract litigation charges, and compares across years — but fails in execution due to incorrect year attribution for Intel’s data and arithmetic error in summation. The use of 'most recent year reported (2021)' for Intel contradicts the requirement for 2022 data, suggesting a misreading of the source. (4) Scores reflect partial credit: Quantitative Accuracy is low due to wrong totals and miscalculations; Qualitative Accuracy penalized for incorrect time period and missing multiplicative comparison; Contextual Relevance is high as the structure and intent align with the question; Correctness Score is moderate because core components are present but critically flawed in synthesis and precision.",

      "original_answer": "Comcast's Studios segment programming and production costs decreased in 2023 due to lower costs associated with content licensing sales, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages, while Disney's total programming and production costs slightly increased by 1% to $13.959 billion in 2023. This reflects that both companies were affected by industry-wide challenges, with Comcast experiencing cost reductions due to halted production activity while Disney absorbed slightly higher costs despite similar pressures, indicating varied strategic responses to the same external disruptions.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast’s Studios segment cut its programming‑and‑production outlays to $7.96 billion in 2023, down about 9 % from 2022, because lower content‑licensing costs – hit by the Writers Guild and SAG strikes that limited new material – more than offset higher theatrical‑release expenses. Disney’s total programming‑and‑production spend slipped slightly to $13.96 billion in 2023 (about 1 % lower than the prior year), as Disney+ saw reduced non‑sports content costs tied to the same work‑stop‑pact and timing of content availability, while modest sports‑related spending rose. Together, the two companies’ expense reductions illustrate how industry‑wide stoppages and delayed content releases trimmed programming costs across the entertainment sector.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the direction of change for both companies' programming and production costs. According to the ground truth, Comcast's costs decreased due to work stoppages, which is correct in direction but the LLM incorrectly quantifies the change as a 9% drop to $7.96 billion without this data being in the original answer. More critically, the LLM states Disney's costs 'slipped slightly to $13.96 billion... 1% lower', directly contradicting the ground truth that Disney's costs *increased* by 1% to $13.959 billion. This reversal of trend is a major factual error. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: while $13.96 billion is close to $13.959 billion (acceptable rounding), the 1% decrease is incorrect — it should be a 1% increase. The $7.96 billion figure for Comcast and 9% decline are not present in the original answer and appear to be hallucinated. No such numbers were provided in the ground truth for Comcast’s absolute spending or percentage change. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in linking both companies to industry-wide challenges like the WGA and SAG strikes, and in connecting cost changes to content availability and work stoppages. However, the conclusion that both companies saw 'expense reductions' is factually wrong since Disney’s costs increased. This undermines the synthesis and leads to an incorrect overall interpretation. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core theme — how industry-wide challenges affected programming costs — and correctly identifies the relevant companies, time frame (2023), and causal factors (strikes, content timing). However, due to key numerical and directional errors, the qualitative and correctness scores are significantly reduced.",

Additionally, McDonald’s fiscal year ends in 2021, not 2022 as implied by the question’s requirement for 'fiscal years ending in 2022'—this is a small misalignment in time period.

      "question": "How do fluctuations in foreign exchange (FX) rates impact both Amazon's tax liabilities and Nike's international sales, and by what mechanism do these effects manifest in their respective financial results?",
      "original_answer": "Foreign exchange rate fluctuations affect Amazon's effective tax rate due to changes in the relative value of foreign earnings in jurisdictions with varying statutory tax rates, and they impact Nike's international sales when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. Dollar, reducing the dollar value of Nike's foreign currency-denominated sales. Amazon specifically notes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are among the factors that could significantly affect its effective tax rates. Nike states that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Both companies are exposed to FX risk, but the financial impact manifests differently: for Amazon, it affects tax liabilities, while for Nike, it directly affects reported revenues and earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Amazon:**  The 10‑K notes that the company’s inter‑company balances and foreign‑currency‑denominated earnings are re‑measured each period.  When exchange rates move, the resulting gains or losses are reflected in pretax income, which in turn changes the amount of income‑tax expense or benefit that Amazon records. (see Amazon 10‑K p. 8).  \n\n- **Nike:**  Nike states that “weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company’s foreign‑currency‑denominated sales and earnings,” and that favorable FX moves produced a $219 million net foreign‑currency conversion gain that boosted gross margin and other‑income. (see Nike 10‑K p. 15 & p. 37).  \n\nThus, FX fluctuations affect Amazon mainly through the re‑measurement of inter‑company balances that alter its taxable income, while for Nike they alter the dollar‑value of overseas sales and generate translation gains or losses that flow through gross margin and other‑income.",

(1) All factual information is correct: Amazon's FX impact on tax liabilities via re-measurement of inter-company balances and foreign earnings affecting pretax income—and thus tax expense—is accurately described and consistent with the original answer's emphasis on FX affecting Amazon's effective tax rate. For Nike, the explanation correctly identifies that a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar reduces the dollar value of sales and earnings, and the mention of a $219 million net foreign-currency conversion gain is factually precise and supports the qualitative claim. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $219 million figure is correctly cited from Nike’s 10-K (pages 15 and 37), and no other numbers are misstated. Format is consistent and accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how FX impacts Amazon (through tax and pretax income effects) versus Nike (through revenue translation and income statement impacts), distinguishing the mechanisms appropriately across companies. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer emphasizes Amazon’s exposure due to differing statutory tax rates across jurisdictions, which the LLM answer does not explicitly mention—this nuance slightly reduces qualitative completeness, though the core mechanism (FX affecting taxable income) is still correct.

According to the ground truth, Colgate-Palmolive reported $93 million in pension and other retiree benefits liabilities for 2024 (not $1,306 million), and Procter & Gamble reported $592 million (not $3,537 million). The combined total in the ground truth is $685 million for 2024, whereas the LLM reports $4,843 million — a massive overstatement. Similarly, the 2023 totals are wrong: LLM reports $5,196 million combined, while the correct combined total is $833 million. These errors invalidate the core of the response. (2) Calculations within the LLM answer are internally consistent (e.g., summing P&G's $2,884M + $653M = $3,537M), but since the input numbers are factually wrong, the results are incorrect. The claimed decrease from $5,196M to $4,843M ($353M drop) does not match the true decrease of $148M ($833M → $685M). (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound — the model attempts to extract data for both companies, both years, and compute combined totals and trends — but it fails at entity-metric alignment.

This indicates that tax-exempt income lowered MET's overall tax liability. In contrast, COF adjusts its Commercial Banking revenue and yields to a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and applicable state taxes to account for investments that generate tax-exempt income, which is a proactive reporting methodology rather than a retrospective adjustment. Thus, while MET reflects tax-exempt income as a reduction in the tax provision, COF adjusts revenue metrics to reflect the equivalent taxable value of those investments.",

It claims that MetLife's 'Tax-exempt income' line is blank in 2023, implying no impact, but the ground truth states it had a negative adjustment of $(34) million, meaning tax-exempt income reduced the tax provision by $34 million. The LLM incorrectly reports this as zero impact. Additionally, the LLM cites a $454 million provision at the U.S. statutory rate and a total provision of $560 million, which are not mentioned in the ground truth and appear fabricated or misattributed. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: the correct figure is $(34) million reduction due to tax-exempt income, not 'blank' or $0. The $454M and $560M figures are unsupported and contradict the ground truth. (3) The qualitative reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to correctly synthesize the multi-hop requirement—MET’s actual tax provision adjustment versus COF’s tax-equivalent revenue reporting. While the description of COF’s methodology is mostly accurate (adjusting revenue using 21% federal rate plus state taxes), the contrast is invalid because the LLM misrepresents MET’s treatment. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses the general topic of tax-exempt income and compares MET and COF’s approaches, but due to factual errors in the core data, the conclusion is misleading. The contrast between MET’s 'no adjustment' and COF’s gross-up method is invalid because MET *did* make an adjustment, per the $(34) million line item.

Oracle, on the other hand, incurred severance expenses specifically in fiscal 2022 related to its restructuring plan, without a disclosed prior-year comparison, suggesting a more recent or intensified focus on workforce restructuring.

The directional effect (reduction in SG&A due to fair value adjustment) is plausible but not confirmed in the original answer.

      "llm_answer": "- Boeing (BA) explicitly excludes potential shares from the diluted‑EPS denominator when the shares would be **antidilutive because the related performance awards or stock‑option strike prices are not met** (or because the company incurred a net loss). The 2023 note lists the specific award classes and the amount of shares left out for that reason.  \n\n- Emerson (EMR) also leaves out any shares that would be antidilutive, but its disclosure simply says that “an inconsequential number of shares…were excluded…as the effect would have been antidilutive,” without tying the exclusion to unmet performance conditions.  \n\n**What this reveals:** When performance conditions are a factor (as with Boeing), they can materially affect the diluted‑EPS calculation by removing a block of potential shares, whereas Emerson’s antidilutive adjustments are minor and not driven by performance‑condition tests, so the impact on its EPS is negligible.",

(1) It correctly identifies that Boeing (BA) excluded shares from diluted EPS due to antidilutive effects tied to unmet performance conditions or strike prices, and notes the explicit disclosure in the 2023 filing—consistent with the original answer. Emerson (EMR) is accurately described as excluding an 'inconsequential number of shares' without linking exclusions to performance conditions. (2) There are no numerical values in the question or answer that require calculation, but all qualitative metrics (e.g., 'inconsequential number') are correctly reported as per the original. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in disclosure practices between BA and EMR regarding the role of performance conditions in EPS calculations. (4) The only minor shortcoming is a slight lack of emphasis on BA’s exclusion being specifically due to *both* strike price and unmet performance conditions (though both are mentioned), while the original answer highlights performance conditions as a key factor. However, the LLM does mention 'performance awards' and 'not met', preserving semantic equivalence. Overall, the answer is factually correct, complete, and contextually appropriate.",

GD disclosed that it expected to collect substantially all of its year-end 2021 receivables during 2022, which suggests that its revenue realization cycle for long-term contracts is more advanced, with receivables being collected shortly after recognition.

The combined funded status deficit is stated as $834 million ($584M for DHR and $250M for TMO), but the ground truth is $771 million. The individual deficits are incorrect: DHR's actual deficit is not provided directly in the original answer, but its fair value of assets is $521M (LLM says $357M), and TMO's fair value is correctly stated as $1,302M. The LLM assigns a $250M deficit to TMO, which contradicts the ground truth implication that TMO has a larger asset base but still an underfunded status — however, the exact deficit for TMO alone isn't specified in the original, so that part cannot be fully verified. (2) The calculation of $584M + $250M = $834M is mathematically correct, but since the inputs are wrong, the result is factually inaccurate. The fair value of DHR’s plan assets is reported as $357M by the LLM, but the correct figure is $521M — a major discrepancy. TMO’s $1,302M is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model attempts to combine data from both companies and compare asset sizes, which addresses the question's intent. However, due to incorrect input data, the synthesis fails on accuracy. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent of the response match the question: it reports combined deficit and compares fair values.

The ground truth is $2,820 million, but the LLM incorrectly states $21,745 million, which is more than 7.5 times higher and likely confuses total global revenue with China-specific revenue. McDonald's pre-tax charges of $290 million are correctly stated. However, due to the incorrect Tesla figure, the combined total is wrong: LLM reports $22,035 million instead of the correct $3,110 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised—while $290 million is correct, the Tesla revenue number is wildly inaccurate, and the sum is therefore incorrect. The calculation logic (adding two figures) is sound, but based on false inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is correct—the model identifies both required components (Tesla's China revenue and McDonald's pre-tax charges) and attempts to sum them. However, it fails at entity-metric alignment for Tesla, pulling an incorrect value likely from a different context (possibly total revenue or misattributed geography). (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the right companies, metric types, and year, and performs the correct final operation (addition). But due to the critical numerical error, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.",

      "original_answer": "SPG capitalizes improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset, indicating a focus on long-term asset enhancement. AMT, on the other hand, uses cash flows to fund maintenance and improvements, communications site and data center construction, and managed network installations, suggesting a more operational and growth-oriented approach. The interaction implies that SPG emphasizes capital efficiency and asset longevity through selective capitalization, while AMT prioritizes ongoing investment in infrastructure to sustain and grow its operations.",
      "llm_answer": "Simon Property Group records tenant allowances and tenant‑improvement costs as capitalized assets, treating them as upgrades that extend a building’s useful life, increase capacity or improve efficiency, and then amortizes those amounts over the lease term (or the asset’s remaining life). American Tower, by contrast, draws on operating cash flow to fund “maintenance and improvements” and other capital‑expenditure programs that are booked as capital‑improvement capex and depreciated over the asset’s estimated 10‑to‑35‑year life. Together, the policies show that SPG aligns the cost of tenant‑driven upgrades with lease periods to preserve asset value on a per‑lease basis, while AMT relies on steady cash‑flow‑generated reinvestment to keep its tower portfolio functional and competitive, reflecting a more cash‑driven, ongoing‑maintenance strategy.",

(1) It correctly identifies SPG's capitalization policy for tenant allowances and improvements, noting they are capitalized when they extend useful life, increase capacity, or improve efficiency—consistent with the original answer. It also accurately describes SPG's amortization over the lease term or asset life, which adds detail not in the ground truth but is factually correct and contextually relevant. (2) For AMT, the LLM correctly states that operating cash flow funds maintenance and improvements, including capital-expenditure programs, and specifies the 10-to-35-year depreciation life for these assets. While the exact range isn't in the ground truth, it is a plausible and reasonable detail that does not contradict it and reflects industry norms. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes SPG’s lease-aligned, asset-efficiency-focused strategy with AMT’s cash-flow-driven, ongoing reinvestment model, drawing a valid contrast in strategic emphasis—SPG on capital efficiency and asset longevity, AMT on operational continuity and growth. (4) The conclusion about SPG preserving asset value per lease versus AMT’s cash-driven maintenance strategy is semantically equivalent to the original’s interpretation. The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'communications site and data center construction' or 'managed network installations' as in the ground truth, slightly reducing completeness, but the broader category of capital-expenditure programs covers this sufficiently. No numerical inaccuracies; all qualitative claims are supported. Thus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness—excellent but not perfect—due to slight omission of AMT’s specific investment categories.",

It also accurately reports Salesforce's operating lease liabilities as approximately $3.2 billion (split into $518 million current and $2.6 billion non-current), which aligns closely with the ground truth value of $3,162 million (minor rounding difference is acceptable). However, the LLM fails to report Texas Instruments' operating lease liability of $3,320 million, incorrectly stating that the information is not available in the provided filings. This is a critical omission, as the ground truth confirms this data exists and was extractable.\n\n2) Quantitatively, the numbers for Salesforce are accurate with acceptable rounding. The $3.2 billion figure for operating leases is a reasonable approximation of $3,162 million. The accrued expenses for both firms are exact. However, the failure to include TXN's $3,320 million operating lease liability undermines the quantitative completeness. Additionally, the LLM does not compute or report the key ratios (11.8% for CRM, 27.4% for TXN) that are central to the original answer and the question’s comparative intent.\n\n3) The reasoning is partially sound for Salesforce but breaks down for Texas Instruments. The LLM correctly interprets Salesforce’s liability structure and notes that lease obligations are much larger than accrued expenses. However, it incorrectly concludes that TXN’s operating lease liability cannot be determined from the data, which contradicts the ground truth and prevents proper multi-hop comparison. This suggests either a failure in information retrieval or synthesis across entities.\n\n4) While the LLM addresses the question framework and uses correct terminology and fiscal years (2024 for CRM, 2023 for TXN), the absence of TXN’s operating lease figure and the resulting inability to make the comparative ratio analysis significantly reduces correctness. The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured but incomplete in a way that affects the core comparative insight.

According to the ground truth, McDonald's US revenue increased from $5,136 million to $5,694 million (11% increase), which the LLM approximates reasonably well at $5.14B to $5.69B (~10.9%), so this part is mostly correct with minor rounding. However, Tesla's US revenue is severely misstated: the ground truth shows an increase from $21,667 million to $26,629 million (23% increase), but the LLM claims $40.6B to $45.2B (11.5% increase), which is both numerically and percentage-wise incorrect. These figures are more than double the actual values. (2) The 'combined percentage increase' is incorrectly calculated as ≈22.4% by summing individual percentages (10.9% + 11.5%), which is mathematically invalid. The correct interpretation from the ground truth is that the combined percentage increase refers to the sum of the two individual growth rates (11% + 23% = 34%), but even that is ambiguous—however, the original answer states '21%' as the combined increase, which may imply a weighted or aggregate calculation not clearly defined. Still, the LLM’s method of simply adding percentages is flawed, and its result is based on wrong inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails because the model uses incorrect data for Tesla and misunderstands how to compute a 'combined percentage increase.' It also mischaracterizes McDonald's data as 'operating-income proxy' when the ground truth specifies revenue. (4) Despite these major errors, the LLM attempts to address both companies, years, and comparisons, showing some contextual understanding. It correctly identifies that Tesla’s absolute growth is much larger, though based on incorrect figures. Due to severe quantitative inaccuracies and flawed reasoning, the correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is penalized heavily due to wrong revenue figures and invalid calculation. Qualitative accuracy suffers from incorrect metric interpretation and synthesis.

According to the ground truth, DUK's noncurrent regulatory assets were $1,603 million *greater* than the combined amounts of NEE and FPL. However, the LLM incorrectly states that DUK's amount was $3.0 billion *lower*, which is the opposite of the correct relationship. (2) The numerical values provided by the LLM are inconsistent with the ground truth. It claims DUK had $5,909 million, NEE $4,578 million, and FPL $4,343 million, leading to a combined NEE/FPL total of $8,921 million. But if DUK were $1,603 million greater than NEE+FPL, then DUK should equal $8,921M + $1,603M = $10,524 million — not $5,909 million. Thus, the individual figures and the final difference are both incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have retrieved DUK’s 2021 noncurrent regulatory assets, retrieved both NEE’s and FPL’s 2021 noncurrent regulatory assets, summed the latter two, and computed the difference.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer gets the core magnitude of the difference correct—approximately $42.2 billion—and correctly identifies that NFLX has significantly higher total contractual obligations than T (AT&T). However, there are critical quantitative inaccuracies. The original answer states T's total contractual obligations are $337,473 (not thousand), meaning $337,473 total, not $337 million. The LLM incorrectly interprets this as $337 million ($337,473 thousand), inflating AT&T’s obligations by 1,000x. Similarly, NFLX’s $42,541,407 is in dollars, not thousands, so the LLM’s interpretation of $42.5 billion is off by a factor of 1,000. The actual total obligations are ~$42.5 million for NFLX and ~$0.34 million for T, making the real difference ~$42.2 million, not billion. (2) The calculation of the difference is conceptually correct but based on wrong units, leading to a massive overstatement. The content obligations for NFLX are reported as $21.7 billion in the LLM answer, but in truth are $21,713,349 (~$21.7 million), again off by 1,000x. For T, the LLM claims long-term debt and interest total ~$244 billion, but the ground truth reports long-term debt obligations as $146,064—about $146 thousand. This is a severe error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure: compare total obligations, identify key components (content for NFLX, debt for T), and explain contribution to difference. However, due to unit misinterpretation, the synthesis is based on incorrect data. (4) Despite the factual inaccuracies in scale, the LLM captures the qualitative relationship: NFLX has much larger obligations driven by content, T’s are smaller and debt-driven. This supports a moderate correctness score. Contextual relevance is high as all question parts are addressed. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the 1,000x scaling errors.

      "original_answer": "HD uses the straight-line method for depreciating buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment over their estimated useful lives, while MCD also uses the straight-line method but specifies different useful life ranges—buildings up to 40 years, leasehold improvements based on the lesser of asset life or lease terms, and equipment between 3 to 12 years. This difference in depreciation policy specificity allows MCD to adjust asset valuations more dynamically based on economic and technological changes, potentially influencing when asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation occur. HD's approach, by contrast, appears more static, which may limit flexibility in responding to rapid changes in asset utility. These differing methods reflect contrasting long-term asset management strategies: HD emphasizes consistency, while MCD emphasizes adaptability.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Home Depot and McDonald’s depreciate property and equipment on a straight‑line basis, spreading cost evenly over the assets’ estimated useful lives. The main distinction is the detail of the useful‑life ranges—Home Depot applies 5‑45 years for buildings and 2‑20 years for equipment, while McDonald’s specifies up to 40 years for buildings, 3‑12 years for equipment and amortizes lease‑hold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or asset life.

For HD, it gives 5–45 years for buildings and 2–20 years for equipment, which aligns with typical disclosures (though the original answer does not specify exact ranges for HD, so this is a minor addition rather than a contradiction). (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate and consistent with known SEC filing data; no calculation errors. The useful life ranges cited are within standard reporting ranges for both firms. (3) The reasoning correctly infers that both companies benefit from predictable expense patterns due to straight-line depreciation, and that MCD’s more detailed categorization allows for finer control—this aligns with the original answer’s point about MCD emphasizing adaptability. However, the LLM answer omits the explicit contrast in strategic emphasis (consistency vs. adaptability) and does not mention how MCD’s policy may influence asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation decisions, which is a key insight in the ground truth.

The LLM incorrectly claims that COP's filing 'does not state' that the divisor is net-saleable production and infers it is 'gross-based,' which is unsupported and contradicts the ground truth. This misrepresentation fundamentally undermines the comparison. (2) Quantitatively, the 6 MCF = 1 BOE conversion factor is correctly cited for both companies, and no numerical calculations are performed that would introduce errors—so quantitative accuracy is high. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in identifying that differences in divisor definitions affect comparability, but the logic is flawed because it reverses the impact: the LLM claims XOM’s cost will 'look lower' due to excluding flared gas, when in fact excluding volumes from the denominator would increase the cost per BOE (smaller denominator = higher cost per unit), which the ground truth correctly states. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly attributes this exclusion to XOM alone while portraying COP as including all production, when both use net production but with different exclusions. (4) Contextual relevance is strong—the question is about comparability of cost efficiency metrics due to methodological differences, and the response addresses methodology, divisors, and conversion factors.

(1) The individual company values are accurate: Costco's 2023 'Construction in progress' is correctly stated as $1,389 million (up from $1,266 million in 2022), and Mondelez's is $1,118 million (up from $879 million in 2022). (2) The 2023 combined total is correctly calculated: $1,389M + $1,118M = $2,507M, matching the ground truth. However, the 2022 combined value is incorrectly stated as $2,145 million; the correct sum is $1,266M + $879M = $2,145M — wait, this actually matches the LLM's number. But the ground truth states $2,138 million, indicating a discrepancy in source data. Upon rechecking: $1,266 + $879 = $2,145, so the ground truth may have a typo, or the input data differs. Given that the LLM's arithmetic is correct based on the numbers it used, and assuming the source data for 2022 values is accurate, the LLM's $2,145M is mathematically sound. The increase is then $2,507M - $2,145M = $362M, which the LLM correctly reports. However, the ground truth claims a $369M increase based on $2,138M in 2022, which contradicts the sum of the individual 2022 values provided in the LLM answer. This suggests either the ground truth has incorrect aggregation or the input data differs. Given the LLM consistently uses correct arithmetic and matches the 2023 total, the deviation is likely due to source data inconsistency rather than reasoning error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts the correct metric across two years, aggregates across entities and time, and computes the change. (4) Therefore, while there is a $7M discrepancy between the LLM's 2022 total ($2,145M) and the ground truth's ($2,138M), the LLM's internal consistency and arithmetic are correct. This minor variance may stem from different data sources or rounding, not a model error.

It reports ≈$2.6 billion for CRM and ≈$836 million for TXN, which sum to $3.436 billion—matching the ground truth. The LLM rounds this to $3.44 billion, which is a negligible and acceptable rounding difference. (2) Quantitatively, the individual figures are accurate within reasonable approximation (e.g., $2.6 billion is a rounded form of $2,600 million; $836 million is exact), and the sum is correctly computed and rounded. The final combined value of $3.44 billion is semantically equivalent to $3.436 billion when rounded to three significant figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model retrieves data from two separate companies, confirms the same fiscal year (2023), and correctly aggregates the values. Entities (CRM, TXN), metric (accrued compensation), and time period (fiscal year 2023) are all accurately identified and synthesized. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, complete, and conveys the same information as the ground truth with only minor, acceptable rounding. The correctness score is 9 instead of 10 due to the slight rounding up from $3.436B to $3.44B, though this is within typical reporting tolerance.",

McDonald’s revenue ($25,494 million) and D&A as a percentage of revenue (1.5%) are also correct. However, the ground truth does not provide Tesla’s D&A as a percentage of revenue or Tesla’s total revenue, instead emphasizing the deferred tax liability context and comparative capital intensity. The LLM introduces Tesla’s revenue ($81,460 million) and computes 2.6% D&A/revenue, which, while factually plausible, is not present in the original answer and adds unsupported detail. (2) All provided numbers are quantitatively accurate, and calculations (382 ÷ 25,494 ≈ 1.5%) are correct. The $2,122 million figure for Tesla is correctly cited as tied to deferred tax liabilities in the filing, but presenting it directly as D&A expense without qualification slightly misrepresents the source, though the knowledge graph accepts it as reflective of D&A. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—correctly combining figures across two companies and normalizing by revenue. However, the original answer avoids computing Tesla’s D&A/revenue ratio, likely due to the nuance that Tesla’s $2,122M is derived from deferred tax disclosures rather than a direct income statement D&A line. The LLM treats it as a direct expense without this caveat, weakening qualitative accuracy. (4) Despite the over-interpretation, the answer remains highly relevant and addresses both parts of the question.

This part is factually correct. However, for Emerson, the LLM misrepresents the data: it states Emerson's unbilled receivables in 2023 as $1,453 million (which is actually the 2022 value per ground truth), and fails to note the increase to $1,599 million in 2023. Instead, it incorrectly uses $1,453 million as the 2023 value and then subtracts customer advances to compute a net contract asset of $556 million, which is not relevant to the question. The question asks about the *change* in net contract asset positions due to changes in unbilled receivables, not the absolute net contract asset balance. (2) The calculation of Boeing’s $317 million decrease is correct. However, Emerson’s change should be an increase of $146 million ($1,599M - $1,453M), but this is entirely missing. The LLM instead computes a static net balance using customer advances, which is not requested. The final comparison claims Boeing’s change is '$239 million lower' than Emerson’s net balance, which misaligns concepts (change vs. level) and answers a different question. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not compare the *changes* in net contract assets as required.

However, COP does not disclose a specific dollar amount for its low-carbon investments. In contrast, XOM provides a concrete figure of $0.9 billion invested in its Low Carbon Solutions business in 2024, specifically targeting carbon capture and storage, lithium, and carbon-free hydrogen projects. This contrast indicates that while both companies are investing in low-carbon technologies, XOM is making a more quantifiably directed financial commitment to these initiatives, whereas COP's investment appears to be ongoing but less specifically itemized, suggesting a potentially broader or less mature allocation of resources toward low-carbon solutions.",

PM highlights that geopolitical instability from the war in Ukraine and sanctions could increase exposure to currency fluctuations, which may raise operational costs and reduce demand for its products. Both companies are exposed to currency volatility, but PM also faces additional geopolitical and regulatory risks in Russia that could lead to asset impairments and deconsolidation, compounding the financial impact beyond typical FX exposure.",

However, there are minor quantitative inaccuracies that prevent a top score. Specifically: (1) The LLM cites a '$474 million, 20-bp hit to 2024 net sales' from Canadian and other international currency moves, but this specific figure and basis point impact are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided information—this introduces unverified data. The ground truth does not include any dollar amounts or basis point impacts related to Costco’s FX exposure. (2) The ground truth states that PM derived 6% of total net revenues from Russia and 1% from Ukraine in 2024, but the LLM omits these specific percentages, which are key quantitative details. While the LLM correctly identifies that PM’s exposure is tied to geopolitical risks (sanctions, capital controls, asset impairments) beyond routine translation effects, it fails to quantify the revenue exposure, reducing quantitative accuracy. Qualitatively, the answer excels: it correctly distinguishes Costco’s operational FX translation risk (impact on dollar-denominated revenue and margins due to local currency weakness) from PM’s more severe geopolitical-currency risk complex (including potential loss of access or value). The multi-hop reasoning—comparing two companies’ FX exposures across different risk profiles—is sound and well-articulated.

However, several of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory, or contractual restrictions that limit their ability to provide such payments. These restrictions include local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements tied to Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Similarly, Wells Fargo’s subsidiary banks are restricted under federal law from transferring funds or assets to the Parent or its nonbank subsidiaries in excess of 10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for any single affiliate and 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates. These limitations, combined with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length transaction terms, constrain the ability of both Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo to reallocate capital internally, thereby reducing flexibility in managing liquidity and capital during periods of financial stress or regulatory scrutiny.",

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar's customer advances increased from $1,860 million in 2022 to $1,929 million in 2023, reflecting a $69 million growth. This increase indicates a shift in the timing and volume of advance payments received from customers. In contrast, General Dynamics explicitly describes the role of customer advances in shaping revenue recognition timing, particularly in their defense and aerospace segments. In defense, customer advances are less common, and billing typically follows revenue recognition, creating contract assets. However, international contracts sometimes result in customer advances before revenue is recognized, creating contract liabilities. In aerospace, General Dynamics often receives deposits upon contract execution and milestone achievements, which are later liquidated as revenue. Therefore, while Caterpillar's customer advances grew modestly, General Dynamics highlights a more structured and segment-specific impact of these advances on financial reporting timing.",

This matches the ground truth exactly in dollar terms (allowing for format variation: $1,860 million = $1.86 billion; $1,929 million ≈ $1.93 billion). The approximate 3–4% rise is a reasonable inference and not contradicted by the original. 2) On General Dynamics, the LLM accurately identifies that customer advances are treated as contract liabilities and affect revenue recognition timing, particularly in international defense and aerospace contracts. It correctly notes that advances are liquidated as milestones are met, aligning with the original’s description of deposit structures in aerospace and international defense. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model compares Caterpillar’s quantitative change to General Dynamics’ qualitative policy on revenue timing, synthesizing information across two companies and contexts. 4) Minor omission: the original answer provides more nuance—specifically, that in domestic defense contracts, billing follows revenue (creating contract assets), whereas advances occur more often in international deals. The LLM mentions international contracts but doesn’t contrast them with domestic practices. Also, the original distinguishes between defense and aerospace segments more clearly. Despite this, the core qualitative and quantitative facts are correct and relevant. Hence, high scores across the board with a slight deduction in qualitative accuracy for incomplete segment-specific detail.",

The combined total of Programming and Production costs for Comcast (CMCSA) in 2023 and Disney (DIS) in 2023 is stated as $42,145 million, but the ground truth is $49,135 million. The LLM incorrectly reports Disney's 2023 cost as $5,383 million and Comcast's as $36,762 million, which do not align with the knowledge graph. Furthermore, the LLM claims Disney’s costs decreased from $5,383 million in 2023 to $4,135 million in 2024, implying a 23% decrease, while the ground truth states there was a 5% increase from 2023 to 2024. This misrepresents both the direction and magnitude of change. (2) The sum $36,762M + $5,383M = $42,145M is arithmetically correct, but the inputs are factually wrong. The percentage change calculation is also mathematically correct for the provided numbers ((4,135 - 5,383)/5,383 ≈ -23%), but based on incorrect data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the actual Programming and Production costs for the two companies in the correct years. It also inverted the trend for Disney, reporting a large decrease instead of a 5% increase. (4) Due to severe inaccuracies in numbers, trends, and synthesis, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.

Alphabet disclosed changes in monetization metrics for Google Network revenues, which are impression- and cost-per-impression-based, but did not provide specific growth percentages or drivers for impression volume growth.

It explains that debt securities are classified as current or long-term based on contractual maturities or the intent to sell within twelve months, and it outlines a structured process for evaluating credit-related impairments and non-credit-related losses. This indicates a more structured and market-sensitive approach to managing investment risk and liquidity. In contrast, MDT references 'current investments' only in the context of its overall liquidity and flexibility, stating that its cash, cash equivalents, current investments, and credit facilities will satisfy its current and future obligations. MDT does not specify the composition or management methodology of its current investments, suggesting a more generalized reliance on liquidity without the same level of detail or risk segmentation as CVS. This difference reflects that CVS adopts a more granular and proactive strategy for managing investment-related liquidity risks, while MDT emphasizes broad financial strength and flexibility without elaborating on specific investment management practices.",

      "original_answer": "ACN's effective income tax rate was reduced by 2.1 percentage points in 2023 due to the FDII deduction, while QCOM explicitly references FDII as a special deduction influencing its provision for income taxes. This reveals that both companies leverage the FDII deduction as part of their tax strategy to lower their effective tax rates by capitalizing on foreign-derived intangible income.",
      "llm_answer": "**Qualcomm (QCOM)** – The reconciliation of its effective tax rate shows a “Foreign‑derived intangible income (FDII) deduction” of **‑1.5 percentage points in FY 2024** (‑2.1 pp in FY 2023 and ‑1.0 pp in FY 2022).  After adding the FDII benefit, Qualcomm’s effective income‑tax rate is **23.5 % for FY 2024** (23.4 % in FY 2023), well below the 21 % statutory U.S. rate plus the other state‑ and foreign‑rate components shown in the same table【page_89】.  \n\n**Accenture (ACN)** – Accenture’s tax‑rate reconciliation also includes an FDII line, which lowers its overall effective tax rate by roughly **‑1.0 percentage point** (the table shows an effective tax rate of **≈22 %** after the FDII adjustment).  \n\n**What this reveals** – Both companies use the FDII provision to shave a measurable amount off their headline effective tax rates, indicating that each deliberately structures a portion of its earnings from foreign‑derived intangible assets (patents, software, licensing) to qualify for the FDII deduction.  Qualcomm’s larger FDII impact (up to 2 pp) reflects a heavier reliance on offshore IP licensing, while Accenture’s smaller but still material FDII benefit shows a similar, though less pronounced, tax‑planning focus on foreign‑derived intangible income.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, ACN's effective tax rate was reduced by 2.1 percentage points due to FDII in 2023, but the LLM states it was reduced by only ~1.0 percentage point. For QCOM, the LLM reports a -1.5 pp impact in FY2024 and -2.1 pp in FY2023, but the original answer only confirms QCOM references FDII as a factor without specifying the exact impact in any year—especially not for 2023 or 2024. Thus, the LLM fabricates precise numbers not present in the ground truth and misattributes the 2.1 pp figure (which belongs to ACN) to QCOM. (2) Number verification: The LLM incorrectly assigns a -2.1 pp FDII benefit to QCOM in FY2023, which contradicts the ground truth that attributes that exact number to ACN. It also introduces FY2024 data not mentioned in the original answer, making it factually unsupported. The effective tax rates cited (e.g., 23.5% for QCOM, ~22% for ACN) are not in the ground truth and cannot be verified against it. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the LLM correctly infers that both companies use FDII as part of their tax strategy and links this to foreign-derived intangible income like IP and licensing. The comparative analysis (QCOM relying more heavily than ACN) shows logical reasoning, though it's based on incorrect numerical foundations. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies, the FDII deduction’s impact on tax rates, and the implications for tax strategy. However, due to major factual errors in numbers and misattribution of data between companies and years, the correctness score is limited to 5—partially correct but with significant errors undermining reliability.",

The distinction between remeasurement (into earnings) and translation (into other comprehensive income) is correctly noted for Goldman Sachs, which adds contextual clarity even though not explicitly required. (2) There are no numeric values in this question, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable beyond correct use of terminology—this is satisfied.

(4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM adds a detail about translation gains/losses going to other comprehensive income for Goldman Sachs, which, while likely true, is not present in the original answer and slightly exceeds the scope of the question. However, this does not detract from correctness. Wording differs but maintains semantic equivalence. All entities (BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, 2024 10-K context implied) are correct.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts is $70 million for Duke Energy and $500 million for NextEra Energy, resulting in a total of $570 million.

The ground truth states Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts are $70 million, but the LLM incorrectly calculates $207 million by summing $70 million (designated) and $137 million (non-designated), implying the total is $207 million when the correct total for commodity contracts is only $70 million. Similarly, for NextEra Energy, the ground truth specifies $500 million, but the LLM uses $1,199 million (total noncurrent derivative liabilities), incorrectly assuming the entire balance is commodity-related. This leads to a combined total of $1,406 million instead of the correct $570 million. These miscalculations severely undermine factual accuracy. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on incorrect data extraction. The sum $207 + $1,199 = $1,406 is mathematically correct, but both inputs are wrong. The correct sum is $70 + $500 = $570 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly identify the specific liability components for commodity contracts. It conflated total derivative liabilities with commodity-specific liabilities for NEE and double-counted designated and non-designated hedges for Duke Energy, failing to isolate the correct metric. (4) While the qualitative interpretation about risk exposure is logically structured—larger liabilities implying greater risk—the reasoning is based on incorrect data, so the conclusion is misleading. The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies, time frame (2020), and concept (hedging strategy), but the factual foundation is flawed.

This total represents 54.3% of ABT’s operating earnings ($6,825 million) and 54.7% of CVS’s operating earnings ($13,743 million + $2,658 interest expense - $88 other income = $16,313 earnings before taxes).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the amortization amounts for ABT ($1.878 billion) and CVS ($1.905 billion), and their sum ($3.783 billion, rounded to $3.78 billion) is accurate. ABT’s operating earnings ($6.825 billion) are also correctly stated. However, the LLM incorrectly reports CVS’s operating earnings as $13.743 billion, which is actually the operating earnings before adjusting for interest and other items. The ground truth uses a derived figure of $16,313 million as earnings before taxes (operating earnings + interest expense - other income), which is necessary for accurate comparison. The LLM fails to perform this multi-hop adjustment, leading to a significant error in the percentage calculation. (2) The percentage of combined amortization relative to ABT’s earnings is correctly approximated at ~55% (actual: 54.3%), but the percentage for CVS is wrong: LLM reports 27%, while correct value is ~54.7% (3,783 / 16,313 ≈ 0.232 for $13.743B, but 3,783 / 16,313 ≈ 0.232 only if using wrong base; actually, 1,905 / 16,313 ≈ 11.7%, but question asks how *combined* amortization compares to *each* company’s earnings — so 3,783 / 6,825 ≈ 55.4% and 3,783 / 16,313 ≈ 23.2% would be correct interpretation — however, original answer states 54.7% of CVS’s earnings, implying it uses *CVS’s portion* of amortization (1,905 / 16,313 ≈ 11.7%) — contradiction in ground truth logic). There is ambiguity in the ground truth: it says 'this total' (i.e., combined $3,783M) represents 54.7% of CVS’s earnings, but 3,783 / 16,313 ≈ 23.2%, not 54.7%. 54.7% would be 1,905 / 3,483 ≈ no match. Rechecking: 1,905 / 16,313 ≈ 11.7%; 3,783 / 16,313 ≈ 23.2%. Neither is 54.7%. However, 1,905 / 3,483 ≈ 54.7% — possibly miscalculation in ground truth. Alternatively, 1,905 / (13,743 + 2,658 - 88) = 1,905 / 16,313 ≈ 11.68%. So ground truth appears to have an error. But LLM reports 27% — possibly 1,905 / 7,000? Not matching. Alternatively, LLM may have computed 1,905 / 6,825 ≈ 27.9% — misattribution. So both LLM and ground truth have issues. However, LLM correctly states that combined amortization is below both companies’ operating earnings, which is true regardless. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: LLM retrieves correct amortization figures and ABT earnings, but fails to adjust CVS earnings with interest and other income/expenses as implied by the ground truth’s calculation, even though that adjustment leads to an inconsistent percentage. (4) Due to conflicting calculations in ground truth and LLM, correctness score is moderate: LLM gets raw amortization numbers right and sum correct, ABT comparison reasonable, but CVS operating earnings and resulting percentage are incorrect. Quantitative accuracy docked for wrong CVS earnings and percentage. Qualitative accuracy penalized for incomplete synthesis.

      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s 2022 filing shows that the bulk of its cash‑flow pressure comes from large, upfront payments for acquiring and producing new titles – cash is spent in the period the content is bought or produced, while the related revenue is spread out over the life of the titles through amortization. In contrast, Comcast’s Studios segment records licensing revenue when the content is delivered, but the cash from those licenses is collected over the multi‑year term of the agreements (payments “generally collected over the license term”) 【page_94】, creating a lag between revenue recognition and cash receipt. Thus, Netflix must manage heavy near‑term cash outflows to fund its pipeline, whereas Comcast must manage the opposite timing risk of recognizing revenue before the associated cash is fully received.",

It accurately contrasts Netflix’s need to fund production upfront with Comcast’s recognition of revenue before full cash collection. However, the LLM omits specific quantitative figures from the ground truth: Netflix’s $1,408 million in principal and interest due in the next twelve months and the $4.4 billion remaining in stock repurchase authorization are not mentioned. Additionally, while Comcast’s 'half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue' in deferred revenue is conceptually aligned with the idea of timing lag, this specific metric is missing. (2) The absence of these exact numbers reduces quantitative accuracy, even though no incorrect numbers are stated. The LLM does not fabricate data but fails to include key financial figures present in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly synthesizing Netflix’s cash flow pressure from upfront payments with Comcast’s revenue recognition policy and cash collection lag. The logic accurately reflects the different financial challenges: Netflix faces liquidity pressure from outflows, Comcast from revenue recognition timing versus cash inflows. (4) Scores reflect high qualitative and contextual accuracy due to correct entities (Netflix, Comcast Studios), accurate characterization of revenue and cash flow timing, and strong reasoning. The correctness score is reduced due to missing key financial data points, but the conceptual explanation remains strong and semantically aligned with the ground truth.",

However, it makes a critical error in calculating CVS’s total cost of products sold across all segments in 2022. The LLM incorrectly adds $160,738 million (labeled as Health Services) + $82,063 million + $42 million to reach $242,843 million. This contradicts the ground truth, which states the total cost for CVS in 2022 was $160,738 million — meaning the LLM has misattributed that figure as a segment value rather than the total. As a result, the comparison percentage is wrong: LLM reports ~42%, but correct value is ~62.6%. (2) Number verification: ABT 2024 = $18,706M ✓, CVS PCW 2022 = $82,063M ✓, sum = $100,769M ✓, CVS total 2022 = $160,738M (ground truth) but LLM uses $242,843M ✗, leading to incorrect percentage. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly retrieves and combines two distinct data points across companies and years, satisfying the first part. However, it fails in the comparative analysis due to misinterpreting the scope of the CVS total cost figure — a critical multi-hop failure in contextual understanding of segment vs. total. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to partial accuracy on the sum but major error in the comparative baseline and resulting percentage. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because half the numbers are correct but the key total and percentage are not. Qualitative accuracy is 4 due to flawed logic in segment aggregation.

SPG, on the other hand, capitalizes construction-related costs—including interest and real estate taxes—during the development period until the asset is ready for its intended use.

The calculated decline of $47 million is accurate ($230.8M - $183.8M = $47M), though the ground truth does not explicitly state the difference, so this represents a correct inference. SPG's capitalization policy is accurately described: it capitalizes construction-related costs including interest and real estate taxes during development, which aligns with the original answer. The implication about differing financial treatments—AMT reducing liabilities vs. SPG capitalizing costs as assets—is correctly interpreted and semantically equivalent to the ground truth.\n\n2) All numeric values are correct: $230.8 million (2022), $183.8 million (2023), and the implied $47 million difference are all factually accurate. No calculation errors.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two companies (AMT and SPG), two time points (2022–2023), and two distinct accounting treatments (liability reduction vs. cost capitalization). It correctly contrasts balance sheet treatment (liabilities vs. capitalized assets) and infers strategic differences in financial reporting.\n\n4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is minor: the LLM uses the phrase 'recognizing less work-in-progress as a liability,' which slightly mischaracterizes accrued construction costs—they are liabilities for services received but not yet paid, not necessarily tied to work-in-progress recognition. The ground truth more precisely frames it as a reduction in liabilities, possibly due to settlement or decreased activity. This is a subtle distinction and does not undermine the overall correctness, but slightly affects qualitative precision. Otherwise, the answer is factually complete, contextually relevant, and well-reasoned.",

According to the ground truth, RTX's total segment operating profit in 2024 is $6,339 million, but the LLM reports $8,744 million—this is a major error. The LLM appears to have incorrectly summed RTX's segments: Collins Aerospace ($4,135M), Pratt & Whitney ($2,015M), and Raytheon ($2,594M) sum to $8,744M, but this contradicts the ground truth total of $6,339M, suggesting either misattribution of segment profits or use of incorrect data. UPS's segment operating profit of $7,536 million is correct and matches the ground truth. The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM reports $16,280 million, but the correct total is $13,875 million. Additionally, RTX's margin is reported as 10.5%, but the ground truth is 9.2%, which further indicates incorrect inputs or calculations. (2) Calculations: The LLM computes RTX’s margin as $8,744M / $83,063M ≈ 10.5%, but since both numerator and denominator appear inconsistent with the ground truth, this calculation, while mathematically correct given its inputs, is factually wrong. UPS’s margin calculation (8.3%) is reasonable but not directly verifiable without exact revenue figure; however, the ground truth does not provide UPS margin, so this is a minor issue. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that RTX operates in high-margin defense/aerospace and UPS in lower-margin logistics, and it attempts to explain the margin difference in strategic terms—this qualitative reasoning aligns with the ground truth and shows sound synthesis. However, because the underlying numbers are incorrect, the reasoning is based on flawed premises. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4/10) due to major quantitative errors in core metrics. Quantitative accuracy is poor (3/10) because RTX’s profit and margin are significantly off. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6/10) as the strategic interpretation is reasonable and contextually appropriate.

However, the LLM claims that CVS’s total cost of products sold in 2023 was $266.872 billion, which is incorrect. This misrepresents the core fact that the sum equals the total, not a portion.

However, the LLM incorrectly reports CVS’s other segments (e.g., Health Services at $175.424 billion) which are not supported by the ground truth, as the total should be $110,153 million, not $266.872 billion.

BlackRock operates as a dedicated asset manager with a strong emphasis on ETFs, which are vehicles that attract large-scale inflows driven by client demand for passive and active investment strategies. The $390 billion in ETF net inflows directly contributes to BlackRock’s assets under management (AUM), which in turn drives its investment management revenue as a percentage of AUM. In contrast, Goldman Sachs’ investment management revenue of $10.596 billion encompasses a broader set of services, including private wealth management and institutional asset management, and is not solely dependent on ETF inflows. This highlights Goldman Sachs’ diversified revenue base, which includes investment banking, market making, and other principal transactions, distinguishing it from BlackRock’s more focused asset management model.",
      "llm_answer": "BlackRock reported roughly $390 billion of net ETF inflows in 2024, whereas Goldman Sachs earned $10.6 billion of investment‑management revenue that year—a gap of about $379 billion. The contrast underscores BlackRock’s role as a pure‑play asset manager whose growth is driven by attracting huge new ETF assets that generate fee income on a massive AUM base, while Goldman Sachs’ investment‑management business is a smaller, fee‑based component of a diversified banking model that earns revenue from advisory, wealth‑management and other services rather than from the scale of ETF inflows.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies BlackRock's 2024 ETF net inflows as $390 billion and Goldman Sachs' 2024 investment management revenue as $10.6 billion (a rounded version of the exact $10.596 billion), and calculates the difference as approximately $379 billion, which is accurate when rounding is considered. The exact difference is $379.404 billion, so the LLM's approximation of $379 billion is acceptable and semantically equivalent. 2) All numeric values are correct within reasonable rounding: $10.6 billion is a standard rounding of $10.596 billion, and the resulting $379 billion difference aligns with this approximation. No calculation errors are present. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two firms (BlackRock and Goldman Sachs), distinguishes between ETF inflows (a volume metric) and investment management revenue (an income metric), and links these to their respective business models. It accurately characterizes BlackRock as a pure-play asset manager focused on ETFs and AUM-driven fees, and contrasts this with Goldman Sachs’ diversified banking model where investment management is one of several revenue streams. 4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the quantitative difference and the qualitative explanation of differing roles and revenue models. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention that BlackRock’s revenue is derived as a percentage of AUM (which grows with inflows), a nuance present in the original answer. However, the core idea—that ETF inflows drive fee income via AUM—is clearly conveyed. Thus, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and highly aligned with the ground truth, warranting a 9/10 for overall correctness.",

According to the ground truth, the correct 2021 Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized is $84 million for DUK and $615 million for NEE (summing to $699 million). However, the LLM reports $114 million for DUK and $586 million for NEE, which are incorrect. The combined total of $700 million is close but not exact. (2) The 2019 values are correctly stated as $84 million (DUK) and $614 million (NEE), summing to $698 million, which matches the ground truth. The comparison concludes a $2 million increase, but the correct difference is a $1 million increase ($699M - $698M). This small error stems from incorrect input values.

The combined segment operating profit is correctly calculated as $13.1 billion (rounded from $13,136 million), with RTX contributing $4.749 billion and UPS $8.387 billion, matching the ground truth values. The operating profit margin for RTX is accurately stated as 6.7%. The proportion of UPS's segment operating profit to total consolidated revenue is calculated as $8.387B / $90.958B ≈ 9.2%, which is a correct rounding of the actual 9.1% in the ground truth—this minor discrepancy is within acceptable rounding tolerance. (2) All calculations are accurate: sum of profits is correct ($4.749B + $8.387B = $13.136B), and the UPS margin calculation is mathematically sound and correctly derived. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is properly executed: the model correctly identifies and retrieves segment operating profits for two different companies (RTX and UPS), computes a sum, retrieves RTX’s margin, calculates UPS’s profit-to-revenue ratio, and makes a valid comparison. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more precise decimal usage and transparent calculation steps. The minor difference in UPS’s percentage (9.2% vs 9.1%) likely stems from rounding intermediate values but does not materially affect correctness.

While it correctly identifies TXN's remaining authorization as $7.24 billion and NVDA's as $10.0 billion, it calculates the sum as $17.24 billion, which is incorrect. The correct sum is $17.24 billion, but the ground truth states $19.24 billion, indicating that at least one of the input figures in the LLM answer is factually wrong. Given the ground truth, either NVDA or TXN (or both) authorizations are misstated. (2) The calculation itself (10.0 + 7.24 = 17.24) is mathematically correct, but the inputs do not align with the ground truth data. The expected total of $19.24 billion suggests the correct inputs should sum to that value (e.g., $12.0B + $7.24B or similar), meaning the LLM's $10.0B for NVDA is likely incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model identifies both companies, retrieves their respective repurchase authorizations, and attempts to sum them — but the failure to use correct source data undermines the synthesis.

According to the ground truth, AMZN had an unrealized net loss of $(13.6) billion in 2024, not 'immaterial' or $0 as claimed. The LLM incorrectly concludes that Amazon did not disclose the figure due to immateriality, which contradicts the ground truth that explicitly states the value. TSLA's unrealized gain of $12 million is correctly reported. However, the combined effect is stated as a $12 million net gain, whereas the correct combined value is a net loss of $(13.588) billion, a massive discrepancy. (2) Number verification: $12 million for TSLA is correct; AMZN's $(13.6) billion loss is entirely omitted and replaced with $0, leading to a false total. The calculation of combining $12 million + $0 is incorrect due to the missing AMZN loss. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model must synthesize data from both AMZN and TSLA filings, but it incorrectly dismisses AMZN's data as undisclosed/immateral instead of reporting the known loss. This breaks the multi-hop logic required. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and metric, and correctly reports Tesla’s impact on comprehensive income, but fails on Amazon’s side and thus misrepresents the combined effect and overall financial impact.

      "original_answer": "At INTC, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years effective January 2023, which reduces annual depreciation expense going forward. This change was influenced by factors such as process technology cadence, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and reuse of machinery across process generations. At CRM, costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized over four years — longer than the typical initial contract period — based on factors including estimated life cycles of offerings and customer attrition. This amortization period directly affects marketing and sales expense on the income statement. Both companies use straight-line depreciation/amortization methods, but the differing amortization periods reflect distinct operational factors: CRM focuses on customer lifecycle and renewal expectations, while INTC considers technological longevity and manufacturing transitions.",
      "llm_answer": "- Intel (INTC) lengthened the estimated useful lives of certain wafer‑fab machinery from 5 to 8 years beginning in Q1 2023.

The LLM claims that this data is absent from the provided 10-K excerpts, but since the ground truth is derived from actual filing data in the knowledge graph, the LLM should have produced the correct figures. Instead, it evades answering by asserting lack of information, which contradicts the verified truth. There are no correct numbers, no valid calculations, and no accurate reasoning. The response fails on all dimensions: it does not provide the combined revenue, misrepresents data availability, and offers no valid comparison of profitability impacts from expense ratios.

These values match the ground truth. The combined 2024 value is correctly calculated as $2,260 million. However, the combined 2023 value is incorrectly stated as $2,197 million being the base for an 'increase'—in reality, $2,260 million (2024) is greater than $2,197 million (2023), so the change is an increase, but the ground truth explicitly states this is a decrease, which contradicts the numbers. Upon verification: $1,029 (BA 2024) + $1,231 (GE 2024) = $2,260; $956 (BA 2023) + $1,241 (GE 2023) = $2,197. Therefore, $2,260 > $2,197 → actual change is an increase of $63 million. The ground truth contains an error in its directional claim (it says 'decrease' when it should be 'increase'). The LLM answer correctly computes the values and the direction of change. Thus, the LLM is numerically and logically correct, but marked down because it contradicts the ground truth’s erroneous assertion. However, since our evaluation must follow the ground truth as authoritative, the LLM is penalized despite being factually accurate. (2) All numbers are correct: $1,029M, $956M, $1,231M, $1,241M, sum $2,260M, prior sum $2,197M. The calculation of the year-over-year change as an increase of $63M is accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two companies across two years, computes totals, and draws a valid comparison. (4) Final scores: Correctness 7/10 because while the LLM answer is quantitatively accurate and logically sound, it contradicts the ground truth’s incorrect directional assessment. To align with instructions, we must treat the ground truth as correct, so the LLM's correct logic is marked as partially incorrect.

However, it introduces a new figure—NVIDIA's 'net deferred-tax asset' of $976 million—which is not requested in the question and appears to be a calculated net after offsetting liabilities. This figure is not part of the original question's focus, which specifically asks for the comparison between NVIDIA's *long-term net deferred tax asset* and Texas Instruments' *net deferred tax asset*. (2) The calculation of the difference is incorrect: the LLM states the difference is 'roughly $800 million', but the correct difference is $1.22B - $0.176B = $1.044B ($1,044 million). The $800 million figure appears to come from subtracting $176M from $976M, which confuses the net deferred-tax asset (a different metric) with the long-term net deferred tax asset. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is correctly pulled for both companies and the correct fiscal year (2022)—but the model fails to use the correct NVIDIA metric for comparison. It should have directly compared the $1.22B (NVIDIA long-term net deferred tax asset) to $176M (TI's net deferred tax asset) without introducing an intermediate, unrequested net figure. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the companies, year, and metric category correctly. However, the quantitative accuracy is reduced due to the incorrect final difference and introduction of an irrelevant net figure. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the reasoning is logical but based on a misinterpretation of which metric to use for NVIDIA.

This reflects a strategy of aligning amortization with expected consumer demand and monetization of content, particularly within Amazon Prime memberships. In contrast, TSLA amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from seven to thirty years, indicating a more uniform approach to asset value recognition that does not vary with usage patterns.

However, there are key quantitative inaccuracies. The ground truth states that AMZN capitalized $19.6 billion in video and music content as of December 31, 2024; this specific dollar amount and date are missing in the LLM response. Instead, the LLM introduces a 'weighted-average remaining life of about 3 years' for AMZN's content, which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified against the provided ground truth. For TSLA, the LLM claims software intangibles are amortized over 3-to-5 years, but the ground truth only specifies 7-to-30 years for 'other intangibles' without mentioning software separately—this introduces entity-specific detail not supported by the source. (2) The absence of the $19.6 billion figure and the incorrect breakdown of TSLA’s amortization periods reduce quantitative accuracy. While format flexibility is allowed, missing major figures and introducing unsupported ones impacts factual precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that AMZN uses accelerated/usage-based amortization (with straight-line as fallback) versus TSLA’s straight-line approach, and infers strategic differences in asset management—this demonstrates proper synthesis across entities and methods.

This results from incorrectly adding TGT's $22 million reduction as a positive $22 million increase. In reality, TGT reduced its pension-related AOCI loss by $22 million (from $719M to $697M), meaning its change is -$22 million. PM's $164 million increase is correct. The correct net change is $164M + (-$22M) = $142M. The LLM instead computes $164M + $22M = $186M, which is factually wrong. (2) The individual components are partially correct: PM’s $164M increase is accurate; TGT’s movement from $719M to $697M is correctly cited, but the characterization of this as a '$22M increase' is incorrect—it is a $22M decrease in loss, i.e., a $22M improvement. The direction of change is misrepresented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model identifies both companies, the correct metric (pension-related AOCI), and attempts to synthesize across both. However, it fails in correctly interpreting the sign and impact of TGT’s change, leading to an incorrect aggregate. The qualitative comparison about PM having larger adjustments is valid, but the claim that TGT had a $22M increase contradicts the ground truth. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the question structure, discusses both companies, and attempts to explain accounting differences. However, due to the major calculation error and misinterpretation of directional changes, the correctness score is low.

This implies AMD's payments are (4,020 - 2,572)/2 = $724 million and CRM's are $3,296 million — not $4,004 million. The LLM incorrectly calculates CRM's total by summing $3,296M (operating) and $708M (finance), arriving at $4,004M, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) The calculation errors are significant: the sum of $3,296M + $708M is actually $4,004M, but this value does not align with the ground truth combined total of $4,020M, suggesting the LLM misattributed CRM's total. Moreover, asserting AMD's lease payments as $0M is factually wrong per the knowledge graph. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly extract AMD's lease obligations nor compute the comparative difference. It assumed absence of data implies zero value, which is invalid. (4) Scores reflect major factual and computational errors (correctness=2), poor number accuracy (quantitative=2), flawed reasoning despite correct identification of CRM subcomponents (qualitative=3), and partial relevance as it addressed the right companies and metric type (contextual=6).",

The original answer states that the combined cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized, by Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) and NextEra Energy, Inc.

However, the LLM claims that only NEE’s figure is available ($308 million) and that DUK’s data is missing from the provided materials. This contradicts the ground truth, which clearly includes both figures and their sum. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports $308 million for NEE, but the correct amount per the original answer is $586 million. The combined total is stated as $907 million in the ground truth, but the LLM does not compute or acknowledge this. There is no indication that the LLM had access to incomplete data—the evaluation assumes the model should have accessed the correct filings or knowledge graph data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the question requires retrieving and summing two specific financial figures from two companies in the same year, then comparing the sum to one component. The LLM incorrectly asserts data unavailability rather than performing the synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the response addresses the right metric and companies, but the refusal to provide numbers based on claimed data gaps—when the correct data exists in the knowledge base—undermines correctness. The model appears to hallucinate a limitation in data access rather than using available knowledge. Thus, the scores are low: 1 for correctness and quantitative accuracy due to entirely wrong numbers and missing totals, 2 for qualitative accuracy due to flawed reasoning, and 5 for contextual relevance as the framework of the response is appropriate but content is incorrect.",

While it correctly identifies that both Disney and Verizon experienced a shift in collateral cash flows related to derivative contracts from 2022 to 2023, the combined impact it reports ($7.3 billion) is more than double the ground truth ($3.18 billion). (2) For Disney, the LLM cites a $4.1 billion increase in operating cash flow and attributes part of it to collateral receipts vs. payments, but this figure represents total operating cash flow growth, not the specific impact of collateral changes. The knowledge graph indicates that Disney's actual collateral-related cash flow swing was approximately $1.3 billion (from a $1.1 billion outflow in 2022 to a $0.2 billion inflow in 2023). For Verizon, the LLM correctly reports a shift from paying $2.3 billion in 2022 to receiving $880 million in 2023, which is a $3.18 billion swing — this aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM incorrectly adds Disney’s total OCF increase to Verizon’s collateral swing. The correct total impact is Verizon’s $3.18 billion swing plus Disney’s ~$1.3 billion swing, totaling ~$4.48 billion — still not matching the ground truth of $3.18 billion, suggesting either updated data or a different interpretation. But the LLM’s $7.3 billion figure is clearly wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to isolate the specific collateral payment impact for Disney and instead uses total OCF change, leading to a major overstatement. It correctly isolates Verizon’s swing but then combines it with an incorrect Disney figure.

      "original_answer": "HD reports an estimated useful life of 5-45 years for leasehold improvements, while MCD depreciates leasehold improvements using the lesser of the asset's useful life or the lease term, which generally includes certain option periods. This difference suggests that HD may adopt a more standardized approach to depreciation over a fixed range, whereas MCD tailors depreciation timelines based on lease agreements. As a result, MCD may experience more variability in annual depreciation expense depending on lease structures, while HD's approach could lead to more predictable long-term expense patterns.",

The citation of specific 10-K pages adds credibility, and the numbers are accurate with acceptable formatting. This earns a perfect score on quantitative accuracy. However, the qualitative reasoning contains a partial misinterpretation: while it's true that MCD uses the shorter of the useful life or lease term (including option periods), the LLM incorrectly implies that this always results in faster depreciation and front-loading of expenses. The ground truth emphasizes that MCD’s approach introduces *variability* based on lease structures, not necessarily shorter or front-loaded depreciation in all cases. Additionally, the LLM suggests HD spreads costs over a 'longer horizon' implying systematically lower annual expenses, but HD’s 5-year minimum could result in shorter depreciation periods than some MCD leases. The answer oversimplifies the strategic implications by focusing only on duration and expense timing, missing the ground truth’s key point about HD’s more *predictable* long-term expense patterns versus MCD’s *variable* ones due to lease-specific adjustments. Thus, while the facts are correct, the synthesis and strategic interpretation are partially flawed, warranting a 7 in qualitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "MA's strategy to expand digital payment options, including accelerating digitization and growing acceptance, increases transaction volume across its network. This growth in transaction volume could lead to a decline in credit card borrowing activity, as consumers shift toward alternative payment methods. According to COF's 10-K filing, a decline in consumer borrowing activity, including credit card use, could materially and negatively affect COF's business and financial results. Therefore, while MA benefits from higher transaction volume through its digital payments expansion, this trend may indirectly reduce COF's revenue from credit-related products.",

(2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers requiring verification; thus, quantitative accuracy is 10 as no numbers are misstated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that increased use of MA's digital payment methods could reduce credit card borrowing and purchase activity at COF, leading to lower interest and fee income—this causal chain is supported by COF’s 10-K (page 30) and matches the original answer’s logic. (4) The LLM adds slightly more detail than the ground truth (e.g., naming specific technologies like 'Digital First' cards and 'Click-to-Pay', and referencing credit-risk pressures), but does not introduce inaccuracies. The only minor shortcoming is that it doesn’t explicitly state the indirect nature of the impact (i.e., MA benefits while COF is negatively affected as a consequence of consumer behavior shifts), though this is implied.

According to the ground truth, AMD has a net deferred tax *asset* of $339 million, not a net liability as claimed by the LLM. Conversely, the LLM incorrectly states that Salesforce (CRM) has a net deferred tax asset of $339 million, but in reality, CRM has a net deferred tax asset of $4,770 million—over 14 times larger. The LLM also fabricates a $4.17 billion gross deferred tax liability for CRM and a $2.89 billion R&D-related deferred tax asset, which are not present in the ground truth. The actual difference in net deferred tax positions is $4,509 million (|$4,770M - $339M|), but the LLM fails to compute or mention this. (2) Completeness: The answer attempts to address both companies and the role of acquired intangibles, but misrepresents the core financial positions. It misses the key fact that both companies have net *deferred tax assets*, not liabilities, and incorrectly frames AMD as having a net liability. (3) Entity Accuracy: Company names (AMD, CRM) and fiscal year (2024) are correct. However, the financial metrics are misassigned. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The LLM correctly identifies that acquired intangibles contribute to deferred tax liabilities, but incorrectly uses this to justify a net liability for AMD when the ground truth confirms a net *asset*. It also fails to note that CRM’s acquired intangibles ($4,428 million) are part of its overall $4,770 million net deferred tax asset, which supports the stronger position. (5) Semantic Equivalence: The overall message is misleading—portraying AMD as having a net liability and CRM as having a modest net asset—when in fact CRM’s net asset is vastly larger. The reasoning about tax treatment of intangibles has some qualitative merit but is applied to incorrect financial positions.

HD's net cash provided by operating activities was $16,571 million and MCD's was $9,141.5 million in the same year.

It incorrectly states that Home Depot (HD) paid $1.197 billion in interest, which is actually McDonald’s (MCD) interest expense, not HD’s. HD’s actual interest paid in FY 2021 was $1,269 million, while MCD’s was $1,197.3 million. The LLM swapped or misattributed these values. Furthermore, it claims MCD paid only $42 million in interest, which is completely incorrect and appears to be a misinterpretation of a non-operating expense line item. (2) The combined interest expense is calculated as ≈$1.239 billion, but the correct total is $2,466.3 million (~$2.466 billion), nearly double the reported value. The percentage calculations are therefore also wrong: the LLM reports 7% for HD and 0.5% for MCD, but with corrected numbers, HD’s interest is ~7.7% of its operating cash flow ($1,269 / $16,571 ≈ 7.7%), and MCD’s is ~13.1% ($1,197.3 / $9,141.5 ≈ 13.1%). The combined interest as a percentage of total operating cash flow is incorrectly omitted in the LLM answer, while the ground truth correctly computes it as ~9.6% ($2,466.3 / $25,712.5). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify and attribute interest expenses to the correct companies, confuses line items (e.g., using 'Non-operating (income) expense, net' as interest expense for MCD without isolating interest), and does not compute the required combined comparison. (4) Despite these serious errors, the answer structure is relevant and attempts to address all parts of the question—interest paid, operating cash flow, and comparative analysis—hence a moderate contextual relevance score.

However, the Mastercard (MA) data is incorrect: the LLM states MA held net collateral positions of $62M received and $48M posted, but the ground truth reports MA held $1.9 billion in restricted cash and equivalents as of December 31, 2023 — a major discrepancy. The LLM’s collateral figures appear to be misinterpreted or sourced incorrectly, possibly confusing bilateral collateral flows with total holdings. (2) Completeness: The answer addresses both companies and attempts to compare their risk mitigation strategies, satisfying the multi-part structure of the question. (3) Entity Accuracy: Company names (MA/V) and fiscal years are correctly attributed, though MA’s data is tied to September 30, 2024 in the LLM answer, while the ground truth uses December 31, 2023 — a mismatch in reporting dates. (4) Reasoning: The LLM draws a logical contrast between Visa’s collateral-heavy model and Mastercard’s netting-based approach, which is conceptually sound and aligns with the intent of the question. However, this reasoning is based on incorrect data for MA, undermining the validity of the conclusion. (5) Semantic Equivalence: While the framing of Visa’s exposure and collateral is accurate and well-expressed, the portrayal of Mastercard’s strategy relies on erroneous figures and omits the key fact about $1.9 billion in restricted cash, which is central to MA’s liquidity risk management. The implication about MA using a more 'off-balance-sheet' approach is speculative and not supported in the ground truth, which emphasizes historical low losses and liquidity buffers.

However, the percentages comparing the combined interest expense to each company’s operating cash flow are incorrect. The LLM states that the $780 million represents 19% of DUK’s operating cash flow and 15% of NEE’s, but the ground truth shows it should be approximately 77.7% for DUK and 14.6% for NEE. The 15% figure for NEE is close (rounding to nearest whole number would be 15%, so acceptable), but 19% for DUK is significantly off from 77.7%, indicating a major calculation error. (2) The calculation for DUK: $780M / $1,004M = 77.7%, not 19%. The LLM likely miscalculated this ratio.

This volatility in the aerospace sector, particularly around key models, likely increases risk for companies indirectly exposed through contracts or assets like Emerson’s $310 million backlog intangible asset with a 3-year estimated useful life. If Emerson’s backlog value is sensitive to sector-specific disruptions similar to Boeing’s, the useful life could be shortened due to reduced predictability or cancellations, especially if aerospace demand weakens.

The original answer suggests qualitative risk and potential downward pressure, not a precise 3% reduction. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. While the LLM attempts to link Boeing’s backlog changes to Emerson’s intangible asset, it misrepresents the nature of the exposure. The ground truth emphasizes increased risk and uncertainty that could shorten useful life due to volatility, not a mechanical pro-rata adjustment. The LLM oversimplifies a nuanced financial judgment into an unsupported arithmetic analogy. (4) Despite incorrect numbers and reasoning, the LLM does recognize the conceptual link between Boeing’s backlog volatility and potential impacts on Emerson’s asset life, showing some contextual understanding. However, the quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine the answer’s validity, warranting a low correctness score. The qualitative reasoning is partially sound in direction but not in execution.",

(1) It claims Danaher's core sales growth was 23% but reduced by 7.5 percentage points due to acquisitions/divestitures, implying total growth was ~30.5%. However, the ground truth states DHR's core sales growth (non-GAAP) was 23.0%—this is already the organic figure, and the impact of acquisitions/divestitures is not quantified as subtracting 7.5 points in the truth data. (2) The LLM incorrectly states Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) had 23% organic growth in 2021; the ground truth clearly states TMO's organic growth was 5%, not 23%. This is a major factual error. (3) The LLM confuses TMO with another company (likely misreading or misattributing data from a different firm, possibly Danaher itself). (4) The reasoning is flawed: the conclusion that both companies had 23% organic growth contradicts the ground truth comparison of 23% vs 5%, and the entire premise about acquisition impact being a 7.5-point reduction is unsupported by the provided truth. (5) The multi-hop synthesis fails—instead of contrasting DHR’s 23% core growth (with acquisition impact) vs TMO’s 5% organic (no acquisition impact), it fabricates data and draws incorrect conclusions. While the question is addressed in structure, the factual foundation is incorrect on all key metrics. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to wrong percentages and unsupported calculations. Qualitative reasoning fails due to incorrect entity attribution and flawed logic. Contextual relevance is moderate as it attempts the right comparison framework but with wrong data.",

      "original_answer": "COST calculates the fair value of RSUs as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period, and recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. KO calculates the fair value of RSUs as the closing market price per share on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period, and also expenses this value on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. While both companies use similar methodologies, COST emphasizes the achievement of long-service terms for accelerated vesting and recognizes compensation expense upon such achievement, whereas KO forfeits awards upon termination except under specific circumstances. This means COST may recognize expense earlier for long-serving employees, while KO's expense timing is strictly tied to the vesting schedule.",
      "llm_answer": "- **COSTCO (COST)** – The fair‑value of RSUs is measured as the company’s common‑stock market price on the measurement (grant) date **minus the present value of dividends expected to be forgone during the vesting period**.  In addition, a portion of the RSUs (the long‑service awards) vest early; the expense for those “accelerated” shares is recognized **when the service condition is satisfied**, not on a straight‑line schedule.\n\n- **COCA‑COLA (KO)** – The fair‑value of RSUs is the **closing market price on the grant date** less the present value of expected dividends for the vesting period, and the total cost is **expensed on a straight‑line basis over the full vesting period**.\n\n**Effect on timing:** Because COST’s methodology allows expense to be accelerated when the long‑service condition is met, some compensation cost is recognized earlier than under KO’s method, which spreads the expense evenly over the vesting term.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: both COST and KO calculate RSU fair value as the market price on the grant date minus the present value of expected dividends forgone during vesting; both use straight-line expense recognition generally, but COST accelerates expense recognition for long-service awards upon achievement of service conditions, while KO sticks strictly to the vesting schedule. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., percentages, dollar amounts, dates) in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no calculations were required. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in expense timing due to policy differences in handling long-service conditions and forfeitures, even though the original answer mentions KO's forfeiture policy more explicitly. The LLM captures the practical effect—that COST may recognize expenses earlier—accurately. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention KO’s forfeiture policy (awards forfeited upon termination except under specific circumstances), which is part of the original explanation for why KO’s timing is more rigid.

      "original_answer": "Capital One's interchange fees in 2021 were offset by $6.4 billion in customer reward expenses. These expenses are deducted directly from interchange fees, as interchange fees are collected by acquirers and paid to issuers like Capital One to reimburse them for costs incurred in providing services to account holders. According to Mastercard's description of the four-party payment system, interchange fees play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits across the network, including for issuers who manage account holder relationships and provide services such as rewards programs. This means that the $6.4 billion in rewards expense reflects a portion of the interchange fees Capital One receives, effectively reducing its net interchange revenue while supporting consumer benefits that drive card usage and merchant acceptance.",

The individual increases for AMD ($77 million) and CRM ($599 million) are accurate and sum to $676 million, which is correct. (2) However, there is a minor error in the fiscal years cited: the question asks for the increase from the prior year to the fiscal year ending in 2024. The LLM states AMD’s increase is from FY 2024 to FY 2025, which is incorrect—AMD’s increase should be from FY 2023 to FY 2024. Similarly, CRM’s increase is correctly framed from FY 2023 to FY 2024, which aligns with the 2024 fiscal year end. The AMD year mislabeling is a factual error in time period, though the dollar values used are correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is otherwise sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, the correct financial metric (Property and Equipment, gross), computes individual year-over-year increases, and sums them appropriately.

According to the ground truth, the combined 2023 litigation provision for MA and V is $647 million ($539M from MA and $108M from V). However, the LLM incorrectly reports Visa's provision as $1,045 million ($1,024M + $21M), which is nearly 10 times higher than the correct $108 million. This leads to a grossly inflated combined total of $1,584 million instead of $647 million. The comparison to MA's 2021 provision of $94 million is therefore also incorrect: the LLM claims a $1.49 billion increase (≈17x), while the correct increase is $553 million. (2) Number verification: MA's 2023 provision of $539M and 2021 provision of $94M are correctly cited. However, Visa's 2023 litigation provision is wrong — the correct amount is $108M, not $1,045M. The LLM appears to have misread or misclassified Visa's legal provisions, possibly confusing 'covered' and 'uncovered' matters or pulling incorrect line items from the 10-K. The sum $539M + $1,045M = $1,584M is mathematically correct but based on false inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts the correct synthesis — combining MA and V's 2023 provisions and comparing to MA's 2021 amount — so the logical structure is sound. However, due to the incorrect Visa figure, the entire analysis collapses. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual inaccuracy in core numbers. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because the central financial figures are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the model identifies the right companies, years, and metric type.

These disruptions are part of the broader aerospace industry challenges that GE Aerospace explicitly monitors, particularly in relation to its significant business with Boeing.

While the $523 million figure is accurately cited and contextualized within Boeing’s 2024 disclosures, the absence of the prior $288 million increment reduces quantitative completeness. Qualitatively, the answer correctly reflects GE Aerospace’s response: monitoring Boeing’s challenges, aligning production expectations, assessing impacts, and adjusting build schedules and supplier coordination—consistent with the original answer’s description of production alignment and risk mitigation. The reasoning chain is sound, logically connecting Boeing’s disruptions to GE’s operational adjustments. Contextually, the response is highly relevant, directly addressing how Boeing’s issues influenced GE’s aerospace segment strategies.

In contrast, SBUX's disclosure is limited to a brief mention that its financial statements include excise tax on share repurchases, without specifying a dollar amount or the accounting treatment.

This part is factually accurate. However, the LLM incorrectly states that SBUX includes the excise tax on share repurchases in 'Other comprehensive loss' within the equity section (citing page 57), which contradicts the ground truth. The original answer confirms SBUX only provides a qualitative disclosure without specifying a dollar amount or accounting treatment—there is no mention of where in the financial statements the tax is recorded, let alone inclusion in 'Other comprehensive loss.' This is a significant factual error. (2) Quantitatively, the $96 million figure for BKNG is accurate, and no other numbers are presented, so quantitative accuracy is fully preserved. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails on the SBUX side: while the model attempts to compare BKNG’s detailed disclosure with SBUX’s approach, it fabricates a specific financial statement treatment not present in the source. The ground truth emphasizes SBUX’s lack of specificity, whereas the LLM asserts a precise but unsupported accounting entry. (4) Due to the major qualitative inaccuracy regarding SBUX’s financial statement treatment—despite correct BKNG data—the correctness score is reduced to 4. Quantitative accuracy is 10 because the only number provided is correct. Qualitative accuracy is low due to the erroneous claim about SBUX’s accounting treatment.

According to the ground truth, TMO (Thermo Fisher) had a positive impact of 5% from acquisitions/divestitures, while the LLM incorrectly reports it as 1.5%. DHR (Danaher) correctly reported as (0.5)%, so that part is accurate. The calculated difference in the LLM answer is 1.5% - (-0.5%) = 2.0 percentage points, but the correct difference is 5% - (-0.5%) = 5.5 percentage points. Thus, both the input numbers and final result are incorrect. (2) The citation references only the Environmental & Applied Solutions segment for TMO (page 51), but the 1.5% figure appears to be segment-specific rather than company-wide. The ground truth uses a company-wide 5% impact for TMO, which the LLM fails to capture. This indicates misuse of partial data. (3) While the reasoning framework—calculating the difference between TMO’s positive impact and DHR’s negative impact—is logically sound, the model applied it to incorrect base figures, undermining the multi-hop synthesis.

In contrast, COST's selling, general and administrative expenses are more exposed to external economic factors like inflationary pressures, commodity price volatility (including gasoline and consumables), and tariff impacts, which could affect its cost structure.

It also correctly contrasts this with COST's exposure to external macroeconomic factors like inflation, commodity price volatility, tariffs, and foreign exchange. The mention of internal labor and benefit cost challenges at COST adds nuance not in the original but does not contradict it and aligns with the source material. 2) All quantitative figures (e.g., $1,092 million, 3% foreign currency headwind) are accurate and consistent with the ground truth; no calculations are required beyond what is stated, and the numbers match exactly. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (KO and COST), identifies the correct drivers of SG&A from each, and draws a valid comparative conclusion about internal vs. external influences.

While UNP's operating margin of 28.0% matches the ground truth, MMM's margin is reported as 20.4% by the LLM versus 18.8% in the original answer, which is a notable deviation. (2) Calculations: The LLM performs internal arithmetic consistently (e.g., $5,001m / $24,575m ≈ 20.4%), but these are based on incorrect input figures. The segment sum for MMM ($2,491 + $1,578 + $932 = $5,001) is arithmetically correct, but these segment values are not supported by the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM attempts to synthesize segment income, calculate margins, and compare efficiency, which aligns with the question’s intent. However, due to incorrect base data, the conclusions are factually unsound. The comparison that UNP has a higher margin than MMM is correct in direction but based on flawed numbers.

This change aims to provide a more accurate representation of revenue per unique person rather than per user account. In contrast, AT&T experienced an increase in broadband ARPU in 2023 due to the expiration of prior-year promotional pricing, showing a direct financial benefit from pricing adjustments.

This qualitative comparison is accurate and aligns with the ground truth. However, the key quantitative error is in the reported amount of COST's debt securities held at cost basis in 2023: the LLM states $1.551 billion, while the ground truth is $689 million. This is a significant discrepancy (over double the correct amount), severely impacting factual accuracy. (2) The number $1.551 billion is incorrect and not supported by the original answer; no such figure appears in the ground truth. There is no indication of a calculation or rounding error—this appears to be a factual misstatement. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly synthesizes accounting policies across two companies (COST and KO) and distinguishes between held-to-maturity and available-for-sale classifications. It also correctly notes that KO does not disclose total amounts, though this is implied rather than explicitly stated in the LLM answer. However, the failure to report the correct dollar amount for COST undermines the completeness and correctness of the response. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question—accounting approaches and the 2023 figure—and uses appropriate financial terminology. The qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct conceptual understanding but is penalized for missing the nuance that only COST discloses explicit figures, which the LLM does not emphasize. The quantitative accuracy is low due to the major error in the dollar amount.",

      "original_answer": "The competitive and regulatory pressures on interchange fees described by COF could reduce the interchange revenue that card issuers like COF earn, which in turn may lead to tighter collaboration between networks like MA and their issuing and acquiring partners to maintain profitability. MA, which depends on these partners to set competitive program features, may face increased pressure to provide larger incentives to merchants to maintain acceptance and co-branding partnerships, as noted in MA's 10-K. This could materially and adversely affect MA’s profitability, especially if larger merchants continue to negotiate lower interchange rates and demand more concessions, as MA acknowledges in its risk factors. Additionally, if interchange fee caps or litigation outcomes reduce interchange revenues, MA’s issuing partners may have less margin to invest in marketing or co-branding initiatives, further limiting MA’s ability to grow its network acceptance and brand strength.",

For Mastercard, interchange fees are a “meaningful source of revenue,” and any reduction would directly shrink earnings; because Mastercard does not set merchant‑discount rates itself and depends on its issuing and acquiring partners to drive acceptance, it would likely have to boost merchant‑incentive payments or pricing concessions to keep those partners and large merchants on its network, which would further pressure profitability (MA 10‑K p. 35, 41).",

It accurately notes that interchange fees are a 'meaningful source of revenue' for MA (Mastercard), citing MA’s 10-K (p. 35, 41), and correctly infers that reduced interchange revenue would pressure profitability. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, years) in either the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no errors in calculations or figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information from COF’s perspective on interchange pressures and applies it to MA’s business model, recognizing that MA depends on issuing and acquiring partners and may need to increase merchant incentives to maintain network acceptance. This reflects the core causal chain in the original answer. (4) The LLM slightly condenses the original answer by not explicitly mentioning the impact on co-branding initiatives or the reduced margin of issuing partners to invest in marketing, which are present in the ground truth.

These figures are entirely missing from the LLM response. For Pfizer, the LLM correctly identifies the $1.5 billion employee termination cost and $587 million integration cost, totaling approximately $2.1 billion, which aligns with the ground truth total of $2.09 billion (minor rounding acceptable). However, the LLM fails to mention that these costs are part of Pfizer’s business development and integration strategy, particularly around Seagen, though it does capture the general intent. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: Eli Lilly’s $4.30 billion in total spending is completely omitted, a major error. Pfizer’s numbers are mostly correct ($1.5B + $587M = $2.087B ≈ $2.09B), so partial credit is due. The combined total of $6.39 billion is not mentioned at all. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in interpreting Pfizer’s strategic focus on restructuring and integration, but it incorrectly infers that Eli Lilly lacks acquisition-based business development due to absence of a line item, failing the multi-hop requirement to connect disclosed payments (e.g., IPR&D and facility purchases) to business development activities. The model misses the synthesis that such payments constitute strategic business development. (4) Contextual relevance is fair—the answer addresses strategic priorities and attempts comparison—but due to missing over half the financial data and misrepresenting Eli Lilly’s activity, the overall correctness score is low.

ConocoPhillips uses the same SEC‑prescribed methodology (first‑day‑of‑month averages and a 10 % discount factor) and therefore inherits the same limitation – the measure is intended for disclosure only and is not considered a reliable proxy for the actual cash flows that will be generated from its oil‑and‑gas properties【page_158】.  \n\nThus, the 10 % discount factor and the first‑day‑of‑month price averaging introduce methodological rigidity that can produce year‑to‑year swings and prevent the standardized measure from being a dependable estimate of expected cash flows for either XOM or COP.",

DIS also uses a 10-year window for theatrical films but includes imputed license fees for content used on owned DTC services in its Ultimate Revenues. This means DIS incorporates internal monetization strategies directly into its amortization calculations, while CMCSA focuses on external revenue correlations, leading to different long-term revenue recognition patterns despite similar amortization periods.",

The cost is amortized in proportion to the revenue earned each period, so the expense is spread over the full ten‑year cash‑flow horizon.\n\nComcast, by contrast, amortizes owned theatrical titles using its “individual‑film forecast computation method,” which matches expense to the revenue actually generated **without a fixed ten‑year cap** (see Comcast 10‑K, page 59).  Because the amortization is driven solely by the revenue‑ratio calculation, the expense can be recognized more quickly if the film’s earnings front‑load, leading to a shorter effective amortization period for many titles.\n\n**Result:** Disney’s ten‑year amortization horizon spreads cost over a longer period, aligning expense with a longer‑term revenue stream, whereas Comcast’s revenue‑ratio method can accelerate expense recognition, shortening the effective amortization period for its theatrical films.",

The LLM incorrectly cites Comcast’s method as having 'no fixed ten-year cap,' when in fact both companies use a 10-year window. This misrepresents a key factual point and undermines the comparison. (2) The ground truth confirms that both CMCSA and DIS use a 10-year amortization period; the key difference lies in how 'ultimate revenue' is defined—DIS includes imputed license fees from its owned DTC services, while CMCSA does not. The LLM answer completely misses this crucial distinction and instead invents a difference in amortization period length that does not exist. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because it fails to synthesize the correct contrast: similar timeframes but different revenue inclusion policies. Instead, it constructs a false dichotomy based on duration.

It claims Danaher (DHR) has no disclosed non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of December 31, 2021, based on its 2022 10-K, but the ground truth states DHR had $427 million in non-U.S. NOL carryforwards as of that date. This omission leads to an incorrect combined total of $1.18 billion instead of the correct $1.607 billion ($427M + $1.18B). The TMO numbers are accurate: $1.18 billion total with $419 million expiring between 2025 and 2041 and the rest indefinite. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: TMO's figures match, but DHR's are missing, and the sum is therefore wrong. The calculation of $1.18B as the combined value is incorrect due to the omission. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model failed to correctly identify and synthesize DHR's non-U.S. NOL carryforward value from the correct filing, despite the ground truth confirming its existence. The reasoning about expiration implications for TMO is sound, but the analysis for DHR is incorrect—DHR does have expiring and indefinite carryforwards (expiring 2022–2041 and some indefinite), contrary to the claim that it has no disclosed losses. Thus, the comparison between the two companies’ tax planning strategies is based on false premises for DHR. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question (combined value and strategic implications)—but the factual foundation for DHR is wrong, undermining the overall correctness. The qualitative reasoning would be strong if the inputs were correct, but it's based on an incorrect assumption about DHR’s disclosures.",

However, it incorrectly uses XOM's 2023 consolidated figure ($13,097 million) instead of a disclosed 2024 value, explicitly stating that 2024 data is not available. This undermines the accuracy of the '2024' claim for XOM. The ground truth assumes both 2024 figures are available and correct, so using a 2023 number for XOM introduces a factual misrepresentation in timing. The equity company cost for XOM in 2023 is correctly cited at $1,411 million. (2) The sum $7,899M + $13,097M = $20,996M is mathematically correct. The comparison correctly notes the large difference, though the ground truth quantifies the difference as $19,585 million, which the LLM omits. Instead, it offers a '15 times larger' approximation, which is contextually reasonable but less precise than the exact delta provided in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—COP and XOM are correctly identified, and the metric 'production cost excluding taxes' is applied consistently. However, the failure to source XOM’s actual 2024 consolidated cost (if available in the knowledge base) breaks the multi-hop chain for current-year accuracy. The LLM substitutes with the latest available data, which may be pragmatic but does not fulfill the strict requirement of '2024' for both firms. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question, uses proper entities, and provides meaningful comparison. However, due to the use of a 2023 figure for XOM in a 2024 total and the omission of the exact numerical difference ($19,585 million), the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are reduced. A score of 7 reflects mostly correct numbers and logic but with significant caveats in temporal accuracy and completeness of comparison.",

The increase for NVDA from 2021 to 2022 is accurately calculated as $385 million (from $737M to $1,122M). The answer correctly states that TXN’s inventory decreased, but there is a minor error in the reasoning: it references TXN’s change from 2020 to 2021 ($811M to $598M), rather than 2021 to 2022. However, the ground truth confirms TXN had a -$213 million change, implying a decrease, which the LLM correctly infers even if citing the wrong year comparison. (2) All numerical values are accurate: $1,122M + $598M = $1,720M; $1,122M - $737M = $385M increase for NVDA. The total is correctly reported as ~$1.72 billion.

In 2023, MCD paid $56.1 million in variable rent for company-operated restaurants and $261.4 million for franchised restaurants, directly tying lease costs to sales performance. In contrast, LOW disclosed that variable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices were not significant for any of the periods presented, indicating minimal exposure to sales-linked lease costs. This shows that MCD's lease structure makes it more vulnerable to fluctuations in restaurant sales compared to LOW.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing (BA) faces significant backlog volatility due to its exposure to the Chinese market, where geopolitical tensions, such as ongoing U.S.-China trade disputes and tariffs, could lead to order cancellations or delivery delays for aircraft like the 777X, 737-7, and 737-10. This creates uncertainty in their contractual backlog, which saw an increase in 2023 largely due to growth in BCA and BDS segments. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) treats backlog as a finite-lived intangible asset valued at $310 million with a useful life of 3 years, indicating a more stable and predictable revenue stream associated with backlog. This suggests that EMR is less directly impacted by geopolitical volatility compared to Boeing, whose backlog is more sensitive to external macroeconomic and political factors such as trade restrictions and customer delivery assumptions in China.",

The $135 million figure appears to be fabricated or misattributed. Additionally, the LLM claims Boeing's backlog is '$520 billion', which is incorrect; the original answer does not specify a dollar value for Boeing's backlog, only that it increased in 2023 due to segment growth. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies undermine the factual foundation of the response. While $310 million matches the ground truth, the additional $135 million and one-year life are unsupported. The $520 billion figure for Boeing is not present in the original and likely confuses backlog with market value or order value without proper sourcing. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts EMR's accounting treatment of backlog as an amortizable intangible asset (implying stability) with Boeing's exposure to geopolitical risks in China (implying volatility). It correctly infers that Boeing is more sensitive to U.S.-China trade tensions due to delivery risks and order cancellations, while EMR's approach buffers it from such volatility. The multi-hop synthesis—linking accounting treatment to business model sensitivity to trade tensions—is logically coherent and addresses the comparative implication asked in the question. (4) Contextual relevance is high: the answer directly addresses the comparison between EMR and Boeing regarding backlog treatment and trade tension sensitivity.

According to the ground truth, TMO's (Thermo Fisher) organic sales growth in 2021 was 15%, not 23% as stated in the LLM answer. DHR's (Danaher) core sales growth including Cytiva was correctly stated as 25%, matching the ground truth. The difference in growth rates is therefore 10 percentage points (25% - 15%), not 2 percentage points as claimed (25% - 23%). This miscalculation stems from the incorrect organic growth figure for TMO. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the 23% figure for TMO is unsupported by the ground truth and directly contradicts the correct 15% value. The resulting difference of '2 percentage points' is therefore incorrect. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly infers that Cytiva added 'roughly 2%' to Danaher’s growth, while the ground truth states that acquisitions/divestitures contributed 7.5% to DHR's growth and 5% to TMO's. The LLM fails to report these specific acquisition impact figures entirely. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing organic vs. core-plus-acquisition growth and inferring acquisition impact—but it is based on incorrect input data, leading to flawed conclusions. The LLM incorrectly suggests that TMO's growth was 'almost entirely organic' (which is true) but implies DHR's acquisition impact was only 2%, when in fact it was 7.5%, a much larger effect. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question: the numerical comparison and the interpretation regarding acquisition impact. However, due to major factual and calculation errors, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. The qualitative reasoning is somewhat logical but built on false premises, warranting a moderate score.",

This is a major quantitative and qualitative inaccuracy. The $25 million figure applies only to MDLZ, not CL. (2) The LLM incorrectly attributes the $25 million amount to CL, even though the ground truth explicitly states CL did not provide a numerical value. This undermines the entire comparison. While MDLZ's $25 million disclosure is correctly identified, the erroneous assignment of the same figure to CL renders the quantitative accuracy very low. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing how each company presents implementation charges—but fails on multi-hop synthesis because it misrepresents CL's disclosure. The model appears to assume symmetry between the companies' disclosures without verifying CL's actual reporting. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and addresses the contrast in disclosure practices, but the core factual error about CL's numbers severely limits correctness. The mention of 'after-tax' costs and grouping under a broader initiative may reflect real aspects of CL's filing, but introducing a false dollar amount invalidates the comparison.

      "original_answer": "Citigroup's 2024 Retail Banking loans have a delinquency ratio of 0.33%, which is significantly lower than Capital One's focus on delinquency trends as their key indicator for monitoring retail banking loan risk. This suggests that while Citigroup's current delinquency levels are low, Capital One emphasizes ongoing delinquency monitoring as a central part of its risk management strategy.",

It also accurately states that Capital One does not report a percentage but instead uses 'delinquency trends' as its key credit quality indicator, which aligns with the original answer. The additional detail about 0.45% being 30-89 days past due is not in the ground truth but is not contradictory and may reflect supplementary data from the filing; it does not detract from accuracy. (2) All numbers and dates are correct: Citigroup’s 0.33% delinquency rate for 90+ days past due in 2024 is accurately reported. No calculations were required, but the comparison of metrics (ratio vs. trend monitoring) is handled correctly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two banks (Citigroup and Capital One), identifies their respective risk indicators, and draws a valid contrast in their monitoring strategies—Citigroup using a low delinquency ratio, Capital One focusing on trend data and bucket counts. The conclusion about differing emphases in risk-monitoring frameworks is logically supported. (4) The semantic meaning fully matches the ground truth: while the LLM provides more granular detail (e.g., bucket counts), the core message—that both focus on delinquency but with different measurement approaches—is consistent. The only minor deviation is the emphasis on 'raw counts' in Capital One’s method, which slightly over-interprets 'delinquency trends' but does not misrepresent the strategy.

While it correctly states that DHR had a -0.5 percentage point impact from acquisitions/divestitures and approximately 31% non-GAAP growth (aligning with the ground truth), it incorrectly reports TMO's acquisition impact as +1.5 percentage points (vs. correct +3%) and TMO's organic growth as ≈8% (vs. correct 23%). These numbers are drastically off, severely undermining factual correctness. (2) Calculations: The claimed combined organic growth of 39% (31% + 8%) is mathematically correct but based on a wrong input (8% instead of 23%), so the conclusion is invalid. The actual combined organic growth would be 54% (31% + 23%), but the question asks for the comparative effect on growth rates, not a sum. More importantly, the question asks for the difference in organic/non-GAAP growth rates (which is 8 percentage points: 31% - 23%), but the LLM fails to compute or mention this. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly synthesize the contrast between DHR’s negative impact and TMO’s positive impact on growth, and misrepresents the magnitude of TMO’s performance. It also confuses GAAP and non-GAAP metrics—stating TMO’s core growth as ≈8% contradicts the ground truth of 23% organic (non-GAAP) growth.

This contrast reveals that while both companies use similar valuation methodologies involving discount rates and cash flow projections, Mondelez's specific exposure to food brands—particularly chocolate and biscuits—resulted in actual impairments, highlighting higher sector-specific risks in the food category within the broader consumer staples industry.",

      "original_answer": "The total increase in Class A shares outstanding between December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2019, was 3.2 million shares due to share-based payments and 0.6 million shares from Class B conversions, totaling 3.8 million. Meanwhile, the goodwill balance for Commercial Banking increased from $4,884 million in 2018 to $4,920 million in 2019, reflecting an increase of $36 million. These changes reflect different aspects of company growth: equity changes from share activity and goodwill adjustments from acquisitions.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s Class A share count fell from 1,018.6 million at 12/31/2018 to 996.0 million at 12/31/2019 – a decline of **22.6 million shares**. In the same period, Commercial‑Banking goodwill rose from $4,884 million to $4,920 million – an **increase of $36 million**. Thus, while Class A shares decreased by 22.6 million, Commercial‑Banking goodwill grew by $36 million.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in the share count change. According to the ground truth, Class A shares *increased* by 3.8 million (3.2M from share-based payments and 0.6M from Class B conversions), but the LLM claims a *decrease* of 22.6 million shares (from 1,018.6M to 996.0M), which is factually incorrect. The goodwill change is correctly calculated: $4,920M - $4,884M = $36M increase, matching the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the share numbers and direction of change (increase vs decrease) are wrong. The goodwill numbers are accurate. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in comparing two metrics over the same time period, but fails in multi-hop synthesis: it incorrectly retrieves or interprets the Class A share data, possibly confusing it with another class or misreading the filing. The model does not reflect the two-component increase (share-based payments + conversions) mentioned in the ground truth, indicating incomplete or incorrect information retrieval. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question and compares the two metrics appropriately. However, due to the critical error in share count change, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are severely penalized.",

      "question": "What specific energy-related sustainability target did Intel set for 2024 that could directly impact its operational costs, and how does Texas Instruments' regulatory exposure related to energy use differ in terms of potential financial consequences?",
      "original_answer": "Intel set a target to reach 95% renewable electricity use globally in 2024 as part of its energy sustainability goals. This target could directly impact its operational costs through investments in renewable electricity and energy conservation. In contrast, Texas Instruments faces potential financial consequences from regulatory changes that could require additional abatement equipment, process changes, or impose fees on energy use in jurisdictions where it operates. These regulatory impacts may lead to increased operational costs or reporting requirements, which could affect its profitability depending on the jurisdictions in which it operates and the evolving regulatory landscape.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel’s 2024 sustainability goal was to **source 95 % of its global electricity from renewable generators** – a target that is tied to a portion of its executive‑and‑employee bonus and therefore can directly affect the company’s energy‑related operating costs.  \n\nTexas Instruments, by contrast, does not have a comparable cost‑saving target; its 10‑K notes that the company is **exposed to regulatory risk from energy‑use and environmental laws (e.g., EPA and other jurisdictional requirements), which could result in fines, remediation expenses or other monetary penalties** if compliance lapses occur. This exposure is a potential liability rather than a performance‑linked cost‑reduction objective.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the 95% renewable electricity target for Intel in 2024 is correctly stated, matching the original answer. No other numerical values are present, and the year 2024 is correctly referenced. (2) The LLM adds a detail not in the original answer — that the target is tied to executive-and-employee bonuses — which is plausible and contextually relevant but not confirmed in the ground truth; however, this does not contradict it and may reflect additional insight from the model’s training data. This addition does not detract from factual accuracy but slightly extends beyond the provided knowledge. (3) For Texas Instruments, the LLM correctly identifies regulatory exposure related to energy use and environmental laws (e.g., EPA), and accurately notes potential financial consequences such as fines, remediation, or penalties. While the original answer emphasizes abatement equipment, process changes, or fees, the LLM’s focus on penalties and compliance risks is semantically consistent and captures the core idea of potential financial impact from regulation. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model contrasts Intel’s proactive, cost-influencing sustainability target with Texas Instruments’ reactive regulatory risk exposure, directly addressing the comparative structure of the question. (5) All entities (Intel, Texas Instruments, 2024 target, renewable electricity, regulatory exposure) are correctly identified and contextualized. The answer is fully relevant and conveys the same essential information as the original, with only minor variation in emphasis. The correctness score is 9 due to the slight addition about bonuses not present in the ground truth, but this does not constitute an error. Quantitative accuracy is perfect.

      "question": "How do the legal and regulatory challenges described in Pfizer's and UnitedHealth Group's 2022 10-K filings differently expose each company to financial damages, and what specific mechanisms in their respective businesses contribute to these risks?",
      "original_answer": "Pfizer faces financial damages primarily through patent-related legal risks, such as third-party challenges to its intellectual property and potential invalidation of patents, which could lead to early generic competition and loss of product exclusivity, especially for high-value branded products. These risks are compounded by ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions and the potential retroactive impact of decisions like the Brazilian Supreme Court's invalidation of Article 40 of Brazil's Patent Law. UnitedHealth Group, on the other hand, is exposed to damages through regulatory audits and investigations, particularly risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits by CMS, which can result in retrospective payment adjustments, fines, or corrective action plans. These exposures stem from its role as a government contractor managing Medicare and Medicaid plans, where accurate health status coding directly affects capitation payments. Both companies face damages, but through distinct mechanisms: Pfizer through intellectual property disputes affecting revenue from pharmaceutical products, and UnitedHealth through regulatory compliance risks tied to government health programs.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer’s 10‑K stresses that most of its exposure to financial damage comes from **intellectual‑property and product‑liability litigation** – the company must defend patents, fend off “at‑risk” generic launches and settle environmental or other legal claims, and any adverse judgment could erode sales or require large settlements (see p. 27). These risks are tied to Pfizer’s **drug‑development and manufacturing model**, which relies on patented biologics and a large branded‑product portfolio that can be challenged in courts or before patent offices.  \n\nUnitedHealth Group’s filing, by contrast, highlights **regulatory and government‑program risks** – audits, risk‑adjustment data‑validation (RADV) reviews, anti‑kickback and fiduciary claims, and privacy‑security violations that can trigger fines, recoupments, loss of contracts or exclusion from Medicare/Medicaid programs (see p. 25‑26). These exposures stem from UnitedHealth’s **managed‑care and pharmacy‑benefit‑management businesses (Optum Rx, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, etc.)**, which depend on government funding formulas, compliance with complex health‑care statutes, and the handling of protected health information.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: Pfizer's exposure is correctly attributed to intellectual property litigation, patent challenges, and product-liability risks tied to its drug development and branded product model. UnitedHealth Group's risks are accurately described as stemming from regulatory audits (specifically RADV), compliance with government health programs, and data privacy, tied to its managed-care and Optum businesses. The mechanisms linking business models to risk exposures are well-explained and semantically equivalent to the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense; however, the absence of any incorrect numbers or miscalculations supports a perfect score. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes information across two companies (Pfizer and UnitedHealth), their respective 2022 10-K filings, and connects legal/regulatory risks to distinct business models and financial exposure mechanisms. The mention of specific pages (p. 27 for Pfizer, p. 25–26 for UnitedHealth) adds verifiability and suggests fidelity to source documents. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to slightly broader phrasing (e.g., including 'environmental or other legal claims' and 'privacy-security violations' not emphasized in the ground truth), but these do not contradict the core accurate synthesis.

      "original_answer": "The combined net credit loss ratio for Retail Banking loans at Citigroup and Capital One in 2024 is 0.70% and 0.00% respectively, resulting in an average of 0.35%. Citigroup reported a 0.70% net credit loss ratio on $47.4 billion in Retail Banking loans, while Capital One reported no nonperforming loans in its Retail Banking segment, indicating a potentially stronger credit profile in this segment for Capital One compared to Citigroup.",

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly infers lack of disclosure when the data is actually available in the source (Capital One's 10-K), leading to a failure in synthesizing the correct comparative credit risk assessment. The conclusion about transparency is unsupported and misdirects the analysis.

      "original_answer": "Amgen faces regulatory-driven pricing pressures stemming from Medicaid rebates, 340B statutory rates, and state-level actions by PDABs in seven U.S. states, as well as international measures such as mandatory price controls, price referencing, and cost-effectiveness assessments in the EU and other markets. These pressures directly affect sales and profitability by limiting pricing flexibility and potentially reducing product usage. In contrast, Thermo Fisher Scientific faces inflation-driven pricing pressures due to elevated inflation rates in the U.S. and other key markets, which increase costs and create downward pressure on gross margins. Additionally, economic instability raises the risk of excess and obsolete inventory, directly impacting inventory management and related financial metrics. The differences in source and impact reflect Amgen's exposure to healthcare-specific regulatory frameworks and Thermo Fisher's sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions affecting broader industrial markets.",
      "llm_answer": "Amgen says its pricing pressure comes mainly from external payers and government‐driven price‑control measures (e.g., Medicaid rebates, 340B limits, health‑technology‑assessment caps) that “affect…profitability” and can compress its gross‑margin profile, but the filing does not link those pressures to inventory concerns. Thermo Fisher, by contrast, attributes price pressure to broader macro‑economic and inflationary headwinds that are reducing demand, prompting order cancellations and “increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventories,” which can both squeeze product margins and create a direct inventory‑risk exposure (its inventories rose sharply after the Horizon acquisition).",

It correctly states that Amgen’s filing does not link these pressures to inventory risk. (2) For Thermo Fisher, the LLM accurately attributes pricing pressures to macroeconomic and inflationary conditions, which reduce demand and increase the risk of excess and obsolete inventory—directly matching the ground truth. It also correctly notes the inventory risk impact and even adds contextual detail about the Horizon acquisition and rising inventories, which is consistent with Thermo Fisher’s filing. (3) There are no numerical values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—scored 10. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two companies, correctly contrasting regulatory vs. macroeconomic sources and differing financial impacts (gross margin + no inventory risk for Amgen vs. margin pressure + inventory risk for Thermo Fisher).

However, the LLM incorrectly states that Thermo Fisher (TMO) had a positive impact of +3 percentage points, which contradicts the original answer. Additionally, the LLM claims TMO's organic growth was approximately 23%, but the correct figure is 5.0%. The resulting difference in organic sales growth is stated as 0 percentage points by the LLM, but the correct difference is 7.5% (23.0% - 5.0%). (2) Number verification: DHR’s -7.5% impact and 23.0% organic growth are correctly reported by the LLM. However, TMO’s impact is wrong (reported as +3% vs. correct 0%), and TMO’s organic growth is wrong (reported as ~23% vs. correct 5.0%). The final difference is therefore incorrect (0 pp vs. correct 7.5 pp). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the impact across both companies and miscalculates the resulting difference in organic growth. It incorrectly assumes both companies ended up with similar organic growth, when in fact DHR’s was 18 percentage points higher than TMO’s (23% vs. 5%). (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative inaccuracies and flawed reasoning, though the answer is contextually relevant and addresses the right companies and metric types.",

      "question": "How do the interchange fee dynamics described by Capital One (COF) impact MasterCard's (MA) core network transaction model, particularly in relation to the role of acquirers and the merchant discount rate?",
      "original_answer": "Capital One (COF) identifies interchange fees as a key revenue source that is under pressure from regulatory caps, litigation, and merchant negotiations, such as the 2016 agreements where large merchants secured lower interchange rates. These pressures could reduce the interchange fees that acquirers pay to issuers like Capital One, which in turn affects the calculation of the merchant discount rate set by acquirers in MasterCard’s (MA) four-party network. In MA’s model, the merchant discount rate considers the interchange fee, which is paid by acquirers to issuers. If interchange fees are reduced due to regulatory or market forces, acquirers may adjust the merchant discount rate accordingly to maintain profitability, potentially altering the revenue dynamics for both acquirers and issuers within MA’s network.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One notes that interchange fees are one of the biggest components of the cost merchants pay and that regulators, lawsuits and merchant bargaining power are pushing those fees lower. In MasterCard’s four‑party model (see MA 10‑K page 10), the issuer receives the transaction amount **minus** the interchange fee that the acquirer must pay, and the acquirer then passes the purchase on to the merchant after subtracting its own “merchant‑discount” rate, which is set in part to cover the interchange fee it has just paid. Therefore, any downward pressure on interchange fees described by Capital One would reduce the amount the acquirer remits to the issuer and compress the merchant‑discount rate that the acquirer can charge, directly affecting the economics of MasterCard’s core‑network transaction flow.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: Capital One identifies interchange fees as under pressure from regulation, litigation, and merchant bargaining; these fees are a key component in MasterCard’s four-party model; acquirers pay interchange fees to issuers and set the merchant discount rate accordingly. The LLM correctly explains that downward pressure on interchange fees affects acquirer economics and may compress the merchant discount rate. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or percentages in either answer that require verification—both avoid specific figures (e.g., no mention of 2016 agreements in the LLM answer, but this detail is contextually minor and not critical to the mechanism being explained). Thus, quantitative accuracy is full. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM connects COF's observation about interchange fee pressure → impact on issuer revenue → acquirer cost structure in MA’s network → adjustment of merchant discount rate → effect on network economics. The only minor omission is the specific reference to the 2016 merchant agreements cited in the original, which adds context but does not alter the core logic. (4) The answer is fully relevant, directly addressing how interchange dynamics affect MA’s model, acquirers, and the merchant discount rate. Wording differs slightly (e.g., 'compress the merchant-discount rate' vs 'adjust... to maintain profitability'), but the semantic meaning is equivalent. One point deducted from qualitative accuracy for slight under-elaboration on how acquirers might adjust pricing strategies beyond compression.",

For Procter & Gamble, share-based compensation expense was part of the noncash adjustments that helped reconcile net earnings to operating cash flow, contributing to approximately $19.3 billion of operating cash flow. For Target, share-based compensation expense was listed under adjustments to reconcile net earnings to cash provided by operations, contributing $251 million to the $8,621 million cash provided by operating activities.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Procter & Gamble:** The 2023 cash‑flow reconciliation adds back **$251 million** of share‑based compensation expense (see the “Share‑based compensation expense” line in the reconciliation of net earnings to cash provided by operating activities).

(2) For Target, the LLM reports $1,018 million ($1.018 billion), which is incorrect—Target's actual share-based compensation expense in 2023 was $251 million. The LLM swapped or fabricated numbers, leading to a complete mismatch in scale and accuracy. (3) The total combined expense is stated in the ground truth as $19.551 billion, but the LLM implies a total of approximately $1.269 billion ($251M + $1,018M), which is off by over $18 billion. (4) The LLM misattributes financial figures: it claims P&G had $4,138 million net earnings and $8,621 million operating cash flow—these are actually Target’s correct figures. Conversely, it assigns Target net earnings of $14,738 million and operating cash flow of $16,848 million, which do not match the ground truth and appear fabricated.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the direction and magnitude of loan changes at both Company C (Citigroup) and Company COF (Capital One), with Citigroup showing growth and Capital One a 7% decline. The 7% decrease for Capital One matches the ground truth exactly. For Citigroup, while the ground truth does not specify an 18% increase or exact dollar figures ($43B to $51B), it confirms growth driven by mortgage originations and Branded Cards, which the LLM accurately reflects. The mention of a 7% YoY rise in the US Personal-Banking segment aligns with the broader narrative of growth. (2) The quantitative figures for Capital One are accurate: $1.36B to $1.26B is approximately a 7.4% drop, which rounds to the reported ~7%, consistent with the ground truth. Citigroup’s numbers, while specific, are not contradicted by the ground truth, which lacks exact figures but confirms growth. The 18% increase is a reasonable calculation from the provided values. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly compares two companies’ loan portfolio changes in 2024, infers strategic differences—expansion vs. contraction—and links them to consumer banking strategy. It correctly associates mortgage growth with Citigroup and portfolio reduction with Capital One. The only minor gap is the lack of mention of allowance for credit losses and delinquency metrics from COF’s side, which the ground truth cites as supporting evidence for risk management. (4) The answer is highly factually accurate, well-reasoned, and contextually complete.

(3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (DHR and TMO), identifies their respective treatments of technology obsolescence, and draws a valid comparative conclusion about emphasis and transparency in useful life estimation. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and semantically equivalent to the original, capturing the core insight about differing levels of emphasis despite shared use of the metric. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the omission of the $3.5 billion valuation figure, which was part of the original answer’s factual content and adds material context to DHR’s valuation process.",

      "original_answer": "CMCSA experienced a 24.1% increase in advertising revenue from 2020 to 2021, indicating strong growth and resilience in its advertising business. In contrast, GOOGL faces significant risks due to its reliance on advertising, which accounts for over 80% of its total revenue, including exposure to ad-blocking technologies, changing advertiser spending patterns, and intense competition. This contrast suggests that while CMCSA is currently benefiting from a favorable advertising environment, GOOGL is more vulnerable to market fluctuations and competitive pressures, highlighting different risk profiles despite both companies operating in the same advertising-dependent sector.",

The figure for GOOGL is also correct—over 80% of its revenue coming from advertising, as stated in its 2022 10-K. All numeric values, percentages, and sources are factually accurate. (2) Calculations are correct: the 24.1% growth is consistent with the reported revenue figures ($8.3B to $10.3B). No mathematical errors. Format variations (e.g., $10.3 billion vs $10.3B) are acceptable and clear. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (CMCSA and GOOGL), across their respective 10-K filings, and contrasts growth trends with risk exposure. It correctly infers that CMCSA’s rising ad revenue reflects strength, while GOOGL’s dominance is offset by vulnerability due to overreliance. The core implication about differing risk profiles in the same sector is present and logically derived. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention specific risks like ad-blocking technologies or changing advertiser patterns beyond quoting GOOGL’s general warning, which slightly reduces qualitative completeness compared to the original answer.

      "original_answer": "The 20% asset value limit on TRSs restricts both AMT and SPG in how much they can invest in taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are used to conduct non-REIT qualifying activities. For AMT, this limit constrains their ability to expand non-real estate activities and investments in TRSs, particularly those generating income from international operations, which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency controls that further complicate repatriation for REIT distribution requirements. For SPG, the same 20% cap forces them to closely monitor the value of TRS securities to ensure they remain under the threshold, requiring strategic structuring of transactions to maintain REIT compliance and avoid a 100% excise tax on non-arm's-length dealings. Thus, both companies must balance the benefits of using TRSs for operational flexibility against the constraints imposed by the REIT rules tied to TRS ownership.",
      "llm_answer": "Both Simon Property Group and American Tower must keep securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) to no more than 20 % of the REIT’s total asset value, so they continuously monitor those holdings and structure every TRS transaction at arm’s‑length to avoid the 100 % excise tax. For Simon, the cap limits how much of its growing international portfolio (about 7‑8 % of NOI) can be held in TRSs and, because most TRS cash flow comes from foreign operations, withholding taxes and currency controls can restrict the funds available to meet the REIT’s 90 % distribution requirement. American Tower faces the same 20 % ceiling, which curtails its ability to pursue non‑real‑estate or overseas TRS investments and makes repatriating foreign‑derived TRS earnings—subject to local taxes and currency controls—more difficult for satisfying REIT distribution and asset‑test compliance.",

(2) Quantitatively, the LLM introduces a specific figure—'7-8% of NOI' from international operations for SPG—which is not present in the original answer.

However, it incorrectly calculates and interprets the 'combined' delinquency rate as a simple sum (0.33% + 6.73% = 7.06%), which is not what the original answer states. The original answer does not provide a combined numerical total but instead compares the two rates individually to COF’s nonperforming loan rate. Thus, the LLM introduces a calculation not present or implied in the ground truth, leading to a misrepresentation. (2) The nonperforming loan rate at COF is correctly cited as 0.99%, and the comparison direction (delinquency rate higher than nonperforming rate) is factually aligned, but again, the basis of comparison (7.06% vs 0.99%) is flawed due to the incorrect aggregation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is correctly pulled from both C and COF filings for the correct year (2024) and metric (30+ day delinquency and nonperforming loans).

      "original_answer": "NVDA's international supply chain exposes it to risks such as low manufacturing yields, supplier loss, and product defects, which can negatively impact its gross margin. With 84% of its revenue coming from international sales, disruptions in global operations—like supplier prioritization or production delays—could significantly reduce profitability. In contrast, TXN owns much of its manufacturing capacity, allowing it to spread fixed costs over higher output as factory loadings increase. This was evident in 2021 when TXN achieved a gross margin of 67.5%, partly due to the efficiency of its 300mm production. Therefore, while NVDA's reliance on external foundries and international markets increases vulnerability to cost overruns and quality issues, TXN's internalized manufacturing strategy enhances gross margin stability and scalability.",

(1) All key facts are correct: NVDA's 84% international revenue and reliance on third-party foundries, TXN's 67.5% gross margin linked to 300mm fab efficiency, and the contrast in manufacturing strategies are accurately represented. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the percentages (84%, 67.5%, 300mm) match the original answer exactly, with no calculation errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly synthesizing NVDA's supply chain and defect risks with its international exposure, and contrasting it with TXN's vertically integrated, cost-efficient model. The LLM correctly infers that internal manufacturing reduces TXN's exposure to external shocks, supporting margin stability. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to omission of explicit mention of 'spreading fixed costs over higher output' or 'factory loadings increasing,' which are part of TXN's margin advantage in the original. However, the core reasoning about efficiency and margin stability is preserved. Wording differs slightly (e.g., 'supply-chain attacks, cyber-incidents' are more specific than the original's general risks), but these are valid details from NVDA's 10-K and do not contradict the ground truth.

It incorrectly states that Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit ($13.746 billion) is $13.074 billion higher than UPS's $672 million decline. This is a fundamental misunderstanding: the correct comparison is between Caterpillar's *increase* in profit ($4,618 million) and UPS's decrease ($672 million), not between Caterpillar's total profit and UPS's decline. The correct difference is $4,618 million (Caterpillar's increase) minus (-$672 million) = $5,290 million higher in change terms, but the question asks 'how much higher was Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit compared to UPS's decrease,' which should be interpreted as the difference in the *magnitude of change*, i.e., $4,618 - (-672) = $5,290 million. However, the original answer interprets it as 'Caterpillar's increase was $4,618M, UPS's decrease was $672M, so Caterpillar's increase was $4,618M higher than UPS's decrease' — which is logically flawed but appears to be the intended interpretation in the ground truth. Even under that flawed logic, the LLM fails by using total profit instead of change. (2) The margin comparison is partially correct: Caterpillar's margin increased to 20.5%, UPS's margin decreased by 230 bps to 9.0%. But the LLM incorrectly frames the comparison as 'Caterpillar’s margin is 18.2 percentage points greater than the amount of UPS’s margin decline' — this mixes absolute margin with basis point change, which is misleading. The correct comparison is that Caterpillar's margin *improved by* 510 bps vs UPS's 230 bps decline. The LLM fails to report Caterpillar's margin *change* at all. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present — the model identifies both companies and relevant metrics — but fails to correctly synthesize the *changes* in profit and margin. It uses absolute values instead of deltas, breaking the comparison. (4) Scores justified: Correctness 4/10 due to major calculation and interpretation errors; Quantitative Accuracy 5/10 because numbers like $13.746B and 20.5% are correctly cited but misused; Qualitative Accuracy 4/10 due to flawed reasoning in comparisons; Contextual Relevance 8/10 because the answer addresses the right companies, metrics, and year, and attempts both parts of the question.",

It incorrectly states that ACN's customer-related intangible assets are $2.6 billion, but the ground truth is $2,587,660 million (~$2.588 trillion), which is off by a factor of 1,000. This is a catastrophic error. For MSFT, the LLM conflates total intangible assets acquired ($21.969 billion, primarily from Activision Blizzard) with customer-related intangibles, but the ground truth specifies MSFT's actual customer-related intangibles are only $661 million. The LLM incorrectly claims MSFT's customer-related intangibles are ~$22 billion, which is not supported by the data. (2) Dates are partially correct: ACN's data is as of August 31, 2024 (correct), and MSFT's acquisition closed in October 2023 (correct), but the comparison is supposed to be as of August 2024, and the LLM misattributes the $21.969 billion as customer-related, when it is total intangible assets acquired, not customer-specific. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks to compare ACN's customer-related intangibles to MSFT's customer-related intangibles and recent acquisition activity. The LLM fails to correctly separate customer-related intangibles from total acquired intangibles for MSFT and misrepresents both companies' values. It concludes MSFT has an 'order of magnitude larger' customer-related base, when in fact ACN's is vastly larger per ground truth. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the structure addresses the right companies and topic—but due to severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, the conclusion is completely reversed from the truth. The LLM appears to misread ACN's value (possibly confusing millions with billions) and misclassify MSFT's total acquired intangibles as customer-related.

According to the ground truth, DUK's receivables from affiliated companies in 2021 were $16 million, not $65 million as stated by the LLM. The LLM incorrectly reports DUK's affiliated receivables as $65 million, which appears to be a confusion with another figure (possibly VIE or total receivables components). SO's affiliated receivables are correctly reported as $51 million. The combined total is therefore incorrectly calculated as $116 million instead of the correct $67 million. (2) DUK's total receivables are stated as $766 million in the LLM answer, but the ground truth reports $117 million, indicating a severe overstatement—likely due to misaggregation of customer, VIE, and affiliated receivables. SO's total receivables are partially correct at $139 million (customer), but the LLM adds $51 million (affiliated) and $29 million (other), inflating the total to $219 million, which contradicts the ground truth that implies total receivables of $139 million already includes affiliated amounts. Thus, the proportions are wrong: LLM reports 8.5% for DUK (vs. correct 13.7%) and 23% for SO (vs. correct 36.7%), due to incorrect denominators. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly synthesize data across entities and misinterprets the structure of receivables categories. It treats affiliated receivables as additive components rather than subsets, indicating a misunderstanding of financial statement composition.

      "original_answer": "NVDA's gross margin is negatively impacted by inventory risks and supply chain constraints, such as placing non-cancellable orders with long lead times and paying premiums to secure supply, which could lead to excess inventory charges if demand decreases. In contrast, TXN benefits from owning much of its manufacturing capacity, where increased factory loadings spread fixed costs over more output, thereby increasing gross margin. NVDA's strategy involves higher risk and potential cost volatility, while TXN's model provides more cost control and margin stability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AXP reported a Net Interest Yield on average Card Member loans of 9.2%, while BAC reported a Net Interest Yield of 2.73%. This significant difference reflects AXP's focus on high-yield proprietary card loans, with an average loan value of $15.0 billion, compared to BAC's broader asset base of $535.5 billion in average earning assets. AXP's strategy centers on maximizing yield from a more concentrated loan portfolio, whereas BAC's lower yield aligns with its larger, more diversified earning asset base, which includes a wide range of loans and investments.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express reported a 2023 net‑interest yield of roughly **2.7 %** (see the “Net interest yield” line in its Consumer‑Banking and Global‑Banking tables).  Bank of America’s 2023 filing shows a much lower yield – net‑interest income of $ 776 million on average earning assets of $ 535.5 billion, giving a yield of **about 0.1‑0.2 %**.  \n\nThe higher yield at AXP reflects its business model that leans heavily on high‑margin card‑loan portfolios, where interest earnings are generated on relatively small, high‑interest‑rate balances.  By contrast, BAC’s lower yield stems from a traditional banking model with a massive deposit base and a broad loan portfolio that includes many low‑rate assets, so interest earnings are spread over a far larger asset base, indicating a more volume‑driven, lower‑margin asset‑utilisation strategy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial metrics. According to the ground truth, AXP's Net Interest Yield in 2023 was 9.2%, not 2.7% as stated by the LLM. Additionally, BAC's Net Interest Yield is reported as 2.73% in the ground truth, but the LLM incorrectly calculates it as 0.1–0.2% based on a misreading of net interest income ($776 million) relative to average earning assets ($535.5 billion). The correct yield for BAC should be approximately ($776M / $535.5B) = ~0.145%, but this contradicts the ground truth of 2.73%, suggesting the LLM used an incorrect figure for net interest income or misunderstood the metric. However, the ground truth explicitly states BAC’s yield as 2.73%, so either the LLM misread the filing or made a calculation error. More critically, the LLM assigns AXP a yield of 2.7%, which is both factually wrong and closer to BAC’s actual value in the ground truth, indicating a possible mix-up between the two companies. (2) The dollar amount for BAC’s average earning assets ($535.5 billion) is correct, but the net interest income figure of $776 million appears inconsistent with a 2.73% yield, which would imply net interest income of about $14.6 billion (2.73% of $535.5B), suggesting the LLM used an incorrect or mislabeled income line item. Thus, the quantitative inaccuracies are severe and foundational. (3) The reasoning about business models—AXP focusing on high-margin card loans vs. BAC’s diversified, volume-driven model—is qualitatively aligned with the ground truth and shows correct multi-hop synthesis of strategy from financial structure. However, this insight is undermined by the incorrect data. (4) Due to the critical errors in reported yields (9.2% vs. 2.7% for AXP; 2.73% vs. 0.1–0.2% for BAC), the correctness score is very low (2/10). Quantitative accuracy is nearly failed (1/10) because most numbers are wrong. Qualitative reasoning is partially sound (3/10) but based on faulty inputs. Contextual relevance is acceptable (6/10) as the answer attempts the right comparison and strategic interpretation.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. The combined funded status deficit is reported as $834 million, but the ground truth is $771 million. This discrepancy arises because the LLM incorrectly uses $584 million for Danaher (DHR) and $250 million for Thermo Fisher (TMO), whereas the correct values from the knowledge graph must sum to $771 million (specific breakdown not provided in ground truth, but sum is definitive). Furthermore, the LLM calculates the percentage of the deficit relative to total plan assets (both U.S. and non-U.S.) as ~13%, but the correct comparison in the original answer is that the $771 million deficit represents 59.7% of the total *fair value of non-U.S. plan assets only*, not total (U.S. + non-U.S.) assets. (2) The LLM misinterprets the scope of assets: it sums U.S. and non-U.S. plan assets for both companies ($3.66B + $2.53B = ~$6.19B), but the original answer refers only to non-U.S. plan assets. This leads to a grossly inaccurate percentage (13% vs correct 59.7%). The fair value of *non-U.S.* plan assets must be $1.360B (Danaher) + $1.302B (Thermo Fisher) = $2.662B, and $771M / $2.662B ≈ 28.9%, still not matching 59.7%, indicating either incorrect inputs or a different definition in the ground truth. However, since the ground truth explicitly states the 59.7% ratio, and the LLM does not reproduce it due to incorrect asset base and deficit total, the quantitative failure is severe. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM identifies both companies, correct year (2021), and relevant metrics—but fails in correct entity scoping (mixing U.S. and non-U.S. assets) and uses incorrect deficit figures.

(2) The quantitative values are entirely incorrect—both the Accenture repurchase amount and Microsoft’s remaining capacity are wrong, with no clear basis in the provided truth.

However, the ground truth states that MMM's decrease was $34 million, not $29 million. This is a significant numerical error. The correct combined change is a decrease of $20 million ($14M increase - $34M decrease), but the LLM calculates a $15 million decrease ($14M - $29M), which is incorrect due to the wrong MMM delta. (2) Percentage calculations are correct: EMR’s 9.7% increase and MMM’s 15% decrease match the ground truth. However, the conclusion that 'Emerson experienced the larger percentage increase' is misleading—the question asks which company had a greater percentage increase, and while EMR did have an increase (9.7%) vs. MMM’s decrease (−15%), the phrasing could imply a comparison of magnitude, but strictly speaking, only EMR had an increase. Still, the intent of the question is to compare the magnitude of change, and MMM had a larger absolute percentage change. The original answer correctly notes MMM had a greater percentage decrease. The LLM misinterprets the comparative intent by focusing only on 'increase' and not recognizing that the question implies identifying the larger magnitude of change, regardless of direction. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model pulls data for both companies and computes changes and percentages, but the incorrect dollar figure for MMM undermines the final combined change.

      "original_answer": "Disney recorded $0.7 billion in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024 related to content assets, among others, which reduces the carrying value of those assets and signals a decline in expected future cash flows, negatively impacting financial position. In contrast, Netflix monetizes content assets as a group rather than at the individual title level and amortizes them over time, with over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset amortized within four years. This group-level monetization approach allows Netflix to spread the cost of content over time and across its subscriber base, aligning amortization with viewing patterns and supporting a more stable cost of revenue structure.",

The original answer notes that over 90% of content is amortized within four years, which the LLM captures in substance. (2) The entities—Disney (DIS), Netflix (NFLX), fiscal 2024, content assets, amortization, impairment, revenue recognition—are all correctly identified and contextualized. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts Disney’s asset-by-asset impairment approach (leading to one-time charges) with Netflix’s group-level monetization and amortization model, which avoids large discrete impairments and aligns cost with usage. It correctly notes that Netflix evaluates impairments at the group level, which is consistent with its accounting policy.

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: KO's 2023 indefinite-lived intangible assets are correctly stated as $32,868 million and $33,171 million in 2022; MO's are correctly reported as $11,443 million for both years. The combined totals are correctly calculated: $32,868M + $11,443M = $44,311M for 2023, and $33,171M + $11,443M = $44,614M for 2022. The year-over-year decrease is accurately computed as $44,614M - $44,311M = $303M. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the combined total as of December 31, 2023, and the comparison to 2022. (3) Entity accuracy is correct: KO refers to The Coca-Cola Company, MO to Altria, and the metric 'indefinite-lived intangible assets' is correctly identified for both companies. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly pulled data from two different companies and years, synthesized the totals, and computed the change over time.

      "original_answer": "Salesforce (CRM) incorporates executive compensation details by reference to its Proxy Statement, specifically citing sections like 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' 'Committee Reports,' and 'Executive Compensation and Other Matters.' IBM, on the other hand, provides more granular cross-references in its 10-K, listing detailed captions such as '2023 Summary Compensation Table,' '2023 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table,' '2023 Potential Payments Upon Termination Table,' and 'Compensation Program as It Relates to Risk.' These differences suggest that IBM's approach to corporate governance emphasizes detailed transparency around executive pay structures and risk alignment, while Salesforce maintains a more streamlined disclosure framework, relying on Proxy Statement incorporation without specifying individual compensation tables. This contrast in disclosure depth and categorization reveals differing philosophies: IBM's detailed labeling may cater to investor scrutiny and regulatory expectations, whereas Salesforce's approach implies a more consolidated, possibly higher-level governance perspective.",
      "llm_answer": "Salesforce’s 10‑K places its executive‑pay information in Item 11 only by “incorporated by reference” to the company’s proxy statement (see CRM 10‑K p. 95), pointing readers to the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” committee reports and other proxy‑file sections rather than reproducing tables or risk‑linkage narratives in the filing itself. In contrast, IBM’s 10‑K lists a full suite of compensation disclosures—summary‑compensation tables, grants, pension and deferred‑compensation tables, a “Compensation Program as It Relates to Risk,” pay‑ratio and pay‑versus‑performance data (Item 11 on IBM 10‑K p. 16)—providing detailed, stand‑alone information that directly ties executive pay to risk and performance. Thus Salesforce relies on proxy‑statement cross‑referencing for transparency, while IBM embeds extensive, risk‑aligned compensation detail in the 10‑K, reflecting a more integrated governance approach.",

IBM is accurately described as providing granular, stand-alone disclosures in its 10-K, including specific tables like 'Summary Compensation Table' and 'Compensation Program as It Relates to Risk,' which reflects greater transparency. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) in either the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in that sense, but all references (e.g., Item 11, page numbers) are correctly cited and consistent with the knowledge base, earning full marks.

(4) The LLM adds slightly more detail than the original (e.g., mentioning 'pay-ratio' and 'pay-versus-performance data'), which is factually consistent with IBM’s 2023 10-K but not present in the ground truth; this is a minor over-enrichment but not incorrect. The core conclusion about IBM emphasizing risk alignment and transparency while Salesforce takes a consolidated approach is semantically equivalent and well-supported. One point is deducted from qualitative accuracy only because the LLM implies IBM includes pension and deferred-compensation tables, which, while plausible, are not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "The difference in Net Interest Yield between AXP (9.2%) and BAC's Consumer Lending segment (3.66%) in 2023 reflects contrasting financial strategies. AXP focuses on high-yield proprietary card lending, as evidenced by its $15.0 billion in average Card Member loans generating a 9.2% yield, indicating a premium credit business model. In contrast, BAC's Consumer Lending segment, with a much lower 3.66% yield on a significantly larger loan base ($304.561 billion average loans in 2023), suggests a broader, more diversified consumer lending approach with lower per-dollar returns but higher volume. This results in a $7.634 billion effective yield difference ($15.0 billion * 9.2% = $1.38 billion for AXP vs. $304.561 billion * 3.66% = $11.15 billion for BAC, with a $9.77 billion absolute difference in interest income from these segments).",

The higher yield at AXP reflects a strategy that relies heavily on high‑interest‑rate, revolving‑credit card balances to drive profitability, even though it entails greater credit‑risk exposure.

These percentages are accurately cited with correct sources (AXP 10-K p.63, BAC 10-K p.37), satisfying entity and metric accuracy. However, the LLM omits key quantitative details present in the original answer—specifically, the average loan balances ($15.0 billion for AXP, $304.561 billion for BAC) and the derived interest income ($1.38B vs $11.15B), as well as the $9.77 billion absolute difference in interest income. While the LLM captures the strategic contrast, it fails to quantify the scale difference in loan portfolios and resulting income, which is central to the multi-hop reasoning in the ground truth. (2) No calculation errors are made because no calculations are attempted; however, the absence of the computation weakens quantitative completeness. The yields themselves are correct, so quantitative accuracy is high but not full. (3) The reasoning correctly infers that AXP’s higher yield reflects a premium, high-margin credit card model while BAC emphasizes volume and stability through a diversified lending approach. This aligns with the ground truth’s qualitative interpretation. However, the LLM does not synthesize the full multi-hop insight—that BAC earns far more total interest income despite a lower yield due to its massive loan base—missing a critical layer of analysis.

The original answer ties the risk to aviation safety and production oversight, not soil/air/water contamination. The LLM mischaracterizes the nature and source of Boeing’s exposure. (2) For Union Pacific, the LLM correctly identifies environmental remediation costs and a broad regulatory framework, but overgeneralizes by including agencies like the Federal Railroad Administration and Surface Transportation Board, which are not central to environmental compliance. The original answer correctly focuses on federal, state, and local environmental authorities without conflating safety and environmental regulators.

This reflects Disney's dual strategy of monetizing content either individually (e.g., theatrical films) or as part of a bundle (e.g., DTC subscriptions). Netflix, on the other hand, includes participations and residuals as part of its broader content production and licensing expenses, which are amortized as part of its content asset base, aligning with its primarily subscription-based DTC model. This implies that Disney's expense recognition for participations and residuals varies depending on the monetization model (individual vs. group), while Netflix's is more consistently tied to its streaming delivery and usage patterns.",

The mention of Monte Carlo models for performance-based RSUs with TSR modifiers at McDonald's is accurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high because there are no specific numbers (dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in the original or LLM answer—so no numeric errors. (3) However, the core multi-hop reasoning fails: The LLM incorrectly states that Tesla uses Monte Carlo simulations for performance-based RSUs with TSR modifiers. In contrast, the ground truth explicitly states that Tesla measures RSU fair value based solely on the closing market price on the grant date, implying a simple market-based approach without complex modeling. This is a critical factual error that reverses the key distinction in the original answer: McDonald's uses Monte Carlo due to performance conditions; Tesla does not—it uses a straightforward grant-date market price. (4) The LLM answer falsely equates the two companies' methodologies by suggesting both use Monte Carlo under performance conditions, when the ground truth draws a clear contrast: McDonald’s uses complex modeling because of performance features, while Tesla uses a simple market-based valuation.

      "original_answer": "WMT reported $3.8 billion in membership fee revenue for fiscal 2025, recognizing it ratably over the 12-month membership term. COST increased its membership fees in the U.S. and Canada effective September 1, 2024, with the Executive membership fee rising from $120 to $130, and expects these changes to generate approximately $370 million in additional revenue over the next two years, $190 million of which will benefit fiscal 2025. COST also recognizes membership fee revenue ratably over one year, aligning with WMT's approach. However, COST's recent fee hikes suggest a strategy to boost membership revenue, which could bring its financial performance closer to WMT's scale over time, especially as COST's renewal rates remain high at 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart records membership‑fee revenue on a **deferred‑basis and recognizes it ratably over the 12‑month membership term**.  The 5 % fee increase that took effect on September 1 2024 was therefore spread across the remainder of 2024 and most of fiscal 2025, with the additional $370 million of expected revenue recorded gradually in the “membership and other income” line and reflected as a larger accrued‑liability balance.\n\nCostco’s 2024 filing notes that it **raised its Gold‑Star and Executive fees (e.g., to $60 and $120)** and, like Walmart, **recognizes the fees ratably over the membership period**.  Because Costco collects the full annual fee up‑front, the increase is reflected more immediately in current‑year fee revenue, with a proportionate increase in its deferred‑membership‑fee liability.\n\n**Implication:** both companies must disclose a growing deferred‑membership‑fee liability, but Walmart’s later‑effective increase smooths the revenue impact over two years, whereas Costco’s upfront fee hike boosts the current‑year fee‑revenue line and accelerates the timing of the related deferred‑revenue reversal, affecting the comparability of period‑to‑period results.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It incorrectly attributes a 5% fee increase and $370 million in additional revenue to Walmart (WMT), when in fact these figures pertain to Costco (COST). The ground truth states that WMT reported $3.8 billion in membership fee revenue for fiscal 2025, but the LLM answer does not mention this key figure at all. Instead, it falsely claims Walmart implemented a fee increase on September 1, 2024, which is not supported by the original answer. The $370 million in additional revenue over two years and the $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025 are COST-specific figures, not WMT's. The LLM also misstates Costco's fee increases — it says Executive membership was raised to $120, but the ground truth states it increased *from* $120 *to* $130. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: multiple numbers are either misplaced (applied to wrong company) or outdated (COST's Executive fee is reported as $120 instead of the new $130). The $3.8 billion WMT revenue figure is entirely omitted. (3) The reasoning about ratable recognition over 12 months is correct for both companies and represents accurate multi-hop synthesis. The discussion of deferred revenue and liability impacts shows sound understanding of accounting principles and is contextually relevant. However, the core error — swapping key financial details between WMT and COST — undermines the validity of the comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent align with the question, discussing recognition timing and implications for financial reporting, but the factual foundation is flawed. Due to major quantitative and entity errors, the correctness score is low despite some accurate qualitative reasoning.",

      "original_answer": "Salesforce acknowledges that service interruptions—such as errors, defects, or disruptions in service—can lead to customers not renewing subscriptions, making warranty claims, or experiencing performance issues that harm their business, ultimately increasing attrition rates and reducing revenue. IBM highlights that cybersecurity incidents can result in unauthorized access, data breaches, or system outages, which expose customers to liability, regulatory action, and reputational damage, leading to loss of existing or potential customers.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes risks from two different companies (Salesforce and IBM), links each to customer retention impacts, and generalizes the common effect—eroded trust leading to reduced retention in the tech sector. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention 'regulatory action' or 'warranty claims' from the Salesforce risk, nor 'reputational damage to customers' (vs. just brand damage to the firm) as in the original, which slightly reduces completeness.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AXP experienced a reserve release in its Card Member receivables portfolio due to lower delinquencies and a decrease in receivables outstanding, which directly reduced its credit loss provision. Conversely, BAC had a reserve release in its commercial portfolio primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions, which also led to a reduction in its credit loss provision. The directional impact was a decrease in provisions for both companies, but the underlying drivers were distinct: AXP's was delinquency-related, while BAC's was macroeconomic in nature.",
      "llm_answer": "- **American Express (AXP)** – The 2023 credit‑loss provision rose sharply (to $1.313 bn from $565 m) because net write‑offs increased, but part of the increase was offset by a **reserve release that was driven by lower delinquency rates** and a drop in receivables. In other words, the improvement in delinquency trends produced a modest downward adjustment to the provision, even though the overall provision moved higher.\n\n- **Bank of America (BAC)** – BAC’s 2023 credit‑loss provision was reduced by a **reserve release that stemmed from better macro‑economic conditions in its commercial portfolio** (the “improved macro‑economic conditions” offset the credit‑card‑driven reserve build).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly regarding the direction of the credit loss provision for AXP. The original answer states that AXP had a reserve release that reduced its credit loss provision, implying a decrease. However, the LLM claims AXP's provision 'rose sharply' from $565M to $1.313B, which contradicts the ground truth. This misrepresents the directional impact and undermines the core conclusion. For BAC, the LLM correctly identifies that improved macroeconomic conditions led to a reserve release that reduced the provision, aligning with the original answer. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM introduces specific dollar figures ($1.313B and $565M) that are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified. More critically, these numbers suggest an increase in provision, which directly conflicts with the ground truth's assertion of a reserve release reducing the provision. No such increase is mentioned in the original answer, making the quantitative claims unsupported and likely incorrect. (3) The reasoning for BAC is sound: it correctly identifies that macroeconomic improvements in the commercial portfolio led to a reserve release, reducing the provision, and contrasts this with AXP's delinquency-driven release. However, for AXP, the reasoning is flawed because it asserts that lower delinquencies led to a reserve release (correct) but then embeds this in a context where the overall provision increased—contradicting the original answer’s claim of a reduction. This indicates a failure in multi-hop synthesis: the model conflates net write-offs (which may increase provisions) with reserve releases (which decrease them) without correctly resolving the net effect. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both companies, the correct year (2023), and the right concepts (delinquency trends, macroeconomic conditions, reserve releases, provisions). However, due to the critical error in AXP's provision direction and unsupported quantitative claims, the correctness score is low.

In contrast, NFLX did not report specific impairment charges for content assets but instead emphasized a proactive amortization model based on viewing patterns and group-level monetization. This reveals that DIS experienced more direct write-downs of content value during the year, while NFLX manages content valuation risk through accelerated amortization and tax incentive strategies rather than discrete impairment events.

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM correctly identifies Microsoft's 23% cloud revenue growth and calculates an increase of approximately $25.7 billion from the prior-year base (actual: $111.7B × 0.23 = $25.691B, rounded to $25.7B is acceptable). Oracle's $28 billion in cloud services and license support expenses is accurately reported. However, the LLM incorrectly concludes that Microsoft's growth is 'slightly less' than Oracle's expenses, when in fact $25.7B < $28B is correct numerically, but the ground truth states the growth exceeds Oracle's expenses by $7.8B — which implies a different figure for Microsoft’s growth ($25.8B) and a reversed comparison. This contradiction indicates a reasoning error. 2) Quantitatively, $25.7B is very close to the correct $25.8B (difference of $100M, or 0.4%), so this is a minor rounding or reporting variance. Oracle’s $28B is exact. The final comparison statement is factually incorrect: $25.7B is not greater than $28B; thus, claiming Microsoft’s growth exceeds Oracle’s expenses by $7.8B (as in the original) would require Microsoft’s growth to be $35.8B, which it is not. However, the LLM’s own numbers support its conclusion, even if they slightly deviate from the ground truth. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — it connects Microsoft’s growth to Oracle’s expenses — but the synthesis contradicts the ground truth due to a mismatch in the calculated growth amount and the direction of the comparison. 4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question. Despite minor numerical variance and a logically consistent but incorrect conclusion (based on slightly off inputs), the core facts are mostly accurate. The major flaw is failing to match the ground truth’s key comparative insight, likely due to a small error in base revenue or growth calculation.

      "original_answer": "META has $32.82 billion in non-cancelable contractual commitments related to content costs as of December 31, 2024, while DIS reported content expenses of $187 million for fiscal year 2024. META's commitments are significantly higher, indicating a much larger strategic investment in content, likely for platforms like Facebook and Instagram, compared to DIS's content spending, which may reflect more short-term or flexible content acquisition strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "Meta reports $32.8 billion of non‑cancelable contractual commitments as of 12/31/2024, with $26.3 billion of those commitments slated for 2025 and tied primarily to content (and related infrastructure). In contrast, Disney’s 2024 statement shows a “Content” charge of only $187 million. The disparity – Meta’s multi‑billion‑dollar binding commitments versus Disney’s sub‑$200 million expense – suggests Meta is pursuing a far larger, long‑term content investment program, while Disney’s approach appears more modest and selective in its current content spending.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Meta's non-cancelable contractual commitments as $32.8 billion (matching the ground truth $32.82 billion, with acceptable rounding) and Disney's 2024 content expenses as $187 million, which is accurate. The additional detail that $26.3 billion of Meta's commitments are for 2025 and tied to content (and infrastructure) is not in the original answer but does not contradict it and adds context without introducing error. 2) All numbers are factually correct and properly formatted; $32.8 billion ≈ $32.82 billion is an acceptable rounding. The $187 million figure for DIS is exact. Calculations are not required, but the comparison (multi-billion vs. sub-$200 million) is quantitatively sound. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (META and DIS), aligns them to the same fiscal year (2024), and draws a logical inference about strategic differences in content investment. The conclusion that Meta is making larger, long-term binding investments while Disney’s spending appears more modest and flexible is consistent with the ground truth. 4) The LLM answer conveys the same core information with slightly enhanced detail (e.g., breakdown of 2025 commitments), improving clarity without distorting facts. The only minor gap is that the original specifies Meta’s content commitments are 'for platforms like Facebook and Instagram,' which the LLM omits, but this is not critical to the main comparison. Overall, the answer is factually accurate, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate.",

      "original_answer": "Walmart's operation of 5,566 stores across 18 countries, including formats like supercenters and warehouse clubs, combined with its omni-channel integration (pickup and delivery services in most markets, same-day delivery, and digital platforms like walmart.com.mx and walmart.ca), enhances its global competitive reach. Walmart leverages its global ecosystem and local expertise to offer affordable products and services, while also expanding into digital payments through platforms like PhonePe. This creates a competitive challenge for Costco, which acknowledges the risk of losing market share to retailers with greater financial resources and technology capabilities, such as Walmart. Walmart's broader international footprint, coupled with its investments in digital infrastructure and economies of scale, could allow it to outpace Costco in attracting global customers and members, thereby directly impacting Costco's ability to maintain its competitive position.",

There are no calculations required, so numerical accuracy is fully preserved. (2) The LLM correctly identifies Walmart’s omni-channel capabilities—e-commerce integration, mobile apps, same-day pickup and delivery—as key competitive advantages, consistent with the ground truth’s mention of walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, and digital fulfillment. It also accurately cites Costco’s 10-K risk statement about competition from firms with greater financial and technological resources, referencing page 14, which enhances credibility. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects Walmart’s scale and technology (from its international footprint and digital infrastructure) to the strategic threat it poses to Costco’s membership model, especially in overlapping markets. The synthesis across Walmart’s operations and Costco’s disclosed risks is logically coherent and contextually appropriate. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to omission of specific examples like PhonePe or explicit mention of warehouse clubs/supercenters as overlapping formats, which slightly reduces completeness compared to the original.

      "original_answer": "Microsoft accounts for hardware revenue as a single performance obligation when it is sold together with software licenses that are highly interdependent, recognizing revenue at the point in time when ownership is transferred. In contrast, Oracle reports hardware revenue as a distinct category with a disclosed amount of $3,000 million, suggesting it is treated separately within Oracle’s financial reporting framework. This indicates differing revenue recognition approaches for hardware between the two companies, with Microsoft integrating hardware and software in a single obligation while Oracle accounts for hardware as a standalone offering.",
      "llm_answer": "Microsoft says that when its hardware (e.g., PCs, consoles or other devices) is sold together with a software license that cannot function without the operating system, the hardware and the license are treated as **one performance‑obligation**.  Revenue for the combined bundle is therefore recognized **at a single point in time** when ownership of the device is transferred to the reseller or end‑customer.  \n\nOracle, by contrast, lists **hardware‑related sales in a distinct revenue line** (e.g., “Hardware” or “Hardware‑related revenue”) separate from its software and cloud services, so the hardware portion is reported **as its own category** rather than being merged with software licenses.",

      "question": "How do the strategic changes in content distribution by Disney (DIS) and the product changes affecting content distribution on Meta (META) reflect different risks to their respective financial results, and what specific examples from each company's 2024 10-K illustrate these risks?",
      "original_answer": "Disney's strategic changes in content distribution, such as the reorganization of media and entertainment operations into two segments and the removal of certain content from DTC platforms, have led to impairment charges and uncertainty in the profitability of DTC products. For example, Disney noted that the cost of executing its DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which could affect content distribution across platforms and the timing of content windows. Meanwhile, Meta's changes to its Feed display algorithms and the promotion of Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, have led to reduced user engagement and financial results. These strategic shifts in both companies reflect different risks: Disney faces risks related to content curation and cost rationalization, while Meta faces risks from product changes that reduce monetization potential and content distribution effectiveness.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney’s risk stems from strategic shifts in how it distributes its entertainment assets—such as the 2023 re‑organization of its media‑and‑entertainment businesses, the decision to review and remove certain titles from its DTC services, and the resulting impairment charges to content and goodwill (see DIS 10‑K p. 22). Those changes can alter windowing, pricing and the mix of content available on Disney+ and Hulu, which could depress subscriber growth and profitability.  \n\nMeta’s risk is tied to product‑level changes that affect the flow of third‑party content on its platforms—e.g., updates to Feed ranking, ad size and prominence that “may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers” and thus reduce their incentive to spend on Meta’s ad inventory (see META 10‑K p. 23). Those product tweaks can lower user engagement and advertising revenue, directly impacting financial results.",

(1) All factual information is correct: Disney's 2023 reorganization, removal of content from DTC platforms, and resulting impairment charges are accurately described and tied to risks in content windowing, subscriber growth, and profitability. Meta's product changes—specifically algorithmic updates to Feed ranking and ad display affecting content distribution and monetization—are correctly identified as reducing publisher and advertiser engagement, which impacts ad revenue. The cited 10-K page numbers (p.22 for DIS, p.23 for META) match the source data. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in either the ground truth or LLM answer beyond the year 2023, which is correctly referenced; thus, quantitative accuracy is perfect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes strategic changes at two companies, links them to specific risks in content distribution, and connects those risks to financial outcomes (subscriber growth for Disney, ad revenue for Meta). The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention Meta’s promotion of Reels and its lower monetization rate—mentioned in the ground truth—which slightly weakens the completeness of Meta’s risk explanation. However, the core risk (product changes reducing monetization and distribution effectiveness) is still conveyed.

It also accurately states MDLZ's 8.0% net revenue increase in 2021 (reported as 8%), with the recovery in travel retail contributing to growth, though still below pre-pandemic levels. The mention of 5.2% organic growth adds detail not in the original answer but does not contradict it and is consistent with MDLZ's reported performance. (2) All numeric values—$367M goodwill, $204M trademark, 8% revenue growth—are factually correct and properly attributed. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts CL’s asset impairments due to travel retail decline with MDLZ’s revenue growth as travel rebounded, synthesizing information across two companies and their respective financial responses to the same macro factor. The strategic outlook is accurately reflected: CL maintained confidence in Filorga despite impairments (implied in original), and MDLZ showed positive momentum. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state CL’s continued confidence in Filorga’s future growth, which is part of the original answer’s qualitative insight. However, the omission does not distort the facts. All other elements—entities (CL, MDLZ, Filorga), metrics (goodwill, revenue growth), and time frame (2021)—are accurate.

(2) The quantitative comparison is factually correct: $1.5 billion is approximately 0.64% of $235 billion, and the LLM states that Morgan Stanley’s offerings were 'more than 150 times' the size of Mastercard’s issuance. This is accurate (235 / 1.5 ≈ 156.67), so 'more than 150 times' is a reasonable and conservative phrasing.

In contrast, Meta discloses that content costs are part of its cost of revenue, which includes expenses for delivery and distribution of products, but does not specify a dollar amount for content production.

This qualitative contrast is well-articulated and aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM answer omits all specific dollar amounts and dates from Disney’s 2024 disclosures ($34,409 million total, $18,189 million released, $2,281 million completed but unreleased), which are central to the original answer and the question’s demand for 2024 data. These omissions significantly impact quantitative accuracy. (2) No numeric values from the ground truth are mentioned in the LLM response, so there is no opportunity to verify correctness of numbers or calculations — this results in a low quantitative accuracy score despite the absence of incorrect numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in accounting treatment (capitalization vs expensing) and links them to broader monetization strategies (direct content monetization vs platform/advertising-based). This demonstrates strong qualitative understanding. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and directly addresses the comparative question about content cost approaches and what they indicate about monetization strategies. While the reasoning and conceptual contrast are strong, the absence of specific 2024 financial figures from Disney’s disclosures — a key requirement implied by the question referencing '2024 disclosures' — prevents a higher correctness score.

The sum is $37.449 billion, which the model rounds to $37.4 billion. The ground truth states $37.5 billion, indicating a minor rounding difference of $0.051 billion (about $51 million), likely due to intermediate rounding in the final total. (2) All numeric inputs and calculations are derived correctly from the reported figures; the individual differences are accurate to the source data. The final combined increase is off by only 0.14%, which is negligible but prevents a perfect quantitative score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies (TMO and UNH), extracts consolidated revenues for 2020 and 2021, computes year-over-year increases, and sums them. Entity mapping (TMO → Thermo Fisher Scientific, UNH → UnitedHealth Group) is accurate. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only a trivial discrepancy in rounding.

Similarly, FedEx Corporation (FDX) also records GILTI taxes as a period cost, aligning with EMR in terms of immediate recognition of foreign intangible income taxes. This shared treatment reveals a consistent industry approach under the Industrials sector to account for GILTI without relying on deferred tax mechanisms, thereby increasing transparency and aligning with U.S. tax reform expectations post-CARES Act. The immediate expensing of GILTI by both companies results in a direct impact on their annual effective tax rates, with EMR showing volatility due to restructuring benefits and FDX emphasizing future taxable income projections to support deferred tax asset recoverability.",

The combined total of Costs and Expenses is reported as approximately $99.8 billion, while the ground truth is $100,367 million ($100.367 billion). This difference arises because the LLM used rounded figures: $95.1 billion for Meta and $4.7 billion for Disney, which sum to $99.8 billion. However, the exact values from filings likely sum to the ground truth figure (e.g., if Disney’s cost was $5.267 billion instead of $4.7B, the total would align). The Reality Labs percentage is correctly calculated at ~20.9%, matching the ground truth of 20.89%. (2) The LLM states Meta’s total Costs and Expenses as $95.1 billion and Reality Labs as $19.9 billion, then computes 19,875 ÷ 95,121 ≈ 0.209 — this shows precise internal consistency and accurate percentage derivation. The slight variance from 20.89% is due to rounding and is negligible. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies two companies (DIS and META), extracts Costs and Expenses from each for 2024, sums them, and separately analyzes the segment-level data for Reality Labs within Meta. All required synthesis steps are present. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both parts of the question. The minor underreporting of Disney’s Costs and Expenses (likely due to misreading or rounding down from ~$5.267B to $4.7B) is the primary error, leading to a $567 million shortfall in the combined total. This affects quantitative accuracy slightly but does not undermine the overall correctness. Hence, a score of 9 is justified — highly accurate with only a small factual deviation in one input figure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical factual error in the comparison direction and calculation. It claims Tesla's Services and Other revenue is $3.2 billion higher than GM's, but the ground truth states Tesla generated $8,319 million and GM $5,157 million, meaning Tesla's revenue is actually $3,162 million higher—not GM's as implied in the original question context. However, the LLM incorrectly reverses the comparison, stating Tesla is higher when the question asks how much larger GM's revenue is than Tesla's, which is factually incorrect because Tesla's is larger. This misrepresents the core quantitative relationship. (2) While the individual revenue figures are correct—$8.319 billion for Tesla and $5.157 billion for GM (matching $8,319 million and $5,157 million in ground truth)—the difference is miscalculated: 8,319 - 5,157 = 3,162 million ($3.162 billion), not $3.2 billion (close but imprecise). More importantly, the question asks how much larger GM's revenue is than Tesla's, but in reality, Tesla's is larger, so the premise of GM being larger is false. The LLM fails to recognize this and incorrectly affirms Tesla being higher, contradicting its own flawed interpretation of the question. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is unsound: the model fails to correctly interpret the comparative direction in the question, which requires computing GM’s minus Tesla’s (which would be negative), and instead reports Tesla’s lead without acknowledging that the question assumes GM is larger—thus missing the contradiction. It also fails to note that despite Tesla's higher growth rate, it already surpasses GM in absolute revenue, which contradicts the implication in the question. (4) The qualitative reasoning is flawed due to incorrect synthesis and logic. The conclusion that 'Tesla is ahead' is factually correct based on numbers, but it does not align with the question’s framing, which assumes GM is larger. The model should have corrected the premise but instead compounded confusion by misstating the difference. Contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right companies, metric, and year, and discusses growth vs. scale, but the incorrect calculation direction and flawed logic severely undermine accuracy. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the incorrect sign/direction of comparison and imprecise difference. Overall, major factual and reasoning errors result in a low correctness score.",

In contrast, Target explicitly states it offers a starting wage of at least $15 per hour for U.S. hourly team members as part of a broader compensation package that includes benefits like healthcare, retirement plans, and education assistance.

The ground truth states that Costco's SG&A expenses decreased by 17 basis points due to wage increases being offset by leveraging higher sales. However, the LLM claims a 77 basis point decrease in SG&A as a share of net sales from 2021 to 2022 and attributes it directly to wage hikes, which contradicts the original answer. Additionally, the LLM introduces specific SG&A percentages for Target (8.88% in 2022 vs 9.65% in 2021), which are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided information. (2) The calculation of a 77 basis point decline and the exact SG&A ratios for Target suggest precise data extraction from 10-Ks, but since the original answer does not include these numbers, their accuracy cannot be confirmed, and more importantly, they distract from the core point about Costco’s 17 basis point improvement linked to wage strategy. The ground truth emphasizes Costco’s operational efficiency despite higher wages, not a large SG&A drop. (3) The reasoning is partially sound—both companies are correctly identified as having raised wages while maintaining or improving cost efficiency. The comparison between Costco’s wage-linked efficiency and Target’s broader compensation philosophy aligns with the original answer. However, the LLM incorrectly implies Costco explicitly tied the SG&A reduction to wage increases, whereas the original answer notes the reduction occurred *despite* higher wage investment due to sales leverage. This misrepresents causality. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the response addresses both parts of the multi-hop question: impact on SG&A and comparison of labor strategies. Entity accuracy (Costco, Target, years 2021–2022, SG&A, minimum wage) is correct. However, the incorrect magnitude of the SG&A change and unsupported numerical claims reduce factual reliability.

While it correctly identifies MA's amortized cost due within 1 year ($170 million) and MA's cost due after 1 through 5 years ($116 million), it grossly overstates MS's amount. The ground truth states MS has $6,403 million, but the LLM incorrectly includes $58,484 million (AFS) and $6,403 million (HTM), summing to $64,887 million. This reflects a misinterpretation of the data—only $6,403 million is due within 1 year for MS; the $58,484 million appears to be total AFS securities, not those maturing within a year. (2) The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM reports $65,057 million vs. the correct $6,573 million—a tenfold overstatement. The comparison to MA’s $116 million is numerically and proportionally incorrect (560x vs. actual ~56.7x). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM identifies the correct companies (MA, MS), metric (amortized cost), and timeframes (within 1 year, 1–5 years)—but fails in synthesis by using incorrect values for MS.

      "question": "Given that The Walt Disney Company reports advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream and Alphabet (GOOGL) notes that shifts in advertising formats and device usage are affecting monetization trends and margins, how might these evolving advertising dynamics impact the relative growth and profitability of advertising revenues for both companies?",
      "original_answer": "The Walt Disney Company lists advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream, indicating its importance to overall income. Alphabet highlights that shifts toward mobile and newer advertising formats have generally lower margins compared to traditional desktop search, and that changes in device mix, geographic reach, and AI-driven user behavior are affecting monetization trends. These dynamics suggest that while both companies benefit from advertising revenues, Alphabet faces margin pressures due to format and device shifts, which could constrain profitability growth. For Disney, if it relies heavily on traditional advertising formats, it may face challenges adapting to these same evolving dynamics, potentially limiting revenue growth unless it successfully transitions to newer, more competitive formats.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney treats advertising as one of its core service‑revenue streams (see DIS 10‑K p. 84) and therefore expects its ad sales to continue growing alongside its media assets. However, Alphabet warns that as users move to smartphones, wearables, connected‑TVs and other modalities, newer ad formats tend to generate lower margins than traditional desktop search (Alphabet 10‑K p. 31). Consequently, while both companies can still expand ad revenue, Disney’s growth may be steadier but could face margin pressure if it relies increasingly on the same lower‑margin digital formats, whereas Alphabet is likely to see stronger top‑line growth but comparatively weaker profitability because the shifting device mix and ad‑format mix compress its advertising margins.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: Disney reports advertising as a significant revenue stream (cited from p.84 of its 10-K), and Alphabet notes lower margins from shifts to mobile and new ad formats (cited from p.31 of its 10-K). These citations match the source data in the knowledge graph. (2) There are no numeric values, percentages, or dates in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense—however, the LLM correctly references qualitative financial impacts (e.g., margin compression), and no incorrect figures are introduced. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across both companies’ 10-K filings, compares their exposure to advertising dynamics, and draws a nuanced contrast—Disney’s potentially steadier growth vs. Alphabet’s stronger top-line but margin-constrained profitability. (4) The LLM adds slight elaboration (e.g., mentioning wearables and connected TVs) that is contextually reasonable and consistent with Alphabet’s broader device-mix discussion, though not explicitly detailed in the ground truth. This does not introduce error but adds granularity. The core insight—that evolving ad formats and device usage create margin pressure, affecting profitability differently across the two firms—is preserved and well-articulated.

      "original_answer": "The combined carrying amount of foreign currency-denominated notes designated as net investment hedges by AbbVie and Eli Lilly as of December 31, 2024, is $8.44 billion ($3.1 billion from AbbVie and $5.34 billion from Eli Lilly). Both companies report foreign currency translation gains or losses related to these designated notes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which reduces earnings volatility caused by foreign exchange fluctuations.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Combined carrying amount** – AbbVie had foreign‑currency‑denominated notes with a carrying amount of **$5.34 billion** that were designated as net‑investment hedges at 12/31/2024. Eli Lilly reported a similar amount of **$5.34 billion** for its foreign‑currency‑denominated notes that were also designated as net‑investment hedges. Together, the two companies had **approximately $10.68 billion** of such notes on their balance sheets.\n\n- **Effect of the designation** – Because the notes are designated as net‑investment hedges, any foreign‑currency translation gains or losses that arise from changes in spot exchange rates are **recorded in accumulated other‑comprehensive income (loss)** rather than in earnings.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative values. It incorrectly states that AbbVie's carrying amount is $5.34 billion, when the ground truth is $3.1 billion. It also incorrectly assigns Eli Lilly's correct value of $5.34 billion to AbbVie, leading to a completely wrong combined total of $10.68 billion instead of the correct $8.44 billion. These errors are critical because they involve misattribution of financial data between companies and an incorrect sum. (2) The calculation of the combined amount is mathematically correct based on the wrong inputs ($5.34B + $5.34B = $10.68B), but since the inputs are factually inaccurate, the result is invalid. The correct sum is $3.1B + $5.34B = $8.44B. (3) The qualitative reasoning about the accounting treatment is accurate: both companies do report foreign currency translation gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss (or income), which aligns with hedge accounting under ASC 815. This part of the multi-hop synthesis is correct and shows proper understanding of the financial reporting implications. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question—quantitative total and qualitative impact—and uses appropriate financial terminology. However, the severe numerical inaccuracies in entity-specific values and the resulting total significantly undermine the correctness.

      "original_answer": "GM's high fixed cost structure means that small changes in vehicle sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on profitability, making them highly exposed to market fluctuations. In contrast, Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments, which commenced between 2024 and 2025 with lease terms up to 20 years, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream, reducing their short-term exposure to sales volatility. This contrast in financial structures means that GM faces greater financial risk during periods of declining sales, while Tesla's leasing model offers a buffer against immediate market fluctuations through long-term contractual revenue.",
      "llm_answer": "GM warns that “because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability” (GM 10‑K p. 19) and that its “high proportion of fixed costs… may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles” (GM 10‑K p. 17). In contrast, Tesla notes that it has $1.53 billion of operating‑lease commitments that will begin in 2024‑2025, creating long‑term, fixed‑rate lease payments (“These operating leases will commence … with lease terms of 2 years to 20 years”) (Tesla 10‑K p. 80). Therefore, GM’s earnings are highly exposed to market‑driven swings in vehicle sales, while Tesla’s sizable lease portfolio provides a more predictable revenue stream that dampens its sensitivity to such fluctuations.",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $1.53 billion is correctly reported, and the timeframes (2024–2025 start, up to 20-year terms) match. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly contrasts GM’s vulnerability to sales fluctuations due to fixed costs with Tesla’s reduced exposure via long-term lease revenue, synthesizing data from both companies’ filings. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly state that Tesla’s leasing model 'reduces short-term exposure' or 'buffers against immediate market fluctuations' in those exact terms, though the meaning is implied by saying lease payments 'dampen sensitivity'—a semantically equivalent phrase.

In contrast, Target recognized $87 million in impairment charges in 2021, showing that for certain asset groups, the carrying value exceeded the fair value estimated through similar market appraisal methods.

However, there is a minor error in the timing: the original answer specifies that Target's $87 million charge was recognized in 2021, while the LLM states it was disclosed in the 2022 filing — which may be technically accurate if the charge relates to prior-year assets but was reported in the 2022 filing. This creates ambiguity about whether the charge pertains to 2022 or 2021 operations. The LLM implies the charge was for 2022, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) The dollar amount ($87 million) is correct, and the absence of charges at Costco is accurately stated. Number formatting is consistent and acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes that both companies use market appraisals for fair value estimation but reached different conclusions, reflecting divergent asset performance outcomes. It draws a valid contrast in impairment outcomes despite similar methodologies. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing the question’s focus on differing outcomes despite shared valuation methods. The reasoning is sound and well-articulated.

However, the LLM incorrectly reports Emerson as $1.8 million and Lockheed Martin as $97 million, which are far below the correct values. The final sum of $98.8 million is therefore also incorrect; the correct total is $251 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: both individual figures are wrong by orders of magnitude, and the calculation (though arithmetically correct at $1.8M + $97M = $98.8M) is based on incorrect inputs.

These revenues are tied to traditional television broadcasting and promotional services. In contrast, GOOGL generates advertising revenues predominantly through digital platforms such as Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network properties, leveraging both performance and brand advertising models. Revenues are recognized either when a user engages with performance ads or when brand ads are displayed.

      "question": "How might the availability of financing impact both Emerson Electric's (EMR) ability to innovate in decarbonization technologies and FedEx's (FDX) capital investment plans, given their respective references to financing conditions and capital-intensive operations?",
      "original_answer": "The availability of financing directly affects both Emerson Electric's (EMR) ability to innovate in decarbonization technologies and FedEx's (FDX) capital investment plans. EMR notes that the adoption of new technologies like battery storage and hydrogen use cases will depend in part on the availability of financing for such projects. This implies that if financing becomes constrained or more expensive, EMR may struggle to develop or deploy these technologies, which are critical to responding to market trends like decarbonization. Similarly, FDX emphasizes that the amount and timing of its capital investments — which include aircraft, vehicles, and technology — depend on the availability of satisfactory financing. For example, FDX had $4.1 billion available under its 2022 repurchase program and issued $970 million in Pass-Through Certificates to fund corporate purposes. If financing availability tightens, FDX may delay or reduce investments in fleet expansion or technology upgrades. Thus, a decline in financing availability would create a dual impact: slowing EMR’s innovation in climate-related technologies and constraining FDX’s capital expenditures, both of which are essential to their strategic positioning in capital- and technology-intensive industries.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson notes that its ability to fund research, development and the rollout of emerging decarbonization solutions – such as battery storage, hydrogen use and carbon‑capture technologies – is tied to the “availability of financing for certain types of projects” and to overall credit‑market conditions; a deterioration in those markets could restrict the capital needed to bring new low‑carbon products to market (EMR p. 14‑15, 17). FedEx likewise states that the timing and scale of its capital‑intensive investments in aircraft, package‑handling equipment, vehicles, facilities and technology “depend on … availability of satisfactory financing,” so tighter financing or higher borrowing costs would likely curb or delay its planned capital‑expenditure programs (FDX p. 60‑64).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) All factual information is correct: Emerson Electric (EMR) links its innovation in decarbonization technologies (e.g., battery storage, hydrogen use, carbon capture) to financing availability and credit-market conditions, citing specific page references (EMR p. 14–15, 17). FedEx (FDX) ties the timing and scale of its capital investments (aircraft, vehicles, facilities, technology) to the availability of satisfactory financing (FDX p. 60–64). These points are consistent with the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: while no specific dollar figures are repeated in the LLM answer (e.g., $4.1B repurchase program, $970M Pass-Through Certificates), their absence does not detract from correctness, as the LLM correctly captures the dependency on financing without misrepresenting or fabricating numbers. The omission of these figures slightly reduces completeness but not accuracy. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes information from both EMR and FDX filings, correctly identifying the parallel impact of financing conditions on innovation (EMR) and capital investment (FDX), despite different business models. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—wording differs but meaning matches: 'deterioration in those markets could restrict capital' conveys the same risk as in the original. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of specific examples of FDX’s financing actions (e.g., the $970M issuance), which were present in the ground truth and would have strengthened completeness. However, the core logic, entities, and dependencies are accurately represented, warranting a high score.",

      "original_answer": "The difference in starting hourly wages between Costco and Target in 2022 is $2.50, with Costco offering a starting wage of $17.50 and Target offering a minimum of $15 per hour. This wage gap reflects Costco's strategy of providing higher base compensation to support employee retention and career development, as evidenced by their multiple wage increases in 2022 and emphasis on full-time employment and benefits. In contrast, Target's strategy focuses on offering a comprehensive benefits package alongside a competitive but lower starting wage, aiming to attract a diverse workforce with varying employment goals, such as students and retirees seeking supplemental income.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco’s 2022 filing notes that it raised its U.S. starting wage to **$17.50 per hour** (Costco 10‑K Human Capital, page 6). Target’s 2022 filing states that its hourly team members receive a **starting wage of at least $15 per hour** (Target 10‑K Compensation and Benefits, page 6). The $2.50‑hour gap shows Costco’s strategy of using higher base pay as a core element of its “competitive compensation and benefits” approach to attract and retain workers, while Target emphasizes a broader, equity‑focused compensation package that sets a $15 floor but relies on additional benefits and pay equity initiatives to compete for talent.",

      "original_answer": "Goldman Sachs estimates potential loss from credit exposures using a combination of current and potential exposure metrics, incorporating market movements within a specified confidence level and applying netting and collateral arrangements. They also conduct regular and tailored stress tests to estimate losses under hypothetical severe market or economic events, reviewing these estimates to identify and mitigate risk concentrations. In contrast, Visa estimates potential loss in legal and regulatory matters by assessing the probability and amount of loss based on management's judgment, historical data, legal advice, and specific case details. Visa also adjusts estimates as new information becomes available and uses loss-sharing agreements to reduce liability. While Goldman Sachs uses quantitative financial modeling and market-based stress scenarios, Visa relies more heavily on qualitative legal assessments and contractual mechanisms to manage potential loss.",
      "llm_answer": "Goldman Sachs quantifies its credit‑risk exposure by calculating “potential exposure” – a forward‑looking, model‑driven estimate that incorporates netting, collateral and a specified confidence level, and then runs stress‑test scenarios that shock credit‑rating, interest‑rate, currency and equity factors to gauge losses under severe but non‑probabilistic market moves. Visa, by contrast, estimates potential liability from legal and regulatory matters through a judgment‑based process that assesses the probability a loss is “probable” and the amount that can be reasonably estimated, then adjusts the liability as new facts, counsel advice or loss‑sharing arrangements become known. Thus, Goldman relies on quantitative scenario‑based exposure modeling, while Visa relies on qualitative probability judgments and periodic re‑estimation.",

      "original_answer": "Intel has historically faced significant delays in achieving expected manufacturing yields for its 10nm and 7nm process technologies, which led to missed customer product design windows, increased product costs, and allowed competitors like TSMC-based firms to gain a competitive edge in performance and energy efficiency. These yield issues have directly impacted Intel’s gross margin due to higher per-unit costs and underutilized capacity. NVIDIA, on the other hand, faces risks from its reliance on third-party foundries, where failure to achieve high manufacturing yields—either due to issues in product design or the foundry's proprietary process technology—can similarly increase costs and reduce product availability.

The ground truth states that Goldman Sachs' total redemption value based on liquidation preference is $4.25 billion, derived from Series X (90,000 shares × $25,000 = $2.25B) and Series Y (80,000 shares × $25,000 = $2.0B), totaling $4.25B. However, the LLM claims a redemption value of $13.3 billion, which is more than triple the correct amount. This figure appears to be based on a misreading of the filing (possibly confusing number of shares or including accrued dividends not mentioned in the ground truth), and no such $13.3B total is supported by the provided truth. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the $25,000 liquidation preference per share and that the redemption mechanism is based on liquidation preference, but fails to correctly calculate or report the total redemption value. The reference to '13,253 million' ($13.253B) is inconsistent with the ground truth and unsupported. (3) On qualitative aspects, the LLM correctly notes that both GS and Visa provide preferred stockholders with priority in liquidation over common stockholders, and correctly contrasts GS’s quantified redemption value with Visa’s lack of a fixed dollar amount. It also accurately describes Visa’s priority in asset distribution, though it omits key details from the ground truth: Visa’s preferred stock participates on an as-converted basis in quarterly dividends and can convert into class A common or series A preferred stock—information absent in the LLM response, reducing completeness. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question—redemption value for GS and comparison with Visa—and maintains relevance. However, the severe numerical inaccuracy in the core financial figure heavily undermines the correctness score. While the reasoning structure is sound, the failure to report the correct redemption value and omission of Visa’s conversion and dividend participation features result in a low correctness and quantitative accuracy score.",

      "question": "How do ABBV's acquisition-related tax impacts and LLY's $3.35 billion IPR&D and $947.7 million manufacturing site acquisitions in 2024 compare in terms of business development spending, and what does this indicate about their respective strategic growth priorities?",
      "original_answer": "ABBV experienced a lower effective tax rate in 2024, partially due to acquisition costs related to business development activities, indicating that strategic acquisitions influenced its tax position. Meanwhile, LLY spent $3.35 billion on IPR&D (primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic) and $947.7 million on a manufacturing site in Wisconsin, showing a significant allocation of capital toward innovation and manufacturing expansion. Comparing the two, ABBV's business development activities influenced its tax efficiency, while LLY's spending reflects a focus on expanding R&D capabilities and production infrastructure, suggesting different strategic emphases despite both engaging in business development activities.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s 2024 filing shows only modest acquisition‑related tax effects – a $13.4 million acquisition cost line in its tax expense, an $82 million increase in tax positions from acquisitions and a rise in deferred tax liabilities tied to the Cerevel Therapeutics and ImmunoGen purchases. In contrast, Eli Lilly reported spending roughly $3.35 billion on acquired IPR&D and $947.7 million on a Wisconsin manufacturing site, a combined ≈ $4.3 billion of business‑development outlays. This contrast indicates that AbbVie’s growth strategy is centered on managing the tax implications of existing deals rather than pursuing large new purchases, while Lilly is aggressively expanding its pipeline and manufacturing capacity through sizable acquisition investments.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the quantitative details about ABBV's acquisition-related tax impacts. The ground truth states that ABBV had a lower effective tax rate due to acquisition costs influencing its tax position, but does not specify dollar amounts like $13.4 million in acquisition costs, $82 million increase in tax positions, or deferred tax liabilities from Cerevel/ImmunoGen. These specific figures are not present in the original answer and appear to be fabricated or hallucinated, failing the quantitative accuracy check. (2) In contrast, the LLY numbers are correct: $3.35 billion on IPR&D and $947.7 million on the Wisconsin manufacturing site, totaling approximately $4.3 billion — this calculation and data are accurate and match the ground truth. (3) The reasoning and synthesis partially align: the LLM correctly infers that LLY is focusing on pipeline and manufacturing expansion, which matches the original's interpretation. However, the conclusion that ABBV is focused on 'managing tax implications of existing deals rather than pursuing large new purchases' goes beyond the original answer, which only states that acquisition costs influenced tax efficiency — not that ABBV is avoiding new deals. This misrepresents ABBV’s strategic intent. (4) Despite strong contextual relevance and correct handling of LLY’s data, the hallucinated ABBV financials severely undermine correctness. The answer gets partial credit for correctly identifying the contrast in strategic emphasis, but the flawed foundation on ABBV’s side reduces overall accuracy. Thus, correctness is scored at 6 (partially correct with major errors), quantitative accuracy at 5 (half-right due to incorrect ABBV numbers), qualitative accuracy at 7 (sound logic where facts are correct), and contextual relevance at 9 (fully on-topic and addressing the comparative strategy question).",

      "question": "What was the change in merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales for Costco in 2022 compared to 2021, and how does this trend contrast with Target's gross margin percentage in 2021, which was negatively impacted by higher merchandise costs?",
      "original_answer": "Costco's merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales increased from 89.2% in 2021 to 89.5% in 2022, contributing to a decline in its gross margin percentage from 11.13% to 10.48%. In contrast, Target reported that higher merchandise costs were a factor negatively impacting its gross margin percentage in 2021, even though it maintained a much higher gross margin at 28.3%. This shows that while both companies faced pressure from merchandise cost increases, Costco experienced a direct decline in gross margin percentage, whereas Target was able to offset some of the cost pressures through other factors like digital fulfillment efficiencies and favorable category mix.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco’s merchandise costs rose to roughly **89.5 % of net sales in 2022**, up from about **88.9 % in 2021** – an increase of **≈0.6 percentage point** (about 60 basis points). By comparison, Target’s **gross‑margin rate was 28.3 % in 2021**, a level that fell because higher merchandise costs weighed on profitability.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a key factual error in the 2021 merchandise cost percentage for Costco. The ground truth states it was 89.2% in 2021, but the LLM reports 88.9%, which is incorrect. The 2022 figure (89.5%) is correct. This leads to an inaccurate change calculation: the LLM reports an increase of approximately 0.6 percentage points, but the actual increase is 0.3 points (89.5% - 89.2%). The Target gross margin percentage (28.3% in 2021) is correctly reported. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the incorrect baseline percentage and resulting miscalculation of the year-over-year change. While the 89.5% and 28.3% figures are accurate, the 88.9% figure is not, and the ≈0.6 percentage point increase is therefore wrong. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that rising merchandise costs affected Costco and that Target faced margin pressure from higher costs. However, it fails to mention that Target’s gross margin decline occurred in 2021 despite maintaining a high margin, and it omits the crucial contrast that Target offset some cost pressures through digital fulfillment and category mix—key context in the original answer. The multi-hop synthesis is incomplete. (4) Correctness is scored 6 due to partial factual accuracy: core elements like the direction of change and Target’s margin are correct, but the magnitude of Costco’s cost increase is wrong. Quantitative accuracy is 5 due to the significant error in the 2021 percentage. Qualitative accuracy is 7 because the logic and entity identification are mostly correct, but the explanation lacks depth in contrasting the two companies’ responses. Contextual relevance is 9 as the answer addresses the main question and stays focused on the relevant metrics and companies.",

      "original_answer": "Netflix expects to incur between $1 billion and $4 billion in future content licensing obligations over the next three years, primarily after the first twelve months. This compares to Comcast's Studios segment, which typically has future revenue visibility from existing licensing agreements equal to approximately one-half year to one year of annual Studios content licensing revenue. Thus, while Netflix's obligations are forward-looking and not yet fixed, they represent a significant multi-year financial commitment that is expected to be recognized over time, similar to Comcast’s revenue recognition pattern from licensing content over a 1–2 year horizon.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix says the unknown content‑licensing obligations it will incur over the next three years are roughly **$1 billion to $4 billion**. In contrast, Comcast notes that the Studios segment’s “future revenue to be earned” from existing fixed‑price licensing deals is only **about one‑half to one full year of the segment’s annual licensing revenue**. Thus Netflix’s projected three‑year liability is expressed in dollar terms, while Comcast’s visibility is expressed as a time‑based slice of its yearly licensing revenue.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and matches the ground truth in all key quantitative aspects: Netflix's future content licensing obligations are correctly stated as $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, and Comcast's Studios segment's future revenue visibility is accurately described as approximately one-half to one full year of annual licensing revenue. These numbers are factually correct and properly attributed to the respective companies. The answer addresses both parts of the multi-hop question—Netflix’s obligations and Comcast’s revenue visibility—and correctly contrasts the dollar-based projection (Netflix) with the time-based revenue visibility (Comcast). The reasoning is sound: it highlights the difference in how each company expresses forward-looking commitments (liabilities vs. revenue) while implicitly acknowledging the comparable time horizons (multi-year, though Comcast’s is shorter at 1–2 years). The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits the detail from the original answer that Netflix’s obligations are 'primarily after the first twelve months' and does not explicitly note the similarity in recognition patterns over time, which slightly weakens the qualitative synthesis. However, this does not undermine the core correctness. Wording differs but maintains semantic equivalence.

According to the ground truth, AbbVie's net acquired IPR&D is $1.3 billion, and Eli Lilly's is $897.7 million. However, the LLM incorrectly reports AbbVie as $897.7 million and Eli Lilly as $196.0 million—swapping and misstating the figures. The final sum of $1,094 million is therefore incorrect; the correct combined value is $2,197.7 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: both input numbers are wrong, and the calculation, while arithmetically correct ($897.7M + $196.0M = $1,093.7M ≈ $1,094M), is based on incorrect data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model attempts to retrieve values for both companies and sum them—but fails due to incorrect entity-to-metric mapping. It appears to have confused which value belongs to which company, indicating a failure in entity-specific data retrieval. (4) Contextual relevance is high, as the answer addresses the right companies, time frame (December 31, 2024), and metric (net acquired IPR&D), and performs the correct type of aggregation.

      "original_answer": "LOW's Sales Return Reserve decreased from $234 million in 2022 to $191 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction in its estimated obligation for customer returns. Tesla, on the other hand, recognizes a Sales Return Reserve based on historical experience and expected future market values when offering resale value guarantees, indicating a proactive financial obligation tied to vehicle buyback programs. This reveals that while both companies account for potential returns, Tesla's reserve is tied to structured buyback guarantees, whereas LOW's reflects a declining historical trend.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla’s sales‑return reserve fell from $270 million in 2022 to $219 million in 2023 – a $51 million reduction (see Tesla Note 10, “Sales return reserve, current portion”)【page_75】.  Lowe’s sales‑return reserve also declined, dropping from $234 million in 2022 to $191 million in 2023 – a $43 million decrease (see Lowe’s “Sales return reserve” table)【page_49】.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative data for Tesla. According to the ground truth, Tesla's Sales Return Reserve based on resale value guarantees is not quantified as $270M in 2022 and $219M in 2023 — in fact, the original answer does not provide any specific dollar amounts for Tesla’s reserve. The LLM fabricated these numbers, which are not supported by the ground truth. Only LOW’s figures ($234M in 2022, $191M in 2023, $43M decrease) are correct and match the original answer. (2) Calculations for LOW are accurate: $234M to $191M is indeed a $43M decrease. However, Tesla’s claimed $51M reduction is invalid due to incorrect base numbers. The ground truth does not state that Tesla reduced its reserve or provide any numerical trend — it only explains the methodology (based on historical experience and expected future market values under resale guarantees). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Tesla’s reserve is tied to resale-value guarantees while LOW’s reflects general return expectations. This qualitative distinction aligns with the original answer. However, the comparison of changes in reserves between the two companies is flawed because it assumes Tesla had a comparable reserve change, which is not stated in the ground truth. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both companies, the concept of sales return reserves, and the nature of their obligations. But due to the invention of Tesla financials, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are severely penalized. While the structure and intent are appropriate, the core factual foundation for Tesla is incorrect, undermining the validity of the comparison.",

      "original_answer": "To evaluate the segment cost of sales reporting transparency and cost components of MDLZ and PEP, we begin with MDLZ's 2024 10-K filing, which explicitly reports segment cost of sales for Latin America at $3,230 million and North America at $6,491 million. These figures represent the direct costs associated with production and distribution in those regions. In contrast, PEP's 10-K provides a more granular definition of segment cost of sales, explicitly listing components such as raw materials, direct labor, plant overhead, purchasing and receiving costs, production planning, inspection costs, and raw materials handling facilities. PEP also clarifies that these costs exclude the impact of comparability items, which are managed centrally and reported in corporate unallocated expenses. By comparing these disclosures, it becomes evident that while MDLZ offers precise dollar amounts per region, PEP provides a more detailed breakdown of cost components, enhancing operational transparency. This contrast suggests that PEP's approach offers deeper insight into the structure of production costs, while MDLZ's reporting emphasizes geographic cost allocation.",
      "llm_answer": "MDLZ’s 10‑K only presents the total “segment cost of sales” for each geography – e.g., $3,230 million for Latin America and $6,491 million for North America – without breaking the line‑item into raw‑material, labor or overhead components (see MDLZ 2024 segment table, p. 119). In contrast, PepsiCo explicitly states that its segment cost of sales “includes raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, production‑planning, inspection and raw‑material‑handling costs” (see PepsiCo note 1, p. 69). Thus, PepsiCo’s disclosure is far more granular and transparent about the cost drivers, whereas Mondelēz provides only aggregate figures, limiting the analyst’s ability to assess underlying cost structure.",

In contrast, RTX explicitly identifies 'investments in and divestitures of businesses' as a principal factor in liquidity management, showing a strategic emphasis on divestitures to fund operating, investing, and financing activities.

The ground truth states AMGN's allowance was $32 million in 2021, but the LLM claims $26 million, which is incorrect. This leads to an erroneous net change for AMGN: the LLM reports a $2 million increase, but the correct net change is a $4 million decrease (from $32M to $28M). The combined net change is reported as a $70 million decrease, but the correct total is a $69 million decrease (ABT: -$72M; AMGN: -$4M). These calculation and data errors reduce quantitative accuracy. (2) The LLM incorrectly states Abbott's (ABT) 2021 provision as $6 million and 2022 as $26 million, but the original answer only specifies 2023 additions (e.g., $26M in 2023), so these yearly breakdowns are unsupported and likely hallucinated. Similarly, charge-offs of $57M in 2021 and $47M in 2022 for ABT are not in the ground truth, which only mentions $47M in 2023. For AMGN, the LLM claims no provisions in 2021–22 and deductions of $6M and $4M, but the ground truth does not provide data for those years—only that 2023 had a $6M addition and no write-offs. Thus, the year-by-year analysis is speculative. (3) Despite these inaccuracies, the LLM correctly identifies the overall direction of change: ABT's allowance decreased significantly, AMGN's changed slightly, and the combined trend is a large decrease. It also captures the qualitative difference in management patterns—ABT making consistent additions and large write-offs versus AMGN making minimal additions and no write-offs in 2023—though it overextends this with unsupported annual data. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and attempts a complete synthesis, but the incorrect numbers and fabricated yearly figures undermine factual reliability. Correctness score is 6 due to partially correct overall trend but major data inaccuracies; quantitative accuracy is low (5) due to wrong inputs and miscalculations; qualitative reasoning is fair (7) as the conceptual contrast is grasped; relevance is high (9) as all question parts are addressed appropriately in structure and intent.",

In contrast, TSLA's $197 million in 2028 operating lease receivables suggests it is primarily a lessor in this context, leasing out assets—likely manufacturing or logistics equipment. This contrast reflects fundamentally different asset utilization strategies: LOW is deploying capital by leasing assets to support its retail and operational footprint, while TSLA is generating revenue by leasing out assets it owns, potentially as part of its broader capital efficiency and asset-light initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "Lowe’s shows a $571 million 2028 operating‑lease payment commitment (future minimum lease payments for assets it will use)【page_57】, indicating that it relies heavily on leasing to acquire and operate its retail stores and equipment. Tesla, by contrast, reports $197 million of operating‑lease receivables due in 2028【page_80】, meaning it is the lessor and is generating cash flow from assets it has placed with customers (vehicles and solar systems). The opposite positions reveal Lowe’s asset‑intensive, lease‑backed expansion strategy versus Tesla’s asset‑light model that monetizes owned assets through leasing.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the key numbers: $571 million in operating lease payments for LOW and $197 million in operating lease receivables for TSLA in 2028, matching the ground truth exactly. These figures are accurately attributed to the correct companies and financial positions (lessee vs. lessor). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—both dollar amounts and the year 2028 are correct, with no calculation errors. Format variations (e.g., $571 million vs. $571M) are acceptable and do not affect correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that LOW, as a lessee, uses leasing to support its retail footprint (asset-intensive strategy), while TSLA, as a lessor, generates revenue from owned assets (asset-light strategy). The LLM adds contextual detail—mentioning vehicles and solar systems as likely leased assets—which is plausible and consistent with Tesla’s business model, though not explicitly in the ground truth. This addition does not introduce error but enhances explanation. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, capturing the core contrast in asset utilization strategies. One minor point preventing a perfect 10 is that the ground truth emphasizes TSLA’s leasing of manufacturing or logistics equipment, while the LLM focuses on vehicles and solar systems; this is a slight divergence in interpretation, but still within reasonable inference from public knowledge. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and fully relevant.",

It incorrectly assigns EMR's 2021 value ($513 million) to 2022 and EMR's 2022 value ($506 million) to 2021, reversing the years. Similarly, it swaps FDX's values, assigning $(1,638) million to 2022 and $(2,732) million to 2021, which is the reverse of the ground truth. This leads to incorrect combined totals: LLM reports $(2,226) million for 2022 (correct value should be $(2,219) million) and $(1,125) million for 2021 (correct value should be $(1,132) million). These errors stem from misattribution, not calculation mistakes—once the wrong inputs are used, the arithmetic follows correctly. (2) The comparison states 'about $1.1 billion more negative,' which is close to the correct difference of $1,087 million (~$1.1 billion), so the directional conclusion is approximately correct, but based on flawed inputs.

This results in a total of $42M + $3,504M + $484M = $3,891M. AIG's delinquencies are spread across multiple commercial real estate categories, indicating a diversified but small risk exposure.

According to the ground truth, AIG's >90 days delinquent commercial real estate loans are correctly reported at $42 million, which matches. However, COF's delinquent credit card loans are reported as $3,504 million in the ground truth, but the LLM states $3,718 million—this is a major discrepancy. Similarly, COF's consumer banking (auto) loans are $484 million in the truth, but LLM reports $561 million—another substantial error. The LLM's total of $4,279 million (COF) and combined $4.32 billion ($4,321 million) is therefore incorrect; the correct total is $3,891 million. These miscalculations severely undermine quantitative accuracy. (2) Calculations: Even if the LLM used its own numbers, $3,718M + $561M = $4,279M is correct, and $42M + $4,279M = $4,321M (~$4.32B) is arithmetically sound, but the input values themselves are factually wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that the answer requires summing delinquent loans across AIG and COF across specified portfolios, showing proper synthesis structure. However, due to incorrect source data, the reasoning leads to a false conclusion. (4) The qualitative assessment comparing COF’s larger consumer credit risk to AIG’s smaller commercial exposure is directionally reasonable, but the LLM fails to mention AIG’s diversified risk or COF’s concentration in credit cards—key insights in the original answer. Thus, while the general risk comparison is relevant, it lacks the nuanced, data-supported analysis in the ground truth.

The calculated difference of $16.44 billion matches the ground truth difference of $16,438 million (rounding to nearest $10 million). 2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent—values are correctly converted between million and billion formats, and the arithmetic is sound: $16,930M - $492M = $16,438M ≈ $16.44B. Minor rounding is acceptable and common in financial reporting. 3) The reasoning correctly identifies that FedEx’s much larger leasing obligations reflect its reliance on leased aircraft, facilities, and equipment for logistics operations, while Emerson’s smaller leasing footprint suggests a less capital-intensive strategy—this aligns with the ground truth interpretation. 4) The answer fully addresses both parts of the question: the quantitative difference and the strategic implication. Entities (FedEx, Emerson), metrics (operating lease liabilities, total lease liabilities), and context are accurate. The only minor limitation is that the LLM does not explicitly specify the fiscal year (2022) for Emerson, though it does for FedEx—but since the knowledge graph ground truth implies contemporaneous data and no contradiction exists, this does not detract significantly from accuracy.

While it correctly states AIG's delinquent loans as $42 million and AIG's loans in good standing as $3,783 million, it incorrectly reports COF's (Capital One) delinquent loans as $212 million instead of the correct $295 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $254 million instead of $337 million. The percentage calculation (6-7%) is based on the wrong total and thus also inaccurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the core financial figures—especially the COF delinquency value and the final sum—are incorrect. The calculation of $42M + $212M = $254M is mathematically correct, but the inputs are wrong. The correct sum should be $42M + $295M = $337M. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—multi-hop synthesis is attempted by combining data from AIG and COF and comparing the combined delinquent total to AIG’s good-standing loans—but it fails due to incorrect source data. The model identifies the correct entities and metrics, showing understanding of the required comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question: the combined delinquent value and the comparison to AIG’s performing loans.

      "original_answer": "Emerson Electric provided $2,922 million in cash from operating activities in 2022, while FedEx provided $9,832 million. This means FedEx provided $6,910 million more in cash from operating activities than Emerson. For Emerson, changes in operating working capital reduced cash provided by operating activities by $515 million in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson generated **$2.9 billion** of cash from operating activities in 2022, versus **$9.8 billion** for FedEx – a shortfall of roughly **$6.9 billion** (Emerson provided $6.9 billion less, not more).  \n\nIn Emerson’s cash‑flow statement, **changes in operating working capital were a net outflow of $515 million**, which lowered the cash provided by operating activities by that amount.",

The difference is accurately approximated as $6.9 billion (exact: $6,910 million). 2) All numbers are factually correct when accounting for rounding and format variations (e.g., $2.9 billion = $2,900 million, close to $2,922 million; $9.8 billion = $9,800 million, close to $9,832 million). The calculation of the difference (FedEx - Emerson) is correctly interpreted and presented as a $6.9 billion higher cash flow for FedEx, which aligns with the ground truth. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly compares two companies' cash flows from operating activities in 2022 and separately reports the impact of working capital changes on Emerson’s cash flow. It correctly clarifies that Emerson provided less cash, not more, addressing a potential misreading of the question. 4) The only minor issue is the slight rounding of Emerson’s and FedEx’s cash flows, which does not affect the overall correctness given standard reporting practices.

According to the ground truth, the combined decrease is $985 million, but the LLM calculates $1,692 million, which is significantly off. The individual decreases reported for MDLZ ($484M) and PEP ($1,208M) do not sum to the correct total, and more critically, these individual values are not consistent with the ground truth data. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports a $1,208 million decrease for PEP (from $9,761M to $8,553M), which is mathematically correct based on those inputs, and a $484M decrease for MDLZ (from $1,884M to $1,400M), also arithmetically correct. However, these starting and ending values do not align with the actual 10-K filings as reflected in the knowledge graph, meaning the underlying data is wrong. Since the question relies on accurate extraction from source documents, incorrect base figures invalidate the result. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model correctly identifies both companies, the relevant metric, and performs year-over-year subtraction and then summation. However, the synthesis is based on incorrect data, so the conclusion fails.

While it correctly identifies AIG's $42 million in commercial-mortgage loans >90 days delinquent, it incorrectly includes $181 million in commercial-and-industrial loans from COF, which are not commercial real estate loans. The COF filing reports $107 million in commercial-and-multifamily real estate loans >90 days delinquent, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the LLM erroneously adds this to the $181 million (non-real estate category), inflating COF's total to $288 million instead of correctly using only the $107 million. The final combined total is then miscalculated as $330 million instead of the correct $149 million. (2) Number verification: AIG's $42M is correct. COF's $107M is correct in ground truth and mentioned by LLM, but LLM fails to use it properly, instead summing unrelated categories. The $330M total is factually wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize only the relevant real estate loan categories across both companies. It conflates commercial real estate with commercial-and-industrial loans, which are distinct asset classes.

      "original_answer": "General Dynamics contributed $135 million in 2021, while the required contribution for 2022 was only $40 million, indicating a discretionary over-contribution of $95 million. This reflects a strategy of optimizing tax deductibility and contract recovery within its capital deployment framework. In contrast, Union Pacific follows a policy aligned with GAAP, where the funded status of the plans—measured as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets—determines the asset or liability recognition, suggesting a more regulatory and balance sheet-driven funding approach.",

These match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., 'about $95 million' is semantically equivalent to $95 million). 2) Quantitatively, all figures are accurate and the calculation (135 - 40 = 95) is correct. The use of 'approximately' for $40 million does not detract from accuracy, as the original does not specify precision. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer contrasts General Dynamics’ discretionary over-contribution strategy with Union Pacific’s GAAP-aligned, minimum-funding approach based on funded status. While the LLM does not explicitly define 'funded status' as the difference between PBO and plan assets (a minor omission), it correctly captures the essence of Union Pacific’s policy being driven by GAAP and funded status. 4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the quantitative difference and the strategic contrast. The only slight shortcoming is a less detailed explanation of Union Pacific’s GAAP-based recognition logic compared to the original, but the core reasoning is preserved.

      "original_answer": "Disney uses 'Ultimate Revenues' to determine the amortization of production costs for content monetized individually, applying the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues over a 10-year period for theatrical films and episodic series. In fiscal year 2022, Disney recognized $10,224 million in amortization of produced content costs, primarily in 'Cost of services'. AT&T also uses 'Ultimate Revenues' for amortization but applies it to both individual and group monetized content, with a similar 10-year estimation period. However, AT&T places greater emphasis on the fair value of programming and subscription revenue projections, especially for streaming and OTT services. The difference lies in Disney’s use of imputed license fees for DTC services and AT&T’s focus on network-level profitability and fair value assessments.",

      "original_answer": "Disney faces significant challenges in managing churn rates on its DTC platforms, particularly in response to price increases and economic downturns, which can reduce consumer willingness to pay for streaming services. In contrast, AT&T has successfully reduced churn by bundling services, with subscribers purchasing two or more services experiencing significantly lower churn than single-service subscribers. This comparison reveals that the streaming industry faces more price sensitivity and subscriber volatility due to a crowded market and economic pressures, whereas the telecom industry benefits from integrated service offerings that enhance customer retention. The competitive dynamics differ in that Disney must balance price increases with subscriber retention amid rising competition and economic uncertainty, while AT&T leverages its 5G network and bundled plans to maintain subscriber loyalty in a more mature, saturated market.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney warns that its direct‑to‑consumer streaming businesses are vulnerable to higher churn because price increases, an ad‑supported model and a broader economic slowdown are forcing it to “manage churn in reaction to price increases” and may even require lower prices to keep subscribers (DIS 2022 p. 29). In contrast, AT&T notes that “subscribers that purchase two or more services from us have significantly lower churn than subscribers that purchase only one service,” and that its bundled multi‑device and unlimited‑data plans have “higher retention and lower churn rates” (AT&T 2022 p. 42). This contrast shows that Disney’s streaming market is highly price‑sensitive and competitive, making churn a key risk, whereas AT&T’s telecom market can mitigate churn through bundled offerings that lock customers into multiple services.",

While it correctly reports KO's operating income decline of $1,319 million, it incorrectly states MDLZ's segment operating income growth as $90 million (ground truth: $3 million). This error stems from using total segment operating income change ($2,068M - $1,978M = $90M) rather than the actual reported growth figure that accounts for underlying factors. The net dollar difference is therefore miscalculated as $1,409 million instead of the correct $1,322 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the MDLZ growth number and final net difference are incorrect. The $90M figure may be arithmetically correct based on the reported totals, but it contradicts the ground truth that MDLZ's segment operating income grew by only $3M after adjusting for the mentioned headwinds. The model failed to extract the correct adjusted growth figure, indicating a misunderstanding of the financial context. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, the relevant financial metrics, and the impact of SG&A and currency effects.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase's Return on Common Equity (ROE) was 17%, significantly higher than AIG's ROE of 8.6%. This difference is primarily due to JPM's much higher net income of $49,552 million compared to AIG's net income of $3,614 million, as well as JPM's substantially larger average common shareholders' equity of $300,474 million versus AIG's $41,930 million. The ROE calculation (Net Income / Average Common Shareholders' Equity) highlights how JPM’s higher profitability relative to its equity base results in a stronger ROE performance.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 AIG reported a return on common equity of **8.6 %**, while JPMorgan Chase reported **17 %** – a gap of roughly **8.4 percentage points**.  AIG’s ROE was limited by a modest net income of **$3.6 billion** against an average common‑shareholders’ equity of **$41.9 billion**, whereas JPMorgan generated a much larger net income of **$49.6 billion** on a comparatively smaller equity base (≈$291 billion, implied by the 17 % ROE), giving it a substantially higher profitability ratio.  The contrast reflects AIG’s lower earnings (partly from net investment‑income losses and higher expense items) and a larger equity cushion, versus JPMorgan’s stronger earnings from higher revenues and tighter cost structure, which together drive the higher ROE.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies AIG's ROE as 8.6% and JPMorgan Chase's ROE as 17%, matching the ground truth. The net income figures are accurately represented: $3.6 billion for AIG (matches $3,614 million) and $49.6 billion for JPMorgan (matches $49,552 million, rounded appropriately). However, there is a minor inaccuracy in the implied average common shareholders' equity for JPMorgan: the LLM states it is '≈$291 billion', but the ground truth reports $300,474 million (~$300.5 billion). This discrepancy arises because 17% of $291 billion would imply a lower net income than reported; the correct equity base is ~$300.5 billion (since $49,552M / $300,474M ≈ 16.5%, which rounds to 17%). Thus, the equity figure is slightly off, though likely due to reverse-calculation from the ROE percentage. AIG's equity of $41.9 billion is correct (vs $41,930 million). (2) All key financial metrics and years are correct. The comparison of the 8.4 percentage point difference in ROE is accurate (17 - 8.6 = 8.4). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links ROE to net income and average common shareholders' equity, explains the relative performance, and adds contextual qualitative factors (e.g., investment losses, cost structure) that align with typical drivers of ROE differences, even if not explicitly detailed in the ground truth. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with only minor imprecision in the implied equity base for JPMorgan. The core facts, calculations, and synthesis are correct, warranting a high score. The slight quantitative deviation prevents a perfect 10, but overall accuracy and relevance are excellent.",

      "original_answer": "GD's ROIC declined from 14.0% in 2019 to 11.9% in 2021, indicating a downward trend in the efficiency of its capital investments over this period. In contrast, UNP emphasizes that ROIC is used as a key performance metric for evaluating long-term capital investments and is specifically incorporated into the determination of equity compensation for executives. This suggests UNP places increasing strategic importance on ROIC as a performance incentive, even as GD's ROIC has decreased over the same timeframe.",

However, the LLM states BKNG has $1,164 million and LOW has $152 million, summing to $1.32 billion—over double the correct amount. This indicates incorrect data retrieval for both companies. (2) For total operating lease liabilities, the LLM reports Booking Holdings at $2.23 billion and Lowe’s at $751 million, implying a difference of ~$1.48 billion. But the ground truth states the difference is $3,012 million (i.e., $3.012 billion), with LOW having higher total liabilities—directly contradicting the LLM’s claim that BKNG has higher total liabilities. Thus, both the individual values and the direction of the difference are wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the LLM attempts to compute the combined current liabilities and compare them to the difference in total liabilities—but because it uses incorrect base data, the synthesis fails. It also incorrectly concludes that the combined current liabilities are $160 million less than the gap in total liabilities, which is based on erroneous calculations.

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola reported a $1,319 million decrease in operating income in 2024, with higher SG&A expenses cited as a primary driver of the decline. This was compounded by other factors such as commodity costs, other operating charges, and foreign exchange impacts. In contrast, Mondelez listed higher SG&A expenses as one of several cost pressures, including costs from the Simplify to Grow Program, remeasurement losses, manufacturing costs, and an intangible asset impairment charge from 2023. While both companies experienced SG&A increases, Coca-Cola specifically emphasized SG&A as a key contributor to declining operating income, whereas for Mondelez it was part of a broader set of cost challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca‑Cola said that higher selling, general and administrative expenses – driven by heavier marketing and e‑commerce spending, talent‑acquisition costs and inflation‑related wage pressures – were a key factor in its 2024 operating‑income decline of $1.3 billion and the fall in consolidated operating margin from 24.7 % in 2023 to 21.2 % in 2024.  \n\nMondelez International also recorded higher SG&A in 2024, mainly from the “Simplify to Grow” transformation program and related administrative costs, but the filing does not list those expenses as a primary driver of its operating‑performance results, suggesting the SG&A increase had a comparatively modest effect on its 2024 earnings.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: Coca-Cola's $1.3 billion (i.e., $1,319 million) decrease in operating income is accurately reported, and the operating margin decline from 24.7% to 21.2% is consistent with the expected level of detail. The format variation ($1.3 billion vs $1,319 million) is acceptable. (2) The LLM correctly identifies SG&A as a key driver for Coca-Cola’s operating income decline, citing specific pressures like marketing, e-commerce, talent acquisition, and wage inflation—details not in the ground truth but plausible elaborations that do not contradict it. (3) For Mondelez, the LLM correctly notes higher SG&A due to the 'Simplify to Grow' program and related administrative costs, and crucially observes that SG&A was not cited as a primary driver of performance issues—this matches the ground truth where SG&A was one of several factors including remeasurement losses and impairment charges. (4) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts the relative impact of SG&A between the two companies—central for Coca-Cola, more peripheral for Mondelez—demonstrating proper multi-hop synthesis. (5) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits mention of Mondelez’s 2023 intangible asset impairment and foreign exchange impacts noted in the ground truth, but since the question focuses on 2024 and SG&A's role, this omission does not undermine the core accuracy.

      "original_answer": "Apple explicitly states that as a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, a stronger U.S. dollar could negatively affect its net sales and gross margins when expressed in U.S. dollars due to competitive pressures in local markets. This exposes Apple to foreign exchange risk that could directly compress gross margins unless mitigated through pricing adjustments or hedging strategies. In contrast, Intel includes gross margin projections as part of its forward-looking statements, indicating that it actively manages and guides expectations around gross margins through strategic initiatives, manufacturing expansion, and internal/external production planning. While Apple focuses on hedging and risk management to counter external currency pressures, Intel emphasizes proactive business and manufacturing strategies to influence gross margin outcomes directly. Together, these approaches highlight how two technology companies address gross margin stability through different lenses: Apple by mitigating external financial risks and Intel by shaping internal operational and strategic levers.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple notes that because it is “a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar,” a strengthening dollar “will negatively affect the Company’s net sales and gross margins” and it relies on forward‑currency hedges for only part of its exposure, showing that protecting profitability in a global market is largely a matter of managing foreign‑exchange risk (Apple 10‑K Item 7, p. 29). Intel’s 10‑K forward‑looking statements, by contrast, tie its gross‑margin outlook to the “execution of our strategy and manufacturing expansion plans, cost‑control and product‑mix initiatives,” indicating that the company seeks to preserve margins by actively shaping operations and investments rather than by currency‑risk mitigation (Intel 10‑K Forward‑Looking Statements, p. 3).",

The non-current operating lease liability for Netflix is reported as $2,047 million (acceptable rounding of $2,046,801 thousand), which is accurate. For Verizon, both the non-current operating lease liabilities ($20,002 million) and total assets ($380,255 million) are correct, and the calculated 5.3% is accurate.

      "original_answer": "Apple faces a direct negative impact on gross margins due to foreign exchange risk, as a stronger U.S. dollar reduces its net sales and gross margins when expressed in USD. In contrast, Intel expects gross margins to be impacted by strategic investments in manufacturing capacity and process technology under its IDM 2.0 strategy, forecasting non-GAAP gross margins between 51% and 53% over the next several years. While Apple's financial planning must account for FX volatility through hedging instruments and pricing adjustments, Intel's planning focuses on absorbing upfront costs of long-term strategic investments that are expected to drive future revenue growth and margin improvement. This contrast highlights differing financial risk profiles: Apple managing external market volatility versus Intel managing internal strategic investment impacts.",

However, the ground truth states that Intel forecasts non-GAAP gross margins between 51% and 53% under IDM 2.0, while the LLM claims Intel 'provides no specific margin-percentage outlook,' which is incorrect. This is a significant omission and factual error, as Intel did provide a forward-looking margin range in its disclosures related to IDM 2.0. (2) The $1 billion VaR figure is accurate and properly attributed. But the absence of Intel’s 51–53% gross margin guidance — a key quantitative element in the ground truth — undermines the quantitative accuracy.

The absence of a specific number in the LLM response is not an error, as the focus is on the methodological difference. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that AIG adjusts its ROCE by excluding unrealized gains/losses on available-for-sale (AFS) securities, particularly those flowing through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), which matches the ground truth. It also accurately states that JPMorgan’s reported ROCE (or ROTCE) does not remove these effects, making its equity base sensitive to market fluctuations. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in accounting treatment between AIG and JPMorgan, links this to the impact on the ROCE metric, and concludes that direct comparison is misleading—this is logically consistent with the original answer. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention JPM’s 17% ROE figure from the original answer, which slightly reduces completeness, but since the question focuses on comparability due to treatment differences rather than the exact value, this omission does not undermine the core correctness. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent or near-equivalent. All entities (AIG, JPMorgan Chase, ROCE, AFS securities, AOCI) are correctly identified and contextualized for 2023.

The combined effect is calculated as 11% + 0.8% = 11.8%, which aligns with the original answer's statement that the combined impact contributed 11.8 percentage points to the financial performance challenges.

The LLM correctly treats the 0.8 as percentage points (not percent of percent), and the addition is mathematically sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model synthesizes FX impacts across two companies (KO and MDLZ), correctly attributes the Turkish lira’s role within broader currency movements, and aggregates the effects appropriately. However, the original answer specifies that the combined 11.8 percentage points refers to the contribution to 'financial performance challenges'—a slightly broader context than 'total change in operating income for the two companies', which the LLM interprets narrowly. This is a minor over-simplification but does not distort the core fact. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both companies, the specific FX movement (Turkish lira vs. USD), and the combined impact. The only minor gap is that the original answer notes the Turkish lira was 'among others' for both firms, while the LLM slightly overemphasizes the Turkish lira as the primary driver, though it does mention 'other currencies' for KO.

      "original_answer": "The rising interest rate environment in 2023 positively impacted AIG's fixed and fixed index annuity sales due to a strong partnership with Blackstone, although it also led to an increase in surrenders as policyholders sought better returns elsewhere. AIG noted that fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods generally in the five-to-ten-year range, and older contracts with higher minimum interest rates contributed to better-than-expected persistency. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase reported a $15.1 billion noninterest revenue, which included higher commissions on annuity sales in its Banking & Wealth Management segment, driven by the impact of First Republic and strong market levels. This indicates that both companies benefited from the rising rate environment, with AIG experiencing increased annuity sales despite higher surrender risks, and JPM seeing higher annuity-related fee income.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 rise in benchmark rates gave AIG a “strong tailwind” for new fixed‑ and fixed‑index annuity business, but the same higher rates also spurred a noticeable uptick in policy‑holder surrenders, especially as contracts with lower guaranteed rates moved out of their surrender‑charge periods (AIG 2023 Form 10‑K, “Annuity Sales and Surrenders”). By contrast, JPMorgan Chase reported that the higher‑rate environment lifted its annuity‑related commissions, which helped lift non‑interest revenue a few percent year‑over‑year (JPM 2023 Form 10‑K, “Noninterest revenue…higher commissions on annuity sales in BWM”).",

It correctly notes AIG's mention of surrender charge periods (implied five-to-ten years) and persistency dynamics. The comparison to JPMorgan Chase is qualitatively accurate: higher rates boosted annuity-related commissions, contributing to noninterest revenue growth in its Banking & Wealth Management (BWM) segment. However, the LLM answer omits the specific dollar amount of JPMorgan's noninterest revenue ($15.1 billion) and does not mention the contribution from First Republic, which is a key multi-hop detail in the ground truth. While the phrase 'lift non-interest revenue a few percent year-over-year' is plausible, it lacks precision and is not directly supported by the original answer, which emphasizes the absolute revenue figure and acquisition impact rather than a percentage change. These omissions affect completeness and quantitative accuracy but do not invalidate the overall reasoning. The entities (AIG, JPMorgan Chase), time period (2023), and financial concepts (surrenders, commissions, noninterest revenue) are correctly identified and contextually relevant.

However, the LLM incorrectly states the difference between the combined Neuromodulation revenue and MDT's Neuroscience segment revenue as $6.3 billion, when it should be $2,268 million ($8.784B - $2.516B = $6.268B difference — but the ground truth says the combined is $2,268M *less*, implying a comparison where $2.516B is $2.268B less than $8.784B, which is factually correct). The LLM misrepresents the magnitude of the difference by stating '$6.3 billion less', which is the actual difference, but the original answer frames it as '$2,268 million less' — a correct value. The LLM's phrasing confuses the direction of comparison: it says the combined sales are $6.3B less than MDT's Neuroscience revenue, which is numerically accurate (~$6.268B), but then adds 'about 28% of', implying the combined value is 28% of MDT's total, which is correct (~28.6%), but this was not asked. The core error is in the framing of the comparison: the original answer emphasizes that the combined Neuromodulation revenue is $2,268M less than MDT's Neuroscience revenue — a correct and precise statement. The LLM instead reports the full difference as $6.3B, which is approximately correct but uses a larger number that misaligns with the expected framing. (2) Calculations: Sum ($781M + $1,735M = $2,516M) is correct. Difference ($8,784M - $2,516M = $6,268M) is ~$6.3B — LLM is approximately correct here, but the original answer states the combined is '$2,268 million less', which only makes sense if there's a data discrepancy or mislabeling — however, based on provided ground truth, $8,784M - $2,516M = $6,268M, so stating '$2,268 million less' appears to be an error in the ground truth or a misinterpretation. Upon re-evaluation: if the original answer says the combined is $2,516M and that this is $2,268M *less* than MDT's $8,784M, then $8,784M - $2,268M = $6,516M — which contradicts. Therefore, the original answer contains a calculation error: $8,784M - $2,516M = $6,268M, not $2,268M. Given this, the LLM’s '$6.3 billion less' is actually more accurate than the provided 'ground truth'. This suggests the ground truth may have an error. Assuming the ground truth is authoritative despite this inconsistency, the LLM is penalized for deviating from it. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: LLM correctly pulls Neuromodulation revenues from both companies, sums them, retrieves MDT’s Neuroscience revenue, and compares — sound reasoning. (4) Scores justified: Correctness 6 due to conflict between accurate calculation and deviation from stated ground truth; Quantitative 5 because while numbers are accurate, the comparison framing diverges; Qualitative 7 for solid reasoning and entity accuracy; Contextual 9 for full relevance and addressing all parts.",

MDLZ, on the other hand, reported that unfavorable currency translation decreased its net revenues by $1,096 million, with the Argentinean peso cited as a primary contributor. While KO quantifies the impact as a 11% decrease in operating income, MDLZ provides a direct dollar amount of $1,096 million lost due to currency effects, which includes the peso’s weakness against the stronger U.S. dollar.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca‑Cola reported that a stronger U.S. dollar versus currencies such as the Argentine peso cut its consolidated operating income by roughly 11 percent in 2024. Mondelez disclosed that the same dollar‑strength effect lowered its net revenue by about $1.1 billion (the primary “currency” head‑wind) for the year.  Thus, the dollar’s strength reduced KO’s operating profit by a double‑digit percentage, while it shaved roughly $1 billion off MDLZ’s total revenue.",

(1) Quantitatively, the 11% decrease in KO's operating income is correctly reported. MDLZ's $1,096 million revenue impact is rounded to '$1.1 billion', which is acceptable and common in financial reporting; this minor rounding does not affect factual correctness. (2) The answer addresses both parts of the multi-hop question: the impact on KO's operating income and MDLZ's net revenue, correctly attributing the Argentine peso as a key contributor in both cases. (3) Entities are accurate—KO (Coca-Cola) and MDLZ (Mondelez), 2024 time frame, and correct financial metrics (operating income for KO, net revenue for MDLZ). (4) The reasoning is sound: it compares percentage-based impact (KO) versus dollar-based impact (MDLZ), highlighting the different reporting styles while correctly attributing the cause to the strong U.S. dollar. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention that the Argentine peso was 'cited as a primary contributor' for MDLZ, though the phrase 'primary currency head-wind' effectively captures this.

The combined total is reported as $4.65 billion, which is a rounded but acceptable representation of the exact sum ($4,649,312,000). However, the LLM makes a critical error in the denominator for Verizon's total operating lease obligations: it uses $24.27 billion instead of the correct $44.7 billion (sum of $24.7B + $20.0B as per the original answer). This leads to an incorrect percentage of 17.6% instead of the correct 17.7%. While 17.6% may appear close, the error stems from using an incorrect total liability figure, indicating a failure in multi-hop synthesis (VZ has two components to its total lease obligations, which the LLM missed). (2) Calculations: NFLX’s percentage is correct: $383.3M / $2.43B ≈ 15.8%. VZ’s calculation is flawed: $4.27B / $24.27B ≈ 17.6%, but the correct total obligation is $44.7B, so $4.27B / $44.7B ≈ 9.55%, though the original answer states 17.7%, implying the $4.3B current portion is 17.7% of $24.7B (non-current) + $20.0B (another component) = $44.7B. The LLM likely misidentified the total obligation amount. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly pulls individual current liabilities and performs the NFLX percentage correctly. However, it fails to fully synthesize VZ’s total lease obligations from multiple components, leading to an incorrect base for percentage calculation. This is a significant multi-hop error. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 7 due to accurate current liability figures and correct NFLX percentage, but major error in VZ’s total obligation. Quantitative accuracy is 7 due to mostly correct numbers but one critical denominator error. Qualitative accuracy is 8 because reasoning is sound except for incomplete entity synthesis.

The combined total of $19 billion matches the ground truth of $19.0 billion (minor rounding difference: $19B vs $19.0B is semantically equivalent).

According to the ground truth, the combined basic EPS for AIG and American Express for 2024 is $12.32. However, the LLM reports AIG's EPS as $14.04 and American Express's as $2.21, leading to a calculated sum of $16.25, which does not match the ground truth. These individual EPS figures are incorrect, and the sum is therefore also wrong. (2) The calculation itself (adding $14.04 and $2.21 to get $16.25) is mathematically correct, but since the input numbers are inaccurate, the result is invalid. The correct individual EPS values should have been AIG: $10.11 and American Express: $2.21 (or similar, depending on actual data), summing to $12.32. The LLM's values do not align with the knowledge graph source.

The operating cash flow for General Dynamics is correctly stated as $4.112 billion, and the repurchase as a percentage of operating cash flow is approximately correct at 36% (actual: 36.4%).

(2) For NFLX, the LLM reports a combined Federal provision of $441.4 million (current $854.2M + deferred -$412.8M), which may be arithmetically correct based on its inputs, but these inputs do not align with the ground truth data. Similarly, VZ’s Federal total is reported as $3,869 million, which is much higher than implied by the ground truth (where Federal portion is 67.2% of total tax provision). The LLM states VZ’s total tax provision is $4,892 million, but this is inconsistent with the implied total from the ground truth (since $3,286M combined Federal includes VZ’s share, and NFLX’s total tax provision was $797.4M in LLM output, suggesting VZ’s Federal portion alone cannot exceed ~$2.8B).

These match the ground truth values of $1,655,945 thousand and $2,837,000 thousand respectively (with $1,655.9 million = $1,655,900 thousand, a negligible rounding difference of $45 thousand). The sum is reported as approximately $4,493 million, which is equivalent to $4,493,000 thousand—very close to the exact ground truth sum of $4,492,945 thousand. The minor rounding is acceptable under format variation rules.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent: both input values are correct within acceptable rounding, and the final sum is accurately approximated. The calculation $1,655.9M + $2,837M = $4,492.9M ≈ $4,493M is mathematically sound and correctly formatted.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is correctly synthesized across two companies and their respective fiscal years. The model identifies the correct metric (customer-related intangible assets), extracts values from each company’s filing, and combines them appropriately. The only minor shortcoming is not explicitly showing the full precision of ACN’s value (e.g., $1,655,945 thousand), but using a rounded $1,655.9 million is acceptable and common in financial reporting.\n\n4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing the combined net carrying amount for both companies as of their respective fiscal year-ends. The use of 'approximately $4,493 million' and 'about $4.5 billion' provides helpful context without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this is a highly accurate and well-reasoned response with only negligible rounding differences.",

The answer correctly notes that AT&T does not provide a specific quantified amount for expected reclassification, aligning with the ground truth's 'indeterminate amount'. The combined impact is correctly stated as approximately $731 million, which is semantically accurate since no additional amount can be determined for AT&T. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both companies and the total impact as required by the multi-part question. (3) Entities are correctly identified: Google (with ticker GOOGL) and AT&T, both referenced with correct 2024 filing context and appropriate financial instruments (foreign currency cash flow hedges for Google, cross-currency swaps for AT&T). (4) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across both 10-K filings, recognizes that AT&T’s disclosure lacks a specific reclassification figure despite discussing offsetting effects, and avoids inventing a number. The conclusion that the total impact is approximately $731 million is logically and factually justified. (5) Semantic equivalence is maintained: while the LLM uses 'earnings' instead of 'revenues', this is acceptable as reclassification from AOCI into earnings can flow through revenues depending on the hedge, and the core financial impact is correctly characterized.

However, the LLM misrepresents the key non-GAAP adjustments. For Medtronic, it mentions 'certain tax adjustments, net (9)' as the main driver, but omits the two most significant adjustments listed in the original answer: amortization of intangible assets (15.0%) and restructuring and associated costs (21.5%), which are quantitatively more impactful than the tax adjustment. For Pfizer, the LLM incorrectly states a 'income-tax provision – non-GAAP items' of $2.25 billion, which is not in the original answer; instead, the ground truth specifies restructuring and acquisition-related items totaling $1.2 billion, broken into $785M integration costs, $190M transaction costs, and $125M employee termination charges. The $2.25B figure appears fabricated or misattributed. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: tax rates and the difference are accurate, but the $910 million tax benefit for Medtronic is mentioned correctly (though labeled as 'net (9)' confusingly), while Pfizer’s $2.25B figure is incorrect.

      "question": "How do McDonald's and Starbucks each incorporate occupancy costs into their respective financial structures, and what does this reveal about their differing approaches to managing leased properties?",
      "original_answer": "McDonald's incorporates occupancy costs primarily through its lessee role in a significant real estate portfolio, where it often owns the building but leases the land. These occupancy costs, such as property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance, are generally paid by franchisees for franchised locations, which make up the majority of McDonald's restaurants. This indicates a strategy where the financial burden of occupancy costs is largely shifted to franchisees, allowing McDonald's to maintain a more asset-light model. In contrast, Starbucks directly incorporates occupancy costs into its store operating expenses for company-operated locations, reflecting a more direct financial responsibility for these costs. This reveals that McDonald's leverages its franchise model to outsource occupancy-related financial obligations, while Starbucks assumes these costs as part of its operational expenditures, highlighting a more vertically integrated approach to property management.",
      "llm_answer": "McDonald’s records occupancy costs primarily within its lease accounting – the right‑of‑use asset and lease liability capture the present value of lease payments for the restaurants it actually leases, while the property‑tax, insurance and maintenance costs for the overwhelming majority of its franchised locations are passed to franchisees and therefore do not appear as McDonald’s operating expense. Starbucks, on the other hand, does not separate lease components; it treats occupancy costs as ordinary operating expenses that are included in product‑and‑distribution costs, store‑operating expenses and corporate G&A. This contrast shows McDonald’s off‑loads most occupancy risk to franchisees, whereas Starbucks retains the cost of its leased stores on its income statement, reflecting a more direct‑expense approach to managing leased properties.",

(1) It correctly identifies that McDonald's generally does not bear occupancy costs for franchised locations—these are passed to franchisees—and accounts for leased properties using right-of-use assets and lease liabilities under lease accounting standards. This aligns with McDonald's asset-light, franchise-driven model. Starbucks, in contrast, includes occupancy costs (like rent, property taxes, insurance, maintenance) directly in operating expenses such as store operating expenses and G&A, which reflects its company-operated, vertically integrated approach. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense, but all qualitative financial treatments are correctly described. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing two companies' treatment of occupancy costs across their financial structures and inferring strategic differences in property management—is sound and well-synthesized. The LLM correctly links accounting treatment to business model differences. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to slightly less clarity on McDonald's dual role as land lessee and building owner in many cases (mentioned in ground truth but not in LLM answer), which adds nuance to its real estate strategy.

      "original_answer": "Emerson (EMR) experienced potential net earnings impacts due to its use of derivatives, particularly when hedges were not fully effective at offsetting changes in underlying hedged items, such as foreign currency exposures and commodity-based manufacturing costs. This lack of perfect offsetting could directly affect earnings volatility. In contrast, FedEx (FDX) reported net earnings allocable to common shares of $3,819 million in fiscal 2022, which reflects the outcome of its overall risk exposure and earnings management strategies, including those that may have influenced earnings per share. The difference in financial outcomes highlights how EMR's derivative-related earnings volatility contrasts with FDX's reported net earnings, which were influenced by both operational performance and share dilution effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s 2022 filing shows that it uses derivative contracts—cash‑flow hedges for foreign‑currency exposure and non‑designated hedges for commodity‑price risk—to offset the economic impact of those variables; the effective portion of the hedge is recorded in other‑comprehensive income and only the ineffective portion flows through earnings, limiting the volatility of net earnings. In contrast, FedEx’s 2022 results report a steep earnings decline (net earnings fell to $3.8 billion, or $14.54 per share, from $5.2 billion the prior year), reflecting the company’s exposure to factors such as pension‑plan investment losses, higher discount rates and tax‑position adjustments that were not fully insulated by its risk‑management actions, and thus translated directly into lower reported earnings.",

It also correctly references FedEx's net earnings decline in fiscal 2022. However, the LLM states FedEx's net earnings as $3.8 billion, while the ground truth specifies $3,819 million ($3.819 billion), which is a minor rounding but acceptable; more critically, the LLM introduces a prior-year figure ($5.2 billion) and attributes the decline to pension losses, higher discount rates, and tax adjustments—details not present in the original answer and unsupported by the provided ground truth. These additions, while plausible, are extraneous and not verifiable from the source, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The $3.8 billion vs. $3,819 million is a minor discrepancy (within rounding tolerance), but the inclusion of unverified prior-year data and causal factors (pension, tax) constitutes factual overreach. The original answer does not mention year-over-year changes or specific risk factors for FedEx, only reporting the absolute net earnings figure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: it contrasts EMR’s risk management (hedging) with FDX’s earnings outcome, linking hedging design and accounting to earnings volatility. However, the LLM infers risk-management shortcomings at FedEx based on earnings decline, while the ground truth makes no such evaluative claim—only stating the net earnings figure and noting it reflects overall risk exposure and earnings management, including share dilution. This over-interpretation weakens qualitative accuracy.

However, it failed to compute TGT's revenue per square foot, claiming that Target's 2024 net sales were not provided. According to the ground truth, this information must have been available in the underlying data (as the correct answer was derived), but the LLM incorrectly concluded it was missing. This led to an incomplete and incorrect final answer. (2) The calculation for WMT is quantitatively accurate: $114,641 million / 274 million sq ft ≈ $418.40. TGT’s total retail square footage was correctly identified as 245.9 million sq ft (from 245,939 thousand sq ft). However, the LLM did not use or report TGT’s revenue, nor compute its revenue per square foot, which is required. The difference of $47.75 per square foot was not calculated due to this omission. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed at a critical step: the model needed to extract TGT’s 2024 net sales (implied to exist in the knowledge graph) and divide by its square footage. Instead, it prematurely concluded the data was unavailable, breaking the synthesis chain. This reflects a failure in qualitative reasoning despite correct identification of inputs. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response directly addresses the question structure and uses correct entities (TGT, WMT, 2024, retail square footage).

The 2023 combined outflow is stated as $3.64 billion, matching the ground truth of $3,642 million. The year-over-year decrease is reported as roughly $1.7 billion, which is a reasonable rounding of the actual $1,696 million difference. However, there is a critical error in the 2023 breakdown: the LLM claims AIG spent $2.07 billion and Amex $1.57 billion in 2023, but the ground truth does not support AIG having a $2.07 billion outflow in 2023. In fact, the original answer implies AIG’s 2023 outflow must have been $3,642M - $1,570M = $2,072M, which may be numerically consistent but is not explicitly verified in the knowledge graph and introduces unsupported component values. The 2024 individual outflows ($353M for AIG, $1,593M for Amex) sum to $1,946M, which is correct. (2) Calculations: The 2024 sum is accurate ($353M + $1,593M = $1,946M). The 2023 total is correctly stated as $3.64B, but the individual components attributed to each company in 2023 are not confirmed by the ground truth and appear to be reverse-engineered without explicit support, making them potentially misleading. The year-over-year difference is correctly approximated at $1.7B.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar adjusts residual values for operating leases by prospectively changing depreciation expense on a straight-line basis, while for finance leases, residual value adjustments reduce finance revenue over the remaining lease term. FedEx, on the other hand, evaluates salvage values as part of depreciation for long-lived assets like aircraft, adjusting estimated service lives or residual values based on usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors. This means Caterpillar’s adjustments directly affect either depreciation or revenue depending on lease type, whereas FedEx’s changes impact the depreciation schedule of capital assets over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar explicitly revises the estimated end‑of‑term value of equipment it leases. If the lease is classified as an operating lease, any change in the residual estimate is reflected prospectively by adjusting the depreciation expense on the underlying asset; if the lease is a finance (sales‑type or direct‑finance) lease, the change is booked as a reduction of finance‑lease revenue over the remaining lease term. FedEx’s leases are primarily operating leases in which the residual‑value risk stays with the lessor, and the company records lease expense (right‑of‑use asset amortization) without making separate residual‑value adjustments to depreciation or revenue.",

While it correctly notes that FedEx's leases are primarily operating leases and that it records lease expense via right-of-use asset amortization, it fails to mention that FedEx adjusts the estimated service lives and residual values of its long-lived assets (like aircraft) based on usage, maintenance costs, and economic factors—adjustments that impact depreciation schedules. The ground truth emphasizes this active reassessment of salvage values as part of depreciation, which the LLM omits. This is a significant qualitative difference in how FedEx manages asset valuation, even if not tied to lease-type classifications. There are no numerical inaccuracies (hence perfect quantitative score), and the response is highly relevant to the question. The reasoning is sound but lacks full synthesis on FedEx’s side, missing a key multi-hop element: that FedEx does make residual/salvage value adjustments, just not in the context of lease classification but rather in the broader context of long-lived asset management.

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: MDT's 'Other Investing Activities, Net' is correctly reported as $4 million (inflow), and PFE's as $(179) million (outflow), with total net cash used in investing activities of $(3,493) million for MDT and $(32,278) million for PFE. The percentages calculated (~0.1% for MDT, ~0.5% for PFE) are approximately correct and reasonably rounded.

(3) Entities are correctly identified—Medtronic (MDT) and Pfizer (PFE)—and the fiscal year 2023 is accurately referenced. (4) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly interprets the relative scale of the 'Other Investing Activities' line within total investing cash flows, concluding immateriality for MDT and a small but more noticeable impact for PFE, which aligns with the ground truth. The semantic meaning, factual accuracy, and multi-hop synthesis (comparing two companies, two metrics, and assessing relative significance) are all preserved.

      "original_answer": "McDonald's reported a 2% increase in consolidated revenues to $25.9 billion in 2024, emphasizing growth in constant currencies and the impact of restructuring charges and international market performance. In contrast, Starbucks' 10-K detailed its revenue recognition policy, specifying that consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations, discounts, returns, allowances, and sales incentives such as coupon redemptions and rebates. While McDonald's focused on the quantitative growth and external factors affecting its revenue, Starbucks emphasized the methodological and accounting aspects of revenue recognition, including how it accounts for transactions with licensees and internal adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "McDonald’s 2024 filing reports revenue growth simply as a 2 % increase to $25.9 billion and explains that its consolidated revenues are the cash‑basis sales of company‑owned restaurants plus franchise fees (royalties, rent and initial fees) that are recognized when the underlying sales occur or over the franchise term, with inter‑company eliminations applied. Starbucks’ 2024 disclosure, by contrast, states that consolidated revenues are presented net of inter‑company eliminations and are recorded net of discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, with company‑operated store sales recognized at the point‑of‑sale when payment is received. Thus, McDonald’s emphasizes cash‑receipt timing for franchise and company sales, while Starbucks emphasizes net‑of‑intercompany and incentive adjustments and point‑of‑sale recognition.",

All numeric values (percentages, dollar amounts) are correct and properly attributed to the right company and year. (2) However, the LLM introduces details not present in the original answer, such as specifying that McDonald’s recognizes franchise fees 'over the franchise term' and describing its revenue as 'cash-basis sales'—these specifics are not in the ground truth and may not be verifiable from the knowledge graph. Similarly, the mention of 'cash-receipt timing' and 'point-of-sale recognition' for Starbucks goes beyond the original answer, which focused on net presentation adjustments rather than timing or method of recognition. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts McDonald’s focus on growth metrics with Starbucks’ focus on revenue recognition methodology. However, it mischaracterizes the nature of the difference—ground truth emphasizes McDonald’s discussion of external factors (currency, restructuring, international performance), while the LLM shifts focus to accounting timing, which is not the primary contrast in the original.

      "original_answer": "Emerson Electric (EMR) reported an expected life of 5.1 years for its stock options in 2022, while FedEx (FDX) estimated the expected life based on actual exercise history and noted that options have a maximum term of 10 years. Since FDX examines actual exercise behavior to determine expected life and uses a period equal to that expected life for calculating volatility, a longer expected life (up to 10 years) would lead to a longer historical period being used for volatility estimation. In contrast, EMR’s shorter expected life of 5.1 years would result in a shorter historical period being used for volatility, potentially leading to different volatility inputs in their financial models and, consequently, different option valuations.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s 2022 option data show an average remaining contractual term of **about 2.2 years** (page 73), whereas FedEx assumes an **expected life of 6.4 years** for its options (page 98). The much shorter life for Emerson implies that its holders tend to exercise or forfeit options relatively quickly, while FedEx’s longer life suggests employees keep options outstanding for a longer period. Because each company’s Black‑Scholes model uses a volatility input measured over a period equal to the expected life, Emerson will base its volatility estimate on a much shorter historical window than FedEx, which will use a longer window that generally captures more price fluctuation.",

It states Emerson Electric's expected life as 'about 2.2 years' when the ground truth is 5.1 years. It claims FedEx's expected life is 6.4 years, but the original answer states that FDX does not use a fixed expected life and instead bases it on actual exercise history with a maximum term of 10 years—no specific number like 6.4 is reported. These numbers are not only incorrect but misrepresent the data sources (e.g., citing page numbers not in the knowledge graph). (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: both companies' expected life figures are wrong, and the comparison is built on false premises. The calculation logic (linking expected life to volatility period) is sound, but it's applied to incorrect inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially correct—the model understands that expected life influences the historical period for volatility estimation in the Black-Scholes model, which aligns with the original answer. However, because the underlying facts are wrong, the conclusion about Emerson using a 'much shorter window' is based on a false 2.2 vs 6.4 comparison rather than the actual 5.1 vs up to 10 years. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses the right concepts (exercise behavior, volatility window, Black-Scholes) and attempts the correct synthesis, but the factual foundation is flawed.

These figures are accurately derived from the respective 10-K filings and calculations are correct. (2) The dollar amounts are presented with proper formatting variations (e.g., $820 million vs $820 million), which is acceptable. The MSFT increase is correctly calculated from $20,117 million to $21,825 million, resulting in a $1,708 million increase—this matches the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (ACN and MSFT) across the same time period (2021 to 2022) and correctly compares the dollar increases. It goes beyond the original answer by computing the difference between the two increases ($1,708M - $820M = $888M), which is a valid and insightful addition, though not requested. (4) The only minor deviation from the original answer is that the LLM does not explicitly state the combined increase of $2,528 million, which was included in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "Lowe's faces direct labor cost pressures in a competitive U.S. labor market, where it must attract and retain associates with expanded skill sets amid low unemployment and increasing wage rates. This affects its ability to maintain service quality and execute omnichannel strategies, as noted in its 2024 10-K filing. Nike, on the other hand, is exposed to wage rate fluctuations and labor standards in international markets where its contract manufacturers operate. These external wage pressures influence Nike's manufacturing and sourcing costs, as well as its ability to maintain production timelines and cost controls. While both companies face wage-related challenges, Lowe's labor issues are internal and operational, directly affecting its U.S. retail strategy, whereas Nike's are external and supply chain-based, affecting product availability and cost of goods sold. The two companies must strategize differently—Lowe's through workforce development and retention, Nike through supplier management and sourcing diversification.",
      "llm_answer": "Lowe’s cost outlook is driven mainly by the **U.S.‑based, competitive labor market for store associates** – rising minimum‑wage and benefit requirements increase its payroll expense and force the retailer to seek efficiency gains, tighter staffing controls and pricing discipline in its omnichannel store network (LOW 10‑K p.12). In contrast, Nike’s exposure is to **wage and labor‑standard changes at overseas contract factories**, where unexpected wage hikes or new regulations raise manufacturing costs and may compel the company to relocate production, adjust its supply‑chain footprint, or absorb higher costs in product pricing (NIKE 10‑K p.22). Thus, Lowe’s strategy is shaped by domestic labor‑cost pressure on store operations, while Nike’s strategy is shaped by external wage dynamics in its global manufacturing base.",

Nike’s exposure to overseas wage dynamics and labor standards in contract manufacturing is also accurately described, with correct implications for supply chain, production costs, and sourcing strategy. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in either answer that require verification; thus, quantitative accuracy is not applicable but assumed correct as no numbers were presented.

In contrast, American Express continues to recognize interest income on loans held for sale until they are sold, as reflected in its calculation of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.

The 2023 combined total is reported as $109.4 billion, aligning with the ground truth $109,413 million (rounded). The increase is stated as 'about $8.9 billion', which closely matches the exact $8,965 million ($8.965 billion) difference—minor rounding is acceptable.

Lease‑adjusted NOPAT is derived from net earnings + net interest expense + operating‑lease interest + provision for income taxes, less an income‑tax adjustment; the denominator (“average debt and shareholders’ deficit”) averages current‑year and prior‑year debt (including current maturities, short‑term borrowings and operating‑lease liabilities) and shareholders’ deficit【page_30】【page_31】.  \n\n**Nike (NKE)** – ROIC is calculated as **earnings before interest and after taxes (EBIAT)** divided by **total invested capital**.

According to the original answer (ground truth), NKE does **not** specify a detailed formula for ROIC and does **not** disclose components such as EBIAT or invested capital. Instead, NKE only states that ROIC is a performance measure used by management without providing a reconciliation or formula.

The quantitative elements for LOW are consistent with the ground truth, though no actual numerical values are involved. The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model incorrectly assumes NKE provides a formula when it does not, leading to a false comparison.

It incorrectly states that Lockheed Martin (LMT) reclassified $723 million and Union Pacific (UNP) reclassified $1,796 million in 2021, when the ground truth is $1,787 million from LMT and $723 million from UNP. This swaps the values between the two companies and introduces a calculation error (UNP's actual 2021 amount is $723M, not $1,796M). The combined total is stated as 'about $2.52 billion', which is close to the correct $2,511 million, but this proximity is due to incorrect inputs and thus not reliable. For 2020, the LLM claims a combined total of $211 million, but the correct total is $677 million ($440M from LMT and -$233M from UNP). The LLM incorrectly assigns a -$233 million reversal to LMT when it was actually UNP that had the negative amount. (2) Calculations are flawed: the correct 2021 total is $2,511M, the correct 2020 total is $677M, making the year-over-year increase $1,834M. The LLM reports an increase of 'roughly $2.3 billion', which is significantly overstated. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is unsound: the model fails to correctly attribute data to the right companies across years, leading to incorrect synthesis. It misaligns entities (LMT vs UNP) and years (2020 vs 2021), undermining the comparative analysis. (4) Despite these major quantitative and qualitative errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right question, discusses AOCI reclassifications for defined benefit plans by LMT and UNP, and attempts a year-over-year comparison—hence a moderate score for contextual relevance. However, the factual inaccuracies severely limit usefulness, warranting a low correctness score.",

According to the ground truth, LOW's online sales positively impacted comparable sales by 50 basis points in fiscal 2024, but the LLM claims Lowe’s 'does not note any comparable-sales boost' and implies no positive impact or negligible contribution—this contradicts the original answer. For NKE, the ground truth states an 8% decline in digital sales, but the LLM reports a 5% decline, which is quantitatively incorrect. (2) The numbers are not accurate: 50 bps positive impact for LOW is omitted entirely in the LLM response, and NKE's digital sales decline is reported as ~5% instead of 8%. The resulting performance difference of 58 bps (50 bps positive vs 80 bps negative = 130 bps total gap, but framed as 58 bps in the original answer likely due to different framing) cannot be correctly derived from the LLM's numbers. Even under lenient interpretation, the LLM fails to compute or mention this differential. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks for a comparison of the impact of online sales on comp sales and the resulting difference in digital sales performance. The LLM fails to recognize that LOW had a measurable positive impact (50 bps), misrepresents NKE’s digital decline (5% vs 8%), and does not synthesize the two figures into a comparative performance difference. It also incorrectly infers that lack of explicit mention in Lowe’s filing implies no impact, when the ground truth affirms a 50 bps boost. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses both companies and the topic of digital sales impact on comp sales—but due to major factual and quantitative errors, the overall correctness score is low.

TGT operated 245,939 million square feet as of February 3, 2024, while WMT reported 699 million square feet as of January 31, 2024. This large disparity indicates that WMT maintains a significantly larger retail footprint, but TGT has increased its retail square feet slightly from 244,584 million to 245,939 million, whereas WMT has reduced its retail square feet from 702 million in the prior year to 699 million, suggesting contrasting strategies in store expansion or contraction.",

According to the ground truth, WMT reported 699 million square feet (not 1,053 million), and TGT reported 245,939 million square feet (which is 245.939 million, so this part is approximately correct). The claimed difference of 807 million sq ft is incorrect; the actual difference is 453,061 million sq ft, which suggests a massive error in WMT's reported square footage. The LLM inflates WMT's retail space by over 50%, leading to a completely inaccurate comparison. (2) Calculations are therefore invalid: the difference of 807 million sq ft is wrong, and the claim that Walmart’s footprint is 4 times larger is misleading when the true ratio is closer to 2.8 times (699M / 245.9M ≈ 2.84). Additionally, the prior-year figures cited for WMT (1,060M in 2022) and Target (244.6M) do not match the ground truth (WMT: 702M in prior year, Target: 244,584 million). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to compare trends in expansion/contraction and references both companies’ recent and prior-year data—but it does so using fabricated or incorrect data. The conclusion that WMT is slightly contracting and TGT expanding aligns with the ground truth directionally, but the magnitude and basis are flawed.

In contrast, NVIDIA discloses that it amortizes completed IPR&D assets over periods ranging from one to twenty years, using a method that reflects the pattern of economic benefits unless that pattern cannot be reliably determined, in which case a straight-line method is used.

This is explicitly stated in Disney's 10-K, which notes that declines in traditional forms of distribution have led to higher costs being allocated to DTC offerings. Meanwhile, Meta's advertising business is affected by changes in feed display and ranking algorithms that reduce time spent and user engagement, which in turn lowers advertising effectiveness and revenue. The 10-K explicitly states that these algorithmic changes have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the distribution of content by publishers and marketers, lowering their incentive to invest in Meta's platform. Both companies report that these content distribution challenges directly affect their financial performance: Disney through increased costs and reduced profitability in its DTC segment, and Meta through lower ad targeting capabilities and reduced engagement metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "- Disney 2023: The filing explains that the shift away from “traditional” distribution channels (linear TV, affiliate fees and home‑entertainment sales) forces Disney to allocate a larger share of content‑costs to its streaming services and to forgo revenue that those channels would have generated.  Because those higher content costs are not offset by the lost traditional revenue, the company states that “declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings” (DIS 10‑K p. 20).  \n\n- Meta 2023: Meta’s 10‑K links the profitability of its advertising business to its ability to use third‑party data signals for ad targeting and measurement.  It notes that “changes to the regulatory environment, third‑party mobile operating systems and browsers… have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads… which will adversely affect our advertising revenue” (META 10‑K p. 20‑21).

(1) For Disney, it accurately cites the shift from traditional distribution increasing content cost allocation to DTC, directly quoting the 10-K and correctly attributing the negative impact on profitability. This aligns with the ground truth. (2) For Meta, the LLM correctly identifies reduced ad targeting due to data signal limitations (iOS, cookies, regulations) as a challenge, which is a real issue in the 10-K. However, the ground truth emphasizes algorithmic changes in feed display and ranking that reduce content distribution and user engagement, which in turn reduce advertiser incentive. The LLM shifts focus to data privacy and targeting limitations, which are related but distinct mechanisms. While both affect ad revenue, the LLM does not explicitly mention the feed algorithm changes or reduced time spent/engagement as the primary content distribution challenge, which is central to the original answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially correct: it connects Meta’s external constraints to ad revenue impact, but fails to synthesize the specific link between content distribution (via algorithmic feed changes) and advertiser behavior as described in the ground truth. (4) No numbers or dates are incorrect—both companies and years are accurate, and no calculations are involved.

(3) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: the answer correctly contrasts UNP’s balance sheet treatment of retiree benefits as a deferred tax asset (impacting financial statements directly) with LMT’s exclusion of retiree benefits from segment operating profit, aligning with management’s performance evaluation practices. (4) The qualitative interpretation is semantically equivalent to the original answer—both explain that UNP reflects changes in tax benefits on the balance sheet while LMT excludes retiree benefits from segment-level metrics, reporting them only at the consolidated level. The LLM captures all parts of the multi-part question, including the numerical change, the accounting policy difference, and the broader implication about financial reporting treatment.

      "original_answer": "The difference in pension expense treatment under FAS and CAS standards leads to a divergence in cost recognition patterns between financial reporting and government contract pricing. LMT reports a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million in 2021, which reflects the difference between CAS expenses (used in pricing contracts) and FAS service costs (used in GAAP financial reporting). RTX explains that CAS pension expense includes service cost and amortization of demographic or economic variances, and is only recognized for unfunded plans, whereas FAS pension expense includes service cost and is generally recognized for all plans. This implies that both companies must reconcile these differences to recover pension costs through U.S. government contracts, with RTX noting that changes in plan funding status can directly affect CAS expense and thus the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.",
      "llm_answer": "The two companies record pension and post‑retirement‑benefit costs under the government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which recognize expense only for under‑funded plans, whereas U.S. GAAP (FAS) requires the full service‑cost component to be reported. Because CAS expense is usually larger than the FAS service‑cost component, the gap is shown as a “FAS/CAS operating adjustment.” Lockheed Martin’s 2021 filing shows a $1.96 billion positive adjustment (2020 $1.88 billion), meaning its CAS pension cost exceeds the FAS service‑cost amount and is being recovered through the pricing of its U.S. government contracts. Raytheon’s 10‑K makes the same disclosure – its segment results include CAS pension/PRB expense and the adjustment reflects the difference from FAS – indicating that it also recovers those CAS‑based pension costs via contract pricing, with any positive adjustment (the exact dollar amount is not shown in the excerpt) serving the same purpose.",

The dollar amounts match the original answer in substance, with acceptable format variation (e.g., $1.96 billion = $1,960 million).

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) experienced structural refranchising activities in Asia Pacific during 2024, including the refranchising of bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023, and in territories in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines in early 2024. These refranchisings were included as structural changes in the analysis of net operating revenues and impacted the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. KO distinguishes between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume, noting that structural changes typically do not affect consolidated unit case volume, which reflects all sales of Company beverage products regardless of ownership interest in the bottling partner. In contrast, Altria (MO) incorporates volume growth rates as a key assumption in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the NJOY transaction, particularly for future growth opportunities in the e-vapor category. MO used an income approach with Level 3 fair value inputs, including discounted cash flow analyses based on volume growth projections and operating margins, and amortizes these intangible assets over approximately 18 years. This reflects a forward-looking financial valuation approach, whereas KO’s use of volume growth is operational and tied to current structural changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca‑Cola treats the 2024 refranchising of bottling operations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and selected Indian territories as a “structural change.” The change is reflected in the volume metrics – Bottling‑Investments unit‑case volume fell 23 % (the decline is attributed to those refranchisings), while the broader Asia‑Pacific system still posted only a 1 % increase in unit‑case volume for the year. Altria, on the other hand, does not adjust reported sales volume; instead it builds its own projected volume‑growth rates into the discounted‑cash‑flow models used to value the intangible assets (and goodwill) acquired in the NJOY e‑vapor transaction.",

However, there are key inaccuracies in quantitative details. The claim that Bottling Investments unit-case volume fell 23% due to refranchising is not supported in the original answer—this specific percentage is absent from the ground truth, making it an unsupported addition. Similarly, the 1% increase in Asia-Pacific unit-case volume is not mentioned in the original, so its inclusion introduces unverified data. (2) Dates are partially incorrect: the original specifies Vietnam refranchising in January 2023 and India, Bangladesh, and Philippines in early 2024, but the LLM omits Vietnam and implies all occurred in 2024, missing the multi-year aspect. (3) The qualitative reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly identifies that KO’s refranchising affects segment reporting and unit-case volume metrics structurally, while Altria uses projected volume growth in DCF models for intangible asset valuation, particularly for NJOY’s e-vapor assets. It correctly notes Altria’s use of Level 3 inputs and amortization over ~18 years is missing, but the core idea of forward-looking assumptions is conveyed.

      "original_answer": "Disney faces potential monetary fines from FCC violations related to its television broadcasting operations, which include the licensing of stations that must be renewed every up to eight years. Non-renewal or revocation of these licenses due to violations could result in significant financial penalties and operational disruptions. Meta, on the other hand, is subject to substantial monetary remedies from non-compliance with its FTC consent order and other global privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. The FTC has already initiated proceedings seeking significant modifications to the consent order, including restrictions on data usage and potential board changes, which could lead to costly compliance adjustments and monetary penalties. While both companies face exposure to regulatory fines, Meta's liabilities appear broader and more complex due to the global nature of its regulatory obligations and the potential for sweeping operational changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney’s FCC exposure is described mainly in qualitative terms – violations could trigger “substantial monetary fines” (e.g., > $400 k per indecent utterance per station) and the possible loss or non‑renewal of broadcast licences. Meta’s filing likewise flags “significant monetary fines” and costly compliance obligations arising from the FTC consent order and other privacy‑law actions, but it does not disclose a specific dollar figure. Consequently, Disney’s FCC risk is limited to station‑level penalties that are modest on a company‑wide basis, whereas Meta faces broader regulatory liabilities that could result in larger, though also unspecified, monetary penalties and ongoing compliance costs.",

The original answer does not provide exact dollar amounts, so while the $400k figure may be factually plausible, its inclusion introduces a level of quantitative specificity not supported by the ground truth, slightly reducing quantitative accuracy. The LLM correctly notes that Meta faces significant but unspecified monetary fines and compliance costs from the FTC and global privacy laws, matching the original answer’s emphasis on the breadth and complexity of Meta’s liabilities. The reasoning is sound: it synthesizes the nature of regulatory exposure for both companies and correctly concludes that Meta’s liabilities are broader and potentially more impactful, even if not quantified. The multi-hop logic—comparing sector-specific (broadcasting) vs. global, data-driven regulatory risks—is valid and contextually appropriate.

It incorrectly states that General Motors had 52 thousand forfeited units at $205.94 per unit, totaling $10.7 million, but the ground truth shows GM had a total forfeited value of $98.685 million with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $36.55 per unit. Conversely, for Lowe's, the LLM claims 183 thousand forfeited units at $197.42 per share totaling $36.1 million, but the correct value is $10.708 million with an average grant-date fair value of $205.94 per unit. Thus, the LLM swapped and distorted key figures. (2) Calculations are incorrect: 52,000 × $205.94 = ~$10.7 million matches the LLM’s GM number, but this is factually wrong because GM’s actual per-unit value is $36.55, not $205.94. For Lowe’s, 183,000 × $197.42 ≈ $36.1 million is internally consistent but contradicts the ground truth of $10.708 million and $205.94 per unit. The total combined value in the LLM answer is ~$46.8 million, whereas the correct total is $109.393 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly attributes higher per-unit value to GM ($205.94) when in fact it is Lowe’s ($205.94), reversing the comparison. The explanation about GM using performance-share awards with Monte Carlo simulations may be contextually plausible, but it is based on incorrect data and misattribution. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to address both parts of the question—total dollar value and interpretation of equity strategy—but fails on factual accuracy and logical reasoning due to swapped entities and numbers.

The segment operating profits ($7.38B for LMT, $6.05B for RTX) and consolidated operating profits ($9.12B for LMT, $4.96B for RTX) are accurate and consistent with the original answer. The calculation for LMT is correct: $7.38B + $1.96B = $9.34B, but the reported consolidated profit is $9.12B, which implies other minor reconciling items not emphasized—this is acceptable as the original answer also states the adjustment is added to segment profit to reach consolidated profit, without claiming it is the only reconciling item.

However, it correctly reports the outcome without implying the adjustment alone determines the final profit, so this omission is not critical. The explanation of the mechanism is slightly more detailed than the original, adding value.\n\nOverall, the answer is semantically equivalent, quantitatively accurate, and contextually appropriate, with only a minor gap in completeness regarding RTX's downward reconciling items.

Upon verification, the ground truth says MO reduced obligations by $111M (from $119M to $128M), which is mathematically incorrect (that’s an $9M increase). The LLM likely caught this inconsistency and reported the correct direction (increase of $9M), but then concluded KO had the larger net reduction, which is correct if MO’s obligations increased. 2) All numbers are factually accurate as presented in filings; the $4.5 billion difference is a rounded version of $4,542 million and acceptable. The obligation changes are correctly computed based on stated values. 3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies and performs comparative analysis. The confusion stems from an error in the ground truth statement about MO’s 'reduction' despite an increase in obligations. The LLM appears more factually consistent than the ground truth on this point. 4) Despite the contradiction in the original answer, the LLM provides a logically coherent and numerically accurate response. It correctly identifies KO as having the larger net reduction because MO’s obligations increased. The minor deduction is due to not explicitly flagging the contradiction in the ground truth, but the answer itself is more accurate. Thus, high scores are warranted, with a slight reduction in qualitative accuracy due to incomplete clarification of the MO obligation change direction versus the erroneous claim in the original answer.",

According to the ground truth, AVGO's deferred tax liabilities increased from $5,030 million to $5,117 million (an increase of $87 million), not decreased from $1,294 million to $785 million as claimed. Similarly, CSCO's deferred tax liabilities decreased slightly from $3,106 million to $3,101 million, not from $134 million to $55 million. The LLM uses completely wrong base figures, leading to a false conclusion of a $588 million decrease instead of the correct net change of $0 million. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent but based on incorrect data: -$509M + -$79M = -$588M is mathematically correct, but irrelevant due to wrong inputs. The actual change for AVGO is +$87M and for CSCO is -$5M, resulting in a net increase of $82M, but the ground truth states the combined increase is $0M, implying either rounding or updated data; regardless, the LLM’s figures are orders of magnitude off. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM attempts to retrieve data for both companies and sum the changes—but fails due to incorrect entity-to-data mapping. It likely confused deferred tax liabilities with other line items or pulled data from incorrect tables or footnotes. (4) Scores are low because the core financial data is wildly inaccurate, undermining correctness and quantitative accuracy. Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right concept (change in deferred tax liabilities over time for AVGO and CSCO) and performs the right type of analysis (year-over-year difference and summation), but with invalid data.",

      "original_answer": "Gilead Sciences (GILD) faces civil monetary penalties due to potential non-compliance with FDA regulations, particularly in manufacturing and post-approval requirements, which could lead to product recalls, suspension of approvals, and reputational damage. These penalties are tied to operational risks such as product quality failures and remediation costs. In contrast, Eli Lilly (LLY) faces civil monetary penalties stemming from non-compliance with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly its new manufacturer discount program under Medicare Part D, which begins in 2025. The IRA-mandated penalties could significantly affect LLY’s revenue, especially for products like Jardiance, which is subject to a 66% discount under the government price-setting mechanism starting in 2026. While both companies face civil monetary penalties, GILD’s exposure is rooted in regulatory compliance and product safety, whereas LLY’s is tied to legislative reforms impacting pricing and reimbursement, with direct financial consequences from mandated discounts and rebate obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead’s 10‑K notes that failure to meet FDA‑imposed manufacturing, safety‑reporting or 340B‑program rules could trigger “significant civil monetary penalties, fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls or seizures,” tying the penalty risk primarily to compliance‑related enforcement actions that could increase litigation costs and disrupt supply but do not directly alter product pricing. Eli Lilly’s filing, by contrast, links civil monetary penalties to the Inflation Reduction Act – which mandates government‑set Medicare prices and rebate obligations for covered drugs – so non‑compliance with the IRA’s pricing‑reporting and discount rules could result in statutory fines that directly erode revenue and heighten pricing‑and‑reimbursement risk.",

This matches the original answer’s emphasis on operational and regulatory compliance risks. For Eli Lilly (LLY), the LLM correctly links penalties to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly its impact on Medicare pricing and rebate obligations, which is consistent with the ground truth. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or percentages explicitly mentioned in either the original or LLM answer that conflict—though the original mentions a '66% discount' starting in 2026 for Jardiance under IRA, this specific figure is omitted in the LLM response. However, the LLM still accurately captures the essence of IRA’s financial impact through 'government-set Medicare prices' and 'rebate obligations'. This omission is minor and does not undermine the core accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly differentiates between GILD’s product-safety/compliance-based risk profile and LLY’s legislation-driven pricing/revenue risk, synthesizing regulatory vs. legislative sources of penalties across two companies. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the financial and regulatory risk profiles and identifying the contributing regulatory actions (FDA enforcement) and legislative provisions (IRA). The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the absence of the specific 66% discount and 2026 timeline for Jardiance, which adds granularity present in the original.

The ground truth states a $1,100 million increase, but the LLM reports a $646 million increase, which is incorrect. The LLM provides specific figures ($30.893 billion to $31.539 billion), and the difference between these numbers is indeed approximately $646 million, suggesting internal consistency in calculation but a mismatch with the ground truth data. This indicates either incorrect source data or misidentification of the relevant revenue line item.

      "original_answer": "GE's Renewable Energy segment saw a positive revenue mix effect, particularly from increased demand in Onshore Wind projects in the U.S. and a significant $2 gigawatt HVDC systems agreement in Grid Solutions, which contributed to a $5.7 billion (22%) increase in segment revenues.

The ground truth states that GE's Renewable Energy revenue increased by $5.7 billion (22%), but the LLM claims a $2.1 billion (16%) increase, which is significantly lower and incorrect. Additionally, the LLM reports Grid Solutions revenue rising to $3.9 billion from $3.1 billion and Onshore Wind revenue near $8.4 billion, none of which are supported by the original answer — the original does not provide specific revenue figures for these sub-segments, only citing a $2 gigawatt HVDC agreement as a contributor. The LLM also introduces a segment loss reduction of $0.8 billion (36%), which is not mentioned or inferable from the ground truth. (2) These numerical discrepancies severely impact quantitative accuracy. While the mention of a 'significant $2 gigawatt HVDC systems agreement' is consistent, the LLM fabricates precise revenue values and growth percentages not present in the original, and the calculated $2.1 billion increase does not align with the actual $5.7 billion increase. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning structure is sound: the LLM correctly identifies a positive mix shift at GE (Onshore Wind and Grid Solutions) versus negative mix effects at Union Pacific (Bulk and Industrial), and correctly attributes Union Pacific's issues to lower-margin food/refrigerated and rock shipments.

According to the ground truth, the FAS/CAS adjustment increased by $75 million for LMT and $690 million for RTX, totaling $765 million. However, the LLM reports a $84 million increase for LMT and $690 million for RTX, resulting in a combined $774 million increase. The RTX figure is correct, but LMT's increase is incorrect ($84M vs $75M), leading to an inaccurate total ($774M vs $765M). Additionally, the LLM cites specific values for LMT in 2020 and 2021 ($1,876M and $1,960M), but the ground truth does not provide these absolute values—only the year-over-year change—so their inclusion introduces unverified data. (2) The calculation of the combined increase is mathematically correct based on the LLM's numbers (84 + 690 = 774), but since the inputs are partially wrong, the result is misleading. (3) The reasoning is logically structured and attempts proper multi-hop synthesis by aggregating changes across two companies and linking them to operating profit impacts. It correctly identifies that the adjustment affects operating profit and attempts to attribute portions of profit growth to the adjustment. However, the ground truth only mentions that the increase positively impacted operating profits and highlights the Raytheon merger as a key driver for RTX—information the LLM omits. Instead, the LLM fabricates specific operating profit increase attributions (e.g., $84M of LMT’s $479M increase), which are not in the original answer and cannot be verified. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question (total increase and impact on operating profit) and focuses on the correct entities (LMT, RTX) and year (2021 vs 2020). However, the qualitative accuracy is reduced due to unsupported numerical claims and missing key explanatory context (e.g., the Raytheon merger).

WMT also assesses realizability of deferred tax assets by analyzing future taxable income sources, including the reversal of taxable temporary differences, and holds $32.4 billion in net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, some of which will expire if unused. Therefore, the reversal of taxable temporary differences plays a key role in both companies' determination of whether deferred tax benefits will be realized, with WMT's large carryforwards and KO's indefinite reinvestment strategy both influencing the need for valuation allowances.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Coca‑Cola (KO)** – The company treats the excess book‑tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries as an “indefinite‑reversal” item because it plans to keep undistributed earnings abroad indefinitely. Consequently, it does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for those temporary differences and, when it evaluates the realizability of its deferred‑tax assets, it relies only on the expected reversal of other taxable temporary differences; this approach generally eliminates the need for a valuation allowance.  \n\n- **Walmart (WMT)** – Walmart’s ability to realize its deferred‑tax assets is judged on the basis of projected future taxable income, which includes the expected reversal of taxable temporary differences together with its $32.4 billion of net operating‑loss and capital‑loss carryforwards.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer connects the reversal of taxable temporary differences to the evaluation of deferred tax asset realizability for both companies, incorporates KO’s indefinite reinvestment policy, and integrates WMT’s carryforwards and valuation allowance—synthesizing cross-entity, cross-concept financial logic. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer emphasizes that reversal of temporary differences is a 'key role' for both firms, while the LLM slightly downplays this commonality by focusing more on differences in approach. However, the core reasoning and factual content are semantically equivalent and complete. Thus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, with full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

According to the ground truth, Broadcom's (AVGO) revenue from contracts with customers in fiscal year 2022 under ASC 606 was $22,164 million ($22.164 billion), but the LLM incorrectly states it as $33.2 billion. Similarly, Cisco's (CSCO) total product and service revenue for the period ending July 30, 2022, was $23,264 million ($23.264 billion), but the LLM reports $51.6 billion—more than double the correct amount. The final combined total is therefore also incorrect: the LLM calculates $84.8 billion, whereas the correct sum is $45,428 million ($45.428 billion). (2) All key numerical values are wrong, including both individual company revenues and the final total. Calculations based on incorrect inputs cannot be considered accurate, even if the arithmetic were correct (which it is not: $33.2B + $51.6B = $84.8B is arithmetically correct, but based on false data). (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is superficially sound—retrieving revenue figures for two companies and summing them—but fails at execution because the underlying data is incorrect. The model does not demonstrate accurate synthesis from reliable sources aligned with the knowledge graph. (4) Due to severe quantitative errors and failure to report correct financial figures, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the model understands the task structure (identify revenues, align with ASC 606, sum totals), but still low due to incorrect entity data.

      "original_answer": "GE manages uncertainty in estimating future costs for long-term service agreements under ASC 606, using the percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs. This involves significant judgment in estimating future utilization, overhaul timing, and cost changes, with audit procedures including retrospective reviews and specialist evaluations. GE also follows ASU 2018-12 (LDTI) for future policy benefits, which requires current assumptions on long-duration contracts, including $26,832 million in long-term care liabilities. UNP, on the other hand, accounts for personal injury liabilities under FELA, recording accruals at the low end of a probable range when outcomes are uncertain, with a disclosed range of $383 million to $494 million. Both companies emphasize the need for extensive judgment, sensitivity analysis, and audit involvement to address the financial reporting implications of these uncertain future costs.",
      "llm_answer": "- General Electric says that because the cost to fulfil its 10‑ to 25‑year service contracts must be projected far into the future, the amount of revenue it can recognise is highly judgment‑driven.  The company therefore discloses that revenue is recognised on a percentage‑of‑completion basis using the “total‑estimated‑costs” methodology required by ASC 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers) and explains that the estimates are tested against historic experience, market data and specialist engineering studies.  \n\n- Union Pacific notes that the ultimate settlement of its Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) personal‑injury claims is uncertain, so it records a liability at the low‑end of the $383 million‑$494 million range and continuously reviews the estimate.  This disclosure follows the ASC 450 loss‑contingency guidance that a loss is accrued when it is probable and reasonably estimable, and that the low‑end of an equally‑likely range is used as the best estimate.",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $383 million to $494 million range is correctly cited, and no other numerical values (e.g., GE’s $26,832 million long-term care liability) are inaccurately stated—though this specific figure is omitted, it was not required for addressing the core question about service agreements and personal injury liabilities. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer correctly distinguishes between GE’s revenue recognition for long-term service agreements and UNP’s loss contingency treatment for personal injury claims, referencing the appropriate standards (ASC 606 and ASC 450). (4) The only minor omission is GE’s reference to ASU 2018-12 (LDTI) and its application to long-duration insurance contracts, which adds context but is not central to the question about service agreements.

      "original_answer": "Gilead Sciences capitalized and treated acquired IPR&D projects as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which led to a significant $800 million impairment charge in 2019 when the value of projects related to the treatment of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma declined due to changes in market opportunities. In contrast, Abbott Laboratories generally expensed IPR&D costs as incurred unless the project had an alternative future use. This reveals that Gilead took on more financial risk by capitalizing IPR&D, exposing it to potential impairment charges, whereas Abbott's approach resulted in more immediate expense recognition and lower long-term asset exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead’s 2019 filing shows that it **capitalized the acquired IPR & D projects as intangible assets and then recorded an $800 million impairment** when the expected market opportunity fell short, indicating a strategy of front‑loading the cost of early‑stage research and later writing it down if the outlook changes【GILD page 48】.  \nAbbott, by contrast, **expenses the initial costs of IPR & D rights unless the project has an alternative future use, and only capitalizes IPR & D acquired in a business combination as indefinite‑life intangibles that are tested for impairment**【ABT page 51】, and it notes that such assets are subject to annual impairment testing【ABT page 50】.  \n\nThe difference reveals that Gilead is willing to carry large early‑stage research investments on the balance sheet and absorb sizable impairment charges, while Abbott adopts a more conservative, expense‑as‑incurred approach that limits balance‑sheet exposure and emphasizes cash‑flow discipline for early‑stage research.",

The contrast in financial strategies—Gilead’s riskier capitalization approach versus Abbott’s conservative expensing—is correctly interpreted.

The use of specific document references (e.g., GILD page 48, ABT pages 50–51) supports the accuracy.

According to the ground truth, MS uses an equity correlation range of 25% to 97% with a weighted average of 49%.

Bank of America (BAC) values are correctly reported as 5% to 97% with a weighted average of 25%, matching the ground truth. (2) The calculation and comparison of averages and ranges are therefore flawed—MS’s actual average (49%) is less than the 67% claimed, and the lower bound is 25%, not 0%, which materially affects the interpretation. The claim of a 'wider... range' at MS is misleading because both firms have similar upper bounds (97% vs 99%), but the LLM incorrectly implies MS includes zero correlation scenarios, which is not supported by the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in linking higher correlation assumptions to greater sensitivity to market co-movement risk, and the multi-hop synthesis between BAC and MS is attempted.

The LLM's math is correct (68.6 + 11.7 = 80.3), so the error may lie in the original answer. The operating margin for McDonald's (45%) and Amazon's growth rate (from $36.9B to $68.6B) are correctly cited. The growth rate is calculated as ≈86%, which is accurate (rounded from 85.9%), while the ground truth reports 85% — a negligible difference due to rounding.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is high: all input numbers match the ground truth. The only issue is the combined total: LLM reports $80.3B (correct sum), but ground truth says $79.3B — a $1B discrepancy unexplained by rounding. This could be a data error in the ground truth or a misattribution, but since the LLM’s arithmetic is correct, this is not a calculation error on their part. The ≈86% growth rate is more precise than the ground truth’s 85%, making the LLM technically more accurate.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two companies, computes a total, calculates a growth rate, and makes a valid comparison between MCD's margin and AMZN's growth. All entities (AMZN, MCD, 2024, operating income, operating margin) are correctly identified and used.\n\n4) Semantic equivalence is strong. The LLM conveys the same core information with slightly better precision in the growth rate and correct arithmetic. The $1B difference in the combined total is concerning but likely stems from a source data inconsistency rather than model error. Given that both component values are correct and the model’s sum is mathematically accurate, the correctness score is reduced only slightly due to the mismatch with the provided ground truth.",

In contrast, while AMD discloses its policy to record ROU assets and lease liabilities for both operating and finance leases, it does not provide specific dollar amounts for its ROU assets in the provided excerpt. This reveals that Apple offers greater quantitative transparency regarding its lease obligations, whereas AMD's disclosure is primarily qualitative and policy-focused. The difference highlights varying levels of detail in lease accounting disclosures between the two companies, which could impact investor understanding of their balance sheet strength and lease-related risks.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s 2022 filing includes a detailed schedule that separates right‑of‑use assets and lease liabilities by lease type – operating‑lease ROU assets of $10.4 billion (recorded in “Other non‑current assets”) and finance‑lease ROU assets of $0.95 billion (included in property, plant and equipment) – and even shows the related liability maturities and the deferred‑tax liability arising from those assets. AMD’s 2022 filing, by contrast, only provides a narrative description of its lease policy (e.g., operating and finance leases are recorded as ROU assets and liabilities, finance leases are immaterial, short‑term leases are excluded) without presenting any dollar amounts for the assets or liabilities. This contrast shows Apple’s lease accounting is far more granular and transparent, whereas AMD’s disclosure is limited to qualitative policy statements, offering far less visibility into the size of its lease positions.",

AMD is accurately described as providing only qualitative policy disclosures without specific dollar amounts. (2) All numeric values are correct and properly rounded: $10.4 billion = $10,400 million (close to $10,417M, acceptable rounding), $0.95 billion = $950 million (very close to $952M, minor rounding difference but within tolerance). No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across Apple and AMD’s 2022 filings, compares quantitative vs. qualitative disclosure practices, and draws a valid conclusion about transparency differences. It adds contextual detail (e.g., balance sheet classification, tax implications, immateriality of finance leases at AMD) that enriches the answer without contradicting the ground truth. (4) The answer is highly factually accurate, complete, and relevant. The slight deduction in qualitative accuracy (9 instead of 10) is due to the LLM adding details not present in the ground truth (e.g., balance sheet line items, deferred tax liability), which, while plausible and consistent, were not confirmed in the knowledge graph.

MRK’s total is implied to be $17.5 billion (since $700M is ~4% of $17.5B), which may align approximately, but this is not confirmed in the original answer.

In contrast, RTX excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment when reporting organic changes in operating profit for year-over-year comparability, treating it as a non-recurring, non-operational item to provide transparency into the underlying performance of the business.

While the combined value of $11.9 billion ($11,900 million) is close to the ground truth $11,895 million and can be considered approximately correct, the individual company values and percentages are significantly wrong. The LLM states Apple reported $10.42 billion in Other Non-Current Assets, which matches the ground truth of $10,417 million. However, it incorrectly states Apple’s total assets as $352.8 billion (correct figure is $11,369 million per ground truth), leading to a wrong percentage of ~3% instead of the correct ~9.2%. This is a critical error. For AMD, the LLM reports $1.48 billion (close to the correct $1,478 million), but again uses an incorrect total asset base: $12.42 billion vs. the correct $12,419 million — though this part is acceptable. However, the percentage is stated as ~12%, while the correct value is ~11.9%, which is acceptable if not for the flawed reasoning. (2) The calculation of Apple’s percentage is fundamentally wrong due to using an incorrect total asset figure — likely confusing Apple’s actual total assets with a much larger number (possibly from a different year or metric). The LLM cites page 47 and 45, but misinterprets the data, possibly conflating operating lease liabilities or other line items with total assets. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails on a key link: correctly identifying Apple’s Other Non-Current Assets but failing to retrieve the correct total assets for the same year and company, leading to an invalid comparison. This breaks the synthesis required for the question. (4) Despite correct sourcing attempts and reasonable formatting, the answer is mostly incorrect due to the critical error in Apple’s total assets and resulting percentage. The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right companies, metric, and year, but the core financial analysis is flawed.

However, CVS has stated in its 10-K that it faces limitations in detecting, forecasting, and pricing for medical cost trends, especially during periods of significant volatility in utilization and costs. The ACA and other regulations further restrict CVS's ability to adjust pricing based on these increased costs.

No calculations were required, but temporal and numerical facts match. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the relevant entities: Merck (manufacturer of ProQuad, Gardasil, and Varivax), CVS (Health Care Benefits segment), and the connection between vaccine supply/demand and medical cost forecasting. (3) The reasoning is sound and captures the multi-hop logic: Merck's supply constraints and lower demand → potential disruption in vaccination rates → increased disease incidence and medical utilization → higher claims costs for CVS → challenges in forecasting and pricing due to regulatory and operational limitations (specifically referencing ACA-related pricing restrictions). The LLM cites CVS’s own 10-K language about limitations in detecting cost trends, which strengthens accuracy. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the potential increase in preventable diseases (e.g., measles, HPV-related conditions) as a causal link between lower vaccination rates and higher medical costs, which is present in the original answer.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of long-term lease liabilities for Amazon and McDonald's in 2024 is $91,335 million. Amazon reports long-term lease liabilities of $78,277 million, while McDonald's reports $13,058 million in long-term lease liabilities.

However, McDonald's reported amount is incorrect: LLM states $12,888 million versus the correct $13,058 million. The combined total is therefore miscalculated: LLM reports $91,165 million, while the correct sum is $91,335 million—a difference of $170 million. Despite this, the answer conveys approximate magnitude and uses acceptable rounding (e.g., ≈$91.2 billion). 2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the incorrect McDonald's figure and resulting sum, though Amazon's number is exact and the final total is close. Minor formatting variations (e.g., $91.2 billion) are acceptable, but the underlying calculation must be accurate. 3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly interprets that Amazon has a much larger lease obligation than McDonald's and links this to capital structure implications, noting Amazon’s lease-dependent model versus McDonald’s more modest reliance. This reflects proper multi-hop synthesis across two companies and correct qualitative interpretation. 4) The answer is contextually relevant, addressing both the quantitative total and the comparative analysis of capital structures.

      "original_answer": "The 33% decline in Merck's 2024 U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet, driven by lower pricing, competitive pressures, and Medicaid rebate changes, affects CVS's Health Care Benefits segment by potentially reducing pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service demand and increasing medical cost trends. CVS notes that adverse economic conditions, including changes in drug utilization and provider behavior, can increase its costs and limit its ability to manage medical cost trends. Lower drug utilization due to reduced prescribing of Merck's diabetes medications could decrease PBM revenue for CVS while simultaneously shifting more cost burden to medical claims if alternative treatments are more expensive, thereby increasing medical costs for CVS and straining its ability to manage benefit costs and maintain profitability.",

The combined total in the ground truth is $91.38 billion; the LLM calculates $91.2 billion, likely due to rounding McDonald's figure down. (2) Calculations: The sum of $78.3B + $12.9B = $91.2B is accurate based on the numbers provided by the LLM, but it does not match the precise total of $91.38B from the original answer. Additionally, the claim that Amazon’s obligation is 'about six times larger' is an overstatement: $78.3B / $13.058B ≈ 5.995, so roughly 6x is acceptable as an approximation, though more precisely it's just under 6x.

(2) Numeric verification: The correct difference in organic growth is 7.0% - 4.0% = 3.0 percentage points; LLM reports ≈1 point. CL's FX impact: ground truth is -4.5%, LLM says -1%. PG's FX impact: +2.0% (correctly reported). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies the correct companies (CL and PG) and the relevant metrics (organic sales growth, FX impact), showing an understanding of the required synthesis. However, due to incorrect input data, the conclusions are flawed. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4/10) due to major errors in core numbers and the resulting comparison. Quantitative accuracy is poor (4/10) because two of the three key figures (CL growth, CL FX) are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5/10) as the structure and intent are sound, but data sourcing is flawed. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) because the answer addresses the right question with appropriate framing and terminology.",

      "original_answer": "As of December 31, 2023, SCHW reported a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) of 8.5% under its CSC entity, while WFC, as a large BHC subject to enhanced prudential requirements including SLR, must maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0%. The 5.5 percentage point difference suggests that SCHW's capital position relative to its total leverage exposure is significantly stronger than the regulatory minimum, indicating a more conservative capital management strategy or better alignment with FRB expectations for resiliency and loss-absorbing capacity under the Dodd-Frank Act and SLR rules.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical factual error in reporting WFC's SLR as 'about 5.5%' when the ground truth states WFC must maintain a minimum of 3.0% under enhanced prudential requirements — there is no indication in the original answer that WFC’s actual SLR was 5.5%. This misrepresents the key data point for WFC. Additionally, the 5.5 percentage point difference cited in the original answer is derived from 8.5% - 3.0% (SCHW vs. minimum requirement), not from a comparison with WFC’s actual SLR. The LLM incorrectly implies the difference is between SCHW’s 8.5% and WFC’s 5.5%, which distorts the analysis. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the WFC SLR value is fabricated or misreported; only SCHW’s 8.5% is correct. The calculation of the difference (implied 3 percentage points) does not match the ground truth’s 5.5-point gap relative to the regulatory floor. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in interpreting that a higher SLR indicates a stronger capital position, but it fails the multi-hop logic: instead of comparing SCHW’s SLR to the regulatory minimum (3.0%) applicable to large BHCs like WFC, it compares SCHW to WFC’s reported SLR — which is not provided in the ground truth and is inaccurately stated. The original answer emphasizes SCHW exceeding the minimum by 5.5 points, highlighting conservative capital management; the LLM misses this nuance by focusing on an incorrect inter-firm comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses regulatory capital, SLR, and prudential requirements, and correctly identifies both firms as subject to the framework. However, due to the major quantitative error and flawed synthesis, the overall correctness score is low.",

Similarly, it uses Verizon's Business Group operating income ($31,077M and $31,477M) instead of the correct Business revenue figures of $13,372M (2023) and $12,845M (2022). These errors stem from misidentifying the financial metric. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent but based on wrong numbers: $9,255 + $31,077 = $40,332M (correct arithmetic), but both inputs are factually wrong. The correct 2023 total is $13,394M, not $40,332M. The correct 2022 total is $12,866M, not $40,296M. The claimed $36M increase is incorrect; the actual increase is $528M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to combine data from both companies and compare across years — but fails due to incorrect entity-metric mapping. It uses 'operating income' for Verizon instead of 'Business revenue', and vastly overstates Comcast's figure, suggesting confusion between total segment revenue and a narrow connectivity line item. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure of the response matches the question’s intent (combine, compare), but the substance is severely flawed.

      "original_answer": "GM Financial incorporates disposable personal income as one of several economic factors in its static pool modeling to forecast expected credit losses on retail finance receivables, adjusting the allowance for loan losses based on projected impacts of changes in this metric. Lowe’s, on the other hand, depends on disposable personal income as a core demand driver that influences homeowner spending on repairs and upgrades, particularly among millennials forming households and elderly individuals aging in place. Therefore, a decline in disposable personal income could simultaneously increase credit risk in GM’s finance receivables while reducing demand in Lowe’s home improvement market, creating dual financial pressures across both companies.",

      "original_answer": "A decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory for both Apple and AMD, leading to financial risks such as write-downs, increased production costs, and unutilized purchase commitments. Apple orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments, with manufacturing purchase obligations covering forecasted requirements for up to 150 days. If demand decreases, Apple risks forecasting incorrectly and producing excess components or products, which could lead to inventory write-downs and unutilized purchase commitments. Similarly, AMD has prepayment arrangements with certain vendors, and a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and increased production costs. AMD's reliance on long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements makes it particularly vulnerable to financial strain if demand decreases and inventory cannot be utilized. Together, these dynamics show how both companies' financial positions could be adversely impacted by a shared risk of excess inventory stemming from mismatched supply and demand.",
      "llm_answer": "A slowdown in consumer orders would leave both companies with more product and component inventory than they can sell. For AMD, the 10‑K notes that a “sudden or significant decrease in demand… could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write‑downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins” (AMD p. 24‑27) and that it must honor firm purchase commitments, so the excess stock would increase costs and erode earnings. Apple makes the same point: it “records a write‑down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete… and accrues cancellation‑fee reserves for orders of excess products… a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and an increase in our production costs, particularly since we have pre‑payment arrangements with certain vendors” (Apple p. 12, 24). Thus, lower demand would pressure both firms’ margins and could force inventory write‑downs or impairments, hurting their financial results.",

The LLM correctly identifies Apple's pre-payment arrangements and accrual of cancellation fees, as well as AMD's firm purchase commitments and vulnerability to obsolete inventory. (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer requiring calculation, so quantitative accuracy is perfect—no figures are misstated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes information from both companies' 10-Ks, correctly linking decreased demand to inventory risks and financial consequences for both firms, despite their different manufacturing models. It references specific risk factors from each company’s filing (e.g., AMD p. 24–27, Apple p. 12, 24), showing proper cross-document synthesis.

      "question": "How does the difference in contract mix between General Dynamics' defense segments and Lockheed Martin's contract structure influence their respective operating earnings and margin volatility?",
      "original_answer": "General Dynamics notes that operating earnings and margin volatility in its defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance, and contract mix, particularly emphasizing that contract mix refers to the proportion of higher- versus lower-margin work, which can vary based on contract type (e.g., fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development vs. production). Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, explicitly states that it operates under both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, with the latter including cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee structures. These cost-reimbursable contracts introduce variability in fees based on performance assessments or cost targets, directly affecting earnings and margins. Therefore, while both companies experience margin volatility due to contract mix, Lockheed Martin's detailed exposure to performance-based fees in its cost-reimbursable contracts introduces an additional layer of earnings sensitivity compared to General Dynamics' broader categorization of contract type and work stage impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics’ defense businesses are weighted toward a mix of development‑ and early‑production contracts that are often cost‑plus or fixed‑price‑with‑incentives; when new‑program work (which carries lower margins) rises or when cost‑plus awards are reduced, its operating earnings swing sharply and its segment margins compress. Lockheed Martin, by contrast, earns the bulk of its defense revenue from long‑term, mostly fixed‑price contracts, so its operating earnings move mainly with volume, but any shift toward a larger share of lower‑margin, cost‑reimbursable or early‑life work causes its margins to be more volatile. Thus, GD’s contract‑mix profile makes its earnings and margins more sensitive to program‑stage changes, whereas LMT’s contract structure ties earnings to volume while margin volatility stems from changes in the proportion of higher‑ versus lower‑margin fixed‑price work.",

However, there are key qualitative discrepancies when compared to the ground truth. First, the LLM incorrectly characterizes LMT as earning the 'bulk of its defense revenue from long-term, mostly fixed-price contracts'—the original answer does not support this emphasis on fixed-price dominance; instead, it highlights LMT's significant use of cost-reimbursable contracts with performance-based fees (e.g., cost-plus-award-fee), which introduce earnings sensitivity. This is a critical omission: the ground truth stresses that LMT’s margin volatility is amplified by performance-linked fees in cost-reimbursable arrangements, whereas the LLM downplays this and instead attributes LMT’s volatility to shifts in fixed-price work. Second, while the LLM correctly identifies GD’s sensitivity to program stage and contract type, it does not mention the specific performance-based fee structures (e.g., award fees) that LMT faces, missing a key differentiator in volatility drivers. The reasoning is logically structured and contextually relevant, but the failure to accurately represent LMT’s contract structure and the associated performance-based risk layer reduces qualitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "GILD's net product sales are directly impacted by rebate payment obligations to Medicaid agencies and discounts to 340B covered entities, which significantly reduce the effective price of its products despite any list price increases. This dynamic limits the financial benefit GILD receives from price adjustments. In contrast, JNJ faces legal risks tied to rebate payments and contractual relationships, particularly in relation to its HIV products PREZISTA and INTELENCE, where it is involved in litigation alleging anti-kickback violations and off-label promotion under the False Claims Act. These legal challenges could result in financial penalties or settlements, highlighting a different type of financial exposure compared to GILD’s more direct revenue limitations from rebates.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead Science notes that a “significant portion of our sales … are subject to substantial discounts … including rebates we may be required to pay to Medicaid agencies or discounts we may be required to pay to 340B‑covered entities” (GILD 10‑K p. 18).  Those required rebates and other payer discounts therefore limit the price increases it can achieve and directly reduce its **net product sales** (GILD 10‑K p. 19).  \n\nIn contrast, Johnson & Johnson’s HIV products (PREZISTA and INTELENCE) are the subject of **legal risk** rather than a routine pricing effect: the company has received civil investigative demands and a qui‑tam complaint alleging off‑label promotion, anti‑kickback and false‑claims violations, and it has been subpoenaed for documents on “rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies” and other contractual arrangements with pharmacy‑benefit managers (JNJ 10‑K p. 108‑109).  Thus, JNJ’s rebate‑related issues create exposure to litigation and potential penalties, whereas GILD’s rebates simply lower its reported net sales.",

(2) It accurately contrasts this with JNJ's situation, where rebate-related issues involve legal risks (civil investigative demands, qui-tam complaints, subpoenas) tied to PREZISTA and INTELENCE, including allegations of off-label promotion, anti-kickback violations, and False Claims Act exposure. (3) No numerical data (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, years) are present in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised; all referenced document locations (e.g., GILD 10-K p.18, JNJ 10-K p.108–109) are appropriately cited and consistent with the source logic. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (GILD and JNJ), two regulatory environments (U.S. rebate systems vs. litigation risk), and two types of financial impact (direct revenue reduction vs. contingent legal exposure).

In contrast, Lowe’s defines ROIC as rolling 12-month lease-adjusted NOPAT divided by the average of current and prior year ending debt and shareholders' deficit. These differing methodologies—specifically GM’s inclusion of automotive-specific liabilities and use of EBIT-adjusted versus Lowe’s use of lease-adjusted NOPAT and debt metrics—make direct comparisons of ROIC between the two companies challenging, as they reflect distinct capital structures and operational focuses.",

It states the total is $502 million, but the ground truth is $46 million. This is a critical quantitative error. The individual company values are correct: $274 million for COST and $228 million for MDLZ. However, the sum of $274M + $228M = $502M is mathematically correct, which contradicts the ground truth total of $46M, indicating a possible data discrepancy or misinterpretation in the knowledge graph. Despite this, the LLM's calculation from the provided inputs is accurate, but the inputs themselves must be incorrect if the ground truth is to be believed. (2) The quantitative accuracy is severely compromised due to the incorrect total, even though the per-company figures match the ground truth. The comparison that COST paid more is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is logically sound—LLM correctly identified both companies' values, cited appropriate sources, computed the total, and made the correct comparison. However, the underlying data appears inconsistent with the ground truth, undermining the factual correctness. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses all parts of the question with proper structure and sourcing. Due to the massive discrepancy in the total amount—$502M vs $46M—the correctness score is very low, as this is a core part of the question.

The combined 2024 revenue is accurately calculated: $5.627 billion (Morgan Stanley) + $5.716 billion (Charles Schwab) = $11.343 billion, which the model correctly rounds to 'about $11.34 billion'—this is semantically equivalent to the ground truth of $11,343 million. Both individual revenue figures match the ground truth when converted to consistent units (e.g., $5.627 billion = $5,627 million). (2) Growth percentages are correct: Morgan Stanley’s 8% growth is accurately reported, and Charles Schwab’s 20.2% is correctly approximated as 'roughly 20%' or '≈20.2%'. The additional comparative analysis—stating Morgan Stanley’s growth was '12 percentage points lower' and 'about 40% of Schwab’s growth'—is logically sound and adds value without contradicting the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "General Dynamics recognizes revenue on long-term government contracts using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs at completion, which directly ties revenue fluctuations to changes in cost estimates and production volume. This method means that changes in estimated costs without corresponding changes in contract value impact profitability. Lockheed Martin, under cost-reimbursable contracts, is reimbursed for allowable costs plus a fee, with profitability capped by a ceiling amount and influenced by performance assessments or cost incentives. Therefore, while General Dynamics' profitability is sensitive to cost estimation accuracy and contract maturity, Lockheed Martin's earnings depend on cost control and performance-based incentives within a fixed funding limit.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics records revenue on its defense contracts using the percentage‑of‑completion, cost‑to‑cost method, so earnings are recognized as work progresses and are later adjusted when the estimated total cost to finish a contract changes (the “profit‑booking‑rate” or risk‑retirement adjustments). These adjustments can swing segment operating profit up or down independent of the amount of work performed, as GD notes that changes in profit‑booking rates added about $2 billion to operating profit in 2021 and that revenue can be altered by revisions to estimated costs (GD p.33‑34; GD p.79).  \n\nLockheed Martin, by contrast, treats its cost‑reimbursable contracts by recognizing revenue for the allowable costs incurred plus the agreed‑upon fee, so operating earnings track the actual costs recovered and the fee ceiling rather than periodic profit‑rate adjustments; profitability therefore reflects cost control and the fee structure rather than retroactive re‑estimation of contract margins (Lockheed p.76).  \n\nConsequently, GD’s method can produce larger, sometimes abrupt, changes in reported operating earnings and contract profitability, whereas Lockheed’s cost‑reimbursable approach yields earnings that move more directly with incurred costs and the contractual fee.",

(1) It correctly identifies General Dynamics' (GD) use of the cost-to-cost method under percentage-of-completion accounting, which ties revenue and profit recognition to cost incurrence and allows for adjustments based on changes in estimated total costs. It also accurately characterizes Lockheed Martin's (LM) cost-reimbursable contracts as involving reimbursement of allowable costs plus a fee, with profitability bounded by ceilings and performance incentives. (2) The LLM cites a specific $2 billion adjustment to GD’s operating profit in 2021 due to profit-booking-rate changes, referencing page numbers (e.g., GD p.33-34, p.79; LM p.76), which are plausible in context though not verifiable without source documents. No calculation errors are present, and the numbers mentioned are consistent with known disclosures in public filings. The ground truth does not include this $2B figure, but its inclusion does not contradict it and adds contextual detail.

This means Gilead's income statement reflects the full cost of milestone payments immediately, whereas JNJ delays recognition until regulatory approval is obtained, thereby deferring some costs to future periods through amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead records milestone payments that are tied to an acquisition as “contingent consideration.” Because the acquisition is treated as an asset purchase, any upfront or subsequent milestone payments are expensed as incurred (or, if the liability is re‑measured, the change is booked in Research‑and‑development expense) and flow straight to the R&D line of the income statement. Johnson & Johnson, by contrast, treats milestone payments made under R&D collaboration agreements as ordinary R&D expense only until the product receives regulatory approval; after approval the amounts are capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over the product’s useful life, shifting the cost from the R&D line to cost‑of‑goods‑sold (or amortization expense) in later periods.",

This affects the income statement by immediate expensing (Gilead) vs. deferral and amortization (JNJ). (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present.

It incorrectly assigns $139 million to Costco (COST) and $136 million to Mondelez (MDLZ), reversing the correct values from the ground truth (COST: $136M, MDLZ: $139M). This mislabeling undermines the accuracy of the response. (2) The calculation of the combined outflow ($139M + $136M = $275M) is mathematically correct and matches the ground truth total, which is accurate. However, the year-over-year changes are incorrectly attributed: the LLM claims Mondelez's outflow decreased from $291M to $136M (a $155M drop), but this actually corresponds to COST’s data. Conversely, it states Costco’s outflow 'rose by $14M', but in reality, COST decreased from $291M to $136M (a $155M decrease), while MDLZ decreased from $125M to $139M — an increase, not a decrease. The ground truth states MDLZ had a $14M increase (not decrease) in outflow, but the original answer incorrectly frames it as a decrease; however, the LLM compounds this by fully reversing the companies and misstating the direction of change. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect synthesis: the model swaps the companies' values and misinterprets the direction of change, leading to invalid comparisons. It does not correctly identify which company had the larger year-over-year decrease — in fact, only COST had a decrease; MDLZ had an increase. Therefore, the conclusion that Mondelez had a larger decrease is factually wrong. (4) Despite these critical errors, the answer is contextually relevant and attempts all parts of the question — total outflow and YoY comparison — earning moderate scores for relevance and partial quantitative accuracy on the sum.

It reports Morgan Stanley's 2024 fees as $5,627 million and Charles Schwab's as $5,716 million, leading to a combined total of $11.34 billion. However, the ground truth combined total is $9,773 million, indicating that at least one (or both) of the individual figures is incorrect. The correct growth rate for Charles Schwab is 18.6%, but the LLM reports it as 'about 20%'—a notable deviation despite rounding. (2) The calculation of the combined total is mathematically correct based on the LLM's numbers ($5,627M + $5,716M = $11,343M), but since the inputs are wrong, the result does not match the ground truth. The growth rate calculation for Schwab appears to be based on $4.756B in 2023 rising to $5.716B in 2024: (5,716 - 4,756)/4,756 ≈ 20.18%, which supports the LLM's ~20% claim, but contradicts the ground truth of 18.6%, suggesting incorrect source data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model identifies both companies, extracts fee figures and growth rates, computes a total, and compares growth—but the factual foundation is flawed.

These errors undermine the quantitative foundation of the response. (2) The cited dollar amounts and percentages do not match the required year (2022), and the LLM references 2021 data despite the question asking about 2022. Even if the percentage growth were consistent, the time period mismatch invalidates the comparison. Furthermore, the original answer does not mention specific revenue figures—only growth rates—so introducing incorrect base years and values introduces false precision.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct in structure and reasoning but contains inaccuracies in the key numeric values. The ground truth states Lockheed Martin's FAS/CAS operating adjustment in 2021 was $1,876 million, but the LLM reports it as $1.96 billion ($1,960 million), which is an overstatement of $84 million. The Raytheon Merger impact on RMD's operating profit is correctly cited as approximately $45 million. However, due to the incorrect base value, the calculated difference is $1.915 billion (~$1,915 million), whereas the correct difference is $1,876M - $45M = $1,831 million. This results in a $84 million error in the difference, which is significant. (2) Number/calculation verification: Correct calculation would be $1,876M - $45M = $1,831M; LLM computes ~$1,960M - $45M = ~$1,915M — incorrect. While the $45M figure is accurate, the FAS/CAS adjustment amount is not. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The LLM correctly identifies the two entities (Lockheed Martin and RMD/Raytheon Technologies), the relevant financial metrics (FAS/CAS adjustment vs. merger impact on operating profit), and the correct years (2021 vs. 2020). It synthesizes across these points to make a qualitative comparison about the relative magnitude of accounting adjustments versus merger impacts, which aligns with the original answer’s intent. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is 7 because the core concept and qualitative insight are correct, but the quantitative foundation is flawed. Quantitative accuracy is 6 due to the material error in the FAS/CAS figure and the resulting miscalculated difference. Qualitative accuracy is 8 because the reasoning, entity identification, and interpretation are sound despite the number error.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that HON (Honeywell) has a higher proportion of cost of goods sold (COGS) relative to total expenses compared to RTX (Raytheon), which aligns with the ground truth. The dollar amounts for HON's COGS ($457 million) and total expenses ($569 million) are accurate, and the implied percentage (~80%) matches the ground truth 80.3% (calculated as 457/569 ≈ 0.803). For RTX, the COGS of $34 million is correct, and while the LLM does not explicitly state RTX's total expenses as $143 million, it references $34 million COGS versus $109 million SG&A, implying total expenses of $143 million (34 + 109), which is accurate. The conclusion that RTX has a much smaller share of COGS is correct and consistent with the ground truth 23.8% (34/143 ≈ 0.238). (2) All numbers and calculations are quantitatively accurate. The LLM correctly uses the fiscal year 2021 for both companies and references appropriate expense categories. Minor rounding of 80.3% to 'about 80%' is acceptable and does not affect correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes expense data from both HON and RTX, compares the proportion of COGS to total expenses, and draws a valid conclusion about their cost structures. It correctly infers that HON’s cost structure is more manufacturing-intensive while RTX’s is more weighted toward SG&A and other overhead. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses the question. The only minor limitation is that the LLM does not explicitly compute RTX’s percentage (23.8%), though the qualitative description ('much smaller share') conveys the same meaning. This does not detract significantly from the overall accuracy. Thus, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth.",

Specifically, the LLM uses $8,949 million for CMCSA 2021 and $15,336 million for DIS 2022, summing to $24,285 million. However, the correct combined total per the ground truth implies that at least one of these inputs is wrong—likely CMCSA's value, which may have been misread from the document. (2) For the percentage change, the LLM reports a 0.5% increase in DIS's Programming and Production Costs from 2021 ($15,259M) to 2022 ($15,336M), whereas the ground truth states a 1% decrease. This is a critical error: the direction of change is opposite (increase vs. decrease), and the magnitude is incorrect. The correct calculation should be (15,336 - 15,259) / 15,259 ≈ +0.5%, but the ground truth indicates a decrease, suggesting the actual 2022 value should be lower than 2021.

      "question": "How much higher was the cumulative FAS/CAS operating adjustment impact on Raytheon's consolidated operating profit compared to Lockheed Martin's net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, and what does this difference indicate about their respective pension cost management strategies?",
      "original_answer": "The cumulative FAS/CAS operating adjustment impact on Raytheon's consolidated operating profit in 2021 was $1,796 million, while Lockheed Martin's net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021 was $668 million. The difference is $1,128 million. This significant difference indicates that Raytheon had a much larger pension-related operating adjustment, suggesting more aggressive pension cost management or a different pension structure compared to Lockheed Martin.",
      "llm_answer": "Raytheon’s FAS/CAS operating adjustment added about **$1.96 billion** to its consolidated operating profit in 2021, whereas Lockheed Martin recorded a **$0.668 billion** net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for the same year – a difference of roughly **$1.29 billion**. This larger adjustment at Raytheon shows that a greater portion of its pension cost is offset through the CAS‑based recovery mechanism built into its government contracts, while Lockheed Martin’s smaller net adjustment suggests a more modest reliance on such recoveries and a tighter overall pension‑cost management approach.",

According to the ground truth, Raytheon's cumulative FAS/CAS operating adjustment in 2021 was $1,796 million ($1.796 billion), but the LLM states $1.96 billion—overstating by $164 million. The difference calculated by the LLM is $1.29 billion, whereas the correct difference is $1,128 million ($1.128 billion), leading to an error of $162 million in the calculated gap. Lockheed Martin’s figure is correctly stated as $0.668 billion, matching the ground truth. (2) Calculations: The correct difference is $1,796M - $668M = $1,128M; the LLM computes $1,960M - $668M = $1,292M, which is incorrect due to the wrong Raytheon input. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is logically structured—the model correctly identifies that the comparison reflects differences in pension cost recovery mechanisms and interprets the implications about pension management strategies. The qualitative insight that Raytheon relies more heavily on CAS-based recovery while Lockheed Martin shows tighter cost management is reasonable and aligns with the intent of the question. (4) Despite strong contextual relevance and sound reasoning framework, the correctness score is reduced to 6 due to major numerical inaccuracies. Quantitative accuracy is penalized heavily (score 5) because the core financial figures are incorrect. Qualitative accuracy is fair (7) as the interpretation is plausible given the numbers it used, and contextual relevance is high (9) because the answer addresses both parts of the multi-part question and attempts proper synthesis.",

      "question": "Considering Costco's projected $370 million increase in membership revenue over the next two fiscal years and Mondelez's exposure to rising raw material and labor costs, how might these financial dynamics influence their respective strategies for maintaining profitability in the face of cost inflation pressures described in both filings?",
      "original_answer": "Costco projects a $370 million increase in membership revenue over the next two fiscal years, with $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025, primarily in the latter half of the year. This increase stems from membership fee hikes and higher penetration of Executive Members. Meanwhile, Mondelez notes significant cost inflation pressures, including rising raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs, which have continued to increase. Both companies address cost pressures through pricing strategies—Costco via membership fees and Mondelez through product pricing adjustments. The additional revenue Costco anticipates could help offset inflationary pressures, supporting its membership-driven profitability model. In contrast, Mondelez may need to rely more heavily on pricing actions and cost-saving initiatives to maintain profitability. These differing strategies reflect their business models and exposure to cost inflation, shaping how each company approaches profitability in a challenging cost environment.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco is counting on the $370 million boost to membership‑fee revenue – driven by higher fees and stronger Executive‑member penetration – to add margin that can absorb higher commodity, labor and other inflation‑related costs. Mondelez, by contrast, is confronting rising cocoa, other raw‑material and labor expenses by leaning on its “cost‑excellence” agenda – tightening sourcing and productivity, using hedges where possible and passing a portion of the higher input costs to customers through price increases – to protect its profit margins.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the $370 million increase in membership revenue for Costco is correctly stated, and while the LLM does not break down the $190 million for fiscal 2025, this omission is minor and does not affect the overall correctness. The absence of the specific timing (latter half of fiscal 2025) is a slight detail loss but not critical to the core financial projection. (2) The entities—Costco and Mondelez—are correctly identified, as are the relevant cost pressures: membership revenue for Costco, and raw material (cocoa), labor, and input costs for Mondelez. (3) The reasoning is sound: both companies are shown to respond to inflation through pricing strategies—Costco via membership fees, Mondelez via product pricing and cost-excellence initiatives like sourcing optimization, productivity gains, and hedging. The synthesis across both companies’ strategies is logically presented and reflects their distinct business models. (4) Semantically, the LLM conveys the same core message: Costco leverages membership revenue to absorb inflation, while Mondelez relies on operational efficiency and selective price increases. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit mention that the $370M is spread over two years with a $190M impact in fiscal 2025, but the overall strategic implication is preserved.

      "question": "How does the difference between Apple's effective tax rate and Intel's effective tax rate in 2023 reflect the contrasting impacts of tax credits, deductions, and other adjustments on their respective tax positions?",
      "original_answer": "Apple's effective tax rate in 2023 was 14.7%, while Intel's effective tax rate was -3.2%, indicating a stark contrast in their tax positions. Intel's negative effective tax rate was primarily driven by significant tax credits and adjustments such as research and development tax credits (-11.4%), non-US income taxed at different rates (-13.4%), and foreign derived intangible income benefit (-9.7%), which collectively reduced their tax burden. In contrast, Apple's effective tax rate, although lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, was positively influenced by fewer such adjustments, resulting in a more conventional effective tax rate. This comparison highlights how different business structures, global operations, and tax incentives can lead to divergent effective tax outcomes even under the same statutory rate.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple reported an effective tax rate of **14.7 % for 2023** (up from 16.2 % in 2022)【page_28】, while Intel’s 2023 effective tax rate was **‑119.8 %**, meaning it recorded a net tax benefit rather than a tax expense【page_93】. Apple’s rate was modestly reduced by its U.S. R&D credit and a lower share of foreign‑taxed earnings, but was lifted by a one‑time $10.2 billion State‑Aid charge; Intel’s negative rate was driven primarily by very large R&D tax credits (‑99 pts), foreign‑income‑rate differentials (‑60.6 pts), foreign‑derived intangible income benefits (‑25.1 pts) and other adjustments that together outweighed its tax provision. Thus, Apple’s tax position reflects a relatively balanced mix of credits and a sizable one‑off charge, whereas Intel’s position reflects far larger credit and deduction effects that turned its tax expense into a net benefit.",

This error severely undermines the quantitative and overall correctness. Additionally, the LLM claims Intel's R&D tax credit contributed -99 percentage points, foreign-income differentials -60.6 pts, and FDII benefit -25.1 pts—none of which match the ground truth values of -11.4%, -13.4%, and -9.7% respectively. Apple’s mention of a $10.2 billion State-Aid charge is not present in the original answer and appears to be fabricated or misattributed. (2) The only correct numeric value is Apple’s effective tax rate of 14.7%, which matches the ground truth. All other figures, including the magnitude of tax credit impacts and Intel’s overall rate, are grossly inaccurate. Calculations and comparisons based on these numbers are therefore invalid. (3) While the LLM demonstrates an understanding of the types of adjustments that can influence effective tax rates (e.g., R&D credits, foreign income differentials, FDII), and attempts multi-hop reasoning by comparing two companies’ tax positions, the synthesis is based on incorrect data. The reasoning structure is sound in form but flawed in substance due to reliance on erroneous inputs. (4) Despite the structural relevance and correct identification of Apple and Intel and the general concept of tax adjustments, the extreme numerical inaccuracies—especially the -119.8% vs -3.2%—warrant a low correctness score.

Morgan Stanley reported $87 million in residential real estate loans, with an allowance for credit losses (ACL) of $87 million as of December 31, 2022. Charles Schwab reported $15 million in ACL for residential real estate loans, which accounted for 62% of its total loans in 2024.

However, there is a discrepancy in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for Morgan Stanley: the LLM states $97 million, while the ground truth reports $87 million. This is a factual error affecting quantitative accuracy. (2) All other numbers are correct: Schwab’s ACL of $15 million is accurately reported, and the years (2022 for Morgan Stanley, 2024 for Schwab) are correctly attributed. The breakdown of Schwab’s 62% into 61% first mortgages and 1% HELOCs adds detail not in the original but does not contradict it and may reflect additional context from the filing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM synthesizes data across two firms, two years, and connects loan allocation percentages to ACL figures, correctly interpreting that Schwab has a higher concentration in residential real estate loans. The comparison logic is valid and well-structured. (4) Despite the $10 million ACL error for Morgan Stanley, the core facts—percentages, difference, and relative risk exposure—are correct.

However, for PFE, the LLM includes an additional $470 million commitment to Therachon, which is not mentioned in the original answer and is irrelevant to the question's focus on development milestones specifically tied to Valneva's VLA15 Lyme disease vaccine. The original answer specifies only the $35 million commitment to Valneva. By including the $470 million unrelated commitment, the LLM inflates PFE's total and miscalculates the combined total. (2) The quantitative values for AMGN ($1.6 billion) and PFE's Valneva agreement ($35 million) are correct, but the inclusion of $470 million from Therachon introduces a significant error. The combined total should be $1.635 billion, not $2.105 billion. The calculation itself is arithmetically correct but based on incorrect inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM does not correctly identify which agreements are relevant. The question asks for commitments tied to development milestones through 'their respective agreements'—contextually referring to the specific agreements mentioned in the ground truth (Teneobio for AMGN, Valneva for PFE). The LLM incorrectly expands PFE's commitments to include Therachon without evidence that this was part of the intended scope.

While both companies faced slight declines, HD's performance was slightly worse, as its average ticket dropped from $90.36 in fiscal 2022 to $90.07 in fiscal 2023, whereas LOW's change was smaller in magnitude and occurred against a backdrop of a larger 4.6% drop in customer transactions.",

It also accurately references LOW's 4.6% drop in customer transactions. These numbers match the original answer exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., bolding for emphasis is irrelevant to accuracy). (2) Calculations are correct: the $0.29 difference in HD’s average ticket is accurate ($90.36 - $90.07 = $0.29), and the characterization of LOW’s ticket change as minimal aligns with the 0.1% figure. The LLM adds contextual details not in the original—such as HD’s 2.9% transaction drop and 3.2% comp sales decline, and LOW’s 4.7% comp sales drop—which are factually consistent with typical multi-hop synthesis from 10-K data and enhance the explanation without contradicting the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly links changes in average ticket to transaction-based revenue performance for both companies, contrasting HD’s slightly worse ticket performance with LOW’s more significant transaction volume decline.

While it correctly identifies the individual annual FAS/CAS operating adjustments for LMT—$2,049 million in 2019, $1,876 million in 2020, and $1,960 million in 2021—the cumulative sum is incorrectly calculated as $5,885 million. The correct sum is $5,405 million (2,049 + 1,876 + 1,960). This arithmetic error undermines the entire conclusion. The RTX merger-attributed increase of $690 million in 2021 is correctly stated. However, due to the incorrect cumulative total, the difference is miscalculated as $5,195 million instead of the correct $4,715 million. (2) Number verification: 2,049 + 1,876 + 1,960 = 5,885 is mathematically incorrect; the correct sum is 5,405. The difference: 5,405 - 690 = 4,715, not 5,195. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that it must sum LMT’s adjustments over three years and compare that to RTX’s single-year merger-attributed increase. This shows sound qualitative reasoning structure. However, the failure in basic arithmetic invalidates the quantitative conclusion. (4) Correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to the critical calculation error. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the logic and entity identification are correct. Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses the right companies, metric, time frame, and comparison intent.",

      "question": "How do the accounting treatments for repair and maintenance costs differ between Costco and Coca-Cola in terms of their impact on financial statement line items, and what does this imply about the nature of their respective asset management strategies?",
      "original_answer": "Costco expenses repair and maintenance costs when incurred and does not disclose specific amounts, indicating a focus on immediate recognition of costs related to asset readiness and upkeep. Coca-Cola also expenses repair and maintenance costs when incurred but provides more detailed context around asset management, including depreciation ranges for buildings and equipment, and explicitly states that costs not extending economic life are expensed. This implies that while both companies follow similar accounting principles, Coca-Cola’s more granular reporting reflects a structured approach to asset lifecycle management, whereas Costco’s approach suggests a streamlined operational focus on expensing without detailed disclosure.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco states that “repair and maintenance costs are expensed when incurred” (Costco 10‑K p. 45), so the outlay is recorded immediately as an operating expense (typically within SG&A) and does not affect the balance‑sheet value of its warehouses, equipment and fixtures. Coca‑Cola’s policy is worded the same way – “repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred” (Coca‑Cola 10‑K p. 72) – but the note is embedded in the Property‑Plant‑and‑Equipment section, so the expense is shown in the operating‑expense line of the income statement (often as part of cost of goods sold or other operating charges). Both companies therefore treat routine upkeep as a period cost, but by separating it from capitalized remodels and upgrades they signal that their asset‑management strategies rely on preserving existing facilities rather than repeatedly re‑capitalizing them; Coca‑Cola’s manufacturing‑intensive business, however, places more emphasis on capitalizing improvements that extend the life of bottling and production assets.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Both companies are accurately described as expensing repair and maintenance costs when incurred, which is consistent with the original answer. The LLM correctly cites specific 10-K page numbers and quotes, enhancing credibility. There are no numeric values in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations or dollar amounts—thus scored as 10 by default. (2) The LLM adds contextual detail not in the ground truth—such as specifying that expenses are recorded in SG&A for Costco and possibly in COGS or operating expenses for Coca-Cola—which is reasonable but not confirmed in the original answer. This is not incorrect but represents an inference. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that both companies follow similar accounting principles (expensing when incurred) and draws a logical inference about asset management strategies, noting Coca-Cola’s manufacturing intensity and potential for capitalizing life-extending improvements. This goes slightly beyond the ground truth but does not contradict it. (4) The main difference from the ground truth is emphasis: the original highlights Coca-Cola’s more granular disclosure (e.g., depreciation ranges) as evidence of structured asset lifecycle management, while the LLM focuses on operational implications of capitalizing improvements. This is a valid interpretation but omits the specific point about disclosure practices. Thus, while the core facts and reasoning are correct, the answer slightly misses the nuance in the original about disclosure transparency as a proxy for asset management strategy. Hence, correctness and qualitative accuracy are high but not perfect.",

According to the ground truth, AXP (American Express) reported 112 thousand loan accounts for Troubled Debt Restructurings in 2021, but the LLM incorrectly states 137 thousand. The PYPL (PayPal) figure of 3 thousand accounts for Loans and interest receivable is correct. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is based on incorrect input: 137k - 3k = 134k, which is mathematically correct but uses the wrong AXP value. The correct difference is 112k - 3k = 109k, not 134k. However, the original answer states the difference is 104k, which suggests either a typo in the ground truth or in the data source; assuming the ground truth is accurate, the expected calculation is 112k - 3k = 109k, which contradicts the stated 104k. This discrepancy may affect scoring, but based on the provided ground truth narrative, the intended difference is 104k, which does not align with the arithmetic. Despite this, the LLM’s use of 137k for AXP is definitively incorrect per the stated ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies both companies, the correct metric types, and performs a subtraction—but it fails at data retrieval for AXP. (4) Scores reflect major quantitative error (3/10), partially sound reasoning despite incorrect inputs (4/10), and high relevance as the answer addresses the right question with correct structure (9/10). The correctness score is low due to the critical error in the AXP account number, which invalidates the final result.",

The net deferred tax asset for Tesla is approximately correct ($9.9 billion vs. ground truth $9,882 million), and the valuation allowance ($0.9 billion vs. $892 million) is close, within acceptable rounding. However, the answer incorrectly states that Home Depot reports its deferred tax assets at 'essentially the gross amount' and implies they are positive, while the ground truth clearly states HD's net deferred tax asset is $(230) million (i.e., a net liability). This leads to a major error in the difference calculation: LLM claims Tesla's net assets are $9.9 billion greater, but the correct difference is $10,112 million ($9,882M - (-$230M) = $10,112M). The LLM fails to recognize HD’s negative value, leading to an incorrect comparison. (2) The calculation of the difference is therefore wrong. The LLM does not compute an actual numerical difference and understates it significantly. (3) The reasoning about tax strategies is partially sound but inverted for Tesla: the LLM claims Tesla 'released a large valuation allowance', which may be true, but interprets it as current confidence—this aligns somewhat with the strategy, but the original answer emphasizes TSLA's use of a valuation allowance to offset potential unrealizable benefits, not full confidence. In contrast, HD having no valuation allowance suggests confidence, not conservatism—the LLM incorrectly labels HD's approach as 'more conservative', which is the opposite of the correct interpretation. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both companies, the metric, and the strategy question. However, due to the critical error in interpreting HD’s net deferred tax position and the resulting miscalculation and misattribution of tax strategy, the correctness and qualitative accuracy scores are significantly reduced.

(2) There are no numeric values requiring calculation (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages), but the time ranges (3–7 years) are accurately reported. Format and references to page numbers do not affect factual accuracy. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM synthesizes information across two companies, correctly comparing revenue recognition timing (same: at transaction) and contract structure (different: fixed vs. flexible). (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention PayPal’s volume-based pricing (i.e., lower rates for higher volumes), which is a key qualitative nuance in the original answer. However, it implies this by referencing 'lower-rate, high-volume business.' This omission slightly affects completeness but not core correctness. Overall, the answer is factually precise, contextually relevant, and well-reasoned.",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's and Emerson Electric's 2023 customer advance positions reflect different dynamics in their respective customer payment arrangements?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar reported customer advances of $1,929 million in 2023, indicating it had received significant payments in advance from customers for equipment or services not yet fully delivered. In contrast, Emerson Electric showed customer advances of $(897) million in 2023, representing a liability position where the company had collected customer payments in advance but had not yet fulfilled the associated obligations. These contrasting figures reflect different working capital management approaches or contractual terms with their customers, with Caterpillar maintaining a larger advance payment position while Emerson operated with a net customer prepayment liability.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Caterpillar** – In 2023 the balance sheet shows **customer advances of $1.9 billion** (‑$1,929 m) 【page 61】. These advances arise because Caterpillar’s long‑term equipment and services contracts are often billed before the related revenue is earned, so customers pre‑pay or are invoiced in advance of performance.  \n\n- **Emerson Electric** – Its 2023 statement of contract balances reports **customer advances of $0.9 billion** (‑$897 m) 【page 48】. Emerson’s advances are smaller and stem from contracts where revenue is recognized over time (percentage‑of‑completion and software‑license arrangements); the billing schedule can exceed revenue recognized, but the overall exposure is less than Caterpillar’s.  \n\nThus, Caterpillar’s larger advance balance reflects a financing‑heavy, pre‑payment model for big‑ticket equipment, whereas Emerson’s modest advance balance reflects a mix of progress‑billing and upfront software licensing with less pre‑payment intensity.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It reports Caterpillar's customer advances as '$1.9 billion (‑$1,929 m)', which incorrectly applies a negative sign. The ground truth states Caterpillar had $1,929 million in customer advances — a positive asset/liability reflecting cash received in advance. Similarly, for Emerson Electric, the LLM writes 'customer advances of $0.9 billion (‑$897 m)', again applying a negative sign incorrectly. The original answer clarifies that Emerson’s $(897) million is a liability, but the parentheses in GAAP denote negative value or net liability, not that the amount itself is negative. By writing '‑$897 m', the LLM misrepresents the accounting notation and could imply an outflow or reduction, which distorts the meaning. These sign errors are material in financial reporting.\n\n2) Despite these errors, the absolute values are correct: $1,929 million for Caterpillar and $897 million for Emerson. The years (2023) and entities (Caterpillar, Emerson Electric) are accurate, and the page references align with the source documents.\n\n3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that Caterpillar’s model involves large pre-payments due to long-term equipment contracts, while Emerson’s smaller advances relate to progress billing and software licensing. It captures the contrast in business models and contractual dynamics well, showing good multi-hop synthesis between the two companies’ revenue recognition practices.\n\n4) Contextually, the answer is highly relevant, addressing the core question about differing customer payment arrangements. However, the incorrect use of negative signs undermines the quantitative accuracy, especially since the original answer emphasizes that Emerson’s $(897) million is a liability (i.e., obligation to deliver), not a negative cash receipt. The LLM confuses presentation format with value sign.\n\nOverall, the answer gets key facts and reasoning right but fails on precise financial representation, warranting a moderate correctness score.",

      "question": "How do Merck's recognition of $4.0 billion in upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses and CVS's amortization of upfront payments over contract terms reflect differences in their respective business models and contractual relationships with partners?",
      "original_answer": "Merck recognized $4.0 billion in upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses in 2023 due to the nature of its pharmaceutical collaboration agreements, where such payments do not result in additional intellectual property rights and are tied to ongoing clinical studies that are highly likely to continue. This reflects a business model centered on drug development partnerships where upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In contrast, CVS defers and amortizes upfront payments received from vendors over the life of the contract based on sales volume or on a straight-line basis, depending on whether the payments are linked to purchase commitments. This reflects CVS's business model as a pharmacy services and retail provider with ongoing vendor relationships tied directly to product sales volume. The difference in accounting approaches highlights how Merck's payments are tied to development risk and innovation, while CVS's payments are tied to stable, volume-based supply chain agreements.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck’s $4 billion upfront payment to Daiichi Sankyo was recorded as a pretax charge to research‑and‑development in the period it was paid because the money was made to secure development rights and fund ongoing clinical studies—costs that are integral to Merck’s drug‑discovery and co‑development business model and that are not expected to be recovered if the programs terminate 【page_91】.  \n\nIn contrast, CVS treats upfront payments it receives from drug manufacturers as “upfront payments linked to purchase commitments” that are first deferred and then amortized over the life of the supply contracts, reducing cost of products sold on a straight‑line or volume‑based basis 【page_134】. This reflects CVS’s role as a pharmacy‑benefit manager and retailer that earns revenue by spreading vendor‑provided incentives over the term of its distribution and rebate agreements rather than incurring R&D costs.",

(2) The entities are correct: Merck and CVS are accurately identified, and the reference to Daiichi Sankyo, while not in the original answer, is factually accurate based on public knowledge and adds specificity without introducing error. (3) The reasoning correctly explains Merck’s immediate expensing of upfront payments as R&D due to the nature of drug development partnerships and non-recoverability of costs, which reflects its innovation-driven business model.

(4) The LLM captures the core contrast: Merck incurs R&D costs tied to development risk, while CVS receives and amortizes vendor payments linked to sales volume. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer emphasizes Merck’s payments do not result in additional IP rights, a nuance not mentioned in the LLM response.

In contrast, TSLA elects not to present short-term leases (12 months or less) on the balance sheet, recognizing only long-term lease assets and liabilities.

      "original_answer": "Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations because a stronger U.S. dollar reduces the dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales, especially when it chooses not to raise international pricing. This directly affects its gross margins. Intel, on the other hand, manages gross margin volatility through its inventory valuation methodology, which involves forecasting demand and writing off excess or obsolete inventory when demand forecasts exceed actual demand. This impacts gross margins by adjusting the cost of goods sold based on inventory write-offs and manufacturing output decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple notes that most of its sales are outside the United States, so the U.S.‑dollar value of its foreign‑currency‑denominated revenue and of the components it purchases can change with exchange‑rate moves. A weaker foreign currency lowers the dollar‑value of those sales and may force Apple to raise prices (or keep prices unchanged and absorb the loss), both of which can compress the gross‑margin it earns on foreign sales; a stronger foreign currency can have the opposite effect but may also raise component costs or generate derivative losses that erode margins 【page_19】.  \n\nIntel says it values inventory by comparing demand forecasts with work‑in‑process and finished‑goods levels and writes off any excess or obsolete stock. Because the cost of goods sold is adjusted through these write‑offs, the company can align inventory costs with actual demand and thereby smooth out fluctuations in cost of sales, helping to limit gross‑margin volatility 【page_82】.",

However, it fails to explicitly state Disney's $4.1 billion collateral receipts or calculate the $3.388 billion difference between the two amounts, which are key components of the question. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised: while Verizon’s $712 million payment is correctly cited, Disney’s $4.1 billion receipts are only qualitatively described as 'collateral receipts' without specifying the amount. The difference of $3.388 billion is not mentioned or computed, missing a required calculation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in interpreting the meaning of net receipts vs. net payments and correctly attributing them to Disney and Verizon respectively, showing good synthesis across entities.

CVS, as a pharmacy benefit manager, administers prescription drug plans and manages pharmacy networks. This means that Merck's pharmaceutical products likely flow through the supply chain to be distributed via CVS’s network of pharmacies to patients covered under prescription drug plans administered by CVS. Thus, Merck operates as a pharmaceutical manufacturer and supplier, while CVS operates as a downstream manager and distributor of those pharmaceutical products within the healthcare ecosystem.",

(1) It correctly identifies Merck as a pharmaceutical manufacturer that sells human health products to various intermediaries, including pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), citing its 2023 10-K (page 46). It accurately describes CVS’s role as a PBM that administers prescription drug plans, manages formularies, negotiates rebates, and processes claims (page 193). (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer requiring quantitative verification; thus, quantitative accuracy is not applicable but assumed perfect due to absence of numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that Merck’s products enter the supply chain where CVS, as a PBM, plays a downstream role in formulary placement, rebate negotiation, and patient delivery via affiliated pharmacies—this synthesizes information across both companies’ 10-Ks logically. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly overemphasizes CVS’s direct negotiation and formulary role without explicitly stating that distribution occurs through CVS’s network to patients under health plans it administers—this nuance is present in the original answer but implied rather than stated in the LLM version. However, the core interaction is accurately captured. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent. All entities (Merck, CVS, PBM, 2023 10-K) are correct.

      "original_answer": "Tesla manages its customer receivables through Variable Interest Entity (VIE) arrangements, where it consolidates the financial position and results of operations of these VIEs into its financial statements. Tesla's VIE agreements grant it the power to manage and make decisions affecting the operation of these entities, including managing customer receivables, while fund investors have more protective rights. In contrast, Home Depot addresses credit risk related to its customer receivables through a valuation allowance, which was explicitly stated as not being material to its consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. This indicates that Tesla assumes more direct control and operational involvement in receivables management through third-party arrangements, while Home Depot relies on internal reserves to mitigate credit risk, suggesting a more self-contained and conservative risk management framework.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla isolates the cash‑flow risk of its solar‑energy and vehicle contracts by placing the underlying customer receivables in variable‑interest entities (VIEs) that it controls as the primary beneficiary; the VIEs own the receivables, and fund investors – not Tesla’s general creditors – bear any loss, with Tesla only guaranteeing certain payments and retaining the option to repurchase the investors’ interests. In contrast, Home Depot keeps its customer‑credit balances on its own books, evaluates credit quality through a routine allowance analysis (the allowance was “not material”), and manages risk with internal credit‑policy controls rather than by transferring the receivables to separate entities. Together, the two approaches show that Tesla relies on a structural, off‑balance‑sheet risk‑transfer framework, while Home Depot employs a conventional on‑balance‑sheet credit‑risk management model.",

(1) Quantitatively, there are no numbers, dates, or dollar amounts in the original or LLM answer, so no discrepancies exist—this criterion is fully satisfied. (2) The LLM correctly identifies Tesla’s use of VIEs to manage customer receivables, noting that Tesla acts as primary beneficiary, controls the VIEs, and insulates its general creditors from loss, which aligns with the ground truth’s description of Tesla consolidating VIEs and having decision-making power. It also accurately contrasts this with Home Depot’s approach: keeping receivables on its own books and using a non-material allowance, consistent with the original answer’s mention of a non-material valuation allowance in fiscal 2022 and 2023. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly synthesizing Tesla’s structural, off-balance-sheet risk management via third-party VIEs versus Home Depot’s on-balance-sheet, reserve-based, internal control model. The conclusion that Tesla uses a structural risk-transfer framework while Home Depot uses a conventional, self-contained model is semantically equivalent to the ground truth’s characterization. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the LLM slightly overstates the off-balance-sheet nature of Tesla’s VIEs—since Tesla consolidates them, the entities are *on* the balance sheet in accounting terms, even if risk is isolated. The original answer correctly notes consolidation, while the LLM’s 'off-balance-sheet' phrasing, though common in finance parlance, is technically imprecise. This is a nuanced but important distinction in financial reporting. Despite this, the overall factual correctness, reasoning, and relevance are excellent.",

      "original_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive disclosed that the estimated fair value of its long-term debt was $7,433 million as of December 31, 2024, while the carrying value was higher at $7,941 million, indicating a discount in the market valuation of its debt. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, reported a significantly higher fair value of long-term debt at $38,052 million as of the same date. Coca-Cola’s disclosure also included context about the use of interest rate swaps to manage fair value exposure due to changes in benchmark interest rates, which directly affects the valuation of its debt. Additionally, Coca-Cola extinguished $485 million of long-term debt in 2024, resulting in a $22 million gain, suggesting active debt portfolio management. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive’s disclosure focused solely on valuation methodology without mentioning active debt restructuring or hedging activities. These differences indicate that while both companies report fair value for long-term debt, Coca-Cola’s disclosures suggest a more dynamic debt management strategy involving interest rate hedging and proactive debt retirement, whereas Colgate-Palmolive’s approach appears more static in terms of valuation and reporting.",

It also reports that it voluntarily retired $485 million of debt before maturity, recognizing a $22 million gain, and shows a separate “fair‑value adjustments” line that reflects changes in benchmark rates 【page_91】.  By contrast, Coca‑Cola’s filing does not break out a fair‑value adjustment or reference swap‑related rate adjustments, nor does it disclose any early‑extinguishment gain, indicating a more static presentation of its debt portfolio and less emphasis on active swap hedging or premature retirements in its debt‑management strategy 【page_122】.",

      "original_answer": "The difference in the 2024 healthcare cost trend rate assumption between DIS and VZ impacts their respective financial obligations related to postretirement medical plans by influencing the estimated future benefit payments and liabilities. VZ assumes a 2024 healthcare cost trend rate of 8.80%, which is significantly higher than the 4.50% rate to which it will gradually decline after 2034. This high initial assumption increases VZ’s projected healthcare costs and long-term liabilities. Meanwhile, DIS acknowledges that assumptions like the healthcare cost trend rate significantly affect reported net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations, though it does not specify its own rate. However, DIS also estimates $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts, which directly reduces its net future benefit payments. Therefore, while both companies are impacted by healthcare cost trend assumptions, VZ’s higher assumed rate increases its financial burden, whereas DIS benefits from subsidies that offset some of its obligations.",

However, it incorrectly states that DIS used a 7.0% rate in 2024, while the original answer (ground truth) explicitly says DIS does not specify its rate. This is a significant factual error. The LLM cites DIS 10-K p. 108 as the source for the 7.0% rate, but since the ground truth — derived from a verified knowledge graph of actual filings — confirms DIS does not disclose its specific rate, the 7.0% figure is unsupported and incorrect. (2) The calculation of a '1.8-percentage-point difference' (8.8% - 7.0% = 1.8%) is mathematically correct but based on a false premise, as DIS’s rate is not actually 7.0%. Thus, while the arithmetic is sound, the input data is flawed, undermining quantitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning that a higher trend rate increases projected benefit payments and liabilities is correct and reflects sound multi-hop logic regarding actuarial assumptions. The comparison between DIS and VZ is framed appropriately in terms of relative financial obligations. However, the LLM fails to mention DIS’s $36 million expected Medicare subsidy receipts — a key offsetting factor in its financial obligations highlighted in the ground truth. This omission reduces completeness and weakens the qualitative accuracy. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core issue: how differing trend rates affect postretirement obligations. Despite incorrect numbers and missing key context about subsidies, the overall structure and intent align with the question.

This is calculated as the average of Johnson & Johnson's 3.6% growth and Medtronic's 5% growth ((3.6 + 5) / 2 = 4.3%).

This is a critical error, as the absence of threshold awards is central to the comparison. Additionally, the LLM fabricates a maximum level of ~9.8 million shares and a grant-date fair value of $47/share, which are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the context provided. (2) Completeness: While the LLM attempts to describe both companies' PSU structures, it misses the core differentiator — that KO has threshold-level awards (1.725 million) while PEP has none — and instead invents structural details not in the ground truth. The mention of Coca-Cola’s 'emerging-stronger' two-year EPS-only PSUs and Monte-Carlo valuation, while possibly true, are not part of the original answer and distract from the main comparison. (3) Entity Accuracy: The companies (KO and PEP) and general topic (PSU structures) are correct, and the time frame (2021) is appropriately referenced.

The ground truth explicitly states that Coca-Cola does not disclose an exact percentage and only mentions that 'a majority' of the segment's revenues come from finished product operations. This 44% figure is fabricated and not supported by the source data. PepsiCo's 40% figure is correctly reported. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised due to the invented 44% figure for Coca-Cola. There is no calculation or sourcing justification for this number, and it misrepresents the actual disclosure. The only correct numeric value is PepsiCo's 40%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model incorrectly assumes Coca-Cola provides a precise revenue split, when in fact it does not. The core of the question hinges on the contrast between Coca-Cola's lack of a specific percentage and PepsiCo's explicit disclosure — a nuance the LLM answer misses entirely by inventing data. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and segments and attempts a comparison, but the introduction of false quantitative data undermines the entire response. The qualitative reasoning is flawed due to incorrect entity disclosures (attributing a precise percentage to KO that it does not report).",

According to the ground truth, Alphabet's growth in Total Income from Operations exceeded Meta's by $11,749 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states that Alphabet’s growth was $8.36 billion smaller than Meta’s, which is the opposite of the correct conclusion. (2) The LLM provides specific numbers: Alphabet’s income increased from $74,842M to $84,293M — a difference of $9,451M ($9.45B), which is accurate. Meta’s income increased from $28,944M to $46,751M — a difference of $17,807M ($17.81B), also accurate. However, the comparison is wrong: the correct difference in growth is $17,807M - $9,451M = $8,356M, meaning Meta’s growth exceeded Alphabet’s by $8.36B. But the ground truth claims Alphabet’s growth exceeded Meta’s by $11,749M — which contradicts both the LLM’s calculation and the implied data. This suggests either the ground truth is incorrect or the LLM used wrong data. Given the evaluation must follow the ground truth as authoritative, and the LLM’s calculation based on its input data is internally consistent, the LLM should have arrived at a result matching the ground truth if its inputs were correct. Since it does not, and since the LLM uses different base numbers than implied by the ground truth, there is a data sourcing error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning requires correctly identifying the metric (Total Income from Operations), extracting values for both companies for 2022 and 2023, computing year-over-year changes, then comparing the two deltas. The LLM identifies the correct metric and years, but either uses incorrect data or misattributes the direction of the difference. The final conclusion contradicts the ground truth. (4) Despite correct formatting and structure, the answer is factually wrong per the knowledge graph. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect final comparison and potential input data mismatch.

JNJ reported $7.1 billion in Neuroscience sales, reflecting a 3.6% increase driven by growth in SPRAVATO sales due to ongoing launches, increased physician confidence, and patient demand. MDT’s Neuroscience sales reached $8,959 million, representing a 5% increase year-over-year. Together, these results indicate that both companies benefited from strong performance in their respective Neuroscience portfolios, with JNJ focusing on esketamine-based therapies and MDT on neuromodulation and related technologies.",

The combined increase in Neuroscience-related sales is reported as roughly $0.5 billion ($500 million), but the ground truth states it is $715 million. The LLM incorrectly calculates Medtronic’s (MDT) increase as $247 million (from $6.893B to $7.140B), but MDT’s actual 2023 Neuroscience sales were $8,959 million (i.e., $8.959B), not $7.140B, representing a much larger increase. The LLM also misattributes product dynamics: it claims Medtronic had an 84% surge in SPRAVATO sales and a 21% rise in CONCERTA, but SPRAVATO is a Johnson & Johnson product, not Medtronic’s, and CONCERTA is not a Medtronic product at all. These are critical entity and product misattributions. (2) Calculations are flawed: JNJ’s increase from $6.85B to $7.1B is approximately $250M, which aligns with a 3.6% growth and matches the ground truth directionally, so that part is acceptable. However, MDT’s actual increase should be from ~$8,532 million (2022: $8,959M / 1.05 ≈ $8.532B) to $8,959M, which is about $427M, not $247M. The combined increase should be ~$250M + $427M = $677M, close to the stated $715M (minor variance possibly due to rounding or additional products). But the LLM’s $500M total is significantly off. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize data across JNJ and MDT. It incorrectly assigns pharmaceutical product dynamics (SPRAVATO, CONCERTA) to Medtronic, a medical device company focused on neuromodulation, not CNS drugs. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the companies’ business models and product portfolios. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major numerical and entity errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) due to incorrect base figures and totals. Qualitative accuracy is partially correct (4/10) as JNJ’s SPRAVATO narrative is accurate, but MDT’s product dynamics are entirely wrong.

These numbers are not present in the original answer and are therefore factually incorrect. There is no mention in the ground truth of such line-item adjustments or netting-adjustment tables with these values, making the quantitative claims fabricated or misattributed.

While the qualitative description of Coca-Cola using CDS spreads for nonperformance risk (applying counterparty CDS for assets, own for liabilities) aligns with the original answer, and PepsiCo’s use of CDS rates as part of credit risk assessment is correctly noted, the erroneous insertion of specific financial figures undermines the correctness. The conclusion that the combined impact is 'negligible' is reasonable given the ground truth’s emphasis on immateriality, but it is based on false quantitative premises.

The original answer specifies raw dollar amounts (e.g., $590,892, not $590,892 million), so the LLM's addition of 'million' inflates the values by a factor of 1,000,000, making the numbers grossly inaccurate. For example, ACN's 2024 lease assets are $590,892, not $590,892 million. This error propagates through all calculations. (2) The 2024 total is correctly summed as $591,133 in the ground truth, but the LLM reports $591,133 million, which is wrong. The 2023 total in the LLM answer is incorrectly calculated: $434,179 million + $285 million = $434,464 million, but the LLM states 'about $434,464 million', which is numerically correct only if the 'million' unit were valid — but it is not. The ground truth 2023 total is $434,179 + $285 = $434,464, not $719,179 as stated in the original answer. Wait — correction: the original answer states 2023 total is $719,179, but $434,179 + $285 = $434,464, which contradicts the ground truth. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth. However, per instructions, we treat the original answer as ground truth. Therefore, the LLM must match it. But the LLM reports $434,464 million, which does not match the ground truth $719,179.

(1) The numbers provided are factually wrong: the ground truth states KO's maximum award level is $175.182 million (9,759,000 shares at $47.04 per share), not 3 million shares, and PEP's is $92 million, not 2 million shares. The LLM incorrectly reports share counts instead of the required dollar-value difference in unvested share-based compensation. (2) The calculation is therefore invalid: the claimed '1 million share' difference does not match the actual data and fails to compute the monetary difference as required. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the question asks for the difference in maximum award levels in terms of dollar value of unvested share-based compensation, not number of shares. The LLM failed to extract the correct financial values from the 10-Ks or convert share counts to dollar amounts using grant date fair value. (4) While the entities (KO and PEP) and the document type (2022 10-K) are correct, and the response attempts to address the question structure, it fundamentally misunderstands the metric required.

Accenture’s Net Income for 2024 is $7,419,197, while Texas Instruments’ Net Income is $4,799 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Accenture's Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), net of tax, is $188,359 (in thousands), which equals $188.359 million, not $188.4 million as stated—this is a minor rounding issue and acceptable. However, Texas Instruments' OCI is reported as $65 million in the LLM answer, but the ground truth specifies $65 (not million), meaning $65, or $0.065 million. This is a critical error: the LLM inflated TXN's OCI by a factor of 1 million. The combined OCI should be approximately $188.359 million + $0.065 million = $188.424 million, not 'about $188.5 million' as claimed. The LLM incorrectly treats TXN's $65 as $65 million. (2) Net Incomes are reasonably approximated: Accenture’s $7.42 billion vs. actual $7,419,197,000 (~$7.42B) is accurate; TXN’s $4.80 billion vs. $4,799 million ($4.799B) is also acceptable. However, the comparison of combined OCI to Net Income is flawed. The LLM states combined OCI is 'about 2-3% of Accenture’s profit' and '1-2% of TXN’s profit', but the correct combined OCI (~$188.424M) is only about 2.54% of Accenture’s net income and 3.93% of TXN’s—still in the ballpark, but the more critical error is that the question asks for the sum compared to their *combined* net income. Combined net income is ~$12.218B; combined OCI ~$188.424M is about 1.54%, not the 0.25% in the ground truth. Wait—this reveals a discrepancy: the ground truth claims combined OCI is 0.25% of combined net income, but $189,024 / $12,218,197,000 ≈ 0.00155% (not 0.25%). Actually, $189,024 / $12.218B ≈ 0.00155 or 0.155%, which is closer to 0.15%, not 0.25%. So the ground truth may have a calculation error. However, the LLM does not compute the correct combined comparison at all—it compares OCI to each company’s net income separately, not the combined total as asked. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model identifies both companies, the correct metric (OCI, net of tax), and net income for 2024. But it fails to correctly interpret TXN’s $65 as nominal (not million), and does not compute the correct sum or the correct comparative percentage relative to *combined* net income. (4) Despite these issues, the qualitative insight—that OCI is small relative to net income—is correct, and the entities, years, and metrics are properly identified. Contextual relevance is high. However, due to the major error in TXN’s OCI magnitude and incorrect comparative analysis, the correctness score is reduced to 6, with quantitative accuracy at 5 due to the million-fold error in TXN’s OCI.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing's financial exposure is highly sensitive to changes in gross margins, where a 1% change in margin could result in a $330 million impact on operating earnings due to its reliance on firm orders and complex estimation process for program profitability. Raytheon, with a $78 billion defense backlog as of December 31, 2023, also depends on firm orders to drive future revenue and operational planning. A decline in firm orders would reduce Raytheon’s future revenue visibility and could impact its ability to manage long-term contracts efficiently, while Boeing would face direct earnings volatility due to its margin sensitivity and program cost structures. Together, both companies face significant financial risk if firm orders decrease, though the mechanisms differ—Boeing through margin volatility and Raytheon through reduced backlog conversion.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s earnings are highly sensitive to the assumptions it makes about firm orders because those orders drive the estimated program‑gross‑margin percentages; a 1 % swing in the combined commercial‑airplane margin—which can be triggered by a change in firm‑order volume—would alter operating earnings by roughly **$330 million** (see the 1 % margin impact note on page 49).  \n\nRaytheon’s exposure is measured by the size of its **$78 billion defense backlog** (the aggregate value of firm orders as of 12/31/23); any increase or decrease in firm‑order flow therefore affects a far larger base of future contract revenue, meaning the financial impact of order changes can run into **billions of dollars** rather than a few hundred‑million‑dollar swing.",

According to the ground truth, the difference between ACN and TXN is $1,953 million. However, the LLM calculates a difference of only $950 million, which is substantially off. The LLM states TXN has $3.37 billion in commitments and ACN has $2.42 billion, resulting in a $950 million difference. These individual totals are inconsistent with the ground truth, suggesting errors in data extraction from the 2024 10-K filings. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because both the component values and the final difference are incorrect. Even allowing for format variations, the numbers do not align with the correct committed payments. The calculation itself (subtracting $2.42B from $3.37B) is arithmetically correct, but based on wrong inputs. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—multi-hop synthesis is attempted by extracting commitments from both companies and computing a difference—but the underlying data is inaccurate, undermining the conclusion.

In contrast, UPS specifically excludes five distinct categories: goodwill and asset impairment charges, a one-time compensation payment to supervisors, a regulatory matter expense, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal expense, and defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses.

The reasoning and synthesis are logically sound and relevant, drawing a meaningful contrast between MMM’s generalized approach and UPS’s itemized one, but the LLM incorrectly attributes a detailed exclusion list to MMM, undermining the core factual accuracy.

      "question": "How did the tax refunds from the CARES Act impact Boeing's (BA) liquidity in 2021 compared to Union Pacific's (UNP) net tax payments to authorities in 2021, and what was the resulting difference in their respective tax-related cash flows?",
      "original_answer": "Boeing received $1.7 billion in tax refunds under the CARES Act in 2021, significantly improving its liquidity. In contrast, Union Pacific had a net tax payment of $12 million to taxing authorities in 2021. The difference in their tax-related cash flows was $1,712 million, with Boeing benefiting substantially from the tax provision while Union Pacific experienced a smaller outflow.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s 2021 cash‑flow statement shows that the CARES‑Act loss‑carryback provision generated a **$1.7 billion tax refund**, which added that amount to the company’s liquidity. In contrast, Union Pacific’s 2021 cash‑flow statement records **net cash payments of about $1.2 billion to tax authorities**, which reduced its liquidity. Consequently, the tax‑related cash‑flow effect differed by roughly **$2.9 billion** – a $1.7 billion inflow for Boeing versus a $1.2 billion outflow for Union Pacific.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial figures. While it correctly states that Boeing received a $1.7 billion tax refund from the CARES Act in 2021, it incorrectly reports Union Pacific's net tax payment as $1.2 billion instead of the correct $12 million. This leads to a grossly inaccurate difference in tax-related cash flows: the LLM calculates $2.9 billion ($1.7B inflow + $1.2B outflow), whereas the correct difference is $1,712 million ($1,700M + $12M). (2) Number verification: Boeing's $1.7B refund is accurate; UNP's actual net tax payment was $12 million (not $1.2B); the correct cash flow difference is $1,712 million, not $2.9 billion. The LLM overstates UNP's outflow by a factor of 100. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to compare tax-related cash flows between two companies and compute a net difference—but the conclusion is invalid due to incorrect data. The synthesis across entities (Boeing and Union Pacific) and the directional analysis (inflow vs outflow) are conceptually appropriate. (4) Correctness and quantitative accuracy are severely penalized due to the magnitude of the numerical error. Qualitative accuracy is partially preserved due to correct identification of companies, years, and the nature of the tax events. Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses all parts of the question and uses appropriate financial reasoning, despite factual inaccuracies.",

      "original_answer": "PEP reported that in 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, represented approximately 13% of its consolidated net revenue, with this revenue generated across all divisions, including concentrate sales to independent bottlers used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. Sam's Club, as a segment of Walmart, receives the majority of its non-fuel merchandise through 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically across the U.S., along with some shared Walmart U.S. distribution facilities. This robust and strategically placed distribution infrastructure enables Sam's Club to efficiently receive and stock merchandise, including PEP's products, at scale. As a result, this infrastructure supports Walmart's ability to serve as a major customer for PEP, facilitating the consistent flow of products necessary to sustain PEP's significant revenue dependency on this customer relationship.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) All key facts are correct: the 13% revenue dependency of PEP on Walmart and its affiliates in 2021 is accurately cited, and the role of Sam's Club’s 28 dedicated distribution facilities (plus shared Walmart facilities) is correctly described. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the percentage (13%), the number of facilities (28), and the year (2021) match the original answer exactly. Format variations (e.g., % symbol, spacing) are acceptable and do not affect meaning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links PEP’s revenue dependency to Walmart/Sam’s Club with the logistical infrastructure that enables efficient product distribution and stocking, thereby supporting sustained sales volume. The answer explains how the distribution network facilitates consistent product availability, which underpins the revenue relationship. (4) The only minor shortcoming is a slight omission of the detail about concentrate sales to independent bottlers who then sell finished goods to Walmart—this nuance in the revenue chain is present in the original but not mentioned in the LLM response.

It reports $20,524 million (i.e., $20.524 billion) for ACN's non-U.S. pension plan contributions, which is off by a factor of 1,000—ground truth is $20,524 (not million). Similarly, TXN's participant contributions are stated as $13 million, but the correct amount is $13,024—again, missing the full figure and incorrectly rounding down. The final sum is $20,537 million ($20.5 billion), which is grossly incorrect; the true total is $33,548. (2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: all numbers are either misstated in magnitude (adding 'million' where not present) or truncated. The calculation itself (adding two numbers) is arithmetically correct but based on wrong inputs, leading to a nonsensical result. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model identifies the correct entities (ACN non-U.S. pension plans and TXN U.S. retiree health care) and the right metric (participant contributions for 2024). However, it fails to extract the correct values from the source data, undermining the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the structure, entities, and intent align with the question.

However, the final combined total is incorrect: the LLM calculates $405M + $3,986M = $4,391M, but this arithmetic is wrong. The correct sum is $4,391M → $405 + $3,986 = $4,391 is accurate mathematically, yet the ground truth claims the combined obligation is $4,773 million, which contradicts the component values. Upon verification: $405M (MMM) + $3,986M (UPS) = $4,391M — so either the ground truth or the LLM's source data may have inconsistencies. However, per the provided ground truth, the expected answer is $4,773M, implying a discrepancy in the data. (2) All individual numbers are factually correct as per the LLM’s reporting: MMM $405M, UPS finance $351M, operating $3,635M, total UPS $3,986M. The addition error is not in the LLM’s math but potentially in the ground truth’s final sum. $405 + $3,986 = $4,391, not $4,773. The ground truth appears to contain a calculation error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts long-term lease obligations by subtracting current portions from total liabilities (implied), and aggregates across entities. (4) Despite correct component values and proper logic, the LLM’s final total diverges from the stated ground truth ($4,391M vs $4,773M), which lowers the correctness score. However, the LLM’s calculation is mathematically accurate based on inputs, suggesting the ground truth may be flawed.

      "question": "Considering the different hedging strategies described by Netflix and Google, how do the impacts of their respective hedging gains of $124 million and $211 million in 2024 compare relative to their international revenue exposures, and what does this suggest about their foreign exchange risk management approaches?",
      "original_answer": "In 2024, Netflix reported hedging gains of $124 million, which were included in 'Streaming revenues' and primarily related to foreign exchange hedges on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing/production costs denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Google reported hedging gains of $211 million as part of its total revenues of $350,018 million, reflecting gains from its foreign exchange risk management activities. Netflix's hedging directly impacts both revenue and cost of revenues depending on the nature of the hedged item, while Google's hedging gains appear as a separate line item before being incorporated into total revenues. Given that Netflix's international revenue (excluding the U.S. and Canada) accounted for the majority of its streaming revenue, the $124 million gain suggests a more targeted approach to managing revenue volatility from foreign exchange movements. Google's larger hedging gains relative to Netflix, despite having a much larger revenue base, may indicate a more extensive or aggressive hedging program to manage its global exposure across multiple business lines.",
      "llm_answer": "Google reported a hedging gain of **$211 million** for 2024, while its international sales – the portion of revenue earned outside the United States – represent roughly **51 % of its $350 billion total revenue** (about $180 billion). Netflix’s hedging gain was **$124 million**, and its streaming revenue (the line‑item that includes the hedge) is roughly $31 billion, of which the majority is earned internationally (well over half of the total).  \n\nBecause the Google hedge adds only about **0.12 %** of its international revenue, it reflects a relatively modest, “partial‑coverage” approach, whereas the Netflix hedge represents roughly **0.5‑0.6 %** of its international streaming revenue, indicating a more aggressive hedge relative to its foreign‑exchange exposure. This suggests Netflix relies more heavily on hedging to smooth FX volatility, while Google’s larger, more diversified revenue base allows it to tolerate a smaller hedge impact.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer captures the core comparison between Netflix and Google's hedging gains relative to their international revenue exposures and draws reasonable conclusions about their risk management approaches, showing good contextual understanding and multi-hop reasoning. However, there are notable quantitative inaccuracies that reduce the correctness score. First, the LLM states Google's total revenue as $350 billion, while the original answer specifies $350,018 million — though this is approximately correct, the precision is slightly off. More significantly, the LLM calculates Google's international revenue as 51% of total revenue (~$180B), but this percentage and calculation are not present in the original answer and appear to be an unsupported assumption; the ground truth does not provide Google's international revenue percentage, so this figure is speculative. Similarly, the LLM estimates Netflix's streaming revenue as $31 billion, which is not stated in the original answer and introduces a factual assumption. While the relative impact of the hedging gains (0.12% for Google, 0.5–0.6% for Netflix) is logically derived, these percentages are based on unverified revenue figures, undermining quantitative accuracy. The qualitative insight — that Netflix appears to hedge more aggressively relative to its exposure while Google may take a more diversified, partial-coverage approach — aligns well with the original answer’s interpretation and shows sound reasoning. The entities (Netflix, Google, 2024, hedging gains of $124M and $211M) are correctly identified, and the answer addresses all parts of the question. Thus, while the reasoning and relevance are strong, the use of unsupported numerical assumptions lowers the quantitative accuracy, warranting a 7 for overall correctness.",

While the answer correctly identifies that both companies incurred fees related to corporate separations in 2023, the individual amounts are inaccurate. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are critical: even if the numbers were approximate, the sum ($145M + $115M = $260M) is not close to the ground truth of $154M. There is no indication that the $154M total is derived from partial or overlapping disclosures; thus, the individual figures must align with this total. The LLM fails this check.

      "question": "How do Cisco and Intel each account for the variability in their respective cooperative marketing programs when recognizing revenue, and what specific financial impacts do these estimates have on their financial statements?",
      "original_answer": "Cisco accounts for variability in its cooperative marketing programs by estimating expected usage of these programs, applying either the expected value or most likely estimate method, and updates these estimates at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. This directly impacts their revenue recognition, as deviations from these estimates could adversely affect revenue. Intel, on the other hand, participates in cooperative advertising and marketing programs that partially reimburse customers for marketing activities, and these expenses are accounted for as part of their operating expenditures. While Intel does not explicitly quantify the variability impact, these programs are subject to defined criteria and influence marketing spend forecasting and brand investment returns.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Cisco** – In its revenue‑recognition policy Cisco treats the rebates, co‑op marketing credits and other incentive programs as *variable consideration*.  At each reporting date it estimates the expected usage of those programs (using an expected‑value or most‑likely‑estimate approach) and records revenue net of that estimate, updating the estimate as actual utilization becomes known.  The company warns that a material deviation of actual credits from the estimate would reduce the amount of revenue reported ( see Cisco MD&A ‑ Critical Accounting Estimates, page 36 ).\n\n- **Intel** – Intel’s cooperative advertising and marketing programs reimburse customers for marketing activities that feature Intel’s brand.  Intel estimates the amount of those reimbursements and records them as a reduction to revenue (i.e., a variable‑consideration offset) when the program is earned, so the estimate directly lowers the gross revenue figure shown in the statements.  The size of the estimate therefore determines the net revenue reported ( see Intel MD&A ‑ Co‑operative advertising and marketing programs, page 66 ).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is factually accurate in its description of Cisco's accounting treatment, correctly identifying that Cisco treats cooperative marketing programs as variable consideration, uses expected value or most likely estimate methods, updates estimates periodically, and that deviations can reduce reported revenue. This aligns fully with the original answer and includes a specific reference to Cisco's MD&A (page 36), enhancing credibility. However, the LLM answer incorrectly states that Intel records its cooperative marketing reimbursements as a reduction to revenue (i.e., as a variable-consideration offset). The original answer clarifies that Intel accounts for these programs as operating expenditures, not as a reduction of revenue. This is a significant qualitative error because it misrepresents Intel’s financial statement treatment—impacting whether the expense affects the top line (revenue) or operating expenses (SG&A). While the LLM correctly notes that Intel estimates reimbursements and that these affect financial reporting, the assertion that they reduce gross revenue contradicts the ground truth. There are no numerical figures in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. Contextually, the response is well-structured and relevant, addressing both companies and the financial impact as required. The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound but fails in cross-entity synthesis for Intel. Thus, the correctness score is reduced due to a key factual inaccuracy in financial statement classification for Intel, even though the rest of the reasoning and structure is strong.",

      "original_answer": "Both General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) include lease pre-payments in the calculation of right-of-use (ROU) assets, but the specific language and emphasis on how these pre-payments are incorporated differ. GD explicitly states that lease pre-payments are part of the ROU asset calculation along with deferred rent and initial direct costs. RTX confirms that lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date are included in the ROU asset, which is also adjusted for lease incentives received. The treatment is largely consistent under ASC 842, but the emphasis on initial direct costs and incentives is more detailed in RTX’s disclosure.",
      "llm_answer": "- **General Dynamics (GD)** – In its lease‑accounting note GD states that the right‑of‑use (ROU) asset is measured as the present value of lease payments **plus any deferred rent, lease pre‑payments and initial‑direct‑costs** (see GD 10‑K p. 72).\n\n- **Raytheon Technologies (RTX)** – RTX’s 2022 filing does not add lease pre‑payments to the ROU‑asset calculation; the lease note only references the present value of lease payments (and, where applicable, initial‑direct costs) and makes no mention of including pre‑payments.  \n\nThus, GD treats lease pre‑payments as a component of the ROU asset, whereas RTX does not incorporate lease pre‑payments in its ROU‑asset measurement.",

This matches the ground truth. However, the percentage comparison is slightly off: the LLM states 'roughly 55%' while the correct value is approximately 53.96%. This discrepancy affects quantitative accuracy. Additionally, stating the combined cost is '$18 billion lower' than NFLX's revenue is misleading—it implies a difference of $18B, but the actual difference is ~$17.957B, and more importantly, the question asks for a comparison in terms of proportion, not absolute difference. (2) All numbers are factually correct, and the sum is accurate. The calculation of the percentage should be (21,043,945 / 39,000,966) ≈ 53.96%, but the LLM approximates it to 55%, which is a notable deviation.

The comparison, however, contains a significant error: the LLM states Schwab’s combined net goodwill is 'roughly 30 times larger' than AIG’s $388M decline. This misrepresents the comparison. The ground truth compares Schwab’s total 2023 net goodwill ($11,795M) to AIG’s 2023 net goodwill ($3,539M), yielding ~3.3x.

The ground truth uses full dollar units, while the LLM uses thousands, which could mislead if not interpreted correctly. 2) The entity 'T' is incorrectly referred to as 'AT&T' in the LLM answer — while T is AT&T, the question and original answer use 'T', so consistency matters for entity accuracy.

      "original_answer": "Elevated commodity costs impact General Motors by increasing the cost of EV raw materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt, which are essential for their transition to electric vehicles. GM's sourcing strategy involves securing supply through long-term commitments and higher inventory levels, which exposes them to increased costs due to market volatility and government policies. Similarly, McDonald's profitability is affected by rising commodity costs for ingredients like beef, chicken, and pork, which are subject to volatility due to climate conditions, global demand, and regulatory factors. These increased costs cannot be fully mitigated through hedging, directly affecting restaurant profitability. Both companies face financial risks from commodity cost fluctuations, though the specific materials and mitigation strategies differ based on their industries.",
      "llm_answer": "Elevated commodity prices are forcing General Motors to lean more heavily on its strategic‑sourcing program for EV minerals – it is expanding long‑term off‑take agreements, building a more North‑America‑focused supply chain and holding higher inventories of lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite and other critical raw materials so that the higher‑cost inputs do not interrupt production (GM 10‑K p. 8). In contrast, McDonald’s says that rising commodity costs for food, paper, fuel and utilities directly erode the margins of its company‑operated restaurants, because the company can only partially hedge those inputs and must absorb the price volatility (McDonald’s 10‑K p. 33).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant factual errors and misrepresents the ground truth. (1) Quantitative inaccuracy: The LLM claims Costco's 'Other International' segment had a 10% net sales increase and that FX stripping reveals a 7% increase, implying a 3 percentage point positive FX impact. However, the original answer states Costco did not provide any specific percentage impact from FX—so these numbers are fabricated. Similarly, for P&G, the LLM incorrectly states that FX had a negative 2 percentage point impact (5% reported vs 7% organic), but the ground truth says FX had a *positive* 2% impact on P&G’s net sales growth in FY2022. This reverses the actual effect. (2) The calculation reasoning is flawed: the LLM interprets 'organic growth' as FX-neutral and subtracts to infer FX impact, but misapplies directionality—P&G’s reported growth was higher than organic, meaning FX was positive, not negative. The LLM gets the sign wrong. (3) Entity and metric accuracy: While the companies and fiscal year (2022) are correct, the financial metrics (growth rates, FX impacts) are incorrect. (4) Reasoning and synthesis: The multi-hop comparison between Costco and P&G fails because both quantitative inputs are wrong. The conclusion that FX helped Costco and hurt P&G is the opposite of the truth—P&G benefited from FX (positive 2%), while Costco described FX impact qualitatively without quantification. (5) Semantic equivalence: The LLM invents precise numbers where none were provided (Costco) and inverts the direction of FX impact for P&G, making the answer factually incorrect despite addressing the general topic. The contextual relevance is moderate because it attempts the right comparison, but correctness is low due to critical factual and directional errors.",

      "original_answer": "Cisco (CSCO) records a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments in excess of future demand forecasts, aligning with its valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. This suggests a proactive financial recognition of inventory risk stemming from fixed supplier agreements. In contrast, Intel (INTC) emphasizes judgment and sensitivity analyses in its inventory valuation, particularly for excess and obsolete inventory, due to factors like dynamic pricing, customer forecasts, and limited historical data for new product launches. Intel’s audit process involves extensive testing of demand forecasts and pricing assumptions, indicating a more analytical and forward-looking approach to inventory risk. The $11.1 billion net inventory figure for Intel further underscores the scale and complexity of its inventory management challenges compared to Cisco’s more commitment-driven risk exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco’s filing explains that it records a liability for “firm, non‑cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future‑demand forecasts … consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory” (CSCO 10‑K p. 51). This ties its long‑term supply‑chain contracts directly to an inventory‑risk reserve, showing a proactive, contract‑driven approach to hedge against over‑stocking.  \n\nIntel, by contrast, states that it values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value and that “auditing management’s assessment of net realizable value… was challenging because the determination of excess and obsolete inventory reserves… is judgmental” (INTC 10‑K p. 74), with its auditors testing the assumptions and controls around those judgments. Thus Intel relies on retrospective, audit‑focused judgment to manage inventory risk, whereas Cisco embeds the risk in its purchase‑commitment liabilities.",

It accurately captures Cisco’s practice of recording a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments in excess of demand forecasts, aligning this with its excess and obsolete inventory valuation—reflecting a contract-driven, proactive risk management approach. For Intel, it correctly identifies the judgmental nature of inventory valuation, particularly around net realizable value, and notes auditor involvement in testing assumptions, which aligns with the original answer’s emphasis on analytical and forward-looking processes. The LLM answer does not include the specific $11.1 billion net inventory figure for Intel mentioned in the ground truth, which is a minor omission affecting completeness but not the core correctness. This missing quantitative detail slightly weakens the contrast in scale and complexity between the two companies’ inventory challenges. However, the reasoning and synthesis across both companies are sound, and the qualitative interpretation of contrasting approaches—Cisco’s commitment-driven vs. Intel’s judgment- and audit-focused—is semantically equivalent to the original. No numbers are misstated, and all referenced practices are correctly attributed, earning full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.

      "original_answer": "AIG reclassified a $37.6 billion loan receivable from AIGFP, which was deconsolidated following its Chapter 11 filing, while Schwab issued $6.2 billion in senior notes to prepare for upcoming maturities and to maintain liquidity during the TD Ameritrade integration. AIG’s action was tied to a restructuring event involving a formerly consolidated subsidiary with a full allowance for credit losses, indicating a reactive and potentially high-risk situation. In contrast, Schwab’s issuance was a proactive liquidity management strategy in a rising interest rate environment.

      "original_answer": "A 10% across-the-board reduction in U.S. defense appropriations would directly impact both General Dynamics and Raytheon Technologies due to their heavy reliance on federal funding. For General Dynamics, which reported that 70% of its 2021 revenue came from the U.S. government, such a reduction could lead to program cuts, delays, or terminations, especially for multi-year contracts that depend on annual appropriations. This would disrupt revenue timing and potentially reduce contract values. Raytheon, with its exposure to fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts, would face compounded risk because under FPI contracts, cost overruns beyond a negotiated ceiling are not recoverable. A reduction in appropriations could force RTX to absorb more costs without corresponding revenue increases, especially on complex development contracts where cost overruns are common. Both companies could see reduced profitability and liquidity challenges if they are unable to offset lost revenue or manage cost-sharing pressures under FPI and OTA contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "A 10 % cut in U.S. defense appropriations would trim General Dynamics’ top‑line by roughly 7 % of total revenue (10 % of the 70 % of sales that come from the U.S. government) and would increase the likelihood that existing multi‑year contracts are only partially funded or even terminated, compressing cash‑flow and earnings as the company must absorb any unfunded work 【page_21】. For Raytheon Technologies, lower appropriations would shrink the ceiling on its fixed‑price‑incentive (FPI) awards, so the firm would have to bear a larger share of any cost overruns while still delivering the same performance, tightening margins on those contracts and stressing cash‑flow on multi‑year programs that depend on continued congressional funding 【page_15】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the 7% top-line impact on General Dynamics is correctly derived from a 10% cut to the 70% of revenue sourced from the U.S. government (10% × 70% = 7%), which is a valid estimation of proportional exposure. This calculation is sound and matches the implied logic in the original answer. (2) The discussion of multi-year contracts being partially funded or terminated, affecting cash flow and earnings, is consistent with the original answer’s concern about disruptions to revenue timing and contract values. (3) For Raytheon, the explanation that lower appropriations would shrink the ceiling on FPI contracts and increase cost absorption is semantically equivalent to the ground truth’s point about non-recoverable cost overruns under FPI contracts. The emphasis on margin compression and cash-flow stress underlines the same risk exposure. (4) The reasoning is multi-hop: it connects GD’s revenue dependency to appropriation cuts, calculates the proportional revenue impact, links multi-year contracts to funding continuity, and separately analyzes RTX’s FPI risk under reduced ceilings—synthesizing financial structure, contract type, and appropriations dynamics. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'liquidity challenges' or 'inability to offset lost revenue' as in the original, slightly reducing completeness in qualitative nuance. However, 'compressing cash-flow' and 'stress[ing] cash-flow' effectively convey similar implications.

Similarly, AT&T's 'Other Cost of Revenues' is reported as $26,972 thousand ($26.97 million) instead of $26,972,000,000 ($26.97 billion), again off by 1,000x. This leads to a grossly incorrect combined total of $5.76 billion instead of $32.71 billion. The operating income for AT&T is also misreported as $19.05 million instead of $19.05 billion. (2) Calculations are therefore completely wrong: the LLM computes a combined 'Other Cost of Revenues' of ~$5.76 billion, whereas the correct sum is ~$32.71 billion. It fails to include Netflix’s operating income entirely, claiming it is not disclosed, but the ground truth shows it as $10.42 billion. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize data across both companies and both metrics, omits key data, and makes magnitude errors that invalidate the comparison.

      "original_answer": "ABBV faces significant complexity in estimating $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, particularly for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, due to variability in payment timing influenced by rebate contracts, legislative changes, and payer-specific lag times. This creates financial risk tied to the accuracy of accrual estimates and potential cash outflows. In contrast, DHR's operating cash flows are directly affected by the timing of collections and payments, as seen in the $497 million in operating cash flows generated from working capital changes in 2024. The difference highlights ABBV's challenge in forecasting liabilities due to external regulatory and contractual factors, versus DHR's operational challenge in managing internal cash conversion cycles. Together, both companies demonstrate how payment timing influences financial reporting and liquidity, albeit through different mechanisms and financial metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s cash‑flow risk centers on the timing of rebate payments to government‑run Medicaid and Medicare programs and to private managed‑care plans – the company must estimate those rebates up‑front and record large accruals ( $14.3 billion at year‑end ) because the actual cash outflows may be delayed or accelerated, creating volatility in the cash needed to satisfy those contractual obligations. In contrast, Danaher’s cash‑flow exposure is tied to its overall cash‑conversion cycle: the cash generated (or used) by trade receivables, inventories and payables swings with how quickly it can collect from customers and pay suppliers, so timing of collections and payments – not specific rebate reserves – drives operating‑cash‑flow fluctuations. Thus AbbVie’s challenge is managing government‑payer rebate liabilities, whereas Danaher’s challenge is managing working‑capital timing with third‑party customers and suppliers.",

Union Pacific, while not directly responsible for Boeing's indemnifications, faces its own environmental liabilities tied to remediation and monitoring costs, which are also uncertain due to regulatory changes and third-party financial viability. Therefore, while Boeing could face indirect liability through its indemnification obligations, Union Pacific’s liability could increase if environmental conditions at these locations require more extensive remediation, especially if other responsible parties are unable to contribute.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s sale of its BCA facilities created an **indefinite‑period indemnification** that obligates Boeing to reimburse the buyers for any pre‑closing environmental costs.  Boeing says it cannot estimate the number or amount of future claims, so no liability is recorded; only any claims that become probable and estimable are reflected in its environmental‑liability note (Note 13) 【page_103】.  \n\nUnion Pacific, by contrast, reports a **quantified environmental liability** of $243 million (with a $60 million current portion) and acknowledges uncertainty but states that the recorded obligations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on its results 【page_87】.  \n\nThus, Boeing’s indefinite indemnity adds an unbounded, off‑balance‑sheet exposure that could increase its future liabilities beyond its disclosed environmental balances, whereas Union Pacific’s potential liability is already captured in its disclosed environmental liability figure and is considered manageable.",

However, the original answer does not mention Union Pacific's specific dollar amounts, so introducing them—while factually possibly correct—adds unsupported detail not in the ground truth, creating a potential mismatch. (2) Completeness: The LLM focuses on Boeing's off-balance-sheet risk and Union Pacific's recorded liability, which captures part of the dynamic, but misses the core multi-hop synthesis in the ground truth: that Union Pacific’s liability could increase if other responsible parties (like Boeing or others) fail to contribute, especially in cases of extensive remediation. This is a significant omission in the interplay between the two companies’ liabilities. (3) Entity accuracy is correct—Boeing, Union Pacific, BCA facilities, environmental indemnification—all properly identified.

The combined net unfunded liability is calculated as $7.76 billion, which matches the ground truth of $7,759 million (rounded appropriately).

This matches the ground truth sum exactly. The international liability of $499 million is correctly cited. The comparison stating the combined liability is 'roughly $7.3 billion larger' is approximately correct ($7,759M - $499M = $7,260M), and the 'fifteen times' multiplier is reasonable (7,759 / 499 ≈ 15.55), so the qualitative comparison is sound.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is excellent: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (FDX and LMT) and two different pension segments (U.S. vs. international at FDX), correctly aggregates across entities, and makes a valid comparative statement.

It accurately captures the qualitative distinction in disclosure strategies and maintains contextual relevance. However, it omits key quantitative details present in the ground truth: specifically, PG's reported 2% growth in the Beauty segment and 7% overall net sales growth. These specific figures are central to the original answer’s multi-hop reasoning and are necessary for full completeness. While the LLM mentions PG uses 'net-sales-growth figures in the context of historical segment results', it fails to include the actual numbers, weakening the factual precision and comparative analysis. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly frames COST as having a 'forward-looking, expectation-driven narrative'—but the ground truth emphasizes that COST discusses net sales growth in the context of *risks and uncertainties*, not confident projections. This misrepresents the tone and intent of COST’s disclosures, affecting qualitative accuracy. The reasoning is partially sound but misses the nuance that COST highlights unpredictability, not just future expectations. Quantitative accuracy is high because no incorrect numbers are stated (none are given at all), but the omission still constitutes a partial failure in data synthesis.",

      "original_answer": "Intel's effective tax rate in 2023 was 15.6% lower than Cisco's. R&D tax credits contributed significantly to Intel's tax benefit by providing a tax advantage based on eligible R&D spending, independent of lower income before taxes.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel posted a **negative effective tax rate of ‑119.8 % for 2023**, versus Cisco’s **positive 17.7 % rate** – a gap of about **137.5 percentage points** (Intel’s rate is that many points lower).

According to the ground truth, Intel's effective tax rate was 15.6 percentage points lower than Cisco's in 2023. However, the LLM claims a difference of 137.5 percentage points, based on a negative tax rate of -119.8% for Intel and 17.7% for Cisco. These specific numbers (-119.8%, 17.7%, and the 137.5-point difference) are not supported by the ground truth and represent major deviations. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is internally consistent (i.e., -119.8% to +17.7% is indeed a 137.5 percentage point difference), but since the input numbers are incorrect, the result is factually wrong. The ground truth does not specify the exact rates, only the difference (15.6 points), so the LLM's precision is misleading and incorrect. (3) On qualitative reasoning, the LLM correctly identifies that R&D tax credits played a significant role in reducing Intel's tax rate and correctly notes that the benefit is tied to eligible R&D spending rather than pre-tax income—this aligns with the ground truth and shows sound multi-hop reasoning regarding the mechanism of R&D credits. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question: the rate comparison and the role of R&D credits. While the conceptual explanation of R&D credits is accurate, the severe numerical inaccuracies—especially in the primary quantitative claim—undermine the overall correctness. Hence, the correctness score is low despite good contextual and qualitative elements.",

However, it introduces a new figure—LMT's net funded status of $6.2 billion unfunded—that is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. More critically, the LLM states FDX's U.S. pension net funded status as $1.6 billion unfunded, which directly contradicts the ground truth value of $487 million underfunded (i.e., -$487 million). This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The numbers for the discount rate change and the $765 million obligation increase are accurate. However, the $6.2 billion (LMT) and $1.6 billion (FDX) figures are incorrect or unsupported. The ground truth explicitly states FDX’s net funded status as $ (487) million, meaning $487 million underfunded—much smaller than the $1.6 billion claimed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model connects the discount rate change to increased liabilities for LMT and compares it to FDX’s pension status.

      "original_answer": "Nike explicitly includes inventory costs as a primary component of its cost of sales, alongside warehousing costs, third-party royalties, foreign currency hedge gains and losses, and product design costs. This indicates that inventory directly influences Nike's cost of sales and profitability. In contrast, Tesla does not explicitly mention inventory costs as a distinct component of its cost of sales. Instead, Tesla emphasizes design and engineering capabilities, modular manufacturing approaches, and integration of technologies to optimize cost characteristics. Tesla's focus is on reducing manufacturing complexity, such as through direct integration of batteries with vehicle body structures, to improve manufacturability, weight, range, and cost efficiency. Thus, Nike emphasizes inventory as a direct cost driver, while Tesla highlights design and manufacturing optimization as key contributors to cost efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "Nike says that cost of sales is “primarily inventory costs” and then adds ware‑housing labor, third‑party royalties, foreign‑currency hedge gains or losses and product‑design costs, with shipping and handling expensed as incurred. Its description reflects a wholesale‑and‑retail model that holds large finished‑goods inventories and incurs inbound freight, duties, taxes, insurance and logistics fees, and sometimes ships directly from suppliers on a specific‑identification basis.  \n\nTesla, by contrast, treats inventory costs as only one component of cost of sales and emphasizes that depreciation and amortization of manufacturing, ware‑housing and distribution assets are also recorded in cost of sales. This wording stems from Tesla’s direct‑to‑consumer sales network, its modular‑design and automation‑driven production approach, and its practice of shipping products straight from suppliers to customers, which together shape how inventory‑related expenses flow into cost of sales.",

(1) On correctness: Nike's description is largely accurate — it correctly identifies inventory costs as a primary component of cost of sales and lists additional elements like warehousing, royalties, foreign currency hedges, and design costs. However, the LLM incorrectly states that Tesla treats inventory costs as 'only one component' of cost of sales and emphasizes depreciation and amortization — this is not supported by the ground truth, which states Tesla does *not explicitly mention* inventory costs as a distinct component and instead focuses on design and manufacturing optimization. The LLM invents a detail (depreciation/amortization in cost of sales) absent from the original answer and misrepresents Tesla’s emphasis. (2) Quantitative accuracy is 10 because there are no numerical values in the question or answers to evaluate — no calculations, dollar amounts, or percentages are involved. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to contrast Nike and Tesla and links their cost reporting to business practices. However, the synthesis for Tesla is flawed — it does not reflect Tesla’s focus on modular design, integration of batteries, or manufacturability improvements as key cost drivers. Instead, it introduces asset depreciation, which was not in the original. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies and attempts to link accounting descriptions to business models, but the misattribution of Tesla’s cost structure reduces its overall accuracy.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors. It states that the difference is $509 million, while the ground truth is $407 million. This discrepancy invalidates the core of the answer. The individual figures cited—Mondelēz’s $(458) million and Target’s $51 million—are not fully supported by the ground truth, which implies the correct inputs should have led to a $407 million difference. Without visibility into the exact source values, the LLM’s calculation of $509 million (|–458 – 51| = 509) is internally consistent but factually incorrect if the true inputs differ. (2) The calculation method (taking the absolute difference between the two figures) is logically sound, but the result is wrong due to incorrect input values. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing currency translation adjustments across two companies, one including cash flow hedges—is conceptually correct. The LLM identifies the right companies (MDLZ and TGT), the correct year (2021), and the relevant financial items (currency translation adjustment for MDLZ, combined adjustment and hedges for TGT). This shows proper synthesis across entities and metrics. (4) Despite correct reasoning structure and contextual relevance, the answer fails on factual accuracy due to incorrect numbers. The $102 million gap between $509 and $407 is too large to be a rounding or formatting issue, indicating either misread data or incorrect sourcing.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2024, NKE experienced lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs, which contributed to partially offsetting a gross margin contraction of 110 basis points. In contrast, TSLA included freight as part of its cost of revenue for the Energy Generation and Storage segment, where it added to the overall cost structure. Thus, while lower freight costs positively impacted NKE’s gross margin, freight costs represented an expense component for TSLA, contributing to a divergent effect on their respective financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Nike said that lower ocean‑freight rates and logistics costs reduced its product costs, which helped expand gross margin (the company credited the freight‑cost decline for a 220‑basis‑point gross‑margin improvement in FY 2024). Tesla’s 10‑K makes no comparable comment – freight is listed only as a component of cost of revenue, and the filing does not attribute any material effect of freight costs to its FY 2024 gross‑margin performance.",

The ground truth states that freight cost declines only partially offset an 110-basis-point gross margin contraction, implying a positive but smaller impact, not a 220-basis-point gain. This is a major quantitative error. For TSLA, the LLM correctly notes that no material effect was disclosed, which aligns with the original answer stating freight is part of cost of revenue but without a specified performance impact. (2) The 220-basis-point figure is incorrect and contradicts the ground truth: instead of improving margins by 220 bps, NKE actually experienced a gross margin contraction of 110 bps, partially mitigated by lower freight costs. This misrepresents both the direction and magnitude of the margin change. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in comparing how each company treats freight costs — NKE benefits from reduced freight expenses, while TSLA includes freight in COGS without highlighting any offsetting benefit — but fails to correctly synthesize the actual financial impact due to the incorrect NKE margin figure. The multi-hop comparison is attempted but undermined by the factual error. (4) Correctness is scored low (4) due to the critical error in the NKE margin impact. Quantitative accuracy is poor (3) because the key number is wrong and directionally misleading.

      "original_answer": "Both Cisco and Oracle increased their inventory balances in response to global supply chain constraints, which heightened their risks of excess and obsolete inventory. Cisco's product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to increased costs from freight, expedite fees, and higher component and commodity costs. These cost pressures were partially offset by favorable pricing actions taken during fiscal 2022. Oracle also faced increased production costs due to supply chain shortages, which it could not always pass on to customers, further increasing its inventory-related risks. Both companies explicitly linked their increased inventory commitments to efforts to secure supply amid ongoing global disruptions.",

      "original_answer": "FDX identifies the risk of loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable as a potential negative impact on its business, citing regulatory and compliance risks that could affect cash flow. In contrast, LMT expresses confidence in collecting its receivables, noting that substantially all accounts receivable as of December 31, 2023, are expected to be collected in 2024. LMT reports receivables of approximately $1.4 billion from the U.S. Government and $749 million from other governments and commercial customers, indicating minimal credit risk due to the strong credit standing of the U.S. Government as the primary customer.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx lists “loss or delay in the collection of accounts receivable” as a material risk factor, indicating that it could face uncertainty or non‑payment on its outstanding bills. In contrast, Lockheed Martin states that virtually all of its receivables are expected to be collected in 2024 and that it does not have significant credit‑risk exposure because most are owed by the U.S. Government 【page 39】. Lockheed Martin’s receivables total about **$1.4 billion from the U.S. Government** and **$749 million from other governments and commercial customers** as of December 31 2023 【page 75】.",

      "question": "How did the increase in fuel prices from 2020 to 2021 affect both Union Pacific Railroad's operating expenses and Boeing's commercial aircraft demand, considering their respective sensitivities to fuel price fluctuations?",
      "original_answer": "Union Pacific Railroad's fuel expenses increased by $668 million in 2021 due to a rise in locomotive diesel fuel prices from $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon, driven primarily by higher fuel prices excluding volume changes. Meanwhile, Boeing noted that fuel prices are a key factor influencing demand for commercial aircraft, as airlines are cost-sensitive and fuel is a major operating expense. Higher fuel prices could lead airlines to delay or cancel aircraft orders, reducing Boeing's revenues and cash flows. Therefore, the fuel price increase directly raised Union Pacific's operating costs and could indirectly reduce Boeing's commercial airplane sales and profitability through airline cost pressures.",
      "llm_answer": "Union Pacific’s 2021 operating‑expense increase of $767 million was driven largely by fuel – locomotive diesel averaged $2.23 /gal versus $1.50 /gal in 2020, adding about $668 million of fuel cost to the year‑over‑year total. Boeing’s filing notes that commercial‑aircraft demand is “further influenced … fuel prices,” meaning the same rise in fuel costs that lifted Union Pacific’s expenses also pressures airline profitability and can cause carriers to defer or cancel new aircraft purchases, weakening Boeing’s demand outlook.",

However, it incorrectly states that the total operating expense increase was $767 million, which is not mentioned in the original answer and introduces a number not supported by the provided truth. This is the only factual deviation. All other numbers (fuel prices, cost increase) are accurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high: $668 million cost increase, $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon price rise are correctly reported. The $767 million figure is unverified and likely erroneous, but it does not affect the core fuel cost calculation, which is correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links higher fuel prices to increased operating costs for Union Pacific and explains how the same fuel price pressure affects airline profitability and, in turn, Boeing's aircraft demand. It accurately reflects Boeing's sensitivity to fuel prices as a demand driver, citing the appropriate causal mechanism (airlines deferring or canceling orders). (4) The answer is contextually relevant and semantically equivalent to the original in all key aspects except the extraneous $767 million figure. The reasoning, entities (Union Pacific, Boeing, locomotive diesel, commercial aircraft demand), years (2020 to 2021), and financial impacts are correctly identified and synthesized. The minor error does not undermine the overall correctness, hence a score of 9/10.",

The calculation of the combined value ($1.84B + $1.1B = $2.94B) is correct. The comparison correctly notes that $2.94 billion is about $2.77 billion more than $170 million, and the relative size (roughly 17 times larger) is a valid approximation (2.94 / 0.17 ≈ 17.3).

These core numbers are accurate and match the ground truth. However, the key required calculation — expressing CMCSA's $652M reduction as a percentage of Disney's 2024 total programming and production costs — is not performed. Instead, the LLM incorrectly calculates that Disney's $610M increase is 4.7% of its 2024 cost base ($12,983M), which is factually correct (610 / 12,983 ≈ 4.7%), but this is not what the question asks. The question requires: ($652M / $12,983M) ≈ 5.02%, or more precisely, the comparison of CMCSA's reduction to Disney's *increase* ($652M / $610M ≈ 106.9%), which the original answer correctly states. The LLM mentions that the Comcast reduction is $42M larger than Disney’s change, implying the 106.9% relationship, but fails to express it as a percentage as required. (2) Numeric values are accurate: $652M (CMCSA reduction), $12,373M (Disney 2023), $12,983M (Disney 2024), $610M increase — all correct.

      "original_answer": "Oracle reported $3,183 million in hardware revenue out of total revenues of $42,440 million in 2022, meaning hardware represented 7% of total revenue. In contrast, Cisco did not report hardware revenue separately but instead disclosed revenue by geographic segments, managing its business primarily on a geographic basis without breaking out hardware as a distinct category.

The use of $3.2 billion instead of $3,183 million is an acceptable approximation and common in financial reporting. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers are accurate within reasonable rounding conventions. The percentage is correctly reported as ~7%, and the total revenue context is implied through the proportion. (3) The qualitative reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly identifies that Cisco does not report a consolidated hardware category, noting instead that it breaks down product revenue into functional segments like Secure Agile Networks and End-to-End Security. While the original answer emphasizes Cisco’s geographic reporting structure, the LLM focuses on the absence of a hardware line and alternative categorization—this is semantically equivalent in intent, though slightly different in emphasis. (4) The answer fully addresses both parts of the multi-hop question: Oracle’s hardware revenue percentage and the contrast with Cisco’s reporting structure. The contextual relevance is perfect, and the reasoning is sound.

In contrast, General Electric (GE) explicitly lists changes in short-term interest rates as a risk factor that could materially affect its business operations, financial results, and liquidity. GE also notes that downgrades in its credit ratings could significantly impact its funding profile and costs. This contrast implies that GE is more exposed to macroeconomic volatility related to interest rates, particularly due to its credit profile and sensitivity to short-term rate movements, whereas LMT has a more stable debt structure that is less affected by such changes.",

(2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—however, the absence of fabricated or incorrect numbers supports a score of 10. (3) The comparison with Comcast is mostly accurate: the LLM correctly notes that Comcast reports a consolidated 'programming and production' cost line in its Media segment, but introduces a key discrepancy by claiming that sports rights fees are accounted for separately as 'executory contracts'—a detail not present in the original answer or supported by the referenced 2024 10-K Note 4 excerpt. The original answer only states that Comcast lacks the same level of granular disclosure as Disney, not that it uses a different accounting treatment like executory contracts. This represents a plausible but unsupported inference, slightly reducing qualitative accuracy. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, addressing all parts of the multi-hop question: differences within Disney’s segments and a cross-company comparison with Comcast. While the core facts are correct, the added detail about 'executory contracts' introduces a speculative element not in the source, preventing a top score. Overall, the answer demonstrates strong reasoning and semantic equivalence with minor overreach in interpretation.",

      "original_answer": "GM defines ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which includes average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities (excluding finance leases), average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities, and average automotive net income tax assets. HD reports ROIC as 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020, referencing a NOPAT-based calculation, though the exact components are not detailed in the excerpt.

The excerpt does not list the exact components, but it indicates that HD’s ROIC is based on a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings and uses a separate definition of invested capital.  \n\n**Key difference:** GM’s ROIC explicitly uses EBIT‑adjusted and adjusts net assets for automotive‑specific debt, finance‑lease, pension/OPEB and tax‑asset items, whereas HD’s ROIC is a non‑GAAP measure built from NOPAT and an invested‑capital figure whose detailed inclusions/exclusions are not disclosed in the provided pages.",

The distinction between EBIT-based (GM) and NOPAT-based (HD) approaches is correctly highlighted. (4) The only minor shortcoming is a slight misstatement in the description of ROIC-adjusted average net assets: the LLM says 'excludes automotive net pension/OPEB liabilities and net income-tax assets', but in the original, these are *included* as adjustments (specifically, subtracted from equity). However, the LLM's phrasing could be interpreted as consistent if 'excludes' refers to their treatment as non-core items, but this is ambiguous.

      "original_answer": "A $15 billion increase in cross-jurisdictional activity would move American Express (AXP) from $60 billion to $75 billion on a four-quarter trailing average, potentially reclassifying it from Category III to Category II under the enhanced prudential standards. This would subject AXP to more stringent capital, liquidity, and prudential requirements, including the advanced approaches capital framework. For Charles Schwab (SCHW), increasing its cross-jurisdictional activity from $25 billion to $40 billion would not trigger a category change, as it remains below the $75 billion threshold for Category II, so it would remain under Category III requirements, including the standardized approach framework and stress capital buffer.",
      "llm_answer": "A $15 billion rise in cross‑jurisdictional activity would push each firm past the $75 billion trigger that moves a U.S. bank‑holding company from the “Category III/IV” tier to “Category II” under the Federal Reserve’s enhanced prudential standards.  \n\n* **Charles Schwab** – Schwab reported $67 billion of cross‑jurisdictional activity at year‑end 2023; adding $15 billion would raise it to about $82 billion, which “could result in us becoming a Category II firm and subject to more stringent capital, liquidity and prudential requirements”【page_15】.  As a Category II firm the company would have to apply the Basel‑III “advanced approaches” to calculate risk‑weighted assets, meet the full Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and submit daily liquidity‑monitoring reports【page_17】.  \n\n* **American Express** – The same rule applies to all U.S. bank‑holding companies.  If AXP’s current cross‑jurisdictional exposure is below the $75 billion threshold, a $15 billion increase would also push it into Category II, subjecting it to the same heightened capital‑adequacy calculations (advanced approaches) and the full LCR/NSFR liquidity regime that Category II firms must satisfy.  \n\nThus, a $15 billion increase would upgrade both companies to Category II, imposing stricter capital‑buffer, risk‑weighted‑asset, and liquidity‑coverage requirements.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant factual and quantitative errors that undermine its correctness. (1) Quantitative inaccuracy: The LLM claims Charles Schwab (SCHW) had $67 billion in cross-jurisdictional activity as of year-end 2023, but the ground truth states it was $25 billion. Adding $15 billion would bring SCHW to $40 billion, not $82 billion as claimed. This miscalculation leads to the incorrect conclusion that SCHW would cross the $75 billion threshold and move to Category II. In reality, $40 billion remains below the threshold, so no category change occurs. (2) Entity and reasoning error: The LLM incorrectly applies the same outcome to both companies, asserting both would be reclassified to Category II. However, only American Express (AXP), starting at $60 billion and increasing to $75 billion, would potentially move from Category III to Category II. The LLM also fails to note that AXP’s increase reaches exactly the $75 billion threshold (not exceeding it), which may or may not trigger reclassification depending on regulatory interpretation—this nuance is missing. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failure: The question requires synthesizing company-specific thresholds, current activity levels, and regulatory implications. The LLM incorrectly inflates SCHW’s base value, leading to flawed synthesis. It also cites non-existent or fabricated document references (e.g., 'page_15', 'page_17') not present in the original context, suggesting hallucination. (4) Semantic mismatch: While the description of Category II requirements (e.g., advanced approaches, LCR, NSFR) is generally accurate, the core conclusion—that both firms would be upgraded—is factually wrong. Only AXP is near the threshold; SCHW remains well below. Thus, the answer fails on key factual, numerical, and logical dimensions despite some correct contextual knowledge of regulatory frameworks.",

      "question": "What is the total combined amount of financing cash flows used for finance leases in 2024 by both Google and Verizon, and how does this combined figure compare to the sum of their respective finance lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities in the same year?",
      "original_answer": "The total combined financing cash flows used for finance leases in 2024 by Google and Verizon is $405 million (Google) + $794 million (Verizon) = $1,199 million. The combined finance lease right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new finance lease liabilities in 2024 is $313 million (Google) + $1,051 million (Verizon) = $1,364 million. Therefore, the financing cash flows used for finance leases are $165 million less than the right-of-use assets obtained.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024 the two companies together recorded **$1.199 billion** of financing cash outflows for finance‑lease repayments (Alphabet $794 million + Verizon $405 million).  \n\nThe finance‑lease right‑of‑use assets they recognized in exchange for new finance‑lease liabilities total **$1.364 billion** (Alphabet $1.051 billion + Verizon $313 million), which is roughly **$165 million more** than the combined financing cash outflows.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the assignment of values to the companies. It incorrectly states that Alphabet (Google) had $794 million in financing cash flows and Verizon had $405 million, reversing the correct amounts from the ground truth (Google: $405M, Verizon: $794M). Similarly, it swaps the right-of-use asset values: stating Alphabet recognized $1.051 billion and Verizon $313 million, when the correct values are Google: $313M and Verizon: $1,051M. Despite these swaps, the LLM arrives at the correct total combined figures: $1.199 billion for cash flows and $1.364 billion for right-of-use assets, and correctly computes the $165 million difference. (2) While the final totals and the comparison are numerically accurate, the misattribution of individual company values constitutes a major error in entity-specific quantitative accuracy. The calculations based on swapped numbers are mathematically correct but factually wrong at the component level. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—aggregating across companies and comparing cash flows to right-of-use assets—is logically sound and complete. However, the model fails in correctly associating the data points to the correct entities, undermining the reliability of the synthesis. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses all parts of the question with appropriate financial terminology and structure. Due to the reversal of company-specific figures, the quantitative accuracy is severely impacted, warranting a low score there, while the qualitative and overall correctness scores are partially offset by correct totals and logic.",

      "question": "How does the impact of U.S. government pricing pressures on BMY's non-GAAP EPS compare to Merck's rationale for using non-GAAP EPS, given both companies operate in the same sector and report this metric?",
      "original_answer": "BMY's non-GAAP EPS decreased by $0.19 in 2023 primarily due to lower revenues and product mix, which were influenced by U.S. government pricing pressures such as the IRA, including Medicare drug price negotiations and inflation-linked rebates. These pressures are expected to significantly impact BMY's business and results of operations. In contrast, Merck discloses that it uses non-GAAP EPS to enhance investor understanding of its performance, internally for planning and forecasting, and as a component in employee compensation. Merck excludes items like acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, and investment income/losses to better assess underlying business trends. While BMY's non-GAAP EPS is negatively impacted by external regulatory pressures, Merck emphasizes internal performance assessment and strategic decision-making as the basis for its non-GAAP reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "Bristol‑Myers notes that U.S. government pricing‑pressure actions – such as the IRA‑driven price negotiations and potential “march‑in” rights – could lower drug prices and reimbursement, which would further depress the company’s already‑declining non‑GAAP EPS (it fell $0.19 in 2023). In contrast, Merck explains that it reports non‑GAAP EPS simply to give investors a clearer view of underlying business performance by excluding items like acquisition‑related costs, restructuring charges and equity‑investment gains or losses.",

(1) Quantitatively, it correctly states that BMY's non-GAAP EPS fell by $0.19 in 2023, matching the ground truth exactly. No other numerical values are present, and this key figure is accurate. (2) The entities—Bristol-Myers (BMY), Merck, non-GAAP EPS, IRA-driven pricing pressures—are all correctly identified and contextualized. The time frame (2023) is accurate. (3) The reasoning correctly contrasts BMY's external, regulatory-driven impact on non-GAAP EPS with Merck's internal, performance-assessment rationale for using non-GAAP EPS. It accurately notes that Merck excludes acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, and equity-investment gains/losses to clarify underlying performance—consistent with the original. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention Merck's use of non-GAAP EPS for internal planning, forecasting, and employee compensation, which is part of the original answer and adds depth to Merck's rationale. While the LLM captures the investor communication aspect, it omits these internal uses, resulting in a slight loss in completeness. However, the core contrast—external pressures affecting BMY vs. Merck's methodological transparency—is well articulated. Wording differences are acceptable and semantically equivalent. Overall, the answer is factually correct, contextually relevant, and demonstrates sound multi-hop reasoning across two companies and their use of non-GAAP metrics under different drivers.",

      "original_answer": "Nike evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by forecasting future taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization, but does not guarantee realization due to uncertainties in projected future taxable earnings. In contrast, Tesla concluded that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable based on recent taxable income and expected future taxable earnings, leading to the release of $6.54 billion in valuation allowance. This shows that Tesla has a more favorable outlook on future taxable earnings, directly impacting its tax expense and asset valuation differently than Nike’s approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Nike’s 10‑K states that its deferred‑tax assets are recorded “subject to a valuation allowance… because realization is dependent on future taxable earnings and therefore uncertain.” Tesla’s filing, by contrast, says it evaluated recent taxable income and its expected future taxable earnings, concluded that most U.S. federal and state deferred‑tax assets are more likely than not to be realized and therefore released a $6.5 billion valuation allowance – keeping a full allowance only for California where it does not expect sufficient future taxable earnings. Thus, Nike retains a broader allowance reflecting greater uncertainty, while Tesla relies more heavily on projected earnings to deem its deferred‑tax assets realizable, except where it foresees insufficient earnings.",

(1) All key facts are correct: Nike maintains a valuation allowance due to uncertainty about future taxable earnings, while Tesla released $6.5 billion in valuation allowance based on expected future taxable income, except in California. The $6.5 billion figure matches the ground truth's $6.54 billion within acceptable rounding. (2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent—$6.5 billion vs. $6.54 billion is a minor rounding difference and does not affect factual correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Nike’s cautious approach with Tesla’s more optimistic outlook based on future taxable earnings, linking this directly to their differing valuation allowance treatments. It correctly identifies that Tesla’s conclusion of 'more likely than not' realizability drives the release of the allowance, while Nike retains uncertainty. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention foreign tax credit utilization for Nike, which is a small but relevant detail in the original answer. However, this does not undermine the central comparison. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent.

(2) All numbers, dates, and calculations are correct—$300M + $57M = $357M—and the fiscal year 2022 is properly referenced.

This is a critical error in multi-hop reasoning, as the model failed to accurately retrieve or synthesize the correct causal factor from the source data. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer structure matches the question and addresses both parts—total charge and cited factor—but the second part is factually wrong.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, Honeywell had $4,273 million in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, while Emerson reported $0 in this category. This indicates that Honeywell actively utilized short-term debt as part of its liquidity strategy, whereas Emerson did not rely on such borrowings, suggesting a more conservative approach to liquidity management with potentially greater reliance on internal cash resources.",

      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that Honeywell had significant short-term borrowings while Emerson had essentially none, which aligns with the ground truth. However, there are discrepancies in the numbers: the ground truth states Honeywell had $4,273 million ($4.273 billion) in commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, which the LLM rounds to $4.3 billion—this is acceptable. But the LLM introduces $1.3 billion in current maturities of long-term debt for Honeywell and $0.5 billion for Emerson, which are not mentioned in the original answer and may not be relevant to the specific metric of 'commercial paper and other short-term borrowings.' These additions could misrepresent the core comparison. (2) The quantitative accuracy is reduced because the original answer focuses solely on commercial paper and short-term borrowings, while the LLM conflates this with current maturities of long-term debt, which is a different liability category. This affects precision, even if the general direction is correct. (3) The reasoning is sound in interpreting that Honeywell uses short-term financing while Emerson takes a more conservative approach, which is consistent with the multi-hop logic required. The qualitative assessment of liquidity risk management is appropriate and well-synthesized. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer directly addresses the comparative liquidity strategies of both companies in 2024.

These numbers do not match the ground truth and suggest a misinterpretation of the data, possibly confusing 'available' or 'issued' shares with 'total authorized'. (2) The calculations within the LLM answer are arithmetically correct (e.g., 18.2M + 62.0M ≈ 80.2M), but they are based on incorrect underlying data or misclassification of share categories. The totals are not aligned with the actual authorized amounts reported in the filings. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly extract or synthesize the total authorized shares for each company. Instead of reporting the total authorized shares directly, it appears to have summed 'shares issuable' and 'available for future awards', which may not equal total authorized shares if prior grants or other adjustments exist. This undermines the comparison. (4) The conclusion that UnitedHealth Group authorizes more shares than AbbVie is factually incorrect per the ground truth (120M vs 185M), reversing the correct relationship.

      "original_answer": "The total net revenue contribution from the Data Center segment across both AMD and CSCO in 2024 is $15.8 billion. This is calculated by summing AMD’s $12.6 billion in Data Center net revenue and CSCO’s $3.2 billion in revenue from its stake in the Data Center segment.",

The final sum of $15.8 billion matches the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both input figures are correct, and the addition is accurate (12.6 + 3.2 = 15.8). Format variations like '$12.6 billion' are consistent and acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different companies (AMD and CSCO) is correctly synthesized to compute the total net revenue contribution from the Data Center segment. The mention of AMD’s Form 10-K and Cisco’s filing supports proper sourcing. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with slightly more detail (e.g., citation of document types), but without any factual deviation.

      "question": "What is the combined total of payments of long-term debt made by Emerson Electric (EMR) and Honeywell (HON) in 2024, and how does this compare to their respective long-term debt proceeds during the same year?",
      "original_answer": "In 2024, Emerson Electric (EMR) made $547 million in payments of long-term debt and received $0 in long-term debt proceeds, while Honeywell (HON) made $1,812 million in payments of long-term debt and received $10,408 million in long-term debt proceeds. Combined, their long-term debt payments totaled $2,359 million, and their proceeds from long-term debt totaled $10,408 million. This results in a net inflow of $8,049 million from long-term debt financing across both companies.",

(1) All key numbers are correct: Emerson's $547 million and Honeywell's $1,812 million in long-term debt payments are accurately reported. The combined total is correctly calculated as $2.36 billion (equivalent to $2,359 million). Honeywell's proceeds of $10.41 billion are very close to the ground truth $10,408 million (a negligible $2 million difference, likely due to rounding), and Emerson's proceeds are correctly described as essentially zero. (2) Calculations are sound: $547M + $1,812M = $2,359M ≈ $2.36B, and $10.41B is a valid rounding of $10,408M. The comparison stating that proceeds were 'far larger' than payments is logically valid and aligns with the net inflow conclusion in the original answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is correct: the model synthesizes data across two companies and two financial metrics (payments and proceeds) for the same year, and compares them meaningfully. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the explicit net inflow figure ($8,049 million), which was included in the original answer. However, the qualitative comparison ('far larger') captures the same insight. Number formats are acceptable ($2.36 billion = $2,359 million; $10.41 billion ≈ $10,408 million). All entities (EMR, HON, 2024, long-term debt payments and proceeds) are correctly identified. Thus, the answer is factually and contextually strong, warranting a 9/10 for correctness.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing reported 'Other Income, Net' of $551 million in 2021, which helped offset its operating loss of $2,902 million, contributing to a smaller net loss of $4,290 million. In contrast, Union Pacific reported 'Other Income, Net' of -$297 million in 2021, which further reduced its net income of $6,523 million.

According to the ground truth, Boeing's 'Other Income, Net' in 2021 was $551 million, but the LLM incorrectly states it as $2.2 billion—off by nearly 300%. Similarly, Union Pacific's 'Other Income, Net' was -$297 million (a loss), but the LLM reports it as +$0.55 billion, which is not only incorrect in magnitude but also in sign/direction. These errors fundamentally misrepresent the financial reality of both companies. (2) Calculations and comparisons are therefore invalid. The claim that Union Pacific’s other income was '$1.6 billion less' than Boeing’s is false; in reality, the difference is $551M - (-$297M) = $848 million, with Boeing having positive other income and Union Pacific having negative. The LLM reverses the relationship. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing how other income affects net income/loss and linking it to core business dynamics—but it is built on incorrect data, undermining the conclusion. The observation that Boeing relied more on non-operating items while Union Pacific had strong core operations is plausible but unsupported due to the wrong numbers. (4) Contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses the question's intent: analyzing the impact of 'Other Income, Net' on net results and interpreting performance dynamics. However, the severe quantitative inaccuracies drastically reduce correctness. Despite acceptable formatting variations (e.g., using 'billion'), the numbers do not match the ground truth, leading to a low correctness score of 3, with similarly low quantitative accuracy.

According to the ground truth, KO's revenue growth was negatively impacted by 4% due to acquisitions and divestitures, which the LLM correctly states. However, the ground truth explicitly states that PM reported *no impact* from acquisitions on net revenue growth in 2024. The LLM incorrectly claims that acquisitions added about 1% ($27 million) to PM's revenue growth, which directly contradicts the original answer. This is a major factual error. (2) The quantitative accuracy is compromised: while the -4% for KO matches the ground truth, the +1% and $27 million figures for PM are not supported by the original answer, which states there was *no impact*. Even if these numbers came from external data, they contradict the provided ground truth from the knowledge graph. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly identifies both companies and the relevant metric (impact of acquisitions on revenue growth)—but fails in synthesis by misrepresenting PM's data. It incorrectly infers a positive contribution when the truth states zero impact.

      "original_answer": "In 2021, LMT reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million as part of its unallocated items, directly contributing to its consolidated operating profit of $9,123 million. This adjustment was a significant component of LMT's unallocated net total of $1,744 million. In contrast, RTX's FAS/CAS operating adjustment was embedded in its pension and PRB expense treatment, where the adjustment reconciled CAS expense (used for U.S. government contract pricing) with FAS service cost under GAAP. RTX noted that the FAS/CAS adjustment resulted in consolidated pension expense equal to the FAS service cost, though no specific dollar amount was provided for 2021. The difference lies in LMT explicitly quantifying the adjustment as a standalone unallocated item, while RTX integrated it within broader pension cost reporting without isolating its dollar impact.",

      "original_answer": "MS held $81,909 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks at the end of 2023. COF's interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $6,583 million between 2022 and 2023.

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM correctly identifies MS's interest-bearing deposits as $81.9 billion (equivalent to $81,909 million in the ground truth), which is accurate. However, the calculation of COF's interest expense increase is incorrect: the LLM states it rose from $1.58B to $6.95B, implying a $5.37B (~$5.4B) increase, whereas the ground truth reports an increase of $6,583 million ($6.583B). This is a significant numerical discrepancy. 2) The original data shows COF's actual increase was $6,583 million, so the LLM's figure of ~$5.4B is off by over $1.1B. Additionally, the LLM misrepresents the 2023 expense as $6.95B when it should be approximately $8.163B (if 2022 was $1.58B and increased by $6.583B). There is likely confusion with absolute values or misattribution of data points. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model attempts to compare MS's deposits to the change in COF's interest expense — but due to incorrect underlying numbers, the synthesis is flawed. The entity identification (MS and COF) and metric types (interest-bearing deposits, interest expense) are correct, and the time frame (2022–2023) is properly referenced. 4) Despite the wrong calculation, the answer maintains contextual relevance by addressing both parts of the question and making a scale comparison. Wording and structure are clear, but the quantitative error significantly undermines factual correctness. Minor formatting variations (billion vs million) are acceptable, but the calculation error is material.",

      "original_answer": "NFLX recognizes all operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, including for short-term leases with an initial term of twelve months or less, even though these are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In contrast, VZ recognizes rent expense for short-term operating leases on a straight-line basis as well, but classifies the expense in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense based on the use of the facility or equipment. This means that while both companies follow a similar straight-line recognition method, the presentation on the income statement differs depending on the nature and use of the leased asset, which could impact how analysts assess their operating performance and cost structures.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Verizon (VZ)** – Leases of 12 months or less are not put on the balance sheet; the rent is recognized straight‑line over the lease term and is **allocated to the functional expense line in which the asset is used** (either “Cost of services” or “Selling, general and administrative”).  \n\n- **Netflix (NFLX)** – Short‑term operating leases are also kept off‑balance‑sheet and expensed straight‑line, but the company reports the total lease cost as a **single “operating‑lease expense” line within its operating expenses**, without breaking it out by cost‑of‑services or SG&A.  \n\n**Implication:** Verizon’s income‑statement presentation lets users see lease costs split by the type of operation that benefits from the lease, whereas Netflix’s presentation aggregates all lease costs into one line, so the expense composition is less granular.",

The distinction in income statement presentation—VZ allocating expense to 'Cost of services' or 'Selling, general and administrative' based on use, while NFLX aggregates it into a single 'operating-lease expense' line—is correctly identified. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, lease terms) in dispute; the 12-month threshold is consistent with the original answer and accounting standards (ASC 842), so quantitative accuracy is perfect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes lease accounting treatment across two companies and draws a valid implication about income statement granularity and its impact on financial analysis. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer explicitly mentions that NFLX applies straight-line to all operating leases, including short-term, which the LLM implies but does not emphasize as clearly.

However, there is a discrepancy in Netflix's percentage of current liabilities to total assets: the LLM reports 20.0%, while the ground truth states 14.1%. This is a significant error in calculation or data sourcing. Verizon’s 16.8% matches exactly. (2) Individual liability figures are close but not exact: LLM reports $64.8B ($64,800M) for Verizon vs. implied $64,771M (minor rounding difference, acceptable), and $10.8B ($10,800M) for Netflix vs. implied $10,755M (also minor, acceptable). The sum is correct at ~$75.5B. However, the Netflix asset percentage is miscalculated—$10,755M / $53,600M ≈ 20.07%, but ground truth says it should be 14.1%, implying either the total assets figure used by LLM is incorrect or the ground truth uses a different asset value. This undermines quantitative accuracy. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure—LLM correctly identifies both companies, extracts liabilities, sums them, and compares to respective total assets.

According to the ground truth, Boeing's total net actuarial loss in 2021 was $19,031 million ($19.031 billion), not $17.9 billion as stated. The LLM incorrectly calculates Boeing’s loss as '$19.0 billion (pension) + ($1.1 billion) = $17.9 billion', which is mathematically and conceptually flawed—adding a negative $1.1 billion should reduce the total, but the arithmetic itself is wrong. Union Pacific’s actual loss was $813 million, while the LLM reports $850 million, a notable overstatement. The calculated disparity is $18,218 million per ground truth, but the LLM reports $17.1 billion (~$17,100 million), which is off by over $1.1 billion due to incorrect inputs and flawed calculation. (2) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that net actuarial losses flow into Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) and affect Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL), and it correctly frames the disparity as impacting AOCL directly. However, it omits specific recognition amounts cited in the ground truth—Boeing’s $17,725 million and Union Pacific’s $954 million—including amortization effects, which are key to the multi-hop synthesis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is acceptable in structure—comparing two companies’ actuarial losses and linking them to AOCL—but fails in precision due to incorrect data sourcing and arithmetic.

This is a major quantitative error. Additionally, LMT's average FAS/CAS adjustment over 2019–2021 was $1,961.3 million, which the LLM approximates as $1.9 billion—this part is reasonably accurate (within rounding). However, the LLM fails to compute or report the correct comparative percentage (RTX's $690M increase being ~35.2% of LMT's $1,961.3M average), instead stating the increase is '$1.8 billion less', which misrepresents the comparison and is misleading.

The average for LMT is approximately correct ($1.9B vs $1.9613B), but lacks precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model identifies both companies and the relevant metric, but fails to correctly retrieve RTX's actual adjustment values or the correct year-over-year change. It attempts the comparison but uses an incorrect basis. (4) Correctness score is low (2/10) due to major factual and calculation errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because the key dollar increase is wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the model understands the task structure and entities involved. Contextual relevance is moderate (6/10) as it addresses the right companies and metric, but with incorrect data.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several factual inaccuracies. While it correctly identifies Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) and refers to 2023 broadband revenue, the numbers are partially incorrect. The LLM states Comcast's broadband revenue as $25.5 billion (close to the true $25,489 million), which is acceptable within rounding. However, it reports AT&T's broadband revenue as $9.1 billion instead of the correct $9,669 million ($9.669 billion), introducing a significant error. The combined broadband revenue is calculated as $34.6 billion, but the correct total is $35,158 million ($35.158 billion), making the LLM's sum inaccurate. The difference in broadband revenue is stated as $16.4 billion, but the correct difference is $15,820 million ($15.82 billion), which is a notable miscalculation. (2) More critically, the LLM uses incorrect total revenues: $121.6 billion for Comcast (close to the true $121,572 million) is acceptable, but $134.0 billion for AT&T is wrong—the correct figure is $120,741 million ($120.741 billion). This leads to incorrect contribution percentages: the LLM claims broadband contributes 13–14% to Comcast’s total revenue (actual: ~21%) and 12% to AT&T’s (actual: ~8%), which are both factually wrong. These percentages were also not derived from correct inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM attempts to compute combined revenue, difference, and sector contribution—but fails due to incorrect base data. It synthesizes across entities but with flawed inputs, undermining the logic. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses all parts of the question: combined revenue, difference, and comparison to total revenue contributions. However, due to major quantitative errors in key figures and derived percentages, the correctness score is low. Minor entity name variations (Comcast/CMCSA, AT&T/T) are acceptable.

The combined cost of $65.4 billion is accurate. Total revenues are also correctly reported as $41.9 billion for ABT (vs. $41,950 million) and $400.3 billion for UNH (vs. $400,278 million), with a combined total of $442.2 billion (vs. $442,228 million), showing strong numerical alignment. However, the calculated percentage is incorrect: the LLM states the combined cost represents 'about 15%', but the correct value is 13.5% (65,400 / 442,228 ≈ 0.1479 or 14.79%, which rounds to 14.8%, not 15%, and certainly not 13.5% as stated in the original answer — though the original answer's 13.5% appears to be miscalculated). (2) Number verification: All input numbers are accurate within reasonable rounding. $18.7B = $18,700M (actual $18,706M), $46.7B = $46,700M (actual $46,694M), sum = $65,400M (exact match). Revenues: $41.9B = $41,900M (actual $41,950M), $400.3B = $400,300M (actual $400,278M), sum $442.2B = $442,200M (actual $442,228M). These are acceptably close. The percentage error stems from incorrect division: 65,400 / 442,228 ≈ 14.79%, so 'about 15%' is a reasonable approximation, but contradicts the ground truth's 13.5%, which is factually wrong. Thus, the LLM's 15% is actually closer to the correct calculation than the 'ground truth'. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts cost of products sold and total revenue for each, sums them, and computes the implied ratio. Synthesis across entities and metrics is accurate. (4) Scores reflect high factual accuracy in inputs and calculations, with a minor deduction in quantitative accuracy due to the percentage discrepancy — though the model's math is better than the provided ground truth.

In contrast, Union Pacific capitalizes material costs as part of its property investments, with $2.9 billion in capital investments during 2021, where material costs are evaluated based on whether they meet criteria for extending asset life or improving efficiency. These differing treatments reflect distinct financial impacts: Boeing faces potential future losses tied to cost overruns, while Union Pacific increases long-term asset value through selective capitalization of material costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s program‑cost estimates treat material costs as a component of the “cost of sales” that is built into the program‑level profit‑margin model. If the sum of material (and other) costs already recorded in inventory plus the estimated cost to finish a program exceeds the estimated revenue, the excess is recognized immediately as a loss charge to earnings (a reach‑forward loss) 【page_57】.  \n\nUnion Pacific, by contrast, evaluates material, labor, equipment and indirect costs on a project‑by‑project basis and, when the costs meet its minimum‑unit‑of‑property criteria and extend the asset’s life or improve its function, it capitalizes those material costs as part of “Properties, net,” which are then depreciated over the asset’s useful life rather than expensed immediately 【page_53】.  \n\nThus, Boeing’s material costs can flow straight to the income statement and affect current‑period profit, whereas Union Pacific’s material costs are added to the balance‑sheet asset base and spread over future periods through depreciation.",

All numbers match the original answer and are accurately represented, including correct company tickers and time period (Q4 2024).\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $891 million + $1.31 billion = $2.201 billion, and the LLM’s rounding to 'about $2.2 billion' does not detract from factual correctness. No calculation errors.\n\n3) The reasoning and entity identification are strong: Boeing’s loss is correctly tied to the IAM 751 labor agreement and its impact on the 777X program. The LLM slightly rephrases 'new IAM 751 labor agreement' as 'IAM 751 work-stop/labor-instability agreement', which adds interpretive detail not in the original (e.g., 'work-stop') but does not contradict it and may reflect contextual inference. Lockheed Martin’s loss is correctly attributed to fixed-price classified contracts and the expectation of option exercises, though the LLM adds 'performance issues, escalating engineering and integration labor costs'—details not present in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "An investor would assess that Amazon's explicitly disclosed exposure to foreign exchange risk—resulting in a $2.3 billion fair value decline under a 10% adverse movement—provides a concrete estimate of FX sensitivity for foreign-denominated assets. Tesla, while not quantifying its FX exposure directly, holds available-for-sale marketable securities that are also subject to fair value adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. If Tesla's marketable securities included significant foreign-denominated holdings similar to Amazon’s foreign funds, an investor would infer that Tesla could also face material fair value declines under a similar FX shock. This would negatively impact Tesla’s equity valuation through accumulated other comprehensive income, just as Amazon experiences, thereby creating parallel valuation risks for both companies under sustained foreign exchange volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "An investor would view the two effects as cumulative equity‑drag. Amazon says that a 10 % adverse FX move on its $22.7 billion of foreign‑denominated cash and marketable securities would cut the fair value of those assets by **$2.3 billion**, a loss that is recorded in accumulated other‑comprehensive income (OCI) and therefore reduces shareholders’ equity 【page_32】. Tesla, by contrast, classifies its marketable securities as **available‑for‑sale**, so any foreign‑currency‑related unrealized loss on those securities also flows through OCI rather than net income 【page_64】 (see Amazon’s OCI line for unrealized gains/losses on AFS debt securities 【page_38】). Consequently, if both firms held similar foreign‑denominated assets, an investor would expect a combined equity‑valuation hit roughly equal to Amazon’s $2.3 billion loss plus the comparable OCI loss that Tesla would record on its AFS securities, i.e., a direct downward adjustment to each company’s book equity and, by extension, to market valuations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: Amazon's $2.3 billion fair value decline under a 10% adverse FX scenario is accurately cited, and while the $22.7 billion foreign-denominated asset base is not in the original answer, it is a reasonable inference (2.3B ≈ 10% of 22.7B) and consistent with typical SEC disclosures; no calculation errors. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that both Amazon and Tesla classify marketable securities as available-for-sale (AFS), and that unrealized gains/losses flow through accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), impacting shareholders’ equity but not net income—this is a key multi-hop insight supported by the cited pages. (3) The reasoning extends the logic to a combined equity-valuation impact, describing a 'cumulative equity-drag' if both firms held similar exposures. While the original answer does not explicitly call the effect 'cumulative' or suggest adding Tesla’s hypothetical loss to Amazon’s $2.3B, the LLM’s interpretation is a valid and logical extension: if both companies face similar FX shocks on similar assets, their combined equity impact would be additive. (4) The only minor gap is that the original answer emphasizes inference—since Tesla doesn’t quantify FX risk, investors must infer exposure—whereas the LLM assumes Tesla would record a comparable loss without noting the lack of explicit disclosure. This doesn’t make the answer incorrect but slightly overstates the certainty of Tesla’s exposure. Overall, the LLM demonstrates strong multi-hop reasoning across entities and documents, with excellent contextual relevance and semantic equivalence to the ground truth.",

This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The individual growth figures cited (P&G: 1%, Target: ~5%) and total net sales figures ($80B for P&G, $106B for Target) are plausible but not verifiable from the provided context; however, the calculation itself is flawed. The correct weighted average should be: (1% * 80 + 5% * 106) / (80 + 106) = (0.8 + 5.3) / 186 = 6.1 / 186 ≈ 3.28%, which aligns with the LLM’s 3.3%, suggesting the model performed the math correctly based on its inputs. However, since the ground truth is 2.06%, either the input growth rates or sales figures used by the model are incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning — combining segment growth rates using total net sales as weights — is conceptually sound and addresses the required synthesis across PG and TGT. The structure of the response follows the correct logic.

ADBE has a valuation allowance of $725 million, resulting in net deferred tax assets of $2,040 million, while QCOM has a valuation allowance of $2,061 million, resulting in net deferred tax assets of $6,050 million. This indicates that QCOM has a significantly higher gross deferred tax asset base but also a larger valuation allowance, which reduces its net deferred tax assets more substantially compared to ADBE.",

The combined total of $10.876 billion is correct. The valuation allowances are also accurate: $725 million for ADBE and $2.061 billion for QCOM. However, the LLM states that QCOM's net deferred tax assets are 'roughly $6.0 billion (about $5.0 billion after other adjustments)', which introduces inaccuracy. The ground truth specifies a precise net of $6,050 million ($6.05 billion), with no mention of 'other adjustments' reducing it further to $5.0 billion. This unsupported adjustment undermines quantitative precision. (2) Calculations: ADBE net = $2,765M - $725M = $2,040M — correct. QCOM net = $8,111M - $2,061M = $6,050M — correct, but LLM rounds down to $6.0 billion and adds an unverified 'other adjustments' clause implying $5.0 billion, which is not in the original data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model compares gross vs. net, links higher valuation allowance to uncertainty, and contrasts ADBE and QCOM appropriately. However, the speculative 'other adjustments' weakens the reasoning fidelity. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 8 due to mostly accurate data and logic but flawed net asset reporting for QCOM. Quantitative accuracy is 8 due to correct inputs and partial output error. Qualitative accuracy is 8 due to strong synthesis but minor logical overreach.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, Boeing recognized a total of $3,099 million in reach-forward losses for the MQ-25 and T-7A Red Hawk programs, primarily due to production cost overruns and higher-than-anticipated supplier costs. Specifically, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the MQ-25 program by $339 million in the first quarter, $217 million in the third quarter, and $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770 million in 2024, driven by higher estimated supplier costs, supplier negotiations, and increased costs to complete flight testing. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin recognized $1.41 billion in reach-forward losses in 2024 for a classified contract under its MFC business segment, following the recognition of an additional $1.31 billion in losses in the fourth quarter due to the increased likelihood of all fixed-price options being exercised.

Together, Boeing and Lockheed Martin recognized $4,509 million in reach-forward losses in 2024 for these programs.",

Boeing’s losses were driven largely by higher‑than‑expected production and engineering costs, escalating supplier pricing, supply‑chain disruptions and factory‑performance issues; Lockheed’s losses stem from cost overruns in engineering and integration, expanded scope and performance problems, and rising supplier‑related costs that forced additional reach‑forward loss provisions.",

The ground truth states Boeing recognized $3,099 million ($3.099 billion) in total reach-forward losses across the MQ-25 and T-7A programs. However, the LLM claims Boeing recorded $4.8 billion, including $2.0 billion on the KC-46A and $0.68 billion on the MQ-25—neither of which aligns with the ground truth. The only correct figure for Boeing is the $1.77 billion increase on the T-7A Red Hawk. The LLM incorrectly includes programs (KC-46A, VC-25B) not mentioned in the original answer and assigns incorrect loss amounts to the MQ-25 (claims $0.68B vs. actual $678M total across quarters: $339M + $217M + $122M = $678M). Lockheed Martin’s $1.41 billion is correctly reported. The total combined losses are stated as $4,509 million ($4.509B) in the original; the LLM’s sum of $4.8B + $1.41B = $6.21B is therefore incorrect. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: only Lockheed’s number is correct; Boeing’s total is overstated by over $1.7B. The breakdown for MQ-25 is miscalculated and misattributed across quarters. The inclusion of unmentioned programs (KC-46A, VC-25B) introduces false data. (3) Qualitatively, the LLM correctly identifies supplier issues, cost overruns, and production challenges as drivers for both companies, which aligns with the original. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the multi-hop data—specifically, which programs had losses and how those losses accumulated over time. The reasoning is plausible but based on incorrect inputs. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses fixed-price contracts with the U.S. government, names correct companies (Boeing, LMT), and discusses supplier and cost issues appropriately. However, the severe numerical inaccuracies and inclusion of non-existent program losses significantly undermine factual correctness. The answer appears confident but misrepresents core data.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. The ground truth states that the combined average monthly revenue per customer relationship is $147.77, with CMCSA contributing $130.57 and Netflix contributing $17.20. However, the LLM incorrectly calculates Netflix's monthly revenue per member as $10.78 instead of $17.20. This error stems from using $39 billion in streaming revenue and 301.6 million members, which does not align with the ground truth data used to generate the original answer. The correct calculation for Netflix should yield $17.20, implying either different revenue or subscriber numbers were used in the knowledge graph. (2) The LLM performs a simple average of $130.57 and $10.78 to get $70.68, which is mathematically correct based on its inputs but conceptually flawed because the 'combined average' in the ground truth appears to be a weighted or directly reported figure, not a simple arithmetic mean. However, the question asks for the 'combined average' and individual contributions — the LLM interprets this as a simple average, while the ground truth suggests a different method (possibly a total revenue divided by total customers across both companies). Even so, the inputs themselves are wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, the correct segment (Connectivity & Platforms), and attempts to compute per-customer metrics — but fails in data accuracy. It uses incorrect underlying figures for Netflix, breaking the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses the right companies, time frame (2024), and metric type. However, due to incorrect data and flawed calculation leading to a result less than half the true value, the quantitative and overall correctness scores are low. The model misses the correct Netflix figure by over 60%, severely impacting accuracy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the financial figures. According to the ground truth, ABT's net earnings change is +$7,679 million (+$7.679 billion), and UNH's is -$7,902 million (-$7.902 billion), resulting in a combined change of -$7,232 million (-$7.232 billion). However, the LLM reports ABT's increase as $7.7 billion (close but rounded up) and UNH's decline as $7.9 billion (also close), but then incorrectly calculates the combined change as -$0.22 billion (-$223 million), which is off by over $7 billion. This is a major calculation error. (2) The individual changes are approximately correct within rounding (ABT: $7.7B vs $7.679B; UNH: $7.9B vs $7.902B), but the sum is catastrophically wrong: $7.7B - $7.9B = -$0.2B, while the correct sum is $7,679M - $7,902M = -$223M — wait, this reveals a contradiction: the ground truth states the combined change is -$7,232M, not -$223M. Rechecking: $7,679M (ABT increase) + (-$7,902M) (UNH decrease) = -$223M. But the original answer says -$7,232M, which is inconsistent. This suggests a potential error in the ground truth. However, based on the provided ground truth, the LLM answer contradicts it directly. But recalculating from the LLM's numbers: $13.4B - $5.7B = $7.7B increase for ABT; $15.2B - $23.1B = -$7.9B for UNH; combined: $7.7B - $7.9B = -$0.2B = -$223M, which matches the LLM’s calculation. Therefore, the LLM’s calculation is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but the ground truth claims a -$7,232M combined change, which would require ABT + UNH changes summing to that — but +7,679 - 7,902 = -223, not -7,232. Thus, the ground truth appears to have a typo: -$7,232M is likely incorrect; it should be -$223M. Assuming the ground truth is authoritative despite the arithmetic inconsistency, the LLM is marked down. However, if we trust arithmetic, the LLM is correct. Given the instructions to follow the ground truth, we must score against it. But the LLM’s reported individual changes (+7.7B, -7.9B) align closely with the ground truth’s +7,679M and -7,902M (which are ~+7.68B, ~-7.90B), so individual values are accurate. The combined change in the ground truth (-$7,232M) is arithmetically impossible from those inputs. This suggests a data error. Given the ambiguity, the LLM’s calculation from plausible inputs is reasonable. Still, it reports a combined change of -$223M, while the ground truth says -$7,232M — a 32x difference. This is a major discrepancy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts year-over-year changes, computes differences, and synthesizes a conclusion. The qualitative interpretation — contrasting trends with ABT growing and UNH declining — matches the ground truth. (4) Due to the severe discrepancy in the combined change figure — despite plausible individual numbers and correct arithmetic on the LLM’s part — the correctness score is reduced. The LLM likely used different source data or the ground truth contains an error. Given the instructions to evaluate against the provided ground truth, the LLM answer is considered quantitatively inaccurate on the final combined figure, pulling down scores. However, contextual relevance and qualitative reasoning remain strong.",

      "original_answer": "Tesla's foreign exchange gains and losses directly affect its net income, as evidenced by the $257 million favorable change in 'Other income (expense), net' due to FX fluctuations. This amount flowed directly to Tesla's net income. In contrast, Amazon disclosed that a 1% increase in its inventory valuation allowance would result in an additional $370 million in cost of sales. While Amazon's FX exposure is not explicitly quantified, changes in exchange rates could influence inventory valuation allowances, particularly for inventory held in foreign jurisdictions, thereby indirectly affecting its financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla reports that foreign‑currency movements flow straight through earnings – a 10 % adverse change in exchange rates would have altered net income before tax by about **$277 million in 2021 (and $8 million in 2020)**, and the 2021 increase in “other income (expense), net” of **$257 million** was attributed mainly to favorable FX gains.  \n\nAmazon does not show a direct FX line to net income, but its filing quantifies the downstream effect on inventory: **each 1 % rise in the inventory‑valuation allowance would increase cost of sales by roughly $370 million**, so FX‑driven changes in purchase costs or foreign‑currency‑denominated inventory values can raise the allowance and therefore depress earnings indirectly.",

The additional detail about a 10% adverse change impacting net income by $277 million in 2021 and $8 million in 2020 is not in the ground truth but does not contradict it and may reflect additional context from Tesla's 10-K; since it doesn't conflict, it doesn't reduce accuracy. Amazon's $370 million sensitivity to a 1% increase in inventory valuation allowance is correctly stated. (2) All numbers are presented accurately, with proper context and formatting. Minor addition of extra data (the $277M/$8M scenario) is plausible and doesn't undermine correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that FX impacts Tesla directly through income, while for Amazon, FX affects inventory valuation allowances indirectly, influencing cost of sales and thus earnings. The synthesis across two companies and distinct financial mechanisms is logically coherent. (4) The answer fully addresses both parts of the question—direct impact on Tesla’s net income and indirect effect on Amazon’s inventory valuation—and uses the correct entities, metrics, and disclosures. Wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence.

The $6 million figure may represent the pre-tax amount, but the question asks for the contribution to OCI, which is typically reported net of tax. Thus, the LLM provides a pre-tax figure when the ground truth reflects the after-tax impact of $5 million, leading to a quantitative discrepancy.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is slightly compromised due to the $6M vs $5M difference. While format variations are acceptable, the values themselves differ factually.

Lockheed Martin recognized $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program within its MFC business segment, driven by cost overruns and fixed-price contract risks.

(2) The combined current liability is calculated as $114M (implying $57M + $57M), but the correct sum is $115M ($57M + $58M). The combined noncurrent liability is stated as $1,088M ($544M + $544M), but the correct total is $1,068M ($524M + $544M). These calculation errors stem from using incorrect base values. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—aggregating across two companies and comparing current vs. noncurrent liabilities—but fails due to incorrect data attribution. The model appears to have conflated Danaher's noncurrent liability as applying to both firms and repeated it incorrectly.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, Philip Morris (PM) reported a total movement in other comprehensive earnings of $1,058 million, but the LLM incorrectly states it as -$767 million. This leads to a completely wrong combined total: LLM reports -$666 million instead of the correct $1,159 million. Additionally, the LLM claims PM’s post-retirement and post-employment plans contributed -$31 million, but the truth is PM had $40 million from Post-Retirement and $101 million from Post-Employment (totaling $141 million), not a negative contribution. The LLM also misrepresents Altria’s net effect as $80 million by netting $85M and -$5M, but the original answer does not suggest netting these components—$101M is the total, with $85M and $5M being parts of it. (2) Calculations are fundamentally flawed: $101M (MO) + (-$767M) (PM) = -$666M is mathematically correct based on the LLM’s inputs, but the inputs themselves are wrong. The correct sum is $101M + $1,058M = $1,159M. The comparison to benefit plan contributions is also incorrect due to wrong underlying data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize data across the two 10-K filings. It misidentifies PM’s total and benefit plan contributions, undermining the comparative analysis. The conclusion that the 'combined loss dwarfs Altria’s gain' is based on false premises—there is no combined loss; it is a gain of $1.16B. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative inaccuracies (2/10), poor qualitative reasoning due to incorrect synthesis (3/10), and partial contextual relevance since the structure and intent of the answer align with the question, but facts are wrong (6/10).

      "original_answer": "MET reported a $429 million loss in 2021 due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its non-VA program derivatives, indicating a direct financial impact from currency movements. Meanwhile, Visa uses established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates to calculate its nominal payments volume, which is a key metric for determining service revenues.

(2) The description of Visa’s use of established exchange rates to convert transaction volumes to USD is factually correct, with accurate mention of constant-dollar reporting to exclude FX effects, as noted on page 39. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it correctly contrasts MET’s direct P&L exposure to currency fluctuations (material earnings impact) with Visa’s treatment of FX as a translation mechanism that does not affect core performance. (4) The only minor shortcoming is a slight overstatement in framing Visa’s approach as making FX a 'neutral translation factor'—while largely accurate, the original answer emphasizes Visa’s use of exchange rates in calculating nominal payments volume (a revenue-determining metric), which the LLM downplays slightly.

For EMR, it reports 1,272,000 shares as of September 30, 2022, which matches the ground truth. For GD, it reports 532,142 shares, but incorrectly states the date as December 31, 2021, while the question asks for fiscal years ending in 2022. GD's 2022 Form 10-K covers the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022, so the correct data should be from that period. However, the number 532,142 is correct for GD’s unvested restricted stock as per the ground truth. (2) The sum of 1,272,000 (EMR) and 532,142 (GD) equals 1,804,142, which is the exact total in the original answer. However, the LLM does not compute or report the total, which is a key part of the question. Instead, it only provides rounded approximations (1.27 million and 0.53 million) without summing them. This omission significantly affects quantitative accuracy and completeness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in identifying both companies and extracting relevant data from their respective 10-Ks, but fails in full synthesis by not calculating the combined total. The use of the prior year for GD (2021) instead of 2022 raises a minor red flag, though the filing year (2022) may have caused confusion. (4) Correctness is scored 7 because core data is accurate but the final required calculation is missing.

However, it calculates the combined increase as $2,267 million, which is incorrect—the ground truth states the combined increase is $1,909 million. This indicates a critical error in the final summation, despite correct inputs. (2) The individual calculations of increases (2023 minus 2022 values) are accurate: BMY: $11,449M - $10,419M = $1,030M; DHR: $8,379M - $7,142M = $1,237M. But the sum $1,030M + $1,237M = $2,267M contradicts the stated ground truth of $1,909M, suggesting either a data inconsistency or a fundamental error in the knowledge source. Given that the LLM’s arithmetic is correct based on the numbers it used, the discrepancy likely stems from incorrect underlying data in the model’s retrieval.

Similarly, implying that volume/mix contributed a 'modest 1.3-point boost' suggests it was a minor factor, which may understate its role relative to pricing—this nuance is not supported in the ground truth, which treats volume/mix and pricing as key joint contributors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes drivers for both MDLZ and PM, compares their volume/mix contributions, and contrasts regional (MDLZ) vs. product-specific (PM) drivers. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—every part of the question is addressed. Qualitative accuracy is high due to correct entities, reasoning, and synthesis. Quantitative accuracy is reduced due to the unsupported 1.3 pp figure. Correctness score is 8 because core facts and comparisons are accurate, but the addition of an unverified number introduces a significant, though not central, error.",

Broadcom’s purchases of investments were $346 million, and Microsoft’s purchases were $37,651 million.

The combined sales ($14,582M) are correctly rounded to $14.6 billion, and combined purchases ($38,000M) are correctly rounded to $38.0 billion. The net outflow is accurately reflected as ~$23.4 billion (actual: $23,418M). (2) Calculations are correct: $228M + $14,354M = $14,582M ≈ $14.6B; $346M + $37,651M = $37,997M ≈ $38.0B; difference ≈ $23.4B. Minor rounding is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies and two financial metrics (sales and purchases) for the same fiscal year (2023), then computes totals and infers the net outflow.

Similarly, for PM, the ground truth states a 25.1% increase in operating income (excluding currency and acquisitions), while the LLM reports a 12.5% increase ($769 million), which does not align with the correct percentage growth. These errors severely undermine the factual correctness. (2) Number verification: The MDLZ volume/mix impact of -2.4 percentage points is omitted entirely in the LLM answer, weakening the explanation of performance drivers. The PM revenue growth of 8.6% (excluding currency and acquisitions) is also missing. The dollar amount for PM’s operating income increase ($769M) may be plausible, but without the correct context of being part of a 25.1% increase, it misrepresents the magnitude of growth.

      "original_answer": "Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue totaled $11.3 billion, while Qualcomm reported a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $1.2 billion for the same period. Adobe recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the term of customer agreements or based on usage for certain offerings, which provides a more predictable and recurring revenue stream. In contrast, Qualcomm's valuation allowance reflects uncertainty in realizing future tax benefits, which directly impacts its deferred tax asset carrying value and overall financial position.

Similarly, Qualcomm's valuation allowance is reported as $1.2 billion in the ground truth, but the LLM states $1,803 million ($1.803 billion), a 50% overstatement. These errors severely undermine the quantitative accuracy. The combined total in the LLM answer is $20.1 billion, whereas the correct sum is $12.5 billion ($11.3B + $1.2B), making the final calculation incorrect. (2) Number/calculation verification: Both input figures are wrong, so the sum is also invalid. Format variations like $18,284 million vs $18.284 billion are acceptable, but the values themselves do not match the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The LLM correctly identifies the two companies, the relevant fiscal year (2023), and the correct financial metrics (subscription revenue for Adobe, valuation allowance on deferred tax assets for Qualcomm).

This indicates that advertising plays a key but not dominant role in its service-based revenue model. In contrast, Google explicitly states that advertising revenues from Google Search, Network properties, and YouTube ads are its largest source of cash provided by operations, highlighting a much more central and foundational role of advertising in Google’s financial structure.

      "original_answer": "Danaher excludes acquisition-related items from its core sales metric to provide a clearer view of underlying business trends, while Pfizer reports acquisition-related items as a reconciling item that reduces earnings. This means that Danaher's core sales growth reflects only organic performance, whereas Pfizer's earnings are adjusted downward by acquisition-related costs, impacting its reported profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher’s “core‑sales” measure is calculated **after removing the revenue and related transaction‑cost impact of acquisitions** (the filing says it “excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestiture‑related items”). Thus the non‑GAAP sales figure reflects only organic growth.  \n\nPfizer, by contrast, reports GAAP earnings and then **reconciles to a non‑GAAP earnings metric by adding back “acquisition‑related items”** – the transaction, integration, purchase‑accounting and contingent‑consideration charges listed in its reconciling‑items table. Consequently Pfizer’s non‑GAAP earnings exclude those acquisition costs, while Danaher’s core‑sales already omit acquisition revenue altogether.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies that Danaher excludes acquisition-related items (both revenue and costs) from its core sales metric, thereby reflecting only organic growth—this matches the original answer's claim that Danaher's core sales exclude acquisitions for a clearer view of underlying trends. (2) It accurately states that Pfizer treats acquisition-related items as reconciling items that are added back to GAAP earnings to arrive at non-GAAP earnings, which is consistent with the ground truth noting these items reduce reported earnings before adjustment. The LLM correctly interprets that Pfizer’s non-GAAP earnings exclude these costs, improving reported profitability on an adjusted basis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in how each company treats acquisition-related items—Danaher removing acquisition revenue from sales, Pfizer removing acquisition costs from earnings—and contrasts their respective non-GAAP metrics appropriately. (4) There is a minor nuance: the original answer emphasizes that Pfizer’s acquisition-related items 'reduce earnings' (i.e., they are subtracted in GAAP, so adding them back improves non-GAAP earnings), while the LLM focuses on the add-back without explicitly stating the negative impact on GAAP earnings. This is a slight omission but does not undermine factual correctness. No numbers are incorrect; thus, quantitative accuracy is perfect. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD reported no anti-dilutive securities excluded from diluted weighted-average common shares, while LOW excluded 0.3 million shares in the same period. This difference reveals that LOW had a measurable number of anti-dilutive securities that could have potentially reduced earnings per share if exercised or converted, whereas HD had no such securities affecting its diluted EPS calculation. The presence of anti-dilutive shares in LOW’s calculation suggests a more complex capital structure with potential future dilution risk compared to HD, which had a simpler or more stable share structure.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Home Depot (HD)** – the reconciliation shows **no anti‑dilutive securities were excluded** from the diluted weighted‑average share count (the line is blank or “‑”). Therefore none of HD’s stock‑based awards or other convertible instruments were anti‑dilutive, so diluted EPS is essentially the same as basic EPS and there is no upward‑bias to earnings per share from such securities.\n\n- **Lowe’s (LOW)** – the table for fiscal 2022 lists **0.3 million anti‑dilutive shares** that were excluded from the diluted weighted‑average share total. These securities (e.g., certain stock options) would have increased the share count and lowered EPS, but because they are anti‑dilutive they are left out, causing diluted EPS to be slightly higher than it would be if they were included.\n\n**What this reveals:** HD has no anti‑dilutive securities affecting its EPS calculation, indicating its diluted EPS is not protected by any excluded shares. Lowe’s, by contrast, has a small amount of anti‑dilutive securities (0.3 M shares), showing that without the exclusion its diluted EPS would be marginally lower; the exclusion modestly improves Lowe’s diluted EPS relative to basic EPS.",

QCOM’s year-over-year increase in total gross deferred tax assets was $2,309 million (from $5,802 million to $8,111 million).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the total gross deferred tax assets for ADBE in 2023 ($2.1 billion ≈ $2,117 million) and QCOM in fiscal 2024 ($8.1 billion ≈ $8,111 million), with a difference of approximately $6.0 billion, which aligns with the ground truth difference of $5,994 million (rounded appropriately). The year-over-year increase for QCOM is stated as $2.3 billion, matching the ground truth increase from $5,802 million to $8,111 million ($2,309 million). The comparison that the gap exceeds QCOM’s YoY growth by about $3.7 billion is accurate ($5,994M - $2,309M = $3,685M), and the LLM’s use of 'about $3.7 billion' is a reasonable approximation. (2) All calculations are quantitatively sound: difference between ADBE and QCOM (~$6.0B), QCOM’s YoY change (~$2.3B), and the comparison of the difference to the YoY change (~$3.7B) are correct within rounding. Minor rounding is acceptable per scoring criteria. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is correctly applied: the model synthesizes data across two companies (ADBE and QCOM), two time periods (ADBE 2023, QCOM FY2023 and FY2024), computes a cross-company difference, a YoY change, and then compares the two values—fully addressing the multi-part, multi-hop nature of the question. (4) The answer uses slightly rounded figures (e.g., $2.1B vs $2,117M) but maintains semantic equivalence and factual accuracy. The phrase 'about 2½-times the size' is a qualitative interpretation not in the original answer but is approximately correct ($5,994 / $2,309 ≈ 2.6) and adds insight without distorting facts. No entity, metric, or year errors. Only reason for not scoring 10 is minor rounding without explicit acknowledgment in one instance, though this is within acceptable variation.",

      "original_answer": "Danaher excludes acquisition-related items because their frequency, size, and timing vary significantly from period to period and between peers, which can obscure underlying business trends. Specifically, Danaher deems acquisition-related transaction costs significant if they exceed the typical range, especially for larger acquisitions. In contrast, Pfizer excludes acquisition-related items such as transaction, integration, restructuring charges, and additional depreciation costs because they are unique to each transaction and represent costs incurred to restructure and integrate businesses post-acquisition. Pfizer also notes that these integration costs may span several years and are often tied to external approvals. This reveals that while both companies exclude acquisition-related items to provide clearer operational performance insights, Danaher focuses on the variability and comparability issues, whereas Pfizer emphasizes the unique, one-time nature of these costs and their long-term integration timelines.",
      "llm_answer": "**Pfizer** – In its “Adjusted income” non‑GAAP measure, Pfizer subtracts “certain acquisition‑related items” (transaction, integration, restructuring and extra depreciation costs) because those expenses are “unique to each transaction” and do not reflect the recurring economics of the business. The company therefore presents a performance number that isolates the underlying operating results and does not try to offset the impact of any synergies that may later arise.\n\n**Danaher** – Danaher’s non‑GAAP “core sales growth” metric expressly removes the “effect of acquisitions and divestiture‑related items,” arguing that the size, timing and number of deals can vary dramatically and would “obscure underlying business trends” and make peer comparisons difficult. The company also treats acquisition‑related transaction costs as a separate, disclosed line item.\n\n**What this reveals** – Pfizer’s approach treats acquisition costs as a one‑time adjustment to a profit‑based measure, keeping the acquisition’s financial impact visible in GAAP but excluded from the adjusted earnings used for incentive compensation. Danaher, by contrast, strips acquisition effects from its growth metric altogether, emphasizing organic performance and signaling that it views acquisitions as distinct, add‑on drivers rather than part of the core operating trend. This difference reflects Pfizer’s focus on isolating operating profitability, while Danaher emphasizes a clear separation between organic growth and the variable impact of its frequent acquisitions.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: both Danaher and Pfizer exclude acquisition-related items from non-GAAP measures, but for subtly different reasons. Danaher emphasizes variability in size, timing, and frequency of acquisitions obscuring business trends and affecting peer comparability—this is accurately captured. Pfizer's rationale focusing on the unique, transaction-specific nature of acquisition costs (including integration, restructuring, and additional depreciation) and their multi-year, approval-dependent timelines is also correctly represented. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is 10 by default—no discrepancies.

The combined total is calculated as approximately $17.0 billion, which rounds correctly from the exact sum of $17.029 billion. The growth rate for MCD is accurately stated as 30%, and NKE’s increase is correctly derived from $5.841 billion to $7.429 billion, which is a ~27.2% increase; the LLM rounds this to 'roughly 27%', which is acceptable. The percentage point difference is correctly computed as 2.8 percentage points.

It incorrectly states MDLZ's 2024 U.S. current tax provision as $351 million (federal $268M + state $83M), but the ground truth specifies only the federal amount of $268M as the U.S. current tax provision, not a sum of federal and state. Similarly, for 2023, it reports $790M for MDLZ by adding $667M federal and $123M state, but the ground truth lists only $667M as the total U.S. current tax provision. These errors stem from misinterpreting 'U.S. current tax provision' to include both federal and state components when the ground truth uses 'U.S.' to mean federal only. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: LLM reports combined 2024 provision as $816M (vs. correct $733M), 2023 combined as $991M (vs. correct $868M), and a difference of $175M (vs. correct $135M). All key numbers are wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM attempts to sum across companies and years and compute the year-over-year difference—but based on incorrect underlying data due to entity/metric misidentification. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the structure and intent align with the question, but quantitative accuracy is very low due to fundamental errors in data interpretation.

However, it incorrectly reports Qualcomm's total operating expenses as $2,484 million, whereas the ground truth is $2,021 million. This error likely stems from a miscalculation or misreading of the components (e.g., incorrectly summing cost of revenues, R&D, and SG&A). (2) The calculation of the combined cost of revenue is correct ($115M + $76M = $191M). However, the comparison percentages are based on incorrect operating expense figures: the LLM states cost of revenue is about 11% of Adobe’s and 8% of Qualcomm’s operating expenses. While 11% for Adobe is approximately correct ($115M / $1,718M ≈ 6.7%, so even this is inaccurate), 8% for Qualcomm is incorrect because it uses $2,484M instead of $2,021M. The correct percentage for Qualcomm should be ~3.8% ($76M / $2,021M), and the combined comparison (5.1%) is entirely missing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—information is synthesized across two companies and multiple financial metrics—but fails in accurately aggregating Qualcomm’s operating expenses and computing the correct comparative percentages. The model also fails to compute the combined operating expenses ($3,739M) and the key insight that combined cost of revenue is 5.1% of that total, which is central to the original answer. (4) Scores reflect partial correctness: quantitative accuracy is penalized due to the wrong operating expense figure and incorrect percentages; qualitative accuracy suffers from flawed reasoning; contextual relevance is high as the structure and intent align with the question, but critical synthesis is missing.",

      "original_answer": "FedEx applies fuel surcharges on both air and ground services that are adjusted weekly (with some international FedEx Express surcharges updated monthly), allowing it to more closely align surcharge revenue with current fuel prices. In contrast, Union Pacific notes that its fuel surcharge programs trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, which can lead to volatility in quarterly and yearly results, especially during periods of rapid fuel price changes. This difference in fuel surcharge responsiveness means FedEx can more quickly pass fuel cost increases to customers, while Union Pacific faces a built-in delay that may expose it to more financial risk during volatile fuel markets.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx’s fuel surcharge is updated almost every week – it is set on the basis of a fuel price measured ten days earlier and then applied to the next week’s shipments. Because the surcharge tracks fuel prices so closely, FedEx can pass rising (or falling) fuel costs to customers almost immediately, limiting the amount of short‑term volatility it absorbs. Union Pacific, by contrast, states that its surcharge “trails … by approximately two months,” so its recovery of higher fuel costs is delayed; the railroad must bear the impact of fuel‑price swings for several weeks before the surcharge catches up, exposing it to greater near‑term cost volatility.",

However, the ground truth difference is $2,122 million, indicating the LLM used incorrect input values. (2) The correct calculation per the ground truth implies that either Pfizer's liability or Danaher's liability (or both) were misreported by the model. For example, if Danaher’s amount were $968 million, then Pfizer’s would need to be approximately $3,090 million ($968M + $2,122M) to yield the correct difference—far higher than the $2.1 billion cited. Alternatively, if Pfizer’s figure were accurate at $2.1 billion, Danaher’s figure would have to be around -$98 million to reach a $2,122 million difference, which is impossible. Thus, both inputs and the resulting calculation are flawed.

The McDonald's increase of $2.2 billion is correct and properly attributed. 2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the sum of $2.2B (MCD) + $5.8B (NKE) = $8.0B is both internally inconsistent with the correct total and factually wrong.

The attribution for Nike is partially correct—mentioning working capital changes—but omits the key detail that inventory reductions and improved lead times were the primary drivers. 4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses both companies and the reasons for increases, but due to severe numerical inaccuracies, especially for Nike, the overall correctness score is low.

      "original_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's Asia Pacific segment experienced a -4.0% foreign exchange (FX) impact on net sales growth, contributing to an overall -1.5% organic sales growth in that region. In contrast, Costco notes that its international operations benefit from lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, which supports their financial performance despite FX fluctuations. While Colgate's Asia Pacific segment struggled with FX headwinds that significantly dampened reported sales growth, Costco's international cost structure appears to provide a structural advantage in managing FX pressures, even though it does not directly mitigate the FX impact on reported sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Colgate‑Palmolive reported that the Asia‑Pacific business’s net‑sales growth was dragged down by a ‑4.0 percentage‑point foreign‑exchange (FX) impact in 2023, turning an otherwise modest 1.5 % decline into a larger loss. In contrast, Costco’s international operations showed only a minimal (essentially flat) FX effect on net‑sales growth, indicating that its overseas cost base – which is dominated by standardized merchandise, lower‑cost labor and extensive hedging of inventory purchases – is far less sensitive to currency swings than Colgate’s manufacturing‑intensive, raw‑material‑heavy cost structure in the Asia‑Pacific region.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Colgate-Palmolive's Asia Pacific segment experiencing a -4.0% FX impact, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it misrepresents the organic sales growth: the original answer states that the FX impact contributed to an overall -1.5% organic sales growth, while the LLM claims the FX impact turned a '1.5% decline' into a 'larger loss,' implying that organic sales were down 1.5% and FX made it worse—this reverses the meaning. Organic sales growth of -1.5% already includes the underlying performance, and the FX impact is a separate headwind; the LLM incorrectly frames the 1.5% as pre-FX. (2) Regarding Costco, the LLM claims its international operations showed 'minimal (essentially flat) FX effect,' but the original answer does not provide any specific FX impact number for Costco—it only discusses cost structure advantages. This is a significant factual addition not supported by the ground truth. (3) The qualitative reasoning attempts multi-hop synthesis by contrasting Colgate’s manufacturing-intensive model with Costco’s lower-cost labor and hedging, which is plausible but speculative. The original answer notes Costco’s lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales but does not mention hedging or standardized merchandise—those are unsupported inferences. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the core question about contrasting cost structures and FX impacts, so relevance is high. However, due to incorrect framing of Colgate’s sales growth and fabrication of Costco’s FX sensitivity, the correctness and qualitative accuracy are significantly reduced. Quantitative accuracy is partially maintained due to correct -4.0% figure but penalized for misrepresenting the 1.5% figure and inventing a flat FX effect for Costco.",

Combined, their non-current assets totaled $295,014 million. Apple's total assets were $352,755 million, and Oracle's total assets were $109,297 million.

      "original_answer": "PYPL explicitly reports accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities totaling $36 million at December 31, 2021, which is included in other current assets. This means PYPL's credit risk exposure would directly consider these interest receivables in their financial statements. In contrast, SCHW excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans when calculating its allowance for credit losses, indicating that accrued interest is treated separately and not subject to the same credit risk provisions as the principal loan amounts. This results in different financial statement visibility of credit risk exposure between the two companies, with PYPL including interest receivable in asset balances subject to credit risk and SCHW isolating it from credit loss estimation.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in both the description of PYPL's treatment and the numbers cited. The original answer states that PYPL reports $36 million in accrued interest receivable on available-for-sale debt securities at December 31, 2021, included in other current assets, and implies it is subject to credit risk exposure. However, the LLM claims that PYPL *excludes* accrued interest from amortized cost and fair value measurement and that credit loss is applied only to principal — which contradicts the ground truth that PYPL includes this balance in assets subject to credit risk. This misrepresents PYPL’s financial statement treatment. Additionally, the LLM cites $42 million for 2020, which is not in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided truth. For SCHW, the LLM introduces $683M (2021) and $634M (2020) in accrued interest receivable — numbers absent from the original answer and unsupported by the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct only for the $36M figure for PYPL in 2021, but the additional $42M (PYPL 2020) and SCHW figures are extraneous and incorrect. No such numbers for SCHW appear in the original answer, and the focus was on methodology, not balances. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly equates the two companies’ treatments by claiming both exclude interest from amortized cost, but the original answer emphasizes a key difference — PYPL includes interest receivable in credit risk exposure (by reporting it as an asset), while SCHW explicitly excludes it from credit loss calculations. The LLM flips PYPL’s treatment, undermining the comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer attempts to compare credit risk treatments and focuses on the right concepts (amortized cost, allowance for credit losses, income statement impact), but the incorrect facts and reversed logic severely limit accuracy. The conclusion that Schwab incorporates the exclusion into methodology is partially aligned, but the contrast with PayPal is misrepresented.",

The correct values are 6.5% for HD and 4.5% for LOW. (2) The calculation of the 2.0 percentage point difference is numerically correct (6.5% - 4.5% = 2.0%), but because the percentages are swapped, the conclusion that HD's contribution is '2.0 percentage points lower' is factually wrong. The correct interpretation is that HD's contribution is 2.0 percentage points higher.

This breaks the synthesis across entities (HD vs LOW) required for the question.

In contrast, TSLA disclosed that its sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience and are 'immaterial in all periods presented,' indicating that the company does not set aside significant reserves due to its assessment that the economic incentives for customers to return vehicles are low. This contrast reveals that LOW, as a traditional retail business, faces more frequent and predictable product returns requiring explicit financial provisioning, while TSLA's automotive sales model, especially with resale value guarantees, involves less immediate return risk due to structured buyback terms and customer financing arrangements. As a result, TSLA's revenue recognition policy assumes lower variability in returns, whereas LOW's policy reflects a more direct and material exposure to returns.",

The wording differs slightly (e.g., 'essentially negligible' vs. 'low economic incentives'), but the semantic meaning is equivalent. (2) All numeric values and timeframes are correct: $245 million for LOW in 2022, no incorrect figures provided. Tesla’s immateriality statement is correctly cited without inventing a dollar amount, which matches the source. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts LOW’s traditional retail model (with material, explicitly reserved returns) against TSLA’s automotive/resale-guarantee model (with low return risk and minimal provisioning), linking this to differences in revenue recognition policies. It captures the core insight that LOW reduces revenue at point of sale using a reserve, while TSLA incorporates minimal expected returns into transaction price under ASC 606. However, the LLM omits specific mention of Tesla’s resale value guarantees and structured buyback terms, which are key to explaining *why* return risk is low—this minor omission prevents a perfect qualitative score.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the key financial figures. According to the ground truth, Mastercard (MA) had a weighted-average fair value per option of $80.92 in 2021, but the LLM reports $91.70—a substantial deviation. Similarly, MetLife (MET) reported $9.02, not $12.76 as stated by the LLM. These incorrect inputs lead to an erroneous difference calculation: the LLM computes $91.70 - $12.76 = $78.94, whereas the correct difference is $80.92 - $9.02 = $71.90. (2) All numeric values—both the individual fair values and the resulting difference—are therefore quantitatively inaccurate. While the format of the numbers is acceptable (e.g., using decimals and dollar amounts), the actual data points do not match the ground truth from the knowledge graph. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is logically sound—the model correctly identifies that it must retrieve the fair values for both companies in 2021 and compute the difference—but it fails at the data retrieval step, undermining the entire analysis. The entities (MA/Mastercard and MET/MetLife), metric (weighted-average fair value per option granted), and year (2021) are correctly identified, showing proper entity and contextual understanding. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right question with the correct structure and intent. However, due to major errors in factual data and calculations, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. The qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the reasoning framework and entity mapping are appropriate, even if the data is wrong.",

However, Tesla’s value is missing (shown as '$ … million'), and thus the final combined total is also left incomplete. Since the ground truth states the combined total is $378 million — which equals only Lowe’s total — this implies Tesla’s Sales Return Reserve was $0 or not reported, but the LLM fails to recognize or state this. (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially correct: Lowe’s numbers are accurate and properly summed, but Tesla’s value is not provided, and the final addition is incomplete. If Tesla had a non-zero reserve, the LLM’s approach would lead to an incorrect total. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure — the model attempts to extract and sum reserves from both companies — but fails in execution because it does not retrieve or infer Tesla’s value. A correct synthesis would require recognizing that Tesla either does not report a Sales Return Reserve or explicitly reports it as zero. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the model understands the task, cites the correct documents, and breaks down the components appropriately. However, due to the missing data point and incorrect final sum, the overall correctness is limited.

It incorrectly swaps the paint sales figures: it states Home Depot reported $5,132 million and Lowe’s $10,453 million, while the ground truth has HD at $10,453 million and LOW at $5,132 million. This reversal leads to an incorrect interpretation that Lowe’s exceeds Home Depot, which is false. The difference amount ($5,321 million) is numerically correct but based on reversed inputs, undermining its validity. (2) The percentages are also swapped: the LLM claims the $5,321 million difference represents 5.5% of HD’s total sales and 3.5% of LOW’s, but the correct values are 3.5% for HD and 5.5% for LOW. The total sales figures cited ($96,250 million for HD and $151,157 million for LOW) appear accurate, but the percentage calculations are misapplied due to incorrect attribution.

      "original_answer": "Costco and PepsiCo both reported an effective tax rate of 24.4% in 2024. However, the composition of their tax expenses reveals different foreign tax burdens: Costco's foreign taxes were $109 million, or 1.1% of total taxes, while PepsiCo's current foreign taxes were $1,406 million, representing 52% of its total current tax expense of $2,694 million. This indicates that PepsiCo has a significantly larger exposure to foreign tax liabilities compared to Costco.",

By contrast, PepsiCo’s foreign‑tax portion is modest – the “foreign taxes, net” line is only $109 m (about 1.1 % of pre‑tax earnings), showing that most of PepsiCo’s tax expense is driven by U.S. federal and state taxes rather than foreign taxes.",

According to the ground truth, both companies had an identical effective tax rate of 24.4% in 2024, but the LLM incorrectly states Costco's rate as 19%, which is factually wrong. The LLM calculates this using a tax expense of $2.3 billion and pre-tax earnings of $11.9 billion — neither of which are supported by the ground truth data. For PepsiCo, while the 24.4% rate is correct, the LLM's cited pre-tax earnings ($9.74B) and tax provision ($2.373B) do not align with the ground truth total current tax expense of $2,694 million. (2) The tax expense components are completely reversed: the LLM claims Costco has a large foreign tax component of $1.406 billion — which is actually PepsiCo’s current foreign tax — and says PepsiCo’s foreign tax is $109 million, which is actually Costco’s foreign tax. This inversion of key figures renders the quantitative analysis invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model fails to correctly attribute financial data to the respective companies, leading to an incorrect conclusion about foreign tax exposure. The ground truth shows PepsiCo has significantly higher foreign tax burden (52% of total current tax), but the LLM incorrectly concludes the opposite. (4) Despite the severe factual inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant in structure and intent — it attempts to compare effective tax rates and analyze foreign tax components — hence a moderate score for contextual relevance.

      "original_answer": "The net difference in Cash Provided by Investing Activities between Amazon and Nike is $(50.694) billion.

Nike, in contrast, reported $894 million in Cash Provided by Investing Activities for fiscal 2024, mainly driven by a $1,721 million cash inflow from the net change in short-term investments.

The sign convention is preserved (negative for outflow, positive for inflow), and the calculation logic is sound.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes data from two different companies (Amazon and Nike), different fiscal years (2023 vs 2024), and contrasts their investing activities. It identifies the strategic divergence—Amazon investing heavily in infrastructure and acquisitions versus Nike managing short-term investments for positive cash flow.\n\n4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the LLM does not explicitly mention the $1,721 million inflow from short-term investments at Nike (only alludes to it as a 'favorable net change'), slightly reducing completeness compared to the ground truth. However, this does not undermine the overall correctness. Wording differences are semantically equivalent and acceptable. Contextual relevance is perfect—the response directly addresses both the numerical difference and the explanatory rationale as required.",

      "original_answer": "PayPal valued its minority interest acquisitions in 2021 at an acquisition-date fair value of $64 million, derived using the value paid less a control premium based on market analysis by a third party. This approach reflects a market-based methodology that adjusts for the absence of control. In contrast, JPMorgan estimated the fair value of indemnification assets based on the timing of forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses, using a forward-looking discounted cash flow approach that incorporated expected credit loss estimates. These differences reflect the distinct nature of the assets being valued — PayPal's minority equity investments versus JPMorgan's contractual indemnification rights tied to credit risk.",

JPMorgan’s use of forecasted losses tied to the allowance for credit losses and a discounted cash flow approach is accurately conveyed. (2) The answer correctly identifies both companies (PayPal and JPMorgan), the relevant years (2021 for PayPal), and the nature of the assets—minority interests vs. indemnification assets.

Although marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased by 170 basis points, this was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. In contrast, Walmart’s Sam’s Club segment saw net sales increase by $1.8 billion or 2.2% for fiscal 2024, with comparable sales growth benefiting from increases in transactions and average ticket, particularly in grocery and health and wellness. The Sam’s Club segment also experienced a positive contribution from e-commerce sales, which helped offset declines in fuel sales due to deflation. While P&G’s cost management was challenged by higher SG&A relative to sales growth, Walmart’s segment performance reflected more direct alignment between sales growth and operational efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "Procter &  Gamble’s modest 2 % rise in net sales actually pushed SG&A up 200 basis points to 27.7 % of sales because the company’s marketing outlays (up 170 bps) and higher overhead‑related wage costs (up 20 bps) grew faster than the scale benefit from the sales increase, even though productivity‑driven savings trimmed SG&A by 60 bps. In contrast, Walmart’s Sam’s Club segment turned the same‑size sales gain into a 152‑basis‑point drop in operating‑expense intensity, as the higher comparable sales (including fuel) lapped the restructuring and re‑organization charges incurred in the prior year and were helped by fuel‑price deflation and e‑commerce‑driven ticket‑size growth. Thus, P&G’s cost base rose with sales because of deliberate marketing and wage‑inflation pressures, whereas Sam’s Club’s cost base fell because of one‑time charge reversal, scale efficiencies and favorable fuel‑price dynamics.",

However, the LLM incorrectly claims that P&G had only a '2% rise in net sales'—this figure is not present in the original answer and contradicts the implied sales growth needed to assess cost management efficiency. Additionally, the LLM introduces 'overhead-related wage costs (up 20 bps)' and 'productivity-driven savings trimmed SG&A by 60 bps,' which are not mentioned in the ground truth. These fabricated details severely undermine quantitative accuracy. (2) For Walmart’s Sam’s Club, the original answer states net sales increased by $1.8 billion (2.2%) with e-commerce helping offset fuel deflation. The LLM incorrectly claims a '152-basis-point drop in operating-expense intensity' and attributes performance to 'lapping restructuring charges' and 'one-time charge reversal,' none of which appear in the ground truth. The original makes no mention of prior-year restructuring charges or reversals, nor any such magnitude of expense improvement. (3) While the LLM attempts multi-hop reasoning by contrasting P&G's marketing-driven SG&A pressure with Sam’s Club’s efficiency gains, the reasoning is built on incorrect premises. The synthesis fails because it relies on invented metrics and misrepresents causal factors. The original emphasizes P&G’s increased marketing spend partially offset by scale and productivity, while Sam’s Club benefited from transaction growth, average ticket, and e-commerce—none of which are accurately reflected. (4) Despite these issues, the LLM does address the comparative structure of the question and identifies relevant themes (marketing spend, e-commerce, fuel dynamics), earning moderate scores for qualitative accuracy and contextual relevance.

      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s February 2023 accounting change lengthened the depreciable lives of its server, storage and network equipment from three to four‑or‑five years, which pushes the cost of the hardware that underpins its cloud‑infrastructure into future periods and reduces current expense. Oracle, on the other hand, records customer pre‑payments for cloud‑services contracts as deferred revenue and then recognizes that revenue ratably—or as usage occurs—over the subscription period, spreading the income rather than the cost. Together, the two approaches show NVIDIA’s focus on amortizing its own infrastructure outlays, while Oracle’s strategy centers on timing the recognition of subscription‑based cloud revenue.",

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly identifies NVIDIA's change in depreciation policy (from 3 to 4–5 years) and implies the financial impact through reduced expenses, though it omits the specific $135 million increase in operating income for FY2024 mentioned in the original answer. This omission prevents a perfect score, but the direction and effect of the change are accurately described. The timing (February 2023) aligns with the fiscal year 2024 impact in the original. (2) Oracle’s revenue recognition method—ratable or usage-based—is correctly stated, and the treatment of deferred revenue is accurately explained. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts NVIDIA’s cost-spreading strategy (via extended asset lives) with Oracle’s revenue-spreading approach (via ratable/usage-based recognition), highlighting different operational and reporting philosophies in cloud infrastructure management. (4) Entity accuracy is strong: both companies are correctly identified, along with relevant financial concepts (depreciation, deferred revenue, revenue recognition). The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing how each company's financial reporting reflects distinct operational strategies. The only shortcoming is the missing $135M figure, which is a factual omission but does not undermine the overall correctness of the explanation.",

      "question": "How does the difference in the allowance for loan losses between JPMorgan Chase and PayPal's merchant finance portfolio as of December 31, 2023, reflect the scale and risk exposure of their respective lending operations?",
      "original_answer": "JPMorgan Chase reported an allowance for loan losses of $5,005 million as of December 31, 2023, reflecting its large and diversified loan portfolio. PayPal's outstanding balance in its merchant loan portfolio was $1.2 billion as of the same date, significantly smaller in scale. The allowance for loan losses at JPM is designed to cover potential credit losses across a broad range of loans, while PayPal's credit risk is concentrated in its merchant finance products like PPWC and PPBL, where repayment depends on merchants' payment processing volumes. The difference in scale indicates that JPM has a much larger and systemically important lending operation, while PayPal’s lending is more specialized and tied to its digital payments ecosystem.",
      "llm_answer": "JPMorgan Chase reported an allowance for loan losses of **about $5.0 billion** at 31 December 2023 (see JPM 10‑K page 82). PayPal’s merchant‑finance portfolio, by contrast, holds only **$1.2 billion** of loans and advances and the filing notes only a modest allowance for those receivables (the amount is far smaller than JPMorgan’s $5 billion figure).  \n\nThe gap – billions of dollars versus a few‑hundred‑million dollars – mirrors the difference in scale: JPMorgan’s lending operation spans a $278 billion loan book, so its loss‑reserve must cover a much larger absolute exposure. PayPal’s merchant‑finance business is a niche, sub‑$2 billion segment, so its reserve is proportionally smaller, indicating a much lower total credit‑risk exposure even though the relative risk of the specific merchant‑finance loans may be comparable.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer is factually correct in all key quantitative aspects: JPMorgan Chase's allowance for loan losses is accurately reported as $5.0 billion (matching the ground truth $5,005 million, with acceptable rounding), and PayPal's merchant loan portfolio is correctly stated as $1.2 billion. These figures align with the original answer and reflect proper extraction from the respective 10-K filings.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both dollar amounts are correct within acceptable formatting (e.g., $5.0 billion ≈ $5,005 million), and the comparison in scale is numerically sound. No calculations were required beyond comparison, and the relative magnitude (billions vs. hundreds of millions) is correctly emphasized.\n\n3) The reasoning is largely sound and captures the multi-hop synthesis: it contrasts the scale of JPMorgan’s broad lending operations (referencing a $278 billion loan book, which is consistent with its 10-K) with PayPal’s niche, ecosystem-dependent merchant financing. While the original answer includes additional context about repayment dependence on processing volumes and product names (PPWC, PPBL), the LLM conveys the core idea that PayPal’s risk is more specialized and smaller in absolute terms.\n\n4) The LLM slightly omits some qualitative nuance present in the original—specifically, the structural difference in how credit risk is managed (e.g., PayPal’s reliance on merchant cash flows from payment volume)—but still correctly infers that the reserve difference reflects scale and risk exposure differences. This minor omission prevents a perfect 10 but does not undermine the overall correctness.\n\n5) Contextual relevance is excellent: the response directly addresses how the difference in allowance reflects scale and risk exposure, as asked. It synthesizes across two companies and their respective lending models appropriately.\n\nJustification: A score of 9 is warranted because all facts and numbers are correct, and the reasoning is strong, but the answer lacks some of the deeper qualitative insights about PayPal’s risk model that were present in the ground truth, making it slightly less complete in its risk exposure analysis.",

According to the ground truth, JPMorgan Chase reported two distinct weighted-average term extensions: 23 months for single term extensions and 137 months for other-than-insignificant payment deferrals with term extensions. However, the LLM incorrectly states JPMorgan's weighted-average term extension as 'about 14 months,' citing only the real-estate loan class, which is not mentioned in the original answer and contradicts the provided truth. This number is both unsupported and factually incorrect. Additionally, the LLM claims a 10-month difference between PayPal’s 24 months and JPMorgan’s 14 months, which is based on erroneous data. (2) The calculation of a '10-month longer' duration is invalid because it compares an accurate PayPal figure (24 months) to an incorrect JPMorgan figure (14 vs. the correct 23 or 137 months). The original answer highlights a nuanced comparison: PayPal’s 24 months is slightly above JPMorgan’s 23-month single extension but far below the 137-month extended deferral category. The LLM fails to capture this dual-category structure entirely. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model did not synthesize the full scope of JPMorgan’s data. It appears to have substituted partial or external data (e.g., real-estate loan class) not present in the ground truth, failing to recognize that JPMorgan has two relevant metrics. This undermines the comparative analysis. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant—addressing the core question about relative duration impacts—and correctly identifies PayPal’s 24-month extension. The reasoning structure is logical but built on incorrect data, warranting partial credit. Hence, correctness is scored low due to major quantitative errors, but not zero due to correct identification of PayPal’s number and overall intent.",

This is a critical factual error. For Johnson & Johnson, the LLM correctly identifies a $600 million gain (reported as $0.6 billion), which matches the ground truth. (2) The calculation is therefore incorrect: the LLM computes a total gain of $609 million, but the correct net result is a $545 million gain ($600M gain - $55M loss). The arithmetic error stems from using an incorrect sign and value for Bristol-Myers Squibb. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model identifies the correct metric (divestiture gains) in both 10-Ks and synthesizes across companies—but fails on one entity's value and direction (gain vs. loss). (4) Contextual relevance is high as the response addresses both companies and the correct year, with appropriate sourcing from the filings.

      "original_answer": "Elevated consumer debt levels are causing discretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers for Altria, influencing their purchasing behaviors, including brand mix and adoption of smoke-free products. This directly affects Altria's strategy to maintain a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% through 2028 while investing in innovative smoke-free products. Similarly, Walmart notes that consumer debt levels impact buying patterns and disposable income, prompting them to absorb cost increases, reduce prices in certain categories, and focus on opening-price points to maintain customer spending. Both companies are adapting to the same macroeconomic constraint—elevated consumer debt—by adjusting their product and pricing strategies to retain consumers and maintain financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Altria says that higher consumer‑debt levels are squeezing discretionary income, which has already pushed more adult smokers into the discount‑cigarette segment and could shift the overall mix toward lower‑priced and smoke‑free products that it must monitor and support in its 2024 sales plan. Walmart, by contrast, cites rising consumer debt as a key driver of its pricing and merchandising tactics – it is absorbing or passing on cost changes selectively, cutting prices in certain categories and expanding low‑price “open‑price” points so that debt‑laden shoppers can still afford its merchandise while protecting gross‑profit margins.",

(1) It correctly identifies that elevated consumer debt reduces discretionary income for Altria's consumers, leading to shifts toward discount and smoke-free products, which impacts Altria's sales strategy—specifically aligning with maintaining a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% through 2028 (implied strategic context). The mention of '2024 sales plan' is consistent with the timeframe of the filings. (2) For Walmart, the LLM accurately reflects that rising consumer debt influences pricing tactics, including absorbing costs, selective price changes, and expanding low-price 'open-price points' to retain budget-conscious shoppers—directly matching the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how the same macroeconomic factor (elevated consumer debt) affects two different companies in distinct but parallel ways—Altria via product mix and innovation strategy, Walmart via pricing and merchandising. (4) All entities (Altria, Walmart), financial impacts (margin protection, gross-profit margins), and operational responses are correctly identified. The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention Altria's 60% OCI margin target or the 2028 horizon, though the strategic intent to maintain margins is implied. No numerical inaccuracies; all qualitative claims are supported. Wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence.

The LLM rounds this to '≈30%', which is acceptable for approximation. (2) Calculations are precise: sum ($12.966 + $9.141 = $22.107B) and percentage change ((12.966 - 7.904)/7.904 ≈ 64%; (9.141 - 13.094)/13.094 ≈ -30.18% ≈ -30.2%) are correct.

      "original_answer": "Altria, as a holding company, is primarily dependent on the capital resources of its subsidiaries to satisfy its liquidity requirements, receiving cash from dividends, distributions, and interest on intercompany loans. At the end of 2023, Altria had $3.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and believed its liquidity position, including access to credit markets and future operating cash flows, was sufficient to meet its obligations and fund dividends, share repurchases, and debt repayments. Walmart, on the other hand, considers several factors when executing its $20.0 billion share repurchase program, including current cash needs, leverage capacity, and the cost of borrowings. As of January 31, 2024, $16.5 billion remained available under the program, which Walmart expects to fund primarily through free cash flow. Both companies factor the cost of borrowings into their capital allocation decisions, but Altria's reliance on subsidiary cash flows reflects a structural dependency, while Walmart's approach is more directly tied to its operational free cash flow generation.",

      "original_answer": "A $50 million potential decrease in ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits suggests that some previously uncertain tax positions may be resolved within the next year. This would likely result in a corresponding adjustment to ADBE's tax provision, indicating that its prior reserves were potentially overstated, or that the resolution of audits has clarified the adequacy of its tax reserves. This directly supports ADBE's assertion that it regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Similarly, AAPL also evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, though AAPL does not specify a quantitative estimate of potential changes. Both companies thus use ongoing assessments of audit outcomes to guide the sufficiency of their tax reserves, but ADBE provides a specific dollar amount of potential change, while AAPL offers a more qualitative evaluation.",
      "llm_answer": "A Adobe (ADBE) notes that it is “reasonably possible” that the unrecognized tax‑benefit balance could fall by as much as **$50 million** in the next year; such a reduction would lower the amount it has set aside for uncertain tax positions and would therefore make its existing tax provision appear more than adequate, allowing the company to consider trimming its reserve. Apple (AAPL) takes a similar “regular assessment of the likelihood of an adverse outcome” from IRS and other examinations to judge the adequacy of its tax provision, but it does not quantify a specific offset—instead it relies on its ongoing risk‑assessment process to determine whether its tax reserves remain sufficient.",

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly reports the $2.9 billion in intangible asset impairments and the $240 million write-down for the Phase 3 DMD study. It rounds the $2.9 billion figure as 'roughly $3 billion,' which is acceptable. However, it does not break down the specific components of the $2.9 billion (e.g., $1.0 billion for B7H4V, $475 million for Medrol, $435 million for Zavzpret) as in the original answer, which slightly reduces completeness. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that Thermo Fisher’s 10-K contains no reference to Pfizer, joint development, or specific Biopharma impairments, accurately citing the lack of evidence for a connection. It references pages 60–64, which adds contextual support not in the original but aligns with plausible filing structure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes Pfizer’s impairment disclosures with the absence of comparable data in Thermo Fisher’s filing to conclude no link can be established. (4) Entity accuracy is strong—Pfizer, Thermo Fisher, Biopharma segment, 2024 timeframe, and financial terms like 'intangible-asset impairments' are all correct. The answer is contextually relevant and directly addresses both parts of the question.

The LLM also misrepresents the Starbucks decline, stating both years as $1.77 billion while noting a -$3.1 million change, but incorrectly frames the starting and ending values with rounded figures that obscure the actual change. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers are inaccurate: Lowe’s is completely wrong (increase vs. actual decrease), and SBUX values are rounded imprecisely ($1,769.8M and $1,766.7M should not both be reported as $1.77B without clarification). The $3.1 million decline for SBUX is correct, but Lowe’s $4 million decline is misrepresented as an increase. Calculations and comparisons are therefore flawed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly synthesizes the direction of change for LOW, leading to an incorrect conclusion that SBUX had a larger decline, when in fact LOW had a slightly larger decline ($4M vs $3.1M).

      "original_answer": "JPMorgan Chase discloses that Principal Transactions Revenue consists primarily of centrally managed credit valuation adjustments (CVA), funding valuation adjustments (FVA) on derivatives, other valuation adjustments, and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, and is presented net of associated hedging activities and net of CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. In contrast, Charles Schwab states that Principal Transactions Revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients' fixed income trading activity and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions. This indicates that JPMorgan's presentation is more focused on valuation adjustments and hedging, while Schwab's is tied directly to client trading activity.",
      "llm_answer": "- **JPMorgan Chase** lists **Principal‑transactions revenue as a separate line item** in the Corporate & Investment Bank section of its income statement (e.g., $23.7 bn in 2023).  The footnote explains that it is made up mainly of centrally‑managed valuation adjustments – credit‑valuation adjustments (CVA), funding‑valuation adjustments (FVA), other valuation adjustments and portions of fair‑value‑option liabilities.  \n\n- **Charles Schwab** shows **Principal‑transactions revenue only within its trading‑revenue table** (it is one component of “total trading revenue” together with commissions and order‑flow revenue).  Schwab says it reflects the result of clients’ fixed‑income trading and includes unrealized gains and losses on cash and investment positions and other fair‑value adjustments.  \n\nThus, JPMorgan treats principal‑transactions revenue as a distinct, valuation‑adjustment‑driven line in its overall revenue presentation, whereas Schwab incorporates it as a component of trading revenue, driven by fixed‑income activity and unrealized investment gains/losses.",

(1) It correctly identifies that JPMorgan Chase presents Principal Transactions Revenue as a distinct line item in its Corporate & Investment Bank segment, driven by valuation adjustments (CVA, FVA, etc.), while Charles Schwab includes it within a broader trading revenue category tied to client fixed income activity. The core distinction in composition and presentation is accurately captured. (2) The $23.7 billion figure for JPMorgan in 2023 is factually correct and properly contextualized as an example, though the original answer does not include this specific number—this is an acceptable addition from the model based on real data and does not contradict the ground truth. No calculations are required, so quantitative accuracy is high. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in both composition (valuation adjustments vs. client trading/fair value changes) and presentation (standalone line item vs. embedded in trading revenue). (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—while the LLM adds slight elaboration (e.g., 'unrealized gains and losses'), this is consistent with 'adjustments to the fair value of securities positions' in the original. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that JPMorgan’s revenue is presented net of hedging activities and net of CVA/FVA allocated to markets, which is a small omission in completeness.

      "original_answer": "KO's increased marketing spending in Asia Pacific contributed to a decline in operating income by $263 million (from $2,303 million in 2022 to $2,040 million in 2023), despite favorable pricing initiatives and the impact of acquired brands. This suggests that the marketing investment did not yield a positive return in terms of profitability in that region. In contrast, PG's marketing spending in Europe and North America supported innovation and market growth, contributing to a high single-digit sales increase in Europe and a low single-digit increase in North America. PG's marketing strategy led to global market share growth in Home Care (+0.8 points) and a 230 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin, despite increased SG&A expenses. Therefore, PG's marketing investment strategy appears more effective in driving both top-line growth and margin expansion compared to KO's Asia Pacific approach.",

It correctly notes KO's operating income decline from $2.3B to $2.0B (aligned with ground truth: $2,303M to $2,040M), but misrepresents the magnitude of PG's net earnings margin improvement as 'about 20 basis points' instead of the correct 230 basis points—a significant error. The LLM also introduces unit-case volume growth (+3%, +11% in India) and 'price-product-geographic-mix' lift (5%) not present in the original answer, which may be factual but are not supported by the ground truth provided. 2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised: while KO's operating income figures are approximately correct (rounding $2,303M to $2.3B and $2,040M to $2.0B is acceptable), the PG margin improvement is off by an order of magnitude (20 vs 230 bps), which is a major discrepancy. The original answer emphasizes a 230 bps margin expansion as a key indicator of PG's strategy success, which the LLM severely underreports. 3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that KO's marketing spend led to volume gains but hurt profitability, while PG's spending drove margin expansion and market share growth. It synthesizes the multi-hop comparison between two companies, regions, and financial outcomes logically. However, it omits PG's sales growth details (high single-digit in Europe, low in North America) and mischaracterizes the margin outcome. 4) Contextual relevance is high—the response directly addresses marketing effectiveness, operating income trends, market share, and margin performance for both companies in the specified regions. Despite strong structure and relevant framing, the severe error in PG's margin improvement undermines full factual alignment.

      "original_answer": "The potential exclusion of TEZSPIRE from Medicare Part B coverage would likely reduce access to the drug for Medicare beneficiaries with severe asthma, as described in AMGN's 10-K filing. Since CVS provides Medicare Advantage coverage to beneficiaries under contracts with CMS, and Medicare contracts alone accounted for 73% of CVS's federal government revenues in 2023, this exclusion could directly affect CVS's ability to offer comprehensive respiratory care coverage.

In contrast, SBUX experienced a 4% decline in average ticket, contributing to a $210 million reduction in comparable store sales. This significant drop in average ticket at SBUX directly impacted international total net revenues, which decreased by $149 million overall, with foreign currency translation and lower product and equipment sales further compounding the decline.

For SBUX, it correctly identifies the 4% decline in average ticket and links it to a $149 million drop in international total net revenues, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states that the 4% drop in average ticket led to a 4% decline in comparable store sales — the original answer specifies a $210 million reduction in comparable store sales due to the ticket decline, not a 4% decline. The LLM conflates percentage and dollar impacts without clarifying the full $210M loss. For LOW, the LLM claims a 0.3% increase in average ticket, which directly contradicts the ground truth showing a slight decrease from $103.51 to $103.37 (a -0.13% change), making this a significant factual error. It also introduces a 3% fall in customer transactions and 3.1% sales decline not mentioned in the original, which may be plausible but are unsupported by the provided truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: the $149M international revenue drop matches, but the $210M comparable sales impact at SBUX is omitted, and LOW’s ticket change is misrepresented. The net sales figure of $83.7B for LOW is plausible but not verifiable from the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to link average ticket changes to sales performance for both companies, but the reasoning for LOW is based on incorrect data, and for SBUX, it oversimplifies the causal chain by omitting the $210M comparable sales impact and other contributing factors like foreign currency and product sales.

These numbers match the ground truth, with acceptable use of 'over' and 'about' given the context. (2) However, the key error lies in the comparison: the LLM states that Accenture’s average of 61 hours per employee is 'tiny compared with Oracle’s total of 2 million hours', which is factually and logically incorrect. The ground truth emphasizes that Accenture’s per-person average (61 hours) reflects a more intensive per capita investment, especially since Oracle’s total lacks a per-person metric. Comparing a per-person average (61) to a company-wide total (2 million) in a way that calls the former 'tiny' demonstrates flawed reasoning. (3) The multi-hop synthesis partially fails: while the model retrieves the correct data points from both companies, it misinterprets the nature of the comparison required—evaluating per capita investment intensity versus total volume. It should have noted that Accenture's per-employee figure indicates deeper individual training investment, rather than making an invalid quantitative comparison. (4) Quantitative accuracy is high (8) due to correct numbers and sum; contextual relevance is strong (9) as all parts of the question are addressed; qualitative accuracy is low (5) due to flawed logic in interpretation; overall correctness is reduced to 6 because of the significant misrepresentation in the comparison despite correct inputs.",

This results in full recognition of any valuation changes in the period they occur, directly impacting earnings volatility. In contrast, Lockheed Martin amortizes actuarial gains or losses over time, as shown by the changes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which includes both the actual return versus expected return on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. This amortization approach spreads the financial statement impact across multiple periods rather than recognizing it all at once, leading to smoother earnings.",

      "original_answer": "Costco highlights net sales growth as a key forward-looking metric in its disclosures, signaling strategic importance and framing it within qualitative expectations subject to risks and uncertainties. In contrast, Procter & Gamble's FY2024 results show concrete organic sales growth figures across its business segments, such as 3% in Beauty, 9% in Grooming, and 5% in Health Care, with a total company organic growth of 4%. This contrast reveals how P&G's actual performance provides tangible benchmarks against which Costco's forward-looking statements could be evaluated, despite differences in sector focus and business model.",

      "original_answer": "CAT's 2021 profit increased by $3.491 billion (from $2.998 billion in 2020 to $6.489 billion in 2021), driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, indicating a strategy of passing cost increases to customers through pricing actions. In contrast, LMT's fixed-price contracts require them to absorb cost fluctuations, as profits depend on meeting cost estimates—variations lead to higher or lower profits or even losses. This shows CAT used pricing power to mitigate cost pressures, while LMT managed risks through internal cost control under fixed-price terms.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar’s 2021 profit surge was driven largely by “higher sales volume … and favorable price realization,” which the company used to offset rising transportation, raw‑material and labor costs caused by supply‑chain shortages【page_32†L13-L20】. Lockheed Martin, by contrast, relies on a portfolio of fixed‑price contracts that lock in a predetermined price and leave any cost overruns (or savings) to the contractor; to protect those contracts from supply‑chain strain it has accelerated progress payments to its suppliers and uses performance‑based incentives/penalties built into the fixed‑price terms【page_56†L1-L8】【page_53†L1-L5】. Thus, Caterpillar manages cost pressure by passing higher prices to customers, while Lockheed Martin absorbs cost risk through fixed‑price pricing and supports its supply chain with early supplier payments.",

      "original_answer": "The combined percentage point impact from foreign operations for ACN and ORCL in fiscal 2022 is 2.9 percentage points. ACN reports a 0.8 percentage point increase from non-U.S. operations taxed at other rates. ORCL reports $536 million in tax impact from foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates, which, when normalized to its $1,606 million U.S. federal statutory tax provision, results in a 33.4% effective foreign tax differential (i.e., $536M / $1,606M), or approximately 2.1 percentage points below the U.S. federal statutory rate. These foreign operation effects must be interpreted in the context of other adjustments: ACN reports a 3.0 percentage point increase from other net activity in unrecognized tax benefits and a 3.0 percentage point reduction from excess tax benefits from share-based payments. ORCL reports a $263 million net benefit from settlements and releases and a $441 million expense from domestic tax contingencies, indicating contrasting directional adjustments of $704 million total in offsetting impacts.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. It incorrectly states that ACN's foreign operations reduce its tax rate by 0.8 percentage points, while the ground truth indicates a 0.8 percentage point *increase* (i.e., rate-raising effect), reversing the direction. For ORCL, the LLM calculates an 8.8 percentage point reduction based on the difference between the U.S. statutory rate (21%) and ORCL's effective tax rate (12.2%), which is not the foreign operations impact. The correct foreign impact is derived from normalizing $536M foreign tax impact against $1,606M U.S. statutory provision, yielding 33.4% of the U.S. rate differential, or ~2.1 percentage points *below* the U.S. rate—thus a 2.1 percentage point reduction, not 8.8. The combined impact is therefore 0.8 (ACN increase) minus 2.1 (ORCL decrease) = net reduction of 1.3 points, but the question asks for combined *magnitude* impact (i.e., absolute sum: 0.8 + 2.1 = 2.9), which the LLM completely misses. Instead, it reports 9.6 percentage points, which is factually wrong. (2) The 'other tax-related' adjustments are also misrepresented: ACN’s adjustments include a 3.0 percentage point increase from unrecognized tax benefits and a 3.0 percentage point reduction from share-based payments—net zero in rate impact, not a $1.1B benefit as claimed. The LLM fabricates a $1.1B figure with no basis in the original. ORCL’s net benefit of $263M from settlements and $441M expense from contingencies implies a net *cost* of $178M, not a $270M benefit. The LLM incorrectly frames both as favorable and omits the offsetting nature. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not synthesize foreign impact correctly across companies, misinterprets rate differentials, and invents dollar figures not present in the source. It also fails to distinguish between percentage point impacts and effective rate differences. (4) Despite these severe errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, fiscal year, and general topic of tax rate adjustments—hence a moderate relevance score.

      "question": "What is the total amount of capitalized R&D reported by both MDT and MRK in 2023, and how does this combined figure compare to their respective deferred tax assets after valuation allowance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDT reported $1,255 million in capitalized R&D, while MRK reported $2,099 million, resulting in a combined total of $3,354 million. MDT’s total deferred tax assets after valuation allowance were $5,006 million, while MRK’s were $3,937 million. Therefore, the capitalized R&D of both companies represents a significant portion of their deferred tax assets, with MDT’s R&D capitalization accounting for approximately 25% of its deferred tax assets and MRK’s R&D capitalization accounting for approximately 53% of its deferred tax assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Medtronic reported **$971 million** of research‑and‑development capitalized in fiscal 2023 (see the “Capitalization of research and development” line for April 28, 2023 in the tax‑assets table).  Merck’s 10‑K excerpts do not disclose any capitalized R&D amount for 2023, so the combined total that can be identified from the provided pages is **$971 million**.\n\nFor the same year, Medtronic’s deferred‑tax assets after the valuation allowance were **$5,006 million** (gross deferred tax assets $16,067 million less a $11,311 million valuation allowance, shown in the tax‑assets reconciliation).  Merck’s deferred‑tax‑asset balance after its valuation allowance is not disclosed in the excerpts supplied, so a direct comparison can only be made for Medtronic: the $971 million of capitalized R&D represents roughly **19 %** of Medtronic’s net deferred‑tax assets.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, MDT reported $1,255 million in capitalized R&D in 2023, but the LLM reports $971 million, which is incorrect. Additionally, the LLM claims that Merck (MRK) does not disclose capitalized R&D for 2023, but the ground truth confirms MRK reported $2,099 million—this is a major omission. The combined total should be $3,354 million, but the LLM only reports $971 million, missing MRK entirely. (2) For deferred tax assets, the LLM correctly identifies MDT’s figure as $5,006 million, matching the ground truth. However, it states that MRK’s deferred tax assets after valuation allowance are not disclosed, while the ground truth shows $3,937 million—another critical omission. The LLM’s calculation of 19% for MDT’s R&D as a percentage of deferred tax assets is based on its incorrect $971 million figure ($971/$5,006 ≈ 19.4%), whereas the correct figure using $1,255 million is approximately 25%, as stated in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to retrieve or acknowledge key data points for MRK, breaking the synthesis required across both companies. It incorrectly assumes absence of disclosure rather than reporting available data, undermining the comparative analysis. (4) Despite these issues, the LLM demonstrates correct understanding of how to compute the percentage and identifies the correct fiscal year and entity (MDT and MRK), with proper contextual framing of capitalized R&D and deferred tax assets. This justifies moderate scores for qualitative accuracy and contextual relevance, but the severe quantitative and completeness errors result in a low overall correctness score.",

      "question": "What was the combined impact on pre-tax charges in 2021 for both PepsiCo (PEP) related to its cash tender offers and Philip Morris (PM) related to the OtiTopic, Inc. transaction, and how were these charges classified in their respective financial statements?",
      "original_answer": "PepsiCo recorded a pre-tax charge of $842 million in 2021 related to its cash tender offers, classified under net interest expense and other. Philip Morris recorded a pre-tax charge of $51 million related to the OtiTopic, Inc. transaction, classified under research and development costs within marketing, administration and research costs. The combined pre-tax charge was $893 million.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2021 cash‑tender‑offer program at PepsiCo generated a pre‑tax charge of **$842 million**, which was recorded in the “net interest expense and other” line item. Philip Morris recorded a **$51 million** pre‑tax charge related to the OtiTopic, Inc. acquisition, which was booked as a research‑and‑development expense (within its marketing, administration and research costs). Together, the two transactions produced a combined pre‑tax charge of **about $893 million** in 2021.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth in all aspects. (1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: PepsiCo's $842 million and Philip Morris's $51 million pre-tax charges are correctly stated, and their sum ($842M + $51M = $893M) is accurately reported as 'about $893 million', which is semantically acceptable. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both companies' pre-tax charges, the specific transactions (cash tender offers for PepsiCo, OtiTopic, Inc. transaction for PM), the amounts, classifications, and the combined total. (3) Entity accuracy is perfect: company names (PepsiCo and Philip Morris), ticker symbols implied correctly, year 2021, and financial line items ('net interest expense and other' for PEP; 'research and development costs within marketing, administration and research costs' for PM) are all correctly identified. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly synthesizes data from two separate companies and transactions, computes the aggregate charge, and maintains proper context. (5) Semantic equivalence is achieved: minor wording differences (e.g., 'booked as' vs 'classified under') do not affect factual meaning. All criteria are met with high precision.",
