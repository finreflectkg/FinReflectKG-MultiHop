      "llm_answer": "The 2022 cost of services was $41,892.8 million for Accenture (see the “Cost of services” line in its consolidated income statement) and $15,500 million for Broadcom. Together, the two companies incurred about **$57,393 million** in cost of services in 2022.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. It reports Accenture's 2022 cost of services as $41,892.8 million and Broadcom's as $15,500 million, summing to $57,393 million. However, the ground truth is a combined total of $41,974.766 million, meaning both individual values and the sum are incorrect. Neither company's reported cost aligns with the knowledge graph: Accenture’s actual cost of services was approximately $39,474.766 million and Broadcom’s $2,500 million (implied from correct total). (2) The calculation is mathematically correct ($41,892.8 + $15,500 ≈ $57,393 million), but the inputs are factually wrong, leading to an incorrect final total. The required sum should be ~$41,974.766 million, not $57,393 million — a significant overstatement of ~$15.4 billion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to retrieve data for both companies and sum them — but fails at accurate data retrieval, indicating a failure in entity-metric alignment (likely misreading filings or confusing metrics like revenue with cost of services). (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative inaccuracy (2/10), weak qualitative reasoning due to incorrect data sourcing (3/10), high contextual relevance as it addresses the right companies, metric, and year (8/10), and very low overall correctness (2/10) due to fundamental factual errors.",

However, the 2022 DD&A figure for Chevron is incorrect: the LLM reports $16,319 million, while the ground truth is $23,931 million. This leads to an incorrect 2022 combined total: LLM calculates $23,823 million, but the correct value is $31,435 million. As a result, the comparison is completely wrong—the LLM claims a $1.8 billion increase from 2022 to 2023, but the actual change is a $5,839 million decrease. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely impacted by the erroneous Chevron 2022 number and the resulting miscalculated difference. All other numbers (COP 2022 and 2023, CVX 2023) are correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM correctly identifies the need to sum across companies and years and compare—but fails due to incorrect input data for Chevron 2022. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question and uses proper financial terminology. However, the critical error in a core data point undermines the conclusion.

      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains mostly correct entities and structure but has significant quantitative inaccuracies. The 2023 combined bitumen production is reported as approximately 436 thousand bbl/day, while the ground truth is 426 thousand bbl/day. This discrepancy arises from incorrect individual company figures: LLM states COP produced ~355 thousand bbl/day in 2023, but the correct value should be ~345 thousand bbl/day (since 426 total - 81 XOM = 345, not 355). The 2022 figures are correctly stated as 327 (COP) and 66 (XOM), summing to 393, which matches the ground truth. (2) Calculations: The LLM correctly calculates the 2022 total (327 + 66 = 393), but incorrectly calculates the 2023 total (355 + 81 = 436 vs. correct 426). The year-over-year difference is stated as ~43 thousand bbl/day, but the correct increase is 33 thousand bbl/day (426 - 393). This 10,000 bbl/day error in both total and delta is material. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that it must extract bitumen production for two companies (COP and XOM) across two years (2022 and 2023), sum them, and compare year-over-year — demonstrating sound qualitative reasoning and entity alignment. (4) Justification: Despite correct structure and entity identification, the numerical inaccuracies in the 2023 COP production figure and the resulting totals and delta reduce confidence in factual correctness. The answer is partially correct but contains material calculation and data extraction errors, warranting a score of 6 for overall correctness. Quantitative accuracy is penalized more heavily (5/10) due to incorrect sums and differences. Qualitative accuracy is higher (7/10) due to correct reasoning framework.

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: Apple's gross margins of 43.3% (2022), 44.1% (2023), and 46.2% (2024) match the disclosed figures, and Qualcomm's 56% gross margin in fiscal 2024, unchanged from 2023, is accurately reported. These values support the trend analysis. (2) The answer fully addresses the question by comparing Apple’s three-year upward trend with Qualcomm’s flat performance in 2024, which is consistent with the original answer’s emphasis on Apple showing fluctuation (here, growth) and Qualcomm indicating stability. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from both Apple’s and Qualcomm’s 10-Ks is correctly synthesized across years and companies. (4) The only minor limitation is that the original answer notes Apple’s trend 'potential fluctuation' without specifying direction, while the LLM correctly identifies it as an upward trend based on data; this is a strength in accuracy but slightly exceeds the ground truth’s cautious phrasing. However, since the numbers support 'climbing,' this is justified. All entities (Apple, Qualcomm, gross margin, fiscal years) are correct. The inclusion of page references adds verifiability.

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's and Lockheed Martin's approaches to recognizing actuarial gains or losses differ, particularly in terms of their impact on earnings and the timing of recognition?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if triggering events occur. This approach directly impacts Caterpillar's earnings volatility. In contrast, Lockheed Martin recognizes actuarial gains or losses as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, and these changes are recognized in connection with the annual remeasurement and amortized over time, suggesting a more gradual impact on earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar says that any actuarial gains or losses “are recognized immediately through earnings” when the plans are re‑measured each fourth‑quarter (or earlier if a triggering event occurs)【page_45】. Lockheed Martin, by contrast, initially records actuarial gains and losses in accumulated other‑comprehensive loss and then amortizes them to earnings on a straight‑line basis over the participants’ remaining service or life expectancy【page_85】, so the impact on earnings is spread out over future periods rather than taken all at once.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key numeric values. According to the ground truth, the 2023 interest cost discount rate for T (AT&T) is 3.90%, not 5.30% as stated in the LLM answer. Similarly, T's discount rate for benefit obligation is 5.20%, not 5.00%. The correct difference in interest cost rates is 5.37% (DIS) - 3.90% (T) = 1.47 percentage points, not 0.07 pp. The correct difference in benefit obligation rates is 5.94% - 5.20% = 0.74 pp, not 0.94 pp. The LLM incorrectly states that the interest cost gap is smaller than the benefit obligation gap, when in fact the opposite is true per the original answer (1.07% vs 0.80%). (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: the LLM computes a 0.07 pp difference in interest cost rates (wrong), while the correct difference is 1.07 pp. The benefit obligation difference is reported as 0.94 pp (wrong), while it should be 0.80 pp. These errors invalidate the conclusion. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—comparing two companies across two pension assumptions—but the synthesis is based on incorrect data. The model fails to retrieve accurate figures for T, leading to flawed comparison. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative inaccuracies (2/10), poor qualitative reasoning due to incorrect data synthesis (3/10), but high contextual relevance as the structure and intent align with the question (8/10). Correctness is low (2/10) because both core numbers and the final conclusion are wrong.",

The combined 2021 global Immunology revenue for JNJ and LLY is stated as $20.1 billion, but the ground truth is $18,631.8 million ($18.6318 billion). The LLM incorrectly reports JNJ's Immunology revenue as $16.75 billion and LLY's as $3.36 billion. These figures do not align with the knowledge graph: JNJ's actual Immunology revenue was approximately $16.75 billion (which matches), but LLY's was $1.8818 billion, not $3.36 billion. Thus, the sum is wrong due to incorrect LLY data. (2) The STELARA® sales figure of $9.13 billion and the 54.5% share of JNJ’s Immunology revenue are correct and match the ground truth. This part of the calculation is accurate: $9.13B / ~$16.75B ≈ 54.5%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM correctly identifies the need to sum JNJ and LLY revenues and compute STELARA’s percentage share—but fails in entity-specific data retrieval for LLY. It appears to have used incorrect data for Eli Lilly’s Immunology revenue. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate terminology. However, the major error in LLY’s revenue severely impacts overall correctness. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the incorrect sum and input values, though one component (STELARA%) is correct.

According to the ground truth, the combined total for MMM and UPS is $83 million. However, the LLM states that MMM reclassified a $38 million loss and UPS an $83 million gain, leading to a net of $45 million gain. This contradicts the ground truth, which implies the sum of both companies' reclassifications is $83 million—not UPS alone. (2) The calculation itself ($83M gain - $38M loss = $45M net gain) is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect input values. The ground truth does not support that UPS alone had an $83 million gain. Instead, the total across both firms is $83 million, meaning the individual amounts must sum to $83M, not exceed it. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly identifies both companies (MMM and UPS), the correct year (2021), and the relevant financial concept (reclassification from AOCI due to foreign currency contracts). However, it fails in synthesizing the correct values from each entity, likely misattributing the combined total to UPS alone. (4) Scores reflect that while the structure, entities, and context are appropriate (hence high contextual relevance), the core numerical facts and derived result are incorrect, severely impacting correctness and quantitative accuracy.

According to the ground truth, the correct combined amount is $841 million. However, the LLM states that AMD reported $258 million and NVIDIA reported $674 million, which sum to $932 million—this total and the individual components are incorrect. The correct individual values (from the knowledge graph) must sum to $841 million, so at least one of the two company figures provided by the LLM is wrong. (2) The calculation itself (adding $258M + $674M = $932M) is mathematically correct, but since the inputs are inaccurate, the result is factually incorrect. The expected total is $841 million, meaning the LLM's answer overstates the combined costs by $91 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—retrieving 'Acquisition-related and other costs' from both AMD and NVDA 10-Ks for the most recent fiscal year in their 2023 filings—is conceptually sound, and the model correctly identifies the relevant metric and companies. However, the failure to retrieve the correct values from the source documents undermines the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and time frame, and attempts the correct aggregation.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures, particularly for NVIDIA's 2022 Data Center revenue and thus its growth calculation. According to the ground truth, NVDA's Data Center revenue grew from $15,005M in 2022 to $47,525M in 2023, an increase of $32,520M. However, the LLM incorrectly states that NVDA's 2022 revenue was $10,613M and 2023 was $15,005M, resulting in a growth of only $4,392M — which is off by over $28 billion. This error fundamentally undermines the entire comparison. AMD's figures ($6,043M to $6,496M, +$453M) are correct. (2) Calculations: The LLM correctly computes AMD’s increase ($6,496M - $6,043M = $453M), but NVDA’s increase is wrong due to incorrect input values. The claimed $4,392M increase is incorrect; the true increase is $32,520M. The combined increase is stated as $4.85B (~$4,845M), but the correct total is $32,973M (~$33B). The comparison that NVIDIA’s growth was '$3.94B larger' is also incorrect — it should be about $32B larger. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: While the LLM attempts to synthesize data across two companies and compute comparisons, it fails due to reliance on incorrect source data for NVDA. The structure of the reasoning is sound (compute individual growth, compare, sum), but the factual foundation is flawed. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major numerical and calculation errors; Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2/10) because most dollar amounts and derived values are incorrect; Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the approach and metric usage are correct, even if data is not; Contextual relevance is high (8/10) because the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate framing and structure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually correct in all key aspects. It reports Johnson & Johnson's 2021 oncology revenue as $14.5 billion (ground truth: $14,548 million ≈ $14.5 billion) and Eli Lilly's as $3.0 billion (ground truth: $3,028.8 million ≈ $3.0 billion), which are accurate within reasonable rounding. The combined revenue is stated as $17.6 billion, which matches the ground truth sum of $17,576.8 million when rounded. The growth rates are correctly reported: 17.6% for J&J (exact match) and 8.5% for Eli Lilly (matches calculated growth from $2,792.1M to $3,028.8M). (2) All calculations are accurate: the sum $14.5B + $3.0B = $17.5B, but the LLM says 'roughly $17.6B', which is acceptable given rounding of inputs. The percentage growth values are exact. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies oncology revenues for both companies in 2021, computes the combined total, retrieves or calculates year-over-year growth for both, and compares them appropriately. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor rounding differences in revenue figures. The conclusion that Eli Lilly’s growth was 'roughly half' is a valid interpretation of 8.5% vs 17.6%, and the original answer notes J&J grew at 'more than double', which is consistent. No factual errors; minor rounding is acceptable. Hence, a high score of 9 is justified, with full marks in contextual relevance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the positive impact of rising interest rates on General Motors' financial revenue, accurately citing the $1.7 billion increase in finance-charge income and $0.3 billion rise in investment income. However, it omits the critical negative effect on GM's EBT-adjusted results due to an $1.8 billion increase in interest expense, which is a key part of the original answer and necessary for a complete multi-hop synthesis. For Starbucks, the LLM introduces a specific quantitative claim — that a 100-basis-point rate increase reduces debt fair value by $943 million — which is not present in the ground truth. This number, while plausible, is unsupported by the original answer and represents an overprecision or fabrication. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised: while the GM figures are correct, the Starbucks $943 million figure is not in the ground truth and cannot be verified, making it a significant factual deviation. The original answer only states that sensitivity analysis showed interest rate changes affect fair value, without providing a specific dollar impact. (3) The reasoning is generally sound in linking interest rate increases to finance income for GM and debt valuation for Starbucks, demonstrating correct multi-hop logic across two companies and financial concepts. However, the addition of an unsupported number weakens the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both companies and the core financial impacts of interest rates. The omission of GM's interest expense impact and the addition of an unverified Starbucks figure prevent a higher score.

These small discrepancies affect quantitative precision. The calculated difference is 1.38 percentage points in the LLM answer (5.88% - 4.5%), whereas the correct difference is 1.41 points (5.91% - 4.5%). This indicates a minor calculation drift due to input number variance. (2) Despite these small numeric deviations, the directional trends are accurate: COF’s rate increased (worsening), PYPL’s decreased (improvement), with correct prior-year comparisons (4.57% → 5.88% for COF; 7.2% → 4.5% for PYPL). The entity identification (COF, PYPL), metric (Net Charge-Off Rate), and years (2023 vs. 2024) are all correct.

However, the numerical values are inaccurate. The ground truth states WMT's average invested capital as $277,522 million ($277.522 billion), but the LLM reports $267.2 billion, which is off by $10.3 billion. PEP's value is reported as $60.5 billion by the LLM, which closely matches the ground truth of $60,505 million ($60.505 billion), so this is acceptable within rounding. (2) The calculated difference in the LLM answer is $206.7 billion, but the correct difference is $217,017 million ($217.017 billion). This results in a $10.3 billion error, stemming from the incorrect WMT value. The calculation logic (subtracting PEP from WMT) is sound, but the input data is flawed.

The model understands the need to compare cross-company financial metrics from the same year, showing good qualitative reasoning.

AT&T's interest expense represented approximately 28.6% of its Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes ($19,848 million), while Netflix's interest expense represented about 1.1% of its net income ($5,407,990 thousand).",
      "llm_answer": "AT&T’s 2023 interest expense was **about $6 billion larger** than Netflix’s – $6,704 million versus $699.8 million (a difference of roughly $6.0 billion).

The difference in interest expense is stated as 'roughly $6.0 billion', which is approximately correct (actual: $6,004.174 million). However, the key error lies in the percentage calculations. The LLM claims AT&T's interest expense was 'about 122% of AT&T’s 2023 net income', but the ground truth uses Income from Continuing Operations Before Income Taxes ($19,848 million), not net income, and the correct ratio is ~28.6%. The LLM likely used an incorrect net income figure for AT&T, leading to a grossly inaccurate percentage. Similarly, for Netflix, the LLM states interest expense was 'about 13% of net income' (699.8 / 5,408 ≈ 12.9%), but the ground truth states it was about 1.1%, indicating a discrepancy in the net income value used. The ground truth specifies Netflix’s net income as $5,407,990 thousand ($5.408 billion), so the numerator and denominator appear swapped or miscalculated — 699.8 / 5,408 ≈ 12.9%, not 1.1%. Thus, both percentage representations are factually incorrect. (2) While raw interest expense numbers are accurate, the derived percentages and underlying reasoning are flawed. The difference calculation is approximately correct in magnitude. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly synthesize the required financial metrics — it uses net income for AT&T without verifying the correct base (the ground truth uses pre-tax income for AT&T and net income for Netflix, but the LLM applies net income inconsistently). The model also fails to match the correct net income figure for Netflix in the percentage calculation, suggesting a misunderstanding of the data. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both parts of the question and cites correct documents. However, due to major quantitative and qualitative errors in the core financial ratios, the correctness score is low.

This error directly impacts the calculated difference: the correct difference is $6.12 ($66.12 - $60), but the LLM reports $8.97, which is incorrect.

According to the ground truth, BKNG reported foreign currency transaction gains of $135 million in 2021, with no mention of offsetting $200 million debt-related losses or $30 million derivative losses. These additional losses are not present in the original data and are factually incorrect, leading to a fabricated net impact of -$95 million. Similarly, GM correctly reported $203 million in foreign currency transaction and remeasurement losses, but the LLM incorrectly states GM had $17 million in gains, which is unsupported by the ground truth. (2) Calculations are therefore invalid: the claimed net impacts of -$95M (BKNG) and -$186M (GM) are based on incorrect inputs. The actual net difference should be $135M (gain) vs. -$203M (loss), resulting in a $338 million difference, not the $91 million difference claimed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly synthesize the actual reported foreign currency impacts from the two companies. Instead, it introduced non-existent components (debt-related and derivative losses for BKNG, gains for GM) that distort the comparison. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to compare foreign currency impacts for BKNG and GM in 2021, but the severe factual and quantitative errors undermine the entire response. The core conclusion—that GM had a larger loss—is technically true in direction but based on wrong numbers and reasoning, and misses the actual magnitude of the difference.

      "original_answer": "The total interest expense for General Motors in 2021 was $3,496 million, while for Booking Holdings it was $56 million. The difference is $3,440 million. This significant difference is due to the nature of their respective businesses: Booking Holdings primarily incurs interest from debt discount amortization and issuance costs ($43 million in 2021), whereas General Motors incurs interest from both automotive operations ($950 million in 2021) and its financing arm, GM Financial ($2,546 million in 2021).",

The excess at GM comes from two parts: $950 million of automotive‑operations interest and a much larger **$2.5 billion of interest on GM Financial (its automotive‑financing business)**, whereas Booking’s expense is limited to interest on its corporate debt.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numbers. It states Booking Holdings' interest expense as 'about $1.0 billion', but the ground truth is $56 million—off by nearly 18 times. General Motors' expense is reported as $3.5 billion (close to the true $3,496 million), but the difference is then miscalculated as $2.5 billion instead of the correct $3,440 million. These quantitative errors severely undermine the answer's correctness. (2) Number verification: GM's automotive interest ($950 million) and GM Financial interest (~$2.5 billion) are approximately correct and align with the ground truth ($2,546 million). However, Booking Holdings' actual interest expense of $56 million is misrepresented as $1 billion. The components for Booking are oversimplified—ground truth specifies 'debt discount amortization and issuance costs' totaling $43 million, which the LLM omits or mischaracterizes as general 'corporate debt'. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that GM's higher expense stems from its financing arm and operational debt, and contrasts this with Booking's simpler debt structure. However, due to the incorrect base figures, the synthesis fails quantitatively. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (4/10) due to major numerical errors despite some structural understanding. Quantitative accuracy is poor (3/10) because of the large discrepancy in Booking's interest expense. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6/10) as the reasoning framework and entity identification are reasonable.

Similarly, Netflix's actual depreciation and amortization was $357.477 million, but the LLM reports it as about $1.6 billion, which is more than four times too high. These errors fundamentally misrepresent the financial data. (2) The calculation of the difference is also incorrect: the LLM claims AT&T’s expense was roughly $13 billion higher, but the correct difference is $3,469 million - $357.477 million = $3,111.523 million (~$3.11 billion), not $13 billion.

(2) For CVX, the LLM claims a shortfall of $1,610 million based on an ABO of $1,665 million and plan assets of $55 million. These figures are incorrect — such a severe asset-to-obligation ratio is implausible and does not match the actual filing data. For XOM, the LLM reports a shortfall of $1,245 million ($14,511M - $13,266M), but this calculation and the underlying numbers do not align with the ground truth either. The correct individual shortfalls (as inferred from the combined $10,824M) likely involve much larger gaps, especially for XOM.

However, there are significant quantitative inaccuracies. The original answer states MMM's overall adjusted operating margin increased from 20.8% (GAAP) to 22.6% (adjusted), while the LLM reports segment-level margins (22.0% for Safety-and-Industrial, 21.0% for Transportation-and-Electronics) and implies an overall increase without providing the correct consolidated figures. Additionally, the LLM does not mention the specific dollar amounts of the adjustments—$463 million in litigation costs and $1,258 million PFAS charge—which are central to the original answer and required for full accuracy. (2) For UPS, the LLM correctly states the 280 basis point decline to 9.0% (from 11.8%), which aligns with the ground truth. However, it omits UPS's cost reductions ($1.5B in air/ground, $641M in pickup/delivery, $216M in sorting), which are key to showing that cost-cutting was insufficient to offset headwinds—this weakens completeness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is generally sound: the model correctly contrasts MMM's use of non-GAAP adjustments to boost margins versus UPS's operational headwinds despite cost discipline. It identifies the right contractual (Teamsters), volume, and pricing factors. But the failure to quantify MMM's adjustments in dollars and to cite UPS's specific cost savings undermines the depth of synthesis. (4) The correctness score is 7 because the directional analysis and qualitative drivers are accurate, but the missing dollar figures and incorrect presentation of segment vs. company-wide margins reduce quantitative precision.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect. The ground truth total is $20,525, but the LLM reports $1 million (i.e., $1,000,000), which is off by over 48 times. Accenture (ACN) and Texas Instruments (TXN) both reported non-zero contributions according to the knowledge graph, but the LLM incorrectly states that Accenture reported $0 and only Texas Instruments contributed $1 million. (2) The quantitative accuracy is very low: the reported $1 million from TXN alone exceeds the actual combined total of $20,525, and no source in the LLM response supports the $20,525 figure. The calculation of $1 million + $0 = $1 million is arithmetically correct but based on wrong inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—attempting to retrieve data from both ACN and TXN and sum them—but fails in execution because it uses incorrect or misread data from the filings. The model likely misread or misextracted the actual contribution amounts, especially for ACN. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, year, and metric (participant contributions for non-U.S. pension plans), and cites a specific page in the TXN 10-K. However, the severe factual and numerical inaccuracies drastically reduce correctness and quantitative accuracy scores.",

      "original_answer": "ACN uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments, approximating the rate at which it could borrow on a secured basis for a similar term and amount. TXN, on the other hand, uses a settlement approach in the U.S., selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds to simulate cash flows matching its benefit payments, and for non-U.S. locations with sufficient bond markets, it constructs a yield curve to determine a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same present value.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Accenture (ACN)** – The only present‑value calculation disclosed is for its lease liabilities.  Because the implicit rate in the leases is not known, ACN discounts the lease‑payment stream at its **incremental borrowing rate** – the rate it could obtain on a secured basis for a loan with the same term and economic conditions as the lease.\n\n- **Texas Instruments (TXN)** – TXN discounts the projected cash‑flows of its defined‑benefit pension and post‑retirement plans to determine the benefit obligation.  It selects the **discount rate** by a **settlement‑approach**: a portfolio of high‑quality corporate bonds is constructed (or a yield curve is built from such bonds) to match the plan’s cash‑flows; the single‑rate that yields the same present value is used.  Where an active corporate‑bond market is absent, a government‑bond index is used instead.",

(1) Both companies' methods are correctly described: ACN uses its incremental borrowing rate for lease liabilities when the implicit rate is unknown, and TXN uses a settlement approach with high-quality corporate bonds to match cash flows for pension obligations. The LLM correctly notes that TXN constructs a yield curve where possible and uses government bonds in markets lacking corporate bond data. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information about two different companies, their distinct financial applications (leases vs. pension obligations), and differing methodologies is correctly synthesized. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer slightly expands context by mentioning 'defined-benefit pension and post-retirement plans' and 'active corporate-bond market' without explicit grounding in the original answer, though these are reasonable interpretations of 'non-U.S. locations with sufficient bond markets.' The original specifies TXN uses a yield curve for non-U.S. locations with sufficient bond markets, while the LLM generalizes to using government bonds where corporate markets are absent—this is logically consistent but adds a detail not explicitly confirmed.

      "question": "How do Costco and Altria each account for changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities, and what impact does this have on their respective income tax provisions?",
      "original_answer": "Costco accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates expected to apply in future years. A valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Altria also determines deferred tax assets and liabilities using differences between financial statement and tax bases, applying enacted tax rates. Altria evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets by considering positive and negative evidence, including the character of the assets and potential sources of taxable income within carryback and carryforward periods. Both companies adjust their deferred tax assets and liabilities when tax rates change, with the effect recognized in income in the period of enactment. This approach directly affects their income tax provisions, as changes in deferred tax asset and liability valuations alter the overall tax expense recorded.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco follows the asset‑and‑liability method: it records deferred tax assets and liabilities for all temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities, measures them at enacted rates, adjusts them when tax rates change, and sets a valuation allowance when a portion is not expected to be realized.  The net change in those deferred‑tax balances (including any valuation‑allowance adjustment) is reflected in the company’s provision for income taxes, raising or lowering the provision as the deferred‑tax position increases or decreases.  \n\nAltria also uses the asset‑and‑liability method, recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences and loss‑carryforwards and recording a valuation allowance whenever it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized.  Changes in the deferred‑tax balances and the related valuation‑allowance adjustments, together with accrued interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions, are incorporated into Altria’s provision for income taxes, affecting the amount of tax expense reported for the period.",

(1) Both Costco and Altria use the asset and liability method for accounting for deferred tax assets and liabilities, which is correctly described. The LLM accurately explains that both companies recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between financial statement and tax bases, measured at enacted tax rates, and adjust them when tax rates change—with the impact reflected in the income tax provision. The requirement to establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized is correctly attributed to both companies. (2) There are no numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations, but the LLM does not introduce any incorrect numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes the accounting methods of two different companies and correctly identifies the commonalities (use of asset-liability method, valuation allowances, rate change adjustments) and their impact on the income tax provision. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing how each company accounts for changes in deferred tax items and the resulting effect on tax provisions.

The “Foreign exchange transactions” line in AIG’s Net‑realized‑gains table (e.g., $256 million in 2024) is rolled into Net realized gains (losses), which is part of Net investment income and therefore flows directly to AIG’s net income.\n\nPayPal, by contrast, records the gains and losses that arise from translating its foreign‑currency assets and liabilities in **other income (expense), net**.  Those amounts are offset by the gains or losses on the foreign‑exchange contracts it uses to hedge the exposure, so the net effect appears in the “other income (expense), net” line rather than in a net‑realized‑gain category.",

(1) It correctly identifies that AIG includes foreign exchange gains and losses in Net realized gains (losses), which directly impacts net income through Net investment income. PayPal records these items in other income (expense), net, and uses foreign exchange contracts to offset exposure—this matches the original answer's core claims. (2) The LLM includes a specific dollar amount ($256 million in 2024) for AIG’s foreign exchange transactions. While this number is plausible and consistent with typical 10-K disclosures, the ground truth does not specify any numerical values, so this addition does not introduce inaccuracy but rather enhances detail without contradiction—thus still qualifying as quantitatively accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts AIG’s direct recognition in earnings with PayPal’s hedging and offsetting mechanism, showing understanding across both companies’ financial reporting treatments. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that PayPal’s strategy reduces but does not fully eliminate earnings volatility—a nuance present in the original answer. However, the implication is reasonably conveyed by mentioning the offsetting via hedges in the same income line. Wording differs slightly but maintains semantic equivalence.

The ground truth states GD's 2020 effective tax rate was 15.3%, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as 19.5%. This error directly impacts the calculated absolute difference. The correct difference is |15.3% - (-8.2%)| = 23.5 percentage points, but the LLM calculates 27.7 percentage points based on its incorrect input. While GE's rate of -8.2% is correctly reported, the miscalculation of GD's rate undermines quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation itself (19.5% - (-8.2%) = 27.7%) is mathematically correct, but it is based on an incorrect premise. The correct calculation should use 15.3% and -8.2%, yielding 23.5%. (3) The qualitative reasoning about contrasting tax positions—GD paying taxes due to profitability versus GE recording a tax benefit due to losses—is sound and aligns with the ground truth interpretation. The model correctly identifies the implications of a negative effective tax rate and contrasts the two companies' tax outcomes. This shows adequate multi-hop reasoning in interpreting the meaning behind the numbers, even though the numbers themselves are flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the structure and intent of the response match the question: it computes a difference and explains the tax implications. However, the correctness score is low due to the significant numerical inaccuracy in GD's tax rate, which cascades into the final result.

This negative OCI added to a more‑negative cumulative translation‑adjustment balance, showing that Abbott’s worldwide operations are generating sizable translation losses and indicating strong exposure to foreign‑exchange risk.\n\n- **Eli Lilly (LLY)** – For 2024 the same OCI line showed a **$580 million loss** before reclassifications, moving the cumulative balance from $‑1.82 billion to $‑2.39 billion. The translation loss, while material, is smaller in absolute terms than Abbott’s and therefore contributes less to a deepening cumulative deficit, suggesting that Lilly’s geographic risk from currency fluctuations is present but comparatively lower.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the quantitative details for ABT, particularly regarding the starting and ending cumulative balances and the reported OCI loss. The ground truth states ABT had a 2024 foreign currency translation loss of $1,117 million (not $1 billion) and a cumulative balance worsening to $7,505 million. However, the LLM claims the cumulative balance went from -$6.5 billion to -$7.5 billion, implying a $1 billion change, which is close but not precise. More critically, the ground truth reports ABT’s cumulative balance as positive $7,505 million (a liability or accumulated loss), but the LLM incorrectly treats it as negative values (-$6.5B to -$7.5B), misrepresenting the sign and potentially the accounting treatment. For LLY, the LLM correctly reports the 2024 loss as $580 million (close to $580.2 million) and the ending cumulative balance as $2.39 billion (aligned with $2,389.6 million), but incorrectly states the prior-year balance was $1.82 billion, when the improvement implies a prior balance worse than current (i.e., more negative), yet the ground truth says the cumulative balance improved despite a loss, meaning prior balance must have been lower (more negative) than $2,389.6 million. The LLM’s reasoning contradicts this by showing an increase in deficit from $1.82B to $2.39B, which is inconsistent with 'improvement'. (2) Calculations: The LLM assumes cumulative balances are negative and increasing in deficit, but the ground truth indicates LLY’s cumulative position improved even with a current-year loss, suggesting prior deficits were larger. The LLM fails to capture this nuance and misrepresents the direction of change for LLY. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that larger translation losses imply greater FX exposure and compares ABT and LLY accordingly, which shows sound qualitative logic. However, it fails to recognize the key point in the ground truth that LLY’s cumulative balance improved despite a 2024 loss—this is a critical multi-hop insight the model misses. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses geographic risk exposure, but due to incorrect numerical values and misinterpretation of cumulative balance trends—especially for LLY—the correctness score is limited to 5. The qualitative reasoning is partially sound, and the comparison of relative exposure is acceptable, but the factual foundation is flawed.",

While Target's share-based compensation expense is correct at $251 million, Procter & Gamble's is incorrectly stated as $562 million instead of the correct $545 million, leading to an incorrect total of $813 million instead of $796 million. More critically, the net earnings figures are wrong: PG's net earnings are correctly $14,738 million (approximated as $14.7 billion is acceptable), but Target's net earnings are stated as $4.1 billion instead of the correct $2,780 million ($2.78 billion), a major error. (2) Calculations are therefore also incorrect: the LLM computes PG's expense as 3.8% of earnings (close to the correct ~3.7%, given wrong inputs), but Target's should be ~17.9%, not 6%.

It correctly identifies that Costco defers membership fee revenue and reports a deferred amount of $2.5 billion (matching the ground truth $2,501 million), which supports quantitative accuracy for that part. However, it incorrectly states that Costco reports this under 'accrued liabilities'—the ground truth does not specify the exact line item but implies it is a separately presented liability, unlike Walmart. More critically, the LLM claims Walmart treats membership fees as earned upon receipt and therefore does not carry a deferred liability, which contradicts the ground truth stating Walmart *does* defer recognition over the 12-month period and reports it *within* accrued liabilities (not absent from the balance sheet). The LLM also claims Walmart discloses no deferred amount, but the ground truth indicates Walmart had $3.1 billion in membership fee revenue in fiscal 2024, implying a deferred component consistent with deferral over time. (2) The $2.5 billion figure for Costco is accurate (approximating $2,501 million), but the absence of any deferred amount for Walmart is factually wrong. The LLM fails to report Walmart’s $3.1 billion membership fee revenue, misrepresenting both the amount and accounting treatment.

The model incorrectly assigns Tesla's actual value to McDonald's and reports Tesla's as zero, leading to a completely incorrect combined total of $699 million instead of the correct $2,110 million. The difference is also wrong: the model states McDonald's was $699 million higher, but the correct difference is $711 million ($1,410M - $699M). (2) All key numbers are incorrect: McDonald's provision is off by $711 million, Tesla's by $699 million, the sum by $1,411 million, and the difference by $12 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. The ground truth states the combined growth is $21.593 billion, but the LLM calculates $29.6 billion, which is materially incorrect. The Microsoft cloud revenue increase is stated as $25.7 billion (from a 23% increase to $137.4 billion), but this misinterprets the data: if FY2024 revenue is $137.4B with 23% growth, then FY2023 revenue was approximately $111.7B, implying a $25.7B increase — this part aligns numerically. However, Oracle’s cloud-services revenue growth is reported as $3.9B (from $15.881B to $19.774B), which is accurate ($19.774B - $15.881B = $3.893B ≈ $3.9B). The sum of $25.7B (Microsoft) + $3.9B (Oracle) = $29.6B, which matches the LLM’s total, but contradicts the ground truth of $21.593B. This suggests either the ground truth uses different data or the LLM used incorrect Microsoft figures. However, per the knowledge graph, the correct combined increase is $21.593B, so the LLM’s answer overstates the total by ~$8B. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the final combined dollar increase is wrong by a large margin, despite Oracle’s numbers being correct. Microsoft’s growth figure appears based on a misunderstanding — the 23% growth may not apply to total cloud services alone but possibly includes other segments. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, correct metric (cloud services revenue), and computes year-over-year increases and their sum. However, it fails to use the correct underlying data that produced the ground truth, indicating either incorrect source interpretation or misattribution of revenue figures. (4) Contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses the exact question, cites relevant pages, and attempts proper synthesis.

      "original_answer": "Disney recorded content impairments in 2024 due to strategic changes in content curation, which directly reduced asset values on their balance sheet. In contrast, Netflix follows an amortization policy where content assets are systematically expensed over time, with over 90% of licensed or produced content expected to be amortized within four years. These differing treatments reflect contrasting financial strategies: Disney's impairments signal immediate write-downs based on content performance and strategic shifts, while Netflix spreads content costs over time through amortization, aligning with its subscription-based model where content is monetized as a group rather than at the individual title level.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney recorded a $187 million “content” impairment in 2024, writing down the carrying amount of certain titles because a strategic shift made those assets less useful and recognizing the loss as a one‑time expense. In contrast, Netflix’s policy is to capitalize all licensed and produced titles and then amortize them on an accelerated schedule over the shorter of the contractual window or an estimated use period, only writing them off if the fair‑value test shows the asset is unrecoverable. Thus Disney’s approach creates an immediate hit to earnings, while Netflix spreads the cost of its content investments over several years, producing a smoother expense profile.",

However, the $187 million figure for Disney’s impairment is not present in the original answer (ground truth), which does not specify a dollar amount—this introduces a potentially inaccurate quantitative claim. (2) The original answer mentions that over 90% of Netflix’s content is amortized within four years, a specific metric absent in the LLM response. While the LLM accurately describes Netflix’s accelerated amortization and fair-value write-off policy, it omits this key statistic, reducing quantitative completeness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes Disney’s impairment as a one-time expense due to strategic shifts and contrasts it with Netflix’s systematic amortization aligned with its subscription model. The logic behind differing financial strategies—immediate earnings impact vs. smoothed expense profile—is well articulated and semantically equivalent to the ground truth. (4) Despite the unsupported $187M figure and missing 'over 90% within four years' detail, the LLM conveys the essential qualitative contrast accurately and remains highly relevant to the question.

However, there is a critical error in the quantitative claim for Google: the LLM states that Google expects 'approximately $0 million' impact in the next 12 months, while the ground truth specifies that Google expects to reclassify $731 million in net gains into revenues. This is a major factual discrepancy. For AT&T, the $59 million reclassification to interest expense is correctly reported, though the LLM attributes it to 'historical interest-rate locks' without fully clarifying that this stems from foreign exchange contracts with excluded time value components, which slightly reduces precision.

Beginning-year obligations are accurately reported as $1,421 million (KO) and $119 million (MO), totaling $1,540 million. The LLM correctly notes that payments exceeded obligations, though it expresses the relationship as '3.7 times' rather than stating the $4,210 million excess. (2) Calculations: The sum $5,196 + $554 = $5,750 million is correct. The combined obligation sum $1,421 + $119 = $1,540 million is correct. The ratio 5,750 / 1,540 ≈ 3.73, so 'roughly 3.7 times' is accurate. However, the ground truth emphasizes the absolute excess ($4,210 million), which the LLM omits—this is a minor omission, not an error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (KO and MO), extracts confirmed invoice payments and beginning obligations, and compares them meaningfully.

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The LLM incorrectly assigns $1,702 million in General and Administrative (G&A) expenses to Meta (META), when in fact that figure belongs to Netflix (NFLX). Conversely, the LLM claims Netflix’s G&A is not disclosed, but according to the ground truth, NFLX’s 2024 G&A was $1,702 million and META’s was $1,144 million. The LLM swapped the values in its reasoning, attributing the correct NFLX number to META without verification. (2) COMPLETENESS: The question asks for the difference between the two companies’ G&A expenses in 2024. The LLM fails to provide this due to incorrect data attribution and claims insufficient information, which contradicts the ground truth where both figures are available. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: The companies are misidentified in terms of their financial metrics—Meta and Netflix are reversed. The year (2024) and metric (General and Administrative expenses) are correctly interpreted. (4) REASONING: The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The model should have retrieved G&A for both firms and computed the difference ($1,702M - $1,144M = $558M). Instead, it incorrectly sourced the number for Meta and falsely claimed Netflix’s data was missing, breaking the synthesis chain.

Conversely, WMT experienced an increase in accrued income taxes by $435 million in 2024 compared to a decrease of $468 million in the prior year, suggesting a shift toward higher tax accruals, which negatively impacted its cash flows by $435 million in 2024.

It incorrectly states that Coca-Cola's 'accrued income taxes' grew in 2024, when the ground truth shows it decreased from $24 million to $0 million — a full reversal, not an increase. This misrepresents KO's tax strategy as deferral (implying higher accrual) when in fact it settled its liability, which should have increased cash flow. For WMT, the LLM claims a negative adjustment of $(468) million in 2024, but the truth is WMT had an increase of $435 million in accrued income taxes in 2024 compared to a prior-year decrease of $468 million. The LLM incorrectly uses the prior year’s figure and mislabels it as 2024. (2) Calculations are entirely wrong: the LLM computes a net outflow of $468 million, but the correct combined impact is a net negative of $411 million ($24 million positive for KO, -$435 million for WMT). The LLM also fails to compute the correct delta for WMT. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize changes across both companies and years.

      "original_answer": "Amazon's 2024 consolidated operating income grew from $36.852 billion to $68.593 billion, an increase of $31.741 billion. This growth was driven by strong performance across all segments: North America increased from $14.877 billion to $24.967 billion (+$10.090 billion), International improved from a loss of $2.656 billion to a profit of $3.792 billion (+$6.448 billion), and AWS expanded from $24.631 billion to $39.834 billion (+$15.203 billion). In contrast, McDonald's reported a 1% increase in consolidated operating income to $11.7 billion, but faced geographic challenges with global comparable sales declining 0.1%, including negative results in France and China that required offsetting gains elsewhere. Unlike Amazon's consistent segment growth, McDonald's performance was mixed across regions, with restructuring charges and external factors like the war in the Middle East affecting results.",

The remaining $15.2 billion came from AWS, but the geographic turn‑around alone lifted operating income by $16.5 billion. By contrast, McDonald’s saw only a 1 % rise in consolidated operating income to $11.7 billion while its International Operated Markets and International Developmental Licensed Markets segments posted comparable‑sales declines (‑0.2 % and ‑0.3 %) due to weak performance in France, China and war‑affected Middle‑East markets, meaning the modest overall gain was driven mainly by U.S. results and was constrained by geographic headwinds.",

Amazon's operating income increase is correctly stated as $31.7 billion (vs. $31.741 billion in ground truth), with North America contributing +$10.1 billion (vs. +$10.090 billion), International improving by $6.4 billion (vs. +$6.448 billion), and AWS adding $15.2 billion (vs. +$15.203 billion). These minor rounding differences are acceptable under format variation. The claim that geographic segments accounted for 'roughly half' is reasonable since $16.5 billion of $31.7 billion is about 52%. (2) McDonald's consolidated operating income is correctly reported as $11.7 billion with a 1% increase. The LLM correctly identifies geographic challenges, citing declines in International Operated Markets (‑0.2%) and International Developmental Licensed Markets (‑0.3%), aligning with ground truth's mention of negative results in France, China, and Middle East markets. The inference that U.S. performance drove the modest gain is logically sound and contextually supported. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes Amazon's segment-level changes into consolidated growth, distinguishes geographic from AWS contributions, and contrasts Amazon’s broad-based growth with McDonald’s uneven regional performance and external headwinds. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question—Amazon’s geographic contribution to growth and the contrast with McDonald’s geographic challenges. The only reason for not scoring 10 is the slight imprecision in summing geographic contribution as '$16.5 billion' (actual sum of North America + International improvements is $10.090 + $6.448 = $16.538 billion), which is acceptably close.

The 2022 Caterpillar figure of $840M is correct, but the LLM states 'no settlement reduction was disclosed for 2022' for Emerson, while the ground truth reports $7M (not $0M). This leads to a combined 2022 total of $847M in the ground truth, whereas the LLM calculates $840M, missing $7M from Emerson. (2) Calculations: The 2023 sum ($27M + $5M = $32M) is correct. The comparison to the prior year is directionally accurate (dramatic decrease), but the implied prior-year total ($840M) is off by $7M due to the omission of Emerson’s 2022 reduction. (3) Reasoning: The multi-hop synthesis across both companies and years is mostly sound, correctly identifying the relevant metric and years. However, the failure to include Emerson’s $7M in 2022 slightly undermines the completeness of the prior-year synthesis. (4) Despite this, the core conclusion—a significant decrease from the prior year—is still valid and well-supported. The wording is clear, and semantic equivalence is maintained. The error is minor but prevents a perfect score. Thus, correctness is rated 9/10, with high marks for all other dimensions.",

      "original_answer": "The U.S. Government's preference for progress payments impacts both Lockheed Martin's cash flow timing and Raytheon Technologies' contract asset position. Lockheed Martin notes that the DoD increased progress payment rates from 80% to 90% in March 2020, which improves cash inflows as costs are incurred. In contrast, Raytheon explains that progress payments under U.S. government fixed-price contracts typically result in revenue recognized in excess of billings, creating contract assets on the balance sheet because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion. Therefore, while Lockheed benefits from higher and faster cash inflows due to the increased progress payment rate, Raytheon accumulates contract assets due to delayed billing and payment timing, reflecting a cause-and-effect relationship through the shared mechanism of progress payments.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin’s cash‑flow timing is accelerated because the DoD raised the progress‑payment ceiling to 90 % of costs incurred and the company has been passing those higher‑rate progress payments through to its supply chain – it reported roughly $1.5 billion of net accelerated progress payments in 2021 and used the cash to front‑load $2.2 billion of supplier payments. In contrast, Raytheon Technologies’ contracts still rely heavily on performance‑based payments and on the traditional 80‑90 % progress‑payment ceiling, so a larger portion of revenue is recognized before the customer bills, leaving a material “contract‑asset” balance on the balance sheet.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer captures the core contrast between Lockheed Martin's improved cash flow and Raytheon's contract asset buildup due to progress payment structures, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it introduces specific figures—$1.5 billion in net accelerated progress payments in 2021 and $2.2 billion in supplier payments—that are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified against the provided ground truth, raising concerns about quantitative accuracy. The original answer mentions the March 2020 increase in progress payment rates from 80% to 90%, which the LLM correctly references in spirit (citing 90% ceiling), but does not explicitly date the change, weakening temporal precision. (2) The dollar amounts ($1.5B, $2.2B) and the claim about front-loading supplier payments are absent from the ground truth and represent unverified additions. While progress payments being passed through the supply chain may be plausible, it is not supported in the original answer, making these details potentially misleading. The LLM also generalizes Raytheon’s use of 'traditional 80–90%' progress payments, while the original specifies that Raytheon’s fixed-price contracts lead to revenue recognized in excess of billings—this nuance is partially captured but conflated with performance-based payments, which are distinct mechanisms. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is generally sound: the model connects progress payments to cash flow for LMT and to contract assets for RTX, correctly identifying the cause-effect relationship through differing payment timing. However, it incorrectly implies Raytheon relies more on performance-based payments, whereas the original emphasizes that progress payments under fixed-price contracts create the contract asset issue. This misattribution weakens the reasoning chain. (4) Despite the unsupported numbers and slight conceptual conflation, the LLM answer remains contextually relevant and conveys a semantically similar conclusion about divergent financial impacts. The core insight—accelerated cash for LMT vs. balance sheet contract assets for RTX—is preserved, warranting a score of 7 for overall correctness.",

In contrast, Union Pacific (UNP) applies the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets using a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value over a 5-year period, which is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense.

The use of 'approximately $44 billion' is semantically equivalent and acceptable given common financial reporting conventions. For Charles Schwab, the answer accurately states that HELOCs are part of a collateral pool—including first-mortgage loans and investment securities—used to secure borrowing from the FHLB, aligning with the original answer.\n\n2) Quantitatively, the $44 billion figure is a correct rounding of $44,280 million. No calculation is required beyond this, and the date (implied as of the 2024 10-K) is accurate. The only minor imprecision is the lack of explicit mention of the exact figure ($44,280 million), but 'approximately $44 billion' is a reasonable and commonly accepted representation.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two distinct companies (BAC and SCHW), identifies the correct financial instruments (HELOCs), and links them to their respective disclosures—credit commitments for BAC and collateral usage for SCHW. It correctly identifies the role of the FHLB and the nature of secured borrowing arrangements.\n\n4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both sub-questions directly and accurately. Wording differs slightly but preserves semantic equivalence. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slight rounding without stating the precise number, which, while not misleading, represents a minor loss of precision.",

Gilead also capitalizes regulatory‑milestone payments as intangible assets, but it does not defer or amortize any up‑front payments it receives.  \n\nThus, BMS defers and amortizes up‑front payments it **receives**, while expensing those it **pays**, whereas Gilead expenses the up‑front payments it **pays** outright and does not apply a deferral/amortization approach to up‑front receipts.",

However, there are key quantitative inaccuracies: the LLM states Gilead paid a $35 million upfront fee to Arcus, but the ground truth specifies $313 million to Arcellx and $300 million to Dragonfly—this is a significant error in both amount and company name (Arcus vs. Arcellx). Additionally, the LLM omits BMS’s specific example of receiving an upfront payment from Pfizer, which is central to the original answer. While the qualitative reasoning about deferral vs. expensing is sound and the entities and general treatment are correctly identified, the incorrect dollar amounts and misattribution to Arcus undermine quantitative accuracy.

However, the second part of the answer is incorrect: the LLM states that Bristol-Myers Squibb’s total alliance revenue decreased from $742 million in 2022 to $608 million in 2023 (an 18% decrease), but the ground truth specifies that Bristol-Myers Squibb’s alliance revenue related to the Merck collaboration was $55 million in 2023, down from $100 million in 2022 — a 45% decrease. The LLM used total alliance revenue for BMS rather than the specific collaboration revenue with Merck, which is a critical error. (2) The $212 million figure is accurate. However, the $742M and $608M figures are incorrect in context — they represent BMS’s total alliance revenue, not the amount tied to Merck. The 18% decrease is therefore based on incorrect data and does not answer the question. The correct calculation is (100 - 55)/100 = 45%, which the LLM failed to report. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed because the model did not correctly identify that the question asks for alliance revenue *from the specific collaboration* between Merck and BMS, not BMS’s total alliance revenue. This reflects a failure in entity and metric disambiguation across sources. (4) The correctness score is low due to major factual and quantitative errors in the second part of the answer, despite one correct number.

The combined total cost of revenue is approximately correct at $68.2 billion (vs. ground truth $68,217 million), with minor rounding acceptable. However, the individual cost of revenue figures used are inaccurate: Adobe's cost of revenue is listed as $2.354 billion, but this appears to be a misinterpretation—Adobe's Digital Media cost of revenue is $665 million, not total cost of revenue. Similarly, Microsoft's total cost of revenue is misstated as $65.863 billion, while the correct total cost of revenue should be around $50.354 billion (sum of segments), with Product cost of revenue at $17.804 billion. (2) The calculation for Adobe’s percentage ($665M / $14.216B ≈ 4.7%) is correct and matches the ground truth. However, Microsoft’s percentage is calculated as ≈27.5%, while the ground truth states 23.5%. This discrepancy suggests either an error in the segment revenue figure used or incorrect data source—Microsoft’s Product cost of revenue as a percentage of Product revenue should be $17.804B / $75.7B ≈ 23.5%, not 27.5% (using $64.699B incorrectly as denominator). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is conceptually sound—comparing proportions across companies and computing totals—but relies on flawed input data for the totals and Microsoft’s denominator. (4) Despite these quantitative inaccuracies, the qualitative conclusion that Adobe has a much lower cost-of-revenue proportion than Microsoft is valid. The answer is well-structured and contextually relevant, addressing all parts of the question.

However, there are key quantitative inaccuracies. The LLM states Lowe's deferred balance is $612 million as of February 2, 2024, but this figure is not present in the ground truth, which does not provide any specific deferred revenue amount for Lowe’s—only a qualitative description of its policy. Thus, the $612M figure is unsupported and likely incorrect. For Starbucks, the LLM reports a liability of $1.7 billion (stored-value cards + loyalty) as of September 29, 2024, while the ground truth specifies $1.6 billion as of that date (with a prior balance of $1.5 billion as of October 1, 2023). The $1.7B figure is therefore inaccurate, and the LLM incorrectly combines stored-value cards and loyalty into a single figure not stated in the original. (2) The ground truth emphasizes that Starbucks' liability changes include foreign currency translation effects, which the LLM omits entirely—this is a significant qualitative shortcoming in explaining the accounting contrast. (3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes that Lowe's recognizes revenue only upon redemption while Starbucks maintains a deferred revenue liability, showing multi-hop understanding. However, the addition of loyalty points and the incorrect dollar figures undermine the accuracy. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the policy difference and attempts to illustrate it with numbers. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct policy descriptions but missing nuance (foreign currency impact). Quantitative accuracy is low due to fabricated or incorrect figures.

The calculated growth rate is (36,787 - 34,250) / 34,250 = 7.41%, and the LLM reports ≈7.4%, which is a minor and acceptable rounding. (2) All numeric values are correct or appropriately rounded. The combined revenue is correctly summed (36.787 + 25.1 = 61.887 → $61.9 billion), and the growth rate calculation for COF is accurate. The only minor deviation is the omission of the exact 5.59 percentage point difference in growth rates, but the conclusion that MA's growth is higher is correct and sufficient for the question. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two companies (COF and MA), across two years (2022 and 2023), computes growth rates, and compares them. Entities (COF = Capital One, MA = Mastercard), metric (Adjusted Net Revenue), and years are correctly identified. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly less precision in the percentage (7.4% vs 7.41%) and no explicit quantification of the difference in growth rates, but these do not detract significantly from correctness. Hence, a high score of 9 is justified.",

This reversal of facts leads to a completely erroneous conclusion that Amazon has a more aggressive capitalization policy than Nike, when the truth is the reverse.

While it correctly states CAT's adjusted operating profit as $13,746 million, it incorrectly assumes UPS's 2023 adjusted operating profit is $1,188 million, which is not supported by the question or ground truth. The question only states that UPS experienced a $672 million decrease in adjusted operating profit — it does not provide UPS's actual 2023 profit or prior-year baseline. The LLM fabricates UPS's 2023 profit value, leading to an incorrect difference of $12,558 million instead of the correct $13,074 million. (2) The calculation $13,746M − $1,188M = $12,558M is mathematically correct but based on a false premise. The ground truth difference is $13,074 million, which implies UPS’s adjusted operating profit would have to be $672 million (i.e., $13,746M − $13,074M = $672M), meaning the correct interpretation should have been that UPS’s adjusted operating profit was $672 million in 2023 — not a decrease of $672 million from a higher value. The LLM misinterprets the phrase 'experienced a decrease of $672 million' as implying a current profit of $1,188 million, which is unsupported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model invents data not present in the input. It should have inferred that if CAT’s profit is $13,746M and the difference is $13,074M, then UPS’s profit must be $672M — aligning with the 'decrease' possibly indicating the magnitude of profit (if context implied it), but the phrasing is ambiguous. However, the model’s assumption lacks justification. (4) Correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to incorrect numbers and unsupported calculations. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the model attempts proper reasoning structure and entity identification (CAT, UPS, adjusted operating profit, 2023).

The LLM instead assigns 5.6% to CAT and 7.5% to LMT, which contradicts the ground truth. This reversal affects the factual accuracy of the entity-to-metric mapping. The calculation itself is mathematically correct, and the answer is well-structured and relevant. The error lies in the misattribution of the percentages to the companies, which is a significant but not complete failure in multi-hop reasoning. Hence, the correctness score is reduced to 8 due to this key factual inversion, though the logic and format are otherwise sound.",

While it correctly identifies Amgen's fair value of replacement equity awards as $180 million, it incorrectly reports CVS's value as $14 million instead of the correct $118 million from the ground truth. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $194 million instead of $298 million. (2) The calculation of the sum ($180M + $14M = $194M) is mathematically correct, but based on an incorrect input value for CVS. The Amgen figure matches the ground truth exactly, but the CVS figure is off by $104 million, which is a major discrepancy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model correctly identifies both companies (Amgen and CVS), the relevant event (acquisition-related replacement equity awards), and attempts to sum the values—indicating proper synthesis across entities. However, the failure to retrieve the correct value for CVS undermines the conclusion. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, metric, and transaction types. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the reasoning framework is correct, but the factual error in a core number severely impacts the overall correctness. The correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low due to the material error in the CVS value and the resulting incorrect total.",

The calculated difference is $7,828.5 million in the original answer; the LLM reports $7,828 million, which is off by $0.5 million due to rounding—this is a minor discrepancy and likely due to presentation (e.g., rounding to nearest million). The conclusion that GM had the larger pension deficit is correct.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is nearly perfect: all key numbers (8,008 and 179.5) are accurate, and the difference is correctly approximated. The $0.5 million difference in the final subtraction is negligible and likely due to rounding, not a factual error.

The LLM correctly rounds 5.2% to 'about 5%' and 25.7% to 'roughly 26%', which is acceptable and semantically equivalent. (2) Calculations verified: 974 + 2,207 = 3,181 (correct); 974 / 18,806 ≈ 5.18% ≈ 5% (correct rounding); 2,207 / 8,558 ≈ 25.79% ≈ 26% (correct rounding). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data across two companies (ABBV and ABT), extracts the correct metric (cash outflows for Acquisitions of Property and Equipment), matches it to the correct year (2024), and compares it to respective operating cash flows. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the combined total and the comparison to operating cash flows. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer explicitly states that ABT allocated a 'significantly larger proportion' compared to ABBV, which the LLM implies but does not directly state. However, the conclusion about relative impact ('modest relative to AbbVie’s... more sizable share of Abbott’s') captures the same insight. Thus, the answer is factually and quantitatively accurate with excellent reasoning and relevance, warranting a 9/10 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, and a perfect 10 for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

According to the ground truth, Colgate-Palmolive's SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased from 36.6% to 36.8%, which is a 20 basis point increase. However, the LLM states it increased from 36.5% to 36.8%, implying a 30 basis point rise, which is incorrect. The Walmart decrease is approximately correct at 10 basis points (from 20.9% to 20.8%), so that part is acceptable. (2) The final comparison is wrong: the LLM claims Colgate's increase was 'about 40 basis points larger' than Walmart's decrease. The correct logic is that CL increased by 20 bps and WMT decreased by 10 bps, so the difference in their changes is 20 - (-10) = 30 basis points. The LLM incorrectly calculates this as 40 bps, likely due to using its erroneous 30 bps increase for CL. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing the magnitude of change between two companies' SG&A ratios—but fails due to incorrect input data and flawed arithmetic. (4) Scores reflect that core entities (CL, WMT, SG&A, net sales, 2020–2021 period) are correct and the intent of the comparison is understood (contextual relevance high), but factual and numerical accuracy is compromised, dragging down correctness and quantitative scores.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the 2024 provisions: $8,023 million for INTC and $1,274 million for ORCL, summing to the correct combined total of $9,297 million. However, it incorrectly calculates the 2023 combined total. The ground truth states the 2023 combined total was $1,536 million ($-913 million for INTC and $623 million for ORCL), but the LLM states the 2023 combined total was -$290 million, which is incorrect. The correct sum of -$913 million + $623 million is $-290 million, but the ground truth explicitly states the 2023 combined total was $1,536 million, indicating a discrepancy in the source data or interpretation. However, given the individual values provided (-$913M and $623M), the mathematically correct sum is indeed -$290M, suggesting a possible error in the ground truth or misalignment in data sources. Despite this, the LLM's calculation from the given inputs is correct. (2) The year-over-year difference is reported as 'about $9.6 billion higher', which approximates the difference between $9,297 million and -$290 million, i.e., $9,587 million (~$9.6 billion), which is accurate based on the LLM's numbers. However, using the ground truth's stated 2023 combined value of $1,536 million, the correct increase should be $9,297M - $1,536M = $7,761M, which the LLM misses. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure—aggregating across companies and years and comparing—but relies on an inconsistent 2023 total. If the individual 2023 values (-$913M and $623M) are correct, then the sum must be -$290M, contradicting the ground truth's $1,536M. This suggests a data inconsistency. The LLM follows correct logic given the inputs it appears to use. (4) Due to the conflict between individual components and the stated sum in the ground truth, the LLM's quantitative accuracy is penalized because it does not match the ground truth's combined 2023 figure or the resulting $7,761M increase. However, its internal consistency and reasoning are strong. Thus, correctness is scored 7 for mostly correct numbers and logic but a key mismatch in the 2023 total and delta; quantitative accuracy is 6 due to the significant error in the comparison value; qualitative accuracy is 8 for sound reasoning; contextual relevance is 10 as all parts are addressed appropriately.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the same information as the ground truth with minor rounding differences. (1) Quantitatively: The total debt principal for GD is reported as $8.8 billion (vs. $8,826 million in ground truth), and for UPS as $21.0 billion (vs. $21,030 million), both rounded appropriately. The difference is stated as roughly $12.2 billion, which matches the exact $12,204 million difference. These are acceptable rounding variations. (2) The post-2029 debt portions are not given as exact dollar amounts in the LLM answer but are correctly represented as 77% of $21 billion for UPS (~$16.17 billion, close to the true $16,125 million) and 46% for GD (~$4.05 billion vs. $4,062 million). Percentages are accurate proxies and support the correct conclusion. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts total debt and long-term maturity portions from their respective 2024 10-Ks, computes the difference, and compares the post-2029 debt portions. (4) The answer fully addresses both parts of the question: the dollar difference in total debt and which company has a significantly higher portion due after 2029.

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's and Lockheed Martin's treatments of actuarial gains or losses differ in terms of recognition and financial impact, given Caterpillar's mark-to-market approach and Lockheed Martin's presentation of changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon annual remeasurement or on an interim basis when triggering events occur. This results in direct and immediate impacts to earnings based on changes in pension and postretirement benefit valuations. In contrast, Lockheed Martin reports changes in actuarial gains or losses as components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which are not immediately recognized in earnings but instead amortized over time. This difference in recognition timing and location within financial statements leads to distinct patterns of financial impact: Caterpillar experiences more volatile earnings due to full-year actuarial changes hitting the income statement immediately, while Lockheed Martin's earnings are affected gradually through amortization expense. The two companies therefore reflect actuarial gains or losses through different financial statement line items and at different times, affecting their reported earnings stability.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar records actuarial gains or losses on its defined‑benefit plans using a **mark‑to‑market approach** – the differences between actual and expected returns are recognized **immediately in earnings** at the time of the annual (or interim) remeasurement.  \n\nLockheed Martin, by contrast, **defers those gains and losses in accumulated other‑comprehensive loss** (OCI); the net amount is shown in OCI and is then amortized into pension expense over the participants’ remaining service or life expectancy, so the impact on net income is spread out over future periods.",

(1) It correctly identifies Caterpillar's mark-to-market approach, with immediate recognition of actuarial gains/losses in earnings upon remeasurement, and contrasts it with Lockheed Martin's deferral of such gains/losses into accumulated other comprehensive loss (OCI), followed by amortization into earnings over time. This aligns fully with the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense; however, all qualitative financial reporting treatments are correctly stated, and no incorrect metrics are introduced. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing two companies' accounting treatments for actuarial gains/losses and their differing financial statement impacts—is sound and correctly synthesized. The LLM captures the key distinction: immediate vs. delayed recognition, earnings volatility vs. smoothing. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is minor brevity compared to the original answer—while all key points are present, the LLM omits explicit mention of 'tax effects' (net of tax) and slightly less elaboration on the comparative financial impact on earnings stability.

Raytheon reported a $0.8 billion decline in commercial aerospace OEM sales in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to widebody volume declines driven by the drop in 787 deliveries.

However, it incorrectly states that this decline 'shaved about $0.8 billion off Raytheon’s top-line net sales'—this is misleading because the ground truth clarifies that the $0.8 billion OEM decline contributed to an overall organic sales decrease of $0.6 billion, not a full $0.8 billion reduction in total net sales. The LLM conflates OEM-specific sales decline with total company-wide top-line impact. (2) Quantitatively, the $0.8 billion OEM decline is accurate, and the total net sales figures ($64.4B in 2021 vs $56.6B in 2020) are correctly cited, but the interpretation of their relationship is flawed—the $7.8B increase in total net sales includes other segments (e.g., defense, aftermarket), so attributing the entire $0.8B OEM drop directly to a reduction in total growth is incorrect. The ground truth specifies the organic sales decrease was $0.6B, not $0.8B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly links Boeing’s 787 pause to Raytheon’s OEM sales and cites the correct financial impact.

This indicates that interest capitalization plays a meaningful role in their asset valuation and depreciation planning. In contrast, TXN reports that capitalized interest was 'not material' in their 2022 financial statements, suggesting that interest capitalization has a negligible impact on their capital asset reporting and overall financial strategy. This contrast reveals that INTC likely engages in larger-scale or more interest-intensive capital projects compared to TXN, where such capitalization does not significantly affect financial reporting.",

      "llm_answer": "Intel reported total comprehensive income of about **$19.9 billion** for 2021, while Texas Instruments reported total comprehensive income of **$7.97 billion** for the same year. Thus, Intel’s total comprehensive income was roughly **$11.9 billion greater** than Texas Instruments’ 2021 total comprehensive income.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Intel's Total Comprehensive Income was $12,770 million greater than Texas Instruments' in 2021. The LLM calculates a difference of approximately $11.9 billion ($19.9 billion - $7.97 billion), which is $11,900 million—about $870 million less than the correct value. This discrepancy suggests either incorrect source data or a calculation error. (2) The individual figures cited—$19.9 billion for Intel and $7.97 billion for Texas Instruments—do not align with the ground truth implied by the correct difference of $12,770 million. For the difference to be accurate, either Intel’s income was higher than $19.9 billion or Texas Instruments’ was lower than $7.97 billion. Without access to the exact values from the 2022 10-K filings, the evaluation relies on the consistency of the calculation and alignment with the ground truth difference. The LLM’s calculation is internally consistent (difference is correctly computed from its inputs), but the inputs themselves appear incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is logically sound—comparing two companies’ comprehensive incomes from their respective 10-Ks and computing the difference—but the factual basis is flawed. The model correctly identifies the relevant metric (Total Comprehensive Income), the correct year (2021), and the correct companies. (4) Due to the significant numerical inaccuracy in the final difference—off by $870 million—the Correctness and Quantitative Accuracy scores are low. However, the Qualitative Accuracy is moderate because the reasoning structure is correct, and Contextual Relevance is high as the answer directly addresses the question’s requirements.",

      "original_answer": "Mastercard deposited $783 million into a qualified cash settlement fund related to the Damages Class litigation, while Visa deposited approximately $4.0 billion from the U.S. litigation escrow account plus approximately $500 million attributable to interchange reductions, totaling $4.5 billion. Together, they contributed $5.283 billion. Visa’s contribution represented approximately 85.2% of the total settlement amount.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect in terms of factual content. It states that Mastercard and Visa together deposited about $6.2 billion, while the ground truth is $5.283 billion. More critically, it claims Visa contributed only $467 million, whereas the correct amount is $4.5 billion—over nine times higher. The percentage attributed to Visa is stated as 7.5%, but the correct figure is approximately 85.2%. These errors completely misrepresent the distribution and scale of contributions. (2) Number verification: Ground truth: Mastercard = $783M, Visa = $4.5B ($4.0B from escrow + $500M from interchange reductions), Total = $5.283B, Visa share = $4.5B / $5.283B ≈ 85.2%. LLM: Total = $6.2B (wrong), Visa = $467M (grossly understated), percentage = 7.5% (derived from incorrect values). Calculations are not just inaccurate—they reflect a fundamental misunderstanding or data error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failed: The question requires aggregating settlement deposits from two companies across different accounts and calculating a percentage. The LLM did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the individual contributions, leading to flawed aggregation and analysis. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 1 due to massive factual and numerical errors. Quantitative accuracy is 1 because nearly all numbers are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 2 because while the model recognizes the need to report contributions and a percentage, the entities and logic are misapplied.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numbers. According to the ground truth, the combined 2021 oncology revenue is $17,576.8 million (~$17.58 billion), but the LLM calculates $20.3 billion, which is off by nearly $2.7 billion. This stems from incorrect revenue figures for both companies. The LLM reports JNJ’s 2021 oncology revenue as $14.548 billion, which matches the ground truth and is correct. However, it reports LLY’s 2021 oncology revenue as $5.741 billion (sum of $3.028B US + $2.713B non-US), but the ground truth implies LLY’s 2021 oncology revenue should be approximately $3,028M + $2,713M = $5,741M = $5.741 billion — this actually aligns numerically. However, the ground truth combined total is $17.5768 billion, which suggests JNJ’s share must be ~$11.836 billion (17.5768 - 5.741), not $14.548 billion. Therefore, either JNJ’s number is wrong or LLY’s is — and the sum proves inconsistency. Given the ground truth explicitly states the combined total, and the LLM’s sum exceeds it substantially, at least one input figure is incorrect despite appearing in documents. (2) The growth rate for JNJ (17.6%) is correct, but LLY’s growth is reported as ~7.9% by the LLM (from $5.319B to $5.741B), while the ground truth states 8.5%. This discrepancy suggests either incorrect base numbers or miscalculation. ($5.741 - $5.319) / $5.319 ≈ 7.9%, so the LLM’s calculation is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but the inputs may not reflect the ground truth data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to extract oncology revenues for both companies, compute growth rates, compare them, and sum totals — but the factual foundation is flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate structure and sourcing. However, due to major quantitative errors in the final combined revenue and LLY growth rate, the correctness score is significantly reduced. The answer is partially correct but fails on core numerical accuracy, which is critical in financial analysis.",

      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar reported profit of **$6.5 billion** for 2022, while GE posted a GAAP loss of **$3.7 billion**.  That makes Caterpillar’s profit about **$10.2 billion greater** than GE’s.

      "contextual_relevance": 9,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors despite correctly identifying the general direction of the comparison. Caterpillar's 2022 profit is stated as $6.5 billion (close to the true $6,493 million), and GE's GAAP loss is given as $3.7 billion (close to the true $3,683 million), which are acceptable within rounding. However, the profit difference is stated as $10.2 billion, which is approximately correct ($6,493M - (-$3,683M) = $10,176M or $10.176B), so this part is acceptable. The critical error lies in Caterpillar's profit margin: the LLM calculates it as 12.7% using $6.5B / $50.97B, but the ground truth margin is 10.4%. This suggests either incorrect revenue data or miscalculation. The original knowledge graph states Caterpillar's margin was 10.4%, so the LLM’s 12.7% is factually wrong. Consequently, the margin difference is calculated as 17.7 percentage points (12.7% - (-5.0%)), but the correct difference is 15.4 percentage points (10.4% - (-5.0%)). (2) Number verification: Caterpillar profit: ~$6.5B ≈ $6,493M (OK); GE loss: ~$3.7B ≈ $3,683M (OK); difference: $10.2B ≈ $10,176M (OK); Caterpillar margin: 12.7% ≠ 10.4% (incorrect); margin difference: 17.7 pp ≠ 15.4 pp (incorrect). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to compare profits and compute margins, but fails in accurate synthesis due to incorrect margin calculation, likely from using inaccurate or misaligned revenue data. (4) Scores justified: Correctness scored low (4) due to major error in margin calculation affecting the core of the second part of the question. Quantitative accuracy is 4 due to one major miscalculation despite mostly correct inputs. Qualitative accuracy is 5 because reasoning structure is sound but based on flawed data.

      "question": "How do the cost estimation methodologies used by Boeing on the 777X program compare to Honeywell's approach for long-term contracts, and what specific factors contribute to the complexity and uncertainty in both cases?",
      "original_answer": "Boeing uses program accounting for the 777X aircraft program, which involves estimating the total number of units to be sold (program accounting quantity) and forecasting revenues and costs over the program's expected life. This method introduces significant complexity and uncertainty due to challenges in predicting customer demand, regulatory certification timelines, and associated cost increases. Honeywell, on the other hand, applies the cost-to-cost input method for recognizing revenue on long-term contracts, which measures progress based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs at completion. Honeywell’s cost estimates are influenced by inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, subcontractor performance, labor agreements, and business volume assumptions. Both companies face complexity in estimating costs due to external uncertainties and the long-term nature of their programs, though Boeing’s challenges are more tied to certification and demand forecasting, while Honeywell’s are rooted in contract execution and performance variability.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s 777X cost estimate is built on “program accounting,” which projects the number of aircraft to be sold, the revenue for unsold units and the total program‑life cost by judging market demand, the effort and timing required for certification, and the risk of schedule delays that can push entry‑into‑service later and raise costs (page 135). Honeywell, by contrast, estimates costs for its long‑term fixed‑price contracts with a cost‑to‑cost input method that projects total cost at completion and the margin at completion, relying on incurred costs, historical performance, inflation, technical‑ and schedule‑risk, and subcontractor performance (pages 134 & 66). In both cases the uncertainty stems from limited historical data and the need to forecast technical and regulatory challenges—Boeing’s certification‑timing and demand assumptions, and Honeywell’s technical performance, schedule risk and economic variables—making the estimates highly judgment‑driven and complex.",

Honeywell uses the cost-to-cost input method for long-term contracts, measuring progress based on incurred costs versus total estimated costs, influenced by inflation, technical and schedule risk, subcontractor performance, and other factors. These points match the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, unit counts) in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no discrepancies exist. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes across Boeing and Honeywell, contrasting their methodologies and identifying overlapping and distinct sources of uncertainty. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits Honeywell’s mention of labor agreements and business volume assumptions, which are specific factors listed in the ground truth. This slight incompleteness prevents a perfect 10 but does not undermine the core accuracy. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing the comparison of cost estimation methodologies and the sources of complexity and uncertainty for both firms.

The combined total consideration is accurately calculated as $91.8 billion, which matches the ground truth sum of $80,269 million + $11,514 million = $91,783 million (rounded appropriately to $91.8 billion). The goodwill proportions are correctly represented: BMY's 17.4% is rounded to 'roughly 17%' and MRK's 21.1% is rounded to 'about 21%', which is acceptable for semantic equivalence. The individual goodwill and consideration figures are accurately rounded: $13.99B / $80.27B and $2.42B / $11.51B reflect the original values with minor rounding. (2) All calculations are sound: the percentages are correctly derived from the provided numbers, and the comparison between the two goodwill-to-consideration ratios is accurate. The use of 'billion' instead of 'million' is correctly scaled and consistent. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is properly executed: the model synthesizes data from two separate acquisitions (BMY/Celgene and MRK/Acceleron), computes totals and proportions, and draws the correct comparative conclusion about the higher goodwill allocation in MRK's deal. (4) The answer addresses both parts of the question: total combined consideration and the difference in goodwill proportion. Only minor rounding of percentages (17.4% → 17%, 21.1% → 21%) prevents a perfect 10, but this is within acceptable approximation for financial communication.

      "original_answer": "Boeing's 2022 10-K filing states that it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of indemnifications and financing commitments due to uncertainty in timing and amount. This implies a higher level of financial risk exposure that cannot be quantified. In contrast, FedEx's 2022 10-K indicates that historically, it has not made significant payments under indemnification obligations, and the company has not recognized material amounts for these obligations. This suggests FedEx perceives its indemnification risks as minimal and remote. Therefore, while both companies disclose indemnifications, Boeing's inability to estimate these obligations signals greater uncertainty and potential future financial impact compared to FedEx's more stable and predictable indemnification risk profile.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s 10‑K states that “it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain,” so the company discloses a potential exposure without any quantitative range. FedEx’s 10‑K likewise notes that the “overall maximum potential amount of the obligation … cannot be reasonably estimated,” but adds that “historically, we have not been required to make significant payments under our guarantee or indemnification obligations,” implying that, despite the lack of a numeric estimate, past experience suggests the risk is remote. Thus Boeing’s disclosure reflects a higher‑uncertainty, potentially larger financial risk, whereas FedEx leans on its historical record to portray the indemnification risk as unlikely to be material.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures, particularly in the Medicare Rebates payments for AbbVie. The ground truth states ABBV made payments of $15,054 million ($15.054 billion), but the LLM incorrectly reports payments as $8.8 billion—nearly half the actual amount. Additionally, the LLM reports total cash outflows as $9.748 billion, which is incorrect; the correct combined total of payments and liabilities is not $9.748 billion. The combined total Medicare Rebates liability (not payments) is $6,294 million ($6.294 billion), which the LLM fails to state correctly. The PFE figure of $0.997 billion ($997 million) is accurate and matches the ground truth. (2) Calculations are flawed: the LLM adds $8.751B (a number not found in the original answer) and $0.997B to get $9.748B, which misrepresents both the data and the question. The question asks for the combined total of Medicare Rebates (i.e., the liability), not payments. The correct sum is $5,297M (ABBV balance) + $997M (PFE) = $6,294M, which the LLM does not compute or mention. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the LLM attempts to compare ABBV and PFE in terms of liability and cash flow, and correctly notes that PFE does not disclose a separate payment or balance. However, it mischaracterizes ABBV’s cash outflow as $8.8B instead of $15.054B, undermining the validity of the comparison. It also incorrectly implies that $8.751B is ABBV’s payment, which is not supported by the ground truth. (4) The contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the structure of the question, discussing both companies, their liabilities, payments, and implications for financial obligations.

(2) The quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the HON obligation is off by over 600%, turning a correct fact (CAT's asset value) into a misleading analysis.

While it correctly identifies AMD's increase in Total Property and Equipment, net as $213 million, it incorrectly calculates NVIDIA's increase. According to the ground truth, the combined increase is $2,784 million, implying NVIDIA's increase should be $2,571 million ($2,784 - $213), but the LLM reports $2,369 million, which is off by $202 million. The LLM's combined total of $2,582 million is therefore incorrect, leading to an erroneous excess over $2 billion of $582 million instead of the correct $784 million. (2) Number/calculation verification: AMD's increase from $1,589M to $1,802M is indeed $213M (correct). NVIDIA's increase from $3,914M to $6,283M is $2,369M (correct based on provided numbers), but this contradicts the ground truth combined total, suggesting either the source data in the LLM's context is inconsistent with the knowledge graph or the ground truth assumes different figures. However, since the ground truth states the combined increase is $2,784M, and the LLM's sum is $2,582M, there is a $202M discrepancy. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The LLM correctly understands the task—calculating individual increases, summing them, and comparing to $2 billion. The logic and structure are sound, and it properly cites sources. However, due to incorrect input numbers (especially for NVIDIA), the final conclusion is factually wrong.

Mastercard, on the other hand, emphasizes accelerating secular shifts in commercial point-of-sale purchases by offering differentiated propositions across cards and platforms, expanding distribution across financial institutions, new geographies, and small businesses, and modernizing invoiced payments by embedding payments into widely used platforms and workflows.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express’s 2024 strategy treats commercial payments as a “card‑centric” business: it is deepening its corporate‑card and accounts‑payable expense‑management value proposition and rolling out new financing, banking and other payment features for business customers, while expanding merchant acceptance and B2B‑debit capabilities through partnerships and co‑brand programs【page_8】.  \n\nMastercard’s 2024 plan, by contrast, is building a broader commercial‑payments ecosystem: it is expanding point‑of‑sale and invoiced‑payment capture across more geographies, financial‑institution partners and small‑business channels, and it is scaling new disbursement and remittance flows with the Mastercard Move platform, leveraging its data‑AI, technology and franchise model to launch differentiated products and services【page_8】【page_9】.",

(1) Both American Express and Mastercard are correctly identified with their respective strategic focuses: American Express is portrayed as card-centric, emphasizing corporate card value propositions, accounts payable solutions, and new financing/banking features—matching the ground truth. Mastercard is accurately described as ecosystem-focused, driving POS and invoiced-payment modernization, expanding distribution via financial institutions and geographies, and leveraging platforms like Mastercard Move—consistent with the original. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable beyond correct use of '2024', which both answers include. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes differences in product innovation (e.g., Amex's card enhancements vs. Mastercard's platform-based solutions) and market expansion (Amex via partnerships/co-branding, Mastercard via broader distribution and platform scaling). (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to slightly more detailed phrasing in the LLM answer (e.g., mentioning 'B2B-debit capabilities' and 'Mastercard Move platform'), which are not in the original but are plausible elaborations from source material and do not contradict it.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $2,910 million. Duke Energy paid $447 million, while NextEra Energy paid $2,463 million. This significant difference reflects NEE’s much larger capital expenditures and debt financing activity compared to DUK, as seen in NEE’s $12.1 billion in financing cash flows versus DUK’s $773 million. NEE’s higher interest payments are a direct result of its larger debt load used to fund major investments, including $15.5 billion in independent power and other investments, compared to DUK’s $991 million in long-term debt issuances.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 cash‑paid‑for‑interest (net of amount capitalized) was **$447 million for Duke Energy (DUK)** and **$2,463 million for Nextera Energy (NEE)**, giving a combined total of **$2,910 million**.  \n\nDuke’s modest interest outflow reflects its relatively lower leverage and a financing mix that relies more on regulated‑rate earnings and equity, whereas Nextera’s much larger interest payment signals a capital‑intensive, higher‑leverage structure that uses substantial debt to fund growth and acquisitions.",

These match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., 'million' vs 'M'). The sum is accurate: 447 + 2,463 = 2,910.\n\n2) Quantitatively, all figures are correct. The years (2023), companies (DUK, NEE), and metric (Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized) are accurately identified and reported.\n\n3) The reasoning is sound and captures the core contrast in capital structures: DUK’s lower leverage and reliance on regulated earnings and equity versus NEE’s high-debt, capital-intensive strategy. While the LLM does not include specific supporting figures like NEE’s $12.1B in financing cash flows or $15.5B in investments (as in the original), it still correctly infers the qualitative difference in financing strategies based on the interest payments.\n\n4) The answer is semantically equivalent in conveying the main conclusion: NEE’s significantly higher interest payments reflect a more leveraged, growth-oriented financing model, while DUK’s lower payments indicate a more conservative capital structure. The omission of specific investment or financing cash flow numbers from the original answer slightly reduces qualitative completeness but does not impair the correctness of the core reasoning.\n\nThus, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high score with only minor room for added detail.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in both quantitative values and synthesis. The net property and equipment for GOOGL is incorrectly stated as $171.0 billion (‑$171,036 million), which contradicts the ground truth of $2.6 billion. This leads to a grossly incorrect combined net value of $233.5 billion instead of the correct $65.1 billion. Similarly, the gross investment for GOOGL is reported as $384 billion, which is vastly higher than the true value of $4.6 billion. These numbers appear to be misread from the source (e.g., possibly confusing total assets or misreading line items). (2) Calculations are entirely incorrect due to wrong inputs. The sum $62.5B + $171.0B = $233.5B is mathematically correct but based on false data. The comparison of gross investments ($122.1B vs $384B) is also invalid because GOOGL’s actual gross investment is only $4.6B, not $384B. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the model attempts to contrast capital intensity strategies, it draws the opposite conclusion. It claims Google has a 'heavy, data-center-driven' strategy due to higher spending, but in reality, CMCSA’s gross investment ($122.1B) is far larger than GOOGL’s ($4.6B), supporting the ground truth that CMCSA is more capital-intensive. The reasoning is logically structured but built on false premises. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the right question structure and cites pages, but the data inaccuracies severely undermine usefulness. Scores reflect catastrophic failure in quantitative accuracy, partial credit for attempting correct reasoning framework and addressing all question parts.",

      "original_answer": "AbbVie is advancing its oncology portfolio through the commercial execution of Venclexta, Epkinly, and Elahere, which supports its strategic objective of maintaining growth and competitiveness in the oncology space, especially in the face of challenges with Imbruvica. Meanwhile, Pfizer significantly bolstered its oncology capabilities through the December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, gaining four in-line medicines—Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, and Tivdak—alongside a robust pipeline. This acquisition allows Pfizer to span multiple modalities, including ADCs, small molecules, bispecifics, and other immunotherapies, thereby enhancing its competitive positioning. Together, both companies are strategically strengthening their oncology portfolios, but Pfizer’s acquisition represents a more transformative step in reshaping its presence in the oncology market.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s 2024 strategic objectives state that the company will “advance its oncology portfolio driven by Venclexta, strong commercial execution of Epkinly, Elahere and other new product launches” (page 36). By bringing together a late‑stage B‑cell lymphoma bispecific (Epkinly), a newly approved leukemia therapy (Venclexta) and a novel solid‑tumor agent (Elahere), AbbVie is creating a diversified, multi‑indication oncology franchise that deepens its competitive moat and offsets revenue pressure from biosimilars.  \n\nPfizer, by completing its December 2023 acquisition of Seagen, adds Seagen’s pipeline and four marketed cancer drugs (Padcev, Adcetris, Tukysa, Tivdak) and expands its modality mix to include ADCs, bispecifics and small‑molecule immunotherapies (page 10). This bolsters Pfizer’s oncology breadth and scale, positioning it as a more comprehensive competitor able to address a wider range of cancers and capture greater market share.",

      "question": "How does the use of TRSs by AMT and SPG differently affect their tax obligations and income distribution strategies, based on their respective 2023 disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "AMT operates as a REIT and is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, provided it distributes substantially all of its taxable income to shareholders. However, it must pay taxes on earnings from its domestic TRSs. As of December 31, 2023, AMT’s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing, most of its U.S. indoor DAS networks, Services and Data Centers segments, and most operations in several international markets, which indicates that its TRSs are a limited but necessary part of its structure for engaging in non-REIT-qualified activities. In contrast, SPG also operates as a REIT and owns securities in TRSs, but it is subject to a 100% excise tax on certain transactions with TRSs if not conducted on an arm’s-length basis. SPG must also ensure that no more than 20% of its total assets are represented by securities of TRSs. This constraint affects SPG’s flexibility in managing TRS investments and requires careful monitoring to avoid violating REIT asset tests and incurring penalties. Therefore, while both companies use TRSs to engage in non-REIT activities, AMT appears to integrate TRSs more directly into its international operations, whereas SPG must manage TRS ownership more restrictively to avoid tax penalties and maintain REIT compliance.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower explains that its TRSs are used only for the few domestic activities that cannot be held inside the REIT; the earnings of those subsidiaries are taxed at ordinary corporate rates, but because the REIT still receives a dividends‑paid deduction for the REIT‑qualified portion, the TRS structure lets the company stay in REIT‑qualified businesses and continue to meet the 90 % distribution rule without extra U.S. tax on the REIT’s core tower income.  \n\nSimon Property notes that its TRSs are treated as regular C‑corporations and any non‑arm‑length transaction with them triggers a 100 % excise penalty, and the TRS holdings are subject to strict ownership limits; consequently, income generated by the TRSs is taxed separately from REIT taxable income and must be managed carefully so that the REIT can still distribute at least 90 % of its REIT‑taxable income and avoid the 4 % nondeductible excise tax on undistributed amounts.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct and aligns well with the ground truth in terms of factual content and reasoning. (1) It accurately describes how AMT uses TRSs for non-REIT-qualified domestic activities, with earnings taxed at corporate rates, while the REIT avoids federal income tax on core operations—consistent with the original answer. It also correctly notes that AMT benefits from a dividends-paid deduction, enabling compliance with the 90% distribution requirement. For SPG, the LLM correctly identifies the 100% excise tax on non-arm’s-length transactions with TRSs and mentions the separate taxation of TRS income, as well as the need to meet the 90% distribution rule to avoid the 4% nondeductible excise tax. (2) Quantitatively, all percentages (90%, 100%, 4%) are accurate and correctly attributed. There are no numerical errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes tax implications and income distribution strategies for both companies, contrasting their TRS usage. However, the LLM omits a key point from the original answer: SPG’s 20% asset test limitation on TRS holdings, which is a critical constraint affecting its investment flexibility and REIT compliance. This omission reduces completeness and slightly weakens the qualitative accuracy. (4) Despite this, the answer remains contextually relevant and conveys the core differences in tax obligations and income distribution strategies. Wording differs but meaning is semantically equivalent on key points. The missing 20% asset test detail prevents a top score, but overall correctness is high.",

      "original_answer": "The application of the 10 percent discount factor, combined with the use of first-day-of-the-month average prices, introduces significant variability and reduces the reliability of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows for both COP and XOM. COP states that the standardized measure is based on discrete pricing points (first-day-of-the-month prices), which may not reflect actual future prices or market conditions, and XOM echoes this concern, noting that these pricing assumptions can cause significant year-to-year variability. Both companies emphasize that the standardized measure does not represent the fair value of their oil and gas properties or a reliable estimate of future cash flows due to these prescribed assumptions.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies state that the “standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows” is calculated by (i) using 12‑month average prices that are the simple arithmetic average of each month’s first‑day‑of‑the‑month price, and (ii) discounting the resulting cash‑flow stream at a prescribed 10 % annual rate.  Because the price series is smoothed and the discount rate is fixed – rather than reflecting the actual market‑based discount rates or spot‑price volatility that will be realized – the resulting figure is a comparable, rule‑based estimate, but the filings expressly note that it is **not** intended to represent fair value and its reliability as a true forecast of future cash flows is limited by those simplifying assumptions for both COP and XOM.",

The LLM correctly notes that the price is a simple arithmetic average of the first day of each month’s price, which matches the prescribed method in the filings. (2) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that because both the discount rate and pricing are standardized (rather than market-dynamic), the resulting measure is rule-based and comparable across firms but not reflective of actual future cash flows or fair value. This matches the disclosures from both COP and XOM. (3) The multi-hop synthesis is appropriate—information about standardized assumptions and their impact on reliability is correctly attributed to both companies, even though the answer does not quote each company’s exact wording. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM refers to '12-month average prices' as a 'smoothed' series, which, while reasonable, slightly softens COP and XOM’s stronger point about discrete, potentially unrepresentative pricing points. The original answer emphasizes that first-day prices may not reflect actual future prices, introducing variability—this nuance is slightly underemphasized but not missing. Overall, the LLM captures the core limitations and correctly attributes them to both companies, with full factual and contextual accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "GD uses a cost-to-cost input method to estimate progress on long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time. It bases its estimates on assumptions such as labor productivity, material costs, subcontractor performance, and availability of funding. If there is a significant change in these estimates, GD adjusts the profit using a cumulative catch-up method, which impacts profit recorded to date and future revenue recognition. In 2023, GD had $93.6 billion in remaining performance obligations, with 40% expected to be recognized in 2024. HON also uses the cost-to-cost method for long-term contracts and recognizes revenue over time, but its estimation process includes factors like historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, and anticipated labor agreements. HON emphasizes auditor evaluation of these estimates due to their complexity and subjectivity, particularly for contracts with longer durations or significant gross margin changes. Both companies face financial implications from estimation changes, but GD explicitly ties adjustments to a defined catch-up method, while HON focuses on audit validation of estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies base their “estimated total‑contract‑cost” numbers on forward‑looking assumptions, but the scope of the assumptions and the way the adjustments flow through the financials differ. General Dynamics estimates contract costs using assumptions about labor productivity and availability, material costs, subcontractor performance, funding timing, asset utilization and other technical factors, and then applies a cumulative‑catch‑up method that records any change in the estimated profit (and thus revenue) in the period the change is identified – the impact is shown as a single line‑item adjustment to revenue, operating earnings and EPS. Honeywell also uses a cost‑to‑cost input method but explicitly lists a wider set of drivers – historical performance trends, inflation, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance, business‑volume and labor‑agreement assumptions – and states that adjustments to those cost estimates can be reflected either in operating costs or in revenue, with the resulting change shown as an increase (or decrease) to revenue, operating earnings and diluted EPS in the period the estimate is revised.",

In contrast, HON systematically tracks unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables on a contract-by-contract basis, recognizing contract assets when revenue is recognized before billing and derecognizing them upon billing.

The ground truth value is $4,199 million, but the LLM reports $4,555 million, which is incorrect. The value for NextEra Energy’s remaining reserve amortization ($895 million) is accurate and correctly attributed to the 2021 rate agreement as of December 31, 2024. (2) The calculation of the difference is based on incorrect input: $4,555M - $895M = $3,660M, which does not match the correct difference of $4,199M - $895M = $3,304M. This results in a $356 million overstatement. While the format of numbers is acceptable (e.g., $3.7 billion ≈ $3,660 million), the underlying figures are factually wrong.

It claims both CAT and LMT expected to receive $0 in Medicare Part D subsidies in 2024, citing a '–' line, but this contradicts the ground truth: LMT reported receiving $2 million for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans in 2024. The ground truth does not state that CAT expected $0—rather, it explicitly says CAT did not specify a dollar amount. Thus, asserting $0 is a factual error. (2) Regarding equity allocations, the LLM incorrectly states CAT’s U.S. pension plan target as 15% equity; the ground truth states CAT’s overall postretirement benefit plan strategy targets 40% equities and 60% fixed income. The 15% equity figure actually matches LMT’s target, not CAT’s. The LLM confuses the companies’ allocations. Additionally, the LLM claims LMT does not disclose a specific equity target, but the ground truth states LMT’s 2024 U.S. pension plan target was 85% fixed income and 15% equities—specific and disclosed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly synthesizes data across companies and misattributes figures. It answers a different question than asked by focusing on pension subcategories rather than the overall postretirement benefit asset strategy comparison.

      "original_answer": "AMT maintains greater revenue stability through its structured lease arrangements with fixed escalation clauses and financial penalties for early termination, which discourage tenants from ending leases prematurely. These leases typically have initial terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal options, and often include pass-through costs for power, which are recognized as revenue over time. In contrast, SPG faces higher tenant retention risk due to its reliance on consumer foot traffic and exposure to unpredictable external factors like civil unrest, pandemics, and e-commerce shifts. SPG’s leasing goals are more vulnerable to market volatility, such as oversupply of retail space and reduced consumer willingness to shop in person, which could lead to lower occupancy and rental rates. As a result, AMT benefits from more predictable, long-term cash flows, while SPG must adapt its business model to evolving consumer behavior and external disruptions to maintain revenue stability.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower’s leases are long‑term (typically 5‑10 years with multiple renewal options), contain fixed‑percentage or CPI escalations and heavy penalties for early termination, and the company usually has several tenants on each tower.  This structure, together with the fact that the towers have little residual‑value risk, gives AMT a highly predictable, “take‑or‑pay” revenue stream and lets it retain tenants mainly by exercising renewal rights rather than by offering concessions.  \n\nSimon Property Group’s leases are shorter, often anchored by a single department‑store tenant, include percentage‑of‑sales (overage) rent and are subject to frequent lease‑modification, rent‑concession and re‑tenanting negotiations; tenant bankruptcies and e‑commerce pressure create much more variable cash‑flow exposure.  Consequently, SPG’s revenue is less stable and its tenant‑retention strategy relies on lease modifications, rent allowances and aggressive re‑leasing of vacant space to mitigate that risk.

It also accurately contrasts SPG’s shorter leases, exposure to tenant bankruptcies, e-commerce pressure, and reliance on lease modifications and re-tenanting for retention. The mention of overage rent and frequent renegotiations adds detail not in the ground truth but is factually correct and contextually relevant. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., exact percentages, dollar figures) in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised; all descriptive terms (e.g., '5-10 years') match.

These are not minor formatting issues but reflect different line items and time periods, constituting a major error. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that the Chinese Action Plan could restrict NVIDIA’s sales, citing their 10-K risk disclosure, and acknowledges AMD’s growth trajectory. It also captures the differential impact—NVIDIA expecting direct adverse effects, while AMD’s growth could be curbed. However, it misses the key nuance in the original answer that AMD could benefit from NVIDIA’s potential market share loss if it meets the standards, and that both could be harmed if standards broadly exclude foreign accelerators.

Similarly, reduced business spending impacts Mastercard's cross-border transaction volumes, which are a significant source of revenue through cross-border volume fees and switched transaction fees. Both companies are thus exposed to financial performance risks due to lower business spending, with American Express facing potential liquidity constraints and Mastercard experiencing reduced fee income.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express says that weaker business‑card spending cuts the volume of loans and receivables it can originate, which in turn makes it harder to meet the “funding plan” and to securitize those assets – a key source of liquidity and earnings for the company【page_94】. Mastercard warns that a slowdown in business spending drags down both domestic and **cross‑border** card use, reducing the fee income it earns from switching and currency‑conversion on those transactions【page_35】. Together, the two firms face pressure on different but comparable revenue streams: Amex’s loan‑securitization pipeline is constrained, while Mastercard’s cross‑border transaction fees are suppressed, each weighing on their respective financial performance.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: American Express's loan securitization challenges due to lower business spending are accurately described, as is Mastercard's exposure to reduced cross-border transaction fees. The answer correctly identifies the financial mechanisms at risk—Amex's funding plan and liquidity via securitization, and Mastercard's fee income from cross-border and switched transactions. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers that require verification (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates), so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—score is 10. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes impacts across two companies, linking declining business spending to distinct but relevant financial channels (securitization for Amex, transaction fees for Mastercard). The use of document citations (page_94, page_35) suggests grounding in source material. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—the LLM conveys the same core risks and mechanisms as the original answer, with slightly more detailed phrasing (e.g., mentioning currency conversion, domestic use). The only minor gap is that the original emphasizes 'liquidity constraints' for Amex and 'reduced fee income' for Mastercard more explicitly, while the LLM uses 'constrained pipeline' and 'suppressed fees'—slightly softer but still accurate.

NEE's fuel, purchased power, and interchange expense was $5,457 million, which represents approximately 19.4% of its operating revenues of $28,114 million.

According to the ground truth, DUK's fuel and power expense was $2,203 million ($2.203 billion), but the LLM reports $8.23 billion, which is more than triple the correct value. The LLM appears to have incorrectly summed regional values or misclassified expenses (e.g., listing Progress $2.203 bn as part of Duke’s total while also listing other regions), leading to a gross overstatement. NEE’s expense is reported as $5.46 billion, which is close to the correct $5,457 million and acceptable within rounding. However, the combined expense is stated as $13.7 billion, whereas the correct total is $7,660 million (~$7.66 billion), making the LLM’s figure nearly double the true value. Revenue figures are also incorrect: DUK’s revenue is stated as $24.4 billion, but ground truth is $6,488 million ($6.488 billion); NEE’s revenue is correctly cited at $28.1 billion vs $28,114 million. The LLM’s combined revenue of $52.5 billion is thus inflated due to DUK’s error. The percentage of combined revenues (26%) is based on incorrect totals and is therefore invalid. (2) Calculations are fundamentally flawed: the sum of DUK and NEE’s expenses should be $2,203M + $5,457M = $7,660M, not $13.7B. The LLM’s percentage (26%) lacks relevance since the question asks for individual comparisons, not a combined ratio. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present—LLM attempts to combine data across companies and compare to revenues—but fails due to incorrect base figures. It does not correctly break down each company’s expense as a percentage of its own revenue as required. The ground truth shows DUK at 34% and NEE at 19.4%, but LLM omits this critical comparative insight, instead creating a misleading aggregate. (4) Scores reflect severe quantitative errors (2/10), weak qualitative reasoning due to flawed synthesis (4/10), moderate contextual relevance as it addresses the right companies and general metrics (7/10), and a low overall correctness score (3/10) due to major factual and computational inaccuracies that invalidate the conclusion.",

The difference in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue between the two companies is 15% (58% - 43%).

More critically, the LLM reports Tesla’s weighted average recognition period as 3.5 years, whereas the ground truth is 3.0 years. Starbucks’ recognition period of 2.3 years is correct.

This recurring revenue is critical for maintaining cash flow from operating activities. In contrast, SPG faces significant risks that could negatively impact tenant lease performance, including shifts in consumer behavior toward e-commerce, reduced consumer foot traffic due to public health crises, and the potential for tenants to underreport sales, which affects overage rent collection. These external factors could materially and adversely affect SPG’s occupancy levels and lease rates, directly impacting its revenue and asset value.

This is a critical reversal of fact.

For Caterpillar, the LLM introduces a $90 million restructuring cost not present in the ground truth, which does not specify the amount — making this an unsupported addition. The $8,673 million segment profit for Caterpillar is plausible but not verifiable against the ground truth, which omits the exact figure.

According to the ground truth, COP's discounted future net cash flow from Asia Pacific/Middle East in 2022 was $10,147 million, but the LLM reports $7,810 million. For XOM's Asia region in 2021, the correct value is $49,933 million, but the LLM incorrectly states $2,625 million. These numbers are drastically different and lead to an incorrect combined total: the LLM calculates ~$10.4 billion, while the correct sum is $60,080 million (~$60.1 billion). (2) Calculations are based on wrong inputs, so the arithmetic (though correctly performed) is irrelevant due to incorrect source data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model retrieves incorrect values for both companies and misattributes the scale of investment outcomes. Instead of showing XOM's heavier regional investment, the LLM incorrectly concludes that COP has a larger expected cash-generating potential, which contradicts the ground truth. (4) The contextual relevance is partially maintained as the answer addresses the right companies, regions, metric, and timeframes, but all substantive content is factually wrong.

The combined increase is $4,648 million. This reflects a growth in credit-based sales for both companies, with Apple showing a significantly larger increase compared to Qualcomm.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s net accounts‑receivable grew from $29.5 billion in 2023 to $33.4 billion in 2024 – an increase of **$3.9 billion**. Qualcomm’s net accounts‑receivable rose from $3.2 billion to $3.9 billion – an increase of **$0.75 billion**. Together, the two companies added **about $4.65 billion** in receivables, indicating that a larger share of each firm’s 2024 revenue was generated on credit: Apple’s modest $7.8 billion (≈2 %) rise in total sales was accompanied by a $3.9 billion AR boost, while Qualcomm’s higher‑percentage revenue growth (≈9 % increase to $38.96 billion) was reflected in a $0.75 billion rise in receivables.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the increase in 'Accounts Receivable, Net' for both Apple and Qualcomm from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, with accurate figures: Apple's increase is reported as $3.9 billion (ground truth: $3,902 million), and Qualcomm's as $0.75 billion (ground truth: $746 million). The combined increase is stated as 'about $4.65 billion' (ground truth: $4,648 million), which is a reasonable rounding. 2) All calculations are quantitatively accurate within acceptable rounding: $33.4B - $29.5B = $3.9B for Apple; $3.9B - $3.2B = $0.7B (slight rounding down from $746M, but $0.75B is closer and used correctly later). The combined total $3.9B + $0.75B = $4.65B matches. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies and two years, computes individual and combined changes, and links the increase in receivables to credit-based sales. It adds contextual insight by comparing the AR growth to revenue trends (Apple’s modest revenue growth vs. large AR increase, Qualcomm’s 9% revenue growth), which is not in the original answer but is logically valid and enhances the analysis without contradicting facts. 4) Entities (Apple, Qualcomm, 'Accounts Receivable, Net', fiscal years 2023–2024) are correct. The answer addresses both parts of the question: the combined increase and its implication for credit-based sales. The only minor issue is the slight rounding down of Qualcomm’s increase from $746M to $700M initially, though it later uses $0.75B consistently, suggesting awareness. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate.",

This results in a major miscalculation of the combined total: LLM reports ~$732 million, while the correct total is $1.632 billion. (2) The calculation itself (adding $532 million and $200 million) is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect input data. The fiscal years are correctly referenced (2021 for Schwab, 2022 for Visa), and the metric (long-term purchase obligations) is correctly identified.

According to the ground truth, DUK's fuel and power expense in 2024 is $2,346 million, not $5,293 million as incorrectly calculated by summing segment-specific expenses (Florida, Ohio, Progress). The ground truth explicitly states DUK's total as $2,346 million, which likely already represents the consolidated figure. The LLM incorrectly assumes that summing segment-level fuel expenses gives the total, leading to a significant overstatement. NEE's expense is correctly stated as $5,029 million. Therefore, the combined expense is incorrectly calculated as $10,322 million instead of the correct $7,375 million. Additionally, DUK’s total segment income is reported in the LLM answer as $3,585 million (sum of Florida $1,067M, Ohio $347M, Progress $2,171M), but the ground truth states DUK’s total segment income is $1,067 million — suggesting either that only Florida is considered or that $1,067M is the correct consolidated figure. The LLM’s breakdown contradicts the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: DUK’s fuel expense is off by over double, total segment income is triple the stated value, and the final comparison is based on incorrect totals. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify which figures represent consolidated totals versus segment components, leading to erroneous aggregation. It also misidentifies the scope of 'total segment income' for DUK.

      "original_answer": "The combined net change in income taxes for COP and XOM in 2019 is $36,613 million. This is calculated by adding COP's net change in income taxes of $4,687 million and XOM's net change in income taxes of $31,927 million.

However, it incorrectly claims that XOM does not disclose the 'net change in income taxes' for 2019, when in fact the ground truth states that XOM's value is $31,927 million. This is a critical factual omission that prevents the correct synthesis of the combined total. (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially correct—two of the three key numbers (COP 2019 and 2020) are accurate, but the missing XOM 2019 value leads to an incomplete and incorrect calculation of the combined total. The sum of $4,687M + $31,927M = $36,613M is not provided or acknowledged. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not synthesize across both companies as required. It stops at claiming data unavailability rather than reporting the known ground truth value for XOM, breaking the chain of reasoning. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses the structure of the question and correctly reports available COP data, but fails on the core requirement to combine COP and XOM figures. The conclusion that COP’s 2020 change is 'substantially higher' than its 2019 change is true but irrelevant to the actual comparison asked (combined 2019 COP+XOM vs. COP 2020), further reducing correctness.",

The combined SG&A increase is correctly calculated as ≈$1.203 billion, which is semantically equivalent to $1,203 million. Apple's total operating expense increase is approximated as ≈$2.6 billion, close to the true value of $2,620 million. However, the LLM incorrectly states that Qualcomm's total operating expense change is not disclosed, while the ground truth shows a $35 million decrease. This omission breaks the multi-hop comparison required in the question.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is high: all provided numbers are correct within reasonable rounding. $24.9 billion and $26.1 billion are acceptable rounded forms of $24,932 million and $26,097 million. Similarly, $54.8 billion and $57.5 billion are valid approximations of $54,847 million and $57,467 million. The $38 million increase for Qualcomm is exact. Only the failure to report Qualcomm's operating expense change (which is available in the source) affects accuracy.\n\n3) The reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly computes Apple's and Qualcomm's SG&A changes and their sum. However, it fails to retrieve or acknowledge Qualcomm's total operating expense decrease of $35 million, which is essential for the comparative analysis. This undermines the multi-hop synthesis required to compare combined SG&A increases to changes in total operating expenses across both firms.\n\n4) The contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses most of the question but omits a key component (Qualcomm's operating expense trend), making the final comparison incomplete. The conclusion that a direct comparison cannot be made is incorrect, as the data exists in the source. Thus, while the answer is factually accurate where it speaks, it lacks completeness in multi-hop reasoning, leading to a reduced correctness score.",

This discrepancy affects the combined total, which the LLM calculates as $3,061 million ($320M + $2,741M), whereas the correct sum is $2,943 million ($202M + $2,741M). The value for NextEra Energy ($2,741 million) is accurate. (2) Calculations: The addition in the LLM answer is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but the inputs are flawed. The correct calculation should be $202M + $2,741M = $2,943M. The LLM's total is off by $118 million due to the incorrect DUK figure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies both companies, the correct metric (noncurrent derivative liabilities), and the correct time frame (end of 2023).

AT&T has $5,089 million in such debt, while Verizon has $22,568 million. This significant short-term debt burden implies both companies must prioritize liquidity management in 2025, with AT&T planning to fund its obligations through cash from operations, debt issuance, and asset sales, and Verizon likely needing to maintain access to credit facilities and manage its cash flow efficiently to meet its larger maturing obligations.",

(2) All numeric values are correct and properly attributed to the respective companies and sources (10-K pages). The sum is accurate: $5,089 + $22,568 = $27,657 million, and $27.7 billion is an acceptable rounding. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two separate companies is correctly synthesized. The explanation of liquidity strategies accurately reflects the ground truth: both companies rely on operating cash flow, credit facilities, and new borrowings; AT&T mentions asset sales and cash generation, Verizon refers to asset-backed debt and refinancing. The LLM adds contextual detail (e.g., commercial paper programs, credit facilities) consistent with typical 10-K disclosures, enhancing clarity without introducing inaccuracies. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly name AT&T’s asset sales as a specific planned source (though 'asset-backed issuances' may imply it), and the phrasing slightly generalizes Verizon’s strategy compared to the original’s emphasis on maintaining credit access.

In 2023, refining margins remained above the pre-COVID 10-year historical range but started to normalize from 2022 highs, and the company noted that margins would remain volatile due to changes in global factors such as geopolitical developments and demand growth. Chevron, in its 2023 10-K filing, specifically listed 'changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins' as an important factor that could cause actual results to differ materially from its forward-looking statements.

      "original_answer": "GM Financial's leasing program is heavily exposed to residual values, as evidenced by its leasing penetration and the $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations in 2023, which is directly influenced by used vehicle prices and lease portfolio net book values. In contrast, Tesla does not include vehicle sales with resale value guarantees in its standard disclosures, indicating a different risk profile where upfront cash payments reduce future residual value exposure. This means GM bears more residual risk through its leasing model, while Tesla mitigates this risk by receiving payments upfront and not including such arrangements in future payment disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "GM’s financing model relies heavily on its captive lender – GM Financial financed 42 % of U.S. retail vehicle sales in 2023 and generates roughly half of its revenue from leased‑vehicle income.  Because those leases remain on GM Financial’s books, the company bears the residual‑value risk on the underlying fleet (the 2023 residual‑value estimate was $22.7 billion for 960 k units).  \n\nTesla, by contrast, sells most of its guaranteed‑resale‑value contracts for cash up‑front; the 10‑K notes that lease‑receivable tables “do not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale‑value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront.”  Consequently Tesla’s exposure to residual‑value fluctuations is far lower than GM’s, even though it also offers lease products.",

The original answer highlights a $0.9 billion gain on lease terminations in 2023, which the LLM omits, representing a minor gap in completeness.

(1) The Starbucks inventory reserve is reported as $58 million, but the ground truth value used in the correct combined total of $2,349 million implies Starbucks' reserve should be significantly higher—specifically, if Tesla's reserve is $1,769 million, then Starbucks' must be $580 million ($2,349M - $1,769M), not $58 million. Thus, Starbucks' value is off by a factor of 10. (2) The calculation itself ($58M + $1,769M = $1,827M) is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect input data. (3) The reasoning framework is sound—LLM correctly identifies the need to retrieve inventory reserves for two companies at specified dates and sum them—but fails in data retrieval or interpretation for Starbucks. (4) Tesla’s figure of $1,769 million aligns with the ground truth component, supporting partial accuracy. (5) The term 'inventory-and-warranty reserves' is used for Tesla, which may reflect actual reporting terminology, but the question specifically asks for 'inventory reserves'; if warranty reserves are included in this figure, it could introduce a definitional mismatch, though this cannot be verified without source documents. Overall, the answer is partially correct in structure and one data point, but critically flawed in the Starbucks value, leading to an incorrect total.

      "question": "How much greater is NextEra Energy's (NEE) total noncurrent derivative asset position compared to Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative asset value as a percentage of their combined total, and what does this suggest about their relative exposure to long-term derivative instruments?",
      "original_answer": "NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative asset position of $1,790 million is significantly greater than Duke Energy's $116 million. Together, their combined noncurrent derivative assets total $1,906 million. NEE's position accounts for approximately 93.9% of the combined total, indicating that NEE has a substantially larger long-term exposure to derivative instruments compared to Duke Energy.",
      "llm_answer": "NextEra Energy reported non‑current derivative assets of **$1,790 million**, while Duke Energy’s non‑current derivative assets were **$124 million**. The difference ( $1,666 million ) represents about **87 % of their combined non‑current derivative position** ( $1,914 million ). This indicates that NextEra’s balance sheet is far more weighted toward long‑term derivative contracts, suggesting a much larger exposure to long‑dated hedging and market‑risk positions than Duke Energy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a key factual error in Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative asset value, reporting $124 million instead of the correct $116 million from the ground truth. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $1,914 million (should be $1,906 million) and an inaccurate percentage calculation: 87% (difference as share of combined total) is presented, but the correct value is approximately 93.9% for NEE's share of the combined total. The question asks how much greater NEE's position is compared to Duke's as a percentage of their combined total — this requires computing NEE's share (1,790 / 1,906 ≈ 93.9%), not the difference as a percentage of the sum. The LLM instead calculates (1,790 - 124) / (1,790 + 124) = ~87%, which misinterprets the required comparison. (2) Number verification: NEE’s $1,790 million is correct; Duke’s value should be $116M, not $124M; combined total should be $1,906M, not $1,914M; correct percentage for NEE’s share is ~93.9%, not 87%. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies both companies and the relevant metric (noncurrent derivative assets), and attempts the comparative analysis. However, it fails in the correct synthesis of the quantitative relationship asked — it computes the wrong percentage (difference over total) rather than NEE’s proportion of the combined total. (4) Despite the incorrect calculation and input data, the qualitative conclusion about NEE having greater exposure is reasonable and contextually sound, and the answer addresses both parts of the question. Hence, partial credit is given: correctness penalized heavily due to numerical inaccuracies and flawed calculation, but qualitative and contextual scores remain moderate to high due to proper framing and logical interpretation.",

      "original_answer": "The 1.1% decline in prepaid subscribers reported by Company T directly contributed to the $169 million decrease in access costs for Company VZ in 2024. This causal relationship arises because a reduction in prepaid subscribers leads to lower usage and fewer access points needed, which in turn reduces the associated access costs for network providers like VZ. This is explicitly stated in VZ's 10-K, which attributes part of its cost of services decrease to a drop in prepaid subscribers.",
      "llm_answer": "AT&T’s prepaid base fell 1.1% in 2024 (19,023 k vs. 19,236 k in 2023). That drop lowered the amount of prepaid traffic Verizon had to carry, and Verizon cites “decreases in prepaid subscribers” as a primary driver of the $169 million reduction in its 2024 access‑cost expense.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: the 1.1% decline in prepaid subscribers for AT&T (Company T) is accurately reflected in the subscriber figures (19,023k in 2024 vs. 19,236k in 2023), and the $169 million decrease in access costs for Verizon (Company VZ) is correctly stated. The calculation of the percentage decline is approximately correct (1 - 19,023/19,236 ≈ 1.1%), supporting the reported figure. (2) The answer addresses the causal relationship between AT&T's subscriber decline and Verizon's cost reduction, which is the core of the multi-hop reasoning. It correctly identifies that lower prepaid traffic from AT&T reduced the access burden on Verizon’s network, leading to lower access costs. (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound and consistent with the original answer, citing Verizon’s own attribution of cost savings to the drop in prepaid subscribers. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that this relationship is 'direct' or that it is 'explicitly stated in VZ's 10-K,' which slightly weakens the strength of the causal claim compared to the original. However, the essence of the reasoning is preserved. (4) All entities—AT&T (T), Verizon (VZ), prepaid subscribers, access costs, and the year 2024—are correctly identified and contextualized.

The calculation of the difference is mathematically accurate: (-187) - (-49) = -138 million, which the model correctly interprets as GILD's figure being $138 million more negative. 2) Quantitatively, all numbers and the calculation are correct. The model accounts for the negative values, which is critical, and computes the difference accurately. Format variations (parentheses for negatives) are standard in financial statements and acceptable. 3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (DHR and GILD), identifies the correct metric and year, and performs a valid comparison. The only minor shortcoming is that it frames the difference as 'more negative' rather than stating the absolute difference in magnitude as $138 million, which is how the ground truth presents it.

(1) Quantitatively: Microsoft's increase is stated as 'about $1.0 billion' or $1,000 million, while the ground truth is $1,043 million. This is a reasonable approximation but slightly underreports the exact increase. Qualcomm's increase is correctly reported as $55 million. The combined increase is given as 'about $1.055 billion' ($1,055 million), whereas the ground truth is $1,048 million. The $7 million difference arises from rounding Microsoft's increase down to $1.0 billion. (2) Calculations: The individual year-over-year increases are correctly derived from the stated values, and the sum is arithmetically correct based on the approximated inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies both companies, extracts the relevant metric (ending unrecognized tax benefits) for both 2021 and 2022, computes the changes, sums them, and correctly identifies Microsoft as the larger contributor—fulfilling the multi-hop requirement across entities and years. (4) Semantically, the answer matches the ground truth: it addresses both parts of the question (total increase and which company contributed more), uses correct entities and time periods, and draws the right conclusion.

This contradicts the ground truth, which implies both companies contributed to the $132 million total. Additionally, the LLM states SO’s depreciation and amortization expense is $1,459 million, but the correct value from the ground truth is $1,608 million. NEE’s depreciation and amortization is reported as undisclosed by the LLM, but the ground truth lists it as $2,827 million—indicating the LLM failed to locate or report this data. (2) Calculation-wise, the LLM does not attempt to compute the percentage comparisons provided in the original answer (2.7% for NEE, 3.5% for SO), nor does it correctly sum the allowance amounts. The $189 million figure for SO alone exceeds the combined $132 million in the ground truth, indicating a critical numeric discrepancy. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify and extract the allowance for NEE, incorrectly assumes it is $0 due to absence of an identical line item, and misses the necessary synthesis between the two companies’ data.

According to the ground truth, Disney's 2023 income tax expense was $1,379 million (correctly stated as $1.379 billion), but AT&T's 2023 tax expense is reported as $4.225 billion, which does not align with the ground truth combined total of $5,604 million. If Disney’s was $1,379 million, then AT&T’s must have been $4,225 million ($5,604 - $1,379), so the $4.225 billion figure is numerically consistent. However, Disney’s 2022 tax expense is stated as $1.718 billion in the LLM answer, whereas the ground truth reports $1,732 million ($1.732 billion), introducing a small but notable discrepancy. (2) The combined tax expense is correctly calculated as approximately $5.6 billion, which matches the ground truth of $5,604 million. The difference compared to Disney’s 2022 expense is stated as $3.9 billion, which would imply a subtraction of $5,600 - $1,718 = $3,882 million — close to $3.9 billion. However, using ground truth values: $5,604 - $1,732 = $3,872 million, so $3.9 billion is a reasonable rounding. The main issue is the incorrect reporting of Disney’s 2022 tax expense — $1.718B vs. $1.732B — which affects precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies the need to sum Disney 2023 and AT&T 2023 tax expenses and compare that total to Disney’s 2022 expense. Entity identification (DIS, T, years, metric) is accurate. (4) Despite correct structure and logic, the answer loses points on quantitative accuracy due to the incorrect value for Disney’s 2022 tax expense and slight misrepresentation in magnitude (though within ~1%). The overall correctness score is reduced because financial precision is critical in such comparisons, and even small deviations matter in regulatory contexts like 10-K filings.",

      "original_answer": "DHR explicitly stated that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies in 2023 negatively impacted its operating profits when translating foreign operations into U.S. dollars, with particular exposure due to higher European sales than expenses. In contrast, GILD used estimates of future operating profits as a key input in valuing intangible assets, including assumptions about revenues, market share, and currency-neutral financial performance.

Contrary to the ground truth, it claims Danaher (DHR) had a '$215 million foreign-currency translation gain' in 2023 that 'helped offset the decline' in operating results. However, the ground truth states that the strengthening of the U.S. dollar negatively impacted DHR's operating profits due to higher European sales than expenses — meaning currency movements hurt, not helped, DHR. A gain would imply favorable movement, but the reality was adverse. This misrepresents the direction and impact of currency effects. (2) The $215 million figure is incorrect or misattributed — the ground truth does not mention any specific dollar amount for DHR's currency impact, only the qualitative effect. Thus, the quantitative claim is unsupported and likely false. GILD's side is partially correct: it does use estimated operating profits in intangible asset valuations via a probability-weighted income approach, and no specific dollar estimate is disclosed. However, the LLM incorrectly concludes that GILD 'explicitly builds projected operating-profit assumptions (and thus currency risk)' into models, while the ground truth emphasizes GILD assumes currency-neutral performance, meaning it does not adjust for currency risk. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the comparison between DHR’s actual negative currency impact and GILD’s omission of currency risk in forecasts is completely reversed in the LLM answer. Instead of revealing a gap between real exposure and assumed stability, the LLM falsely suggests DHR had minor positive impact and GILD actively incorporates currency risk — the opposite of the truth. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses both companies, the right documents (10-Ks), and the general topic of currency in forecasting. However, due to fundamental errors in directionality, magnitude, and interpretation of both companies’ disclosures, the overall correctness is very low. The conclusion about 'greater role of exchange-rate considerations in biotech firms' is unsupported and incorrect based on the evidence.",

      "original_answer": "AMT's lease structure, which includes fixed escalation clauses, financial penalties for early termination, and minimal residual value risk due to multi-tenancy and long-term site usability, reduces financial risk from tenant lease performance. In contrast, SPG faces higher financial risk because its retail tenants are vulnerable to reduced consumer foot traffic from safety concerns, e-commerce competition, and public health crises, all of which could directly impact SPG's occupancy levels, lease rates, and overage rent collection.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower’s leases are long‑term (5‑10 years) contracts that are typically non‑cancellable, contain automatic rent escalations and penalties for early termination, and are spread across many tenants on each tower site.  This diversified, “pay‑the‑rent” structure limits the impact of any single tenant’s performance and gives the company a low‑risk, residual‑value cushion.  \n\nSimon Property Group, by contrast, relies heavily on a few anchor retailers and collects a large portion of its rent as a sales‑percentage overage; its leases are more subject to modifications, concessions and re‑tenanting when an anchor files for bankruptcy or closes stores.  Consequently, SPG’s cash‑flow and occupancy are far more sensitive to the creditworthiness and sales performance of individual tenants, creating a higher financial risk from tenant lease performance.",

(1) All key factual elements are correct: AMT's lease structure includes long-term, non-cancellable leases with escalations and penalties, diversified tenancy reducing single-tenant risk, and low residual value risk. SPG's reliance on anchor tenants, overage rent based on sales performance, and vulnerability to tenant bankruptcies and closures are accurately described. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., exact lease lengths, percentages, dollar amounts) in the original answer, so the LLM's mention of '5-10 years' is a reasonable inference and does not contradict the ground truth; no calculation errors exist. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in lease structure (fixed vs. variable rent, termination terms) and tenant dependency (diversified vs. anchor-dependent) to conclude that AMT has lower financial risk from lease performance than SPG. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—while the LLM adds slightly more detail (e.g., 'pay-the-rent' structure, 're-tenanting'), it does not introduce inaccuracies. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the original emphasizes external risks (e-commerce, safety concerns, public health), which the LLM implies but does not explicitly mention.

In contrast, Honeywell (HON) explicitly excludes repositioning and other charges, along with several other items, from its segment profit measurement.

      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar (CAT) – for 2021 the company says that **all restructuring costs are taken out of segment profit**. The costs that are excluded are the items shown in the restructuring‑cost table: employee‑separation costs ($92 m), contract‑termination costs ($2 m), long‑lived‑asset impairments (including the gain on the facility sale, –$63 m) and other restructuring items ($59 m) for a total of $90 m (see CAT 2021 restructuring‑cost table)【page_137】.  \n\nHoneywell (HON) – its segment‑profit definition expressly **excludes “repositioning and other charges,”** which is the line where Honeywell records restructuring‑related expenses, so restructuring costs are not included in segment profit either (see Honeywell Note 22)【page_115】.  \n\nThus, while both companies keep restructuring costs out of segment profit, Caterpillar explicitly excludes **all** such costs in 2021 and lists the specific components, whereas Honeywell’s general approach simply omits them under the broader “repositioning and other charges” exclusion.",

However, the specific costs excluded by CAT differ between the LLM answer and the ground truth. The LLM lists employee-separation costs, contract-termination costs, long-lived-asset impairments, and other restructuring items — which may be accurate based on the filing — but this contradicts the ground truth, which states that CAT excluded costs related to accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, project management, equipment relocation, and building demolition. These are different categories of costs, and there is no clear overlap or equivalence. Thus, the specific cost items are factually inconsistent with the ground truth. (2) The LLM introduces specific dollar amounts ($92M, $2M, –$63M, $59M, total $90M) and references a 'restructuring-cost table' on page 137. These numbers are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified against it; more importantly, the total does not align logically (92 + 2 – 63 + 59 = $90M is mathematically correct, but the inclusion of a gain as a negative cost may misrepresent the nature of the item). Since the ground truth does not mention any dollar figures, the introduction of unverified quantitative data reduces factual accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that both companies exclude restructuring costs from segment profit but do so under different frameworks — CAT with a full exclusion policy in 2021, HON via a broader exclusion category. This matches the comparative logic in the ground truth.

At PEP, effective net pricing helped offset significant declines in operating profit caused by the Quaker Recall and higher commodity costs, although it was insufficient to prevent an overall 19% decline in operating profit for the QFNA segment.

The $4.1 billion figure attributed to net pricing within a $939 million gain appears inconsistent at first glance, but this likely reflects a misstatement—the $4.1B cannot exceed the total $939M gain. This is a clear quantitative error. However, the intended meaning—that net pricing was a major contributor in constant currency—is consistent with the ground truth. (2) The margin change (0.1 percentage point) is accurate (15.8% to 15.9%). The 19% decline in PEP’s QFNA operating profit is correctly cited. The dollar amounts ($4.1B vs $939M) are contradictory and factually incorrect—$4.1B cannot be part of a $939M increase. This is a significant numerical inconsistency. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts MDLZ’s margin expansion (positive, net pricing as driver) with PEP’s defensive use of pricing to cushion losses. It synthesizes across both companies and correctly interprets the differing roles of net pricing. (4) Despite the dollar amount error, the overall qualitative and comparative analysis is accurate and insightful.

However, it reports BAC's 2024 Net Interest Yield as 2.20%, which is incorrect — the ground truth is 2.30%. Additionally, the LLM states BAC's 2023 yield was 2.17%, but the correct value is 2.73%, a significant discrepancy. The claim that BAC's yield was 'virtually unchanged' is therefore factually wrong, as the ground truth shows a clear decline from 2.73% to 2.30%. (2) The calculation of AXP's year-over-year change (+0.4 percentage points) is accurate (12.8% - 12.4% = 0.4%). However, BAC's change should be -0.43 percentage points (2.73% to 2.30%), not 'virtually unchanged' as implied. The LLM's numbers and interpretation for BAC are both quantitatively and logically flawed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model attempts to compare AXP and BAC's credit business performance through net interest yield trends.

The calculated difference is therefore $1,878 million, not $1.5 billion (~$1,516 million), making the quantitative discrepancy substantial. (2) The calculation of the gap is incorrect due to wrong input values. The LLM reports a difference of about $1.5 billion, which is off by $362 million from the correct $1,878 million. Additionally, DUK's derivative asset figure is inflated in the LLM answer—$274 million vs. the true $57 million (which may stem from misattribution to Progress Energy, a subsidiary).

However, it incorrectly states that SO has 'no comparable prepaid pension-benefit balance' and fails to mention SO's $16 million regulatory asset for prepaid pension and other postretirement benefits. This omission is significant because the ground truth explicitly notes this amount, and it affects the interpretation of SO's pension funding strategy. 2) Quantitatively, the NEE figure is accurate in both value and year (2024). The SO value is misrepresented—not due to a wrong number, but due to omission. The LLM claims 'no prepaid pension line appears,' but the ground truth indicates the amount is included within a regulatory asset, which may not be labeled identically but still exists in the financial structure. 3) The reasoning is partially sound: the conclusion that NEE is building a reserve is supported. However, the contrast with SO is overstated—SO does have a small prepaid/regulatory asset position ($16M), suggesting some level of ongoing amortization or recovery mechanism, not absence of prepayment. The LLM misses the nuance that SO’s position reflects continued management of legacy liabilities via regulatory accounting, which is central to the original answer. 4) Despite missing this key detail, the LLM addresses the core comparison and draws a reasonable, though incomplete, inference about funding strategies.

SPG had $209.9 million in payment guarantees associated with joint venture mortgage debt, in addition to several foreign currency-denominated loans, including 1.2 billion EUR (approximately $1.3 billion USD at the time), 46.7 billion JPY, and 517.6 million MXN. Combining AMT's $43.5 billion with SPG's identified foreign currency exposure of approximately $1.3 billion EUR + $46.7 billion JPY (approximately $420 million USD) + $517.6 million MXN (approximately $26 million USD) + $209.9 million in guarantees, the total indebtedness exceeds $45.455 billion.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in both quantitative and entity-specific details. It incorrectly states SPG's total indebtedness as $30.5 billion, which is entirely false according to the ground truth—SPG had only $209.9 million in payment guarantees and foreign currency loans totaling approximately $1.77 billion USD (1.2B EUR ≈ $1.3B, 46.7B JPY ≈ $420M, 517.6M MXN ≈ $26M). There is no mention of a $30.5B total in the ground truth, suggesting the model fabricated or misread SPG’s debt. The combined total of $74.0 billion is therefore grossly inflated and incorrect; the correct total exceeds $45.455 billion, not $74B. (2) AMT’s $43.5B is correctly stated, but SPG’s debt components are misrepresented: the LLM claims SPG has $30.5B in total debt and downplays foreign currency exposure as merely 'reported in foreign-currency equivalents' while asserting underlying borrowings are dollar-denominated—this contradicts the ground truth, which explicitly identifies significant EUR, JPY, and MXN-denominated loans. The conversion of JPY and MXN amounts is omitted or incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not synthesize SPG’s actual foreign-denominated liabilities into a total exposure, nor does it accurately contrast AMT’s acquisition-driven, dollar-heavy debt (with some international elements) with SPG’s regionally fragmented, internationally exposed structure. Instead, it reverses the logic by portraying AMT as more euro-linked and internationally financed, which overstates the case and misrepresents the ground truth. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the structure of the answer addresses both parts of the question (total debt and debt structure comparison), and the discussion of variable-rate components and financing strategies shows understanding of financial concepts. However, due to severe factual inaccuracies in numbers and entity-specific data, the qualitative and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. The correctness score is 2 because the answer is mostly wrong on core facts, despite correct mention of AMT’s $43.5B and some relevant financial terminology.",

All numbers match the ground truth, with only formatting differences (billion vs million) that are semantically equivalent. (2) Calculations are accurate: the difference between PM and CL is correctly computed (~$7.98 billion), and year-over-year changes are correctly identified. The LLM even adds a synthesized comparison (PMI’s increase was $3.165 billion larger than CL’s change), which, while not requested, is logically sound (since CL decreased by $33M and PM increased by $3,132M, the net directional difference is $3,165M). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly identifies and contrasts two companies (CL and PM), extracts net intangible assets for two years (2022 and 2023), computes changes over time, and compares trends. Entities (Colgate-Palmolive, Philip Morris International), metrics (net other intangible assets), and years (2022–2023) are all accurate. (4) The only minor issue is that the original answer emphasizes CL’s decline versus PM’s significant increase in a comparative narrative, while the LLM adds an extra inference about the $3.165 billion 'larger' increase, which, while mathematically correct, slightly extends beyond the direct comparison asked. However, this does not detract from correctness. All core requirements are met with high precision. Thus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, and a perfect 10 for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

The conclusion that AT&T experienced the larger year-over-year change is correct. However, the LLM misunderstood the first part of the question — 'combined difference in Total Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities' — interpreting it as the cross-company difference in absolute values for 2023 ($35,852M - $20,671M = $15,181M), whereas the ground truth interprets it as the combined magnitude of the two companies' year-over-year changes: |+399| + |–6,792| = $7,191M.

However, the LLM states that both companies use a '12-month average commodity prices' based on the 'unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-month price for each of the twelve months preceding year-end', which contradicts the ground truth. The original answer specifies that both companies use the 'first-day-of-the-month average prices'—meaning the price on the first day of each month in the reporting year, not an average over the prior 12 months. This is a key distinction in methodology and timing. (2) While the general idea of price variability affecting cash flow estimates is correctly conveyed, the specific pricing methodology is misrepresented.

However, it incorrectly states that GILD's acquisition of intangible assets generated a net deferred tax liability of $513 million, which is not supported by the ground truth. The original answer does not mention a $513 million figure; instead, it details specific intangible assets ($845M Hepcludex, $1.19B IPR&D, $226M non-deductible goodwill) but does not provide a total net deferred tax liability from the MYR acquisition. This introduces a significant factual error. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: DHR numbers are accurate (within rounding), but the $513M figure for GILD is unsupported and likely incorrect. No calculation error in the $766M difference, but the GILD number lacks verification. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to compare DHR's deferred tax trend with GILD's tax treatment of acquired intangibles, but fails to accurately represent GILD's disclosures. It oversimplifies and invents a specific aggregate liability figure not present in the ground truth, missing the nuance about amortization, non-deductible goodwill, and the basis differences.

These numbers match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $3,510.8 million). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—values, percentages, and timeframes are all correct and consistent with the original answer. The 35% growth is accurately derived from the reported figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model contrasts AMT’s strong FFO performance with SPG’s strategic reliance on FFO despite operational challenges. However, there is a minor error: the LLM incorrectly refers to 'AT&T’s tower business' instead of 'American Tower Corporation (AMT)', which is a distinct company from AT&T. This is a notable entity confusion but does not undermine the overall financial comparison. (4) Despite this slip, the answer remains highly accurate in substance, fully addresses the contrast implied in the question, and maintains strong contextual relevance by linking pandemic impacts to revenue recognition and performance metrics. The core synthesis across companies and metrics is correct, warranting a high score with a slight deduction for the entity misstatement.",

While it correctly identifies the $221 million goodwill carrying value for the Filorga reporting unit (CL) as of December 31, 2023, it incorrectly claims that the Healthcare reporting unit (PM) goodwill amount is not disclosed. The ground truth confirms that the Healthcare reporting unit had a goodwill carrying value of $665 million, which the LLM confuses with an impairment charge. The PM 10-K does provide the carrying value, and the $665 million impairment was applied to that existing carrying value, implying the value was at least $665 million pre-impairment. However, in many cases, particularly when a full impairment is recorded, the carrying value before impairment equals the impairment amount, meaning the post-impairment carrying value would be zero. But the original answer treats $665 million as the carrying value, not the impairment loss. The LLM misinterprets the nature of the $665 million figure, leading to an incorrect conclusion that the data is unavailable. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM fails to report the correct combined value of $886 million and incorrectly assesses data availability. The individual numbers ($221M and $665M) are mentioned but misclassified in context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model should have recognized that the $665 million impairment charge for the Healthcare unit corresponds to its carrying value, especially if fully impaired, and that this value is usable for the sum. The synthesis across CL and PM filings is required and possible, but the LLM erroneously concludes it cannot be done. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right documents and units, but the reasoning and conclusion are fundamentally incorrect, resulting in a very low correctness score.",

In contrast, TGT reports Adjusted EPS as a non-GAAP metric that excludes certain items but does not specify any similar adjustment related to extreme pricing in Argentina or disclose a comparable inflation-driven pricing exclusion. This reveals that MDLZ takes a more granular and region-specific approach to Adjusted EPS adjustments, tailoring its non-GAAP exclusions to macroeconomic conditions, while TGT’s Adjusted EPS appears to follow a more general exclusionary framework without explicit mention of hyperinflationary market adjustments.",

However, it inaccurately states that Adjusted EPS was lowered by $0.12 due to adverse currency translation, whereas the ground truth specifies that the unfavorable currency translation effect was $0.32, partially offset by the $0.20 extreme-pricing adjustment. This misrepresents the magnitude of the currency impact and implies a net $0.12 reduction, which is not supported by the original data. (2) The quantitative error in the currency translation effect ($0.12 vs $0.32) affects the accuracy of the financial impact narrative, though the $0.20 pricing benefit is correct. No other numbers or dates are present, and the year (2024) is implied contextually but not explicitly mentioned—this is a minor omission.

      "question": "How does the differing dependence on occupancy rates between AMT and SPG influence their respective strategies for increasing revenue from existing real estate assets in 2022?",
      "original_answer": "AMT focuses on increasing occupancy of its communications real estate by leasing additional space on existing towers, anticipating growing demand driven by 4G densification and 5G deployments in the U.S. and advanced network technologies internationally. This strategy is expected to generate incremental returns by utilizing existing capacity or upgrading towers with modest investment. In contrast, SPG's retail real estate revenue depends heavily on occupancy rates, which were negatively impacted by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced consumer willingness to visit properties and increased reliance on e-commerce. SPG faces challenges in renewing leases or re-leasing available space on favorable terms due to deteriorating market conditions and tenant financial instability, making it more difficult to increase revenue from existing properties. Therefore, while AMT's strategy is positioned for growth through increased occupancy, SPG's strategy is constrained by external risks affecting occupancy and tenant viability.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower’s 2022 plan treats occupancy as a lever for incremental, high‑margin rent because most of its revenue comes from leasing additional antenna space on towers that already have capacity. The company therefore “increase[s] the occupancy of our existing communications real‑estate portfolio” and targets more tenants and equipment on each site to boost utilization and cash flow (​page 10​;​page 9​).  \n\nSimon Property Group, by contrast, derives a large share of its income from base rent and sales‑based over‑age rents that fall sharply when a mall’s occupancy drops, so its 2022 focus is on preserving or improving occupancy – re‑leasing vacant space, protecting anchor tenants and maintaining tenant sales – to sustain lease income (​page 12​;​page 14​).",

(1) There are no numeric values in the question or original answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that AMT leverages occupancy by adding tenants/equipment on existing towers with high incremental margins, citing growing demand from 4G/5G (implied in the source context), and notes AMT’s strategy of increasing utilization through existing capacity. This matches the original answer’s emphasis on leasing additional space and modest investments for returns. (3) For SPG, the LLM accurately describes its reliance on base and overage rents tied to mall occupancy, and frames SPG’s strategy around preserving occupancy, re-leasing space, and supporting tenant viability—consistent with the original answer’s focus on challenges from pandemic effects, e-commerce, and tenant instability. (4) The reasoning correctly synthesizes a multi-hop comparison: it contrasts AMT’s growth-oriented, capacity-efficient model with SPG’s defensive, occupancy-preservation approach, based on structural differences in their real estate types (communications vs. retail). The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention external risks like the ongoing impact of the pandemic or e-commerce as constraining SPG’s strategy, which slightly reduces qualitative completeness. However, the implication is present in the focus on re-leasing and tenant protection. Wording differs but semantic meaning and factual content are equivalent.

This shows that while both companies report prepaid pension costs, Southern Company explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from these figures, reflecting a more segmented approach to regulatory asset reporting post-acquisition. As a result, the two companies apply different reporting treatments for regulatory components tied to prepaid pension benefit costs, with SO maintaining a more detailed exclusion of regulatory assets.",

The ground truth states that NextEra Energy (NEE) includes unrecognized amounts in prepaid pension benefit costs within regulatory assets/liabilities, but does not specify a $221 million unrecognized loss or break down AOCI components as claimed. These specific numbers ($221M, $2M, $73M) are not present in the original answer and are therefore incorrect. For Southern Company (SO), the original answer specifies that $24 million and $32 million were excluded from prepaid pension costs due to regulatory assets related to Southern Company Gas' postretirement plans pre-acquisition. The LLM instead claims SO shows 'no prepaid pension benefit costs' and reports $23 million in other regulatory assets and a $(203) million net regulatory asset — none of which appear in the ground truth and contradict the original statement. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: none of the dollar amounts provided in the LLM answer match those in the ground truth. The only correct number indirectly referenced is a $24 million figure for SO in 2023, but it is misrepresented as $23 million and placed in an incorrect context. The $32 million for 2022 is omitted entirely. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model attempts to compare regulatory asset treatment between NEE and SO, but it fails to accurately represent the core distinction: NEE includes unrecognized amounts in regulatory assets, while SO explicitly excludes certain regulatory assets from prepaid pension costs post-acquisition. Instead, the LLM fabricates balance sheet positions and mischaracterizes SO’s reporting. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses regulatory asset reporting practices for pension costs at both companies, which is relevant.

      "original_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues for each production, which results in a more revenue-aligned expense pattern. In contrast, Netflix expenses participations and residuals in line with an accelerated amortization pattern, expecting more upfront viewing, with over 90% of a content asset amortized within four years.

The LLM also introduces Thermo Fisher’s income before taxes ($7,037 million), which was not in the original question or ground truth and is irrelevant.

How might analysts interpret the difference in debt valuation approaches between CL and PM in terms of financial reporting conservatism and interest expense recognition?",
      "original_answer": "Analysts may interpret CL's reporting, where the carrying value of long-term debt ($8,239 million) exceeds its fair value ($7,862 million), as indicative of debt issued at a premium or a decline in market interest rates, which increases the fair value of fixed-rate debt. This suggests CL's financial reporting reflects a more conservative approach by maintaining a higher carrying value on the balance sheet. In contrast, PM's fair value step-up adjustment for inventories ($146 million) and the $(107) million purchase price adjustment amortized into interest expense suggest that PM's debt was initially recorded at a discount post-acquisition, leading to higher interest expense recognition over time. This indicates PM's approach reflects the impact of acquisition accounting on interest costs, which may affect earnings volatility. Therefore, the difference in valuation approaches reflects contrasting capital structure strategies and reporting conservatism, with CL showing a market-based valuation decline and PM experiencing acquisition-driven expense increases.",

The numbers match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., $107 million). (2) However, the LLM mischaracterizes the nature of the adjustments for Philip Morris. The ground truth specifies a $146 million fair value step-up adjustment for inventories (not debt) and a $(107) million purchase price adjustment amortized as interest expense—likely related to debt from acquisition accounting. The LLM incorrectly implies the $107 million adjustment is a 'purchase-price adjustment' applied directly to debt valuation and conflates it with inventory step-up, which it omits entirely. This is a significant qualitative error in financial reasoning. (3) The multi-hop synthesis is partially sound: the model correctly infers that Colgate’s higher carrying value implies conservative reporting. However, it misinterprets PM’s approach by failing to distinguish between inventory step-up (a working capital adjustment) and debt-related amortization, leading to an inaccurate conclusion about 'front-loading' interest expense due to debt valuation. The ground truth emphasizes acquisition accounting effects on interest expense, not balance sheet debt valuation. (4) Despite this, the LLM captures the core contrast in reporting strategies—Colgate’s conservative liability presentation vs. PM’s higher interest expense recognition—and remains contextually relevant.

The net interest yield for American Express is correctly stated as 10.8%, and Bank of America's yield is accurately given as 1.95%. The difference of 8.85 percentage points (or 885 bps) is correctly calculated. The adjusted net interest income for American Express is reported as $3.080 billion, which is equivalent to $3,080 million in the original answer—this is a valid format variation and semantically identical. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all percentages and dollar amounts are correct, and the comparison (10.8% - 1.95% = 8.85%) is accurate. The use of 'bps' (basis points) adds precision and is consistent with financial reporting norms. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data from two different companies (American Express and Bank of America), extracts the correct metric (Net Interest Yield) on the appropriate basis (fully taxable-equivalent for BofA), and links the yield to the underlying income figure for American Express.

      "original_answer": "Duke Energy Corporation paid $202 million and NextEra Energy, Inc. paid $1,034 million in cash for interest, net of amount capitalized, in 2023. Combined, they paid $1,236 million. Duke's capital expenditures were $961 million, while NextEra's were $9,302 million, making their combined capital expenditures $10,263 million.

      "question": "How does the allocation of production overhead in capitalized content costs differ between Disney and Netflix, based on their amortization strategies and content monetization models?",
      "original_answer": "Disney allocates production overhead to capitalized content costs for produced films and television content, and amortizes these costs based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues) for content monetized individually, such as theatrical films or titles sold to third parties. For group-monetized content (e.g., content used on DTC services or Linear Networks), Disney amortizes the costs based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line pattern. In contrast, Netflix also capitalizes production overhead for produced content and amortizes it over the shorter of the contractual window or estimated period of use (typically up to ten years), using an accelerated basis driven by expected viewing patterns. Netflix's amortization is not tied to revenue ratios but rather to viewing behavior, with over 90% of a title's cost typically amortized within four years. This reflects a difference in monetization focus: Disney aligns amortization with revenue realization, while Netflix aligns it with consumption patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney capitalizes production‑overhead (and capitalized interest) together with all direct production costs, then splits the assets into **individual** titles (amortized by the ratio of current period revenue to estimated “ultimate” revenue) or **group** titles (amortized on a projected‑usage basis that may be straight‑line or accelerated). Netflix also capitalizes production‑overhead on its produced content, but it does not separate titles; instead it amortizes both licensed and produced assets on an **accelerated, usage‑based schedule** over the shorter of the contractual window or ten years (typically 90 % within four years), reflecting its subscription‑based, group‑monetization model. Thus Disney’s overhead is allocated to assets that are amortized either by revenue‑share or usage, whereas Netflix’s overhead is allocated to assets that are amortized uniformly on an accelerated, usage‑driven basis.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the same core information as the ground truth with only minor differences in emphasis. (1) All key facts are correct: Disney allocates production overhead to capitalized content and uses two amortization methods—revenue-based (ratio of current to ultimate revenues) for individually monetized content and usage-based (projected usage, straight-line or accelerated) for group-monetized content. Netflix capitalizes overhead and amortizes on an accelerated, usage-based schedule over the shorter of contractual term or ten years, with 90% amortized within four years, not tied to revenue. (2) Quantitatively, the '90%' figure is correctly stated and matches the original answer; no other numbers or dates are in dispute. Format and precision are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly contrasting Disney’s dual-track amortization (by revenue or usage depending on monetization model) with Netflix’s uniform accelerated, usage-driven approach tied to viewing behavior. The synthesis across companies and models is logical and complete. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly state that Netflix’s amortization is driven by *expected viewing patterns* or that Disney’s revenue-based method directly aligns with *revenue realization*, which adds slight nuance to the qualitative explanation. However, the core contrast—Disney uses revenue or usage, Netflix uses uniform accelerated usage—is preserved. Wording differences do not affect semantic equivalence.

Only Amgen’s 'Other income (expense), net' of $506 million is correct. (2) Calculations are therefore severely flawed: the LLM computes a combined total of $1.01 billion (sum of $506M + $506M), but the correct sum is $518 million ($506M + $12M). The comparison to Amgen’s tax provision is also wrong—the LLM claims the combined total is half of the tax provision, but in reality, $518 million is slightly less than $519 million (i.e., nearly equal, not half). (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize data across Amgen and Thermo Fisher filings. It appears to have duplicated Amgen’s figure for Thermo Fisher, indicating a failure in entity-metric alignment. (4) Despite these serious quantitative and reasoning flaws, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, metric, and year, and attempts the correct type of comparison—hence a moderate contextual relevance score.

However, the combined value is stated as $9.8 billion, whereas the correct total is $3,863 million (~$3.86 billion), not $9.8 billion. The total fair value of debt securities is mostly accurate: $226.9 billion for Citi (vs $226,876 million) and $21.3 billion for PayPal (vs $21,292 million), so the combined $248 billion is approximately correct. However, the percentage is calculated as ≈4%, but the correct value is $3,863M / $248,168M = 1.56%. The LLM incorrectly computes this, likely due to using an inflated numerator. (2) Number verification: C's 'after 5 but within 10 years' = $526M (truth) vs $6.5B (LLM) — incorrect. PYPL = $3,337M (truth) vs $3.34B (LLM) — correct. Combined numerator = $3,863M (truth) vs $9.8B (LLM) — incorrect. Total fair value = $248,168M (truth) vs ~$248B (LLM) — acceptable. Percentage = 1.56% (truth) vs ≈4% (LLM) — incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies the correct companies (C and PYPL), the correct time bucket ('after 5 but within 10 years'), and the correct metric (fair value of debt securities). It attempts to sum both the numerator and denominator across companies and compute a percentage, showing correct high-level reasoning structure. However, due to the grossly incorrect value for Citi's mid-term debt securities, the synthesis fails. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major numerical inaccuracies and incorrect final percentage. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) due to wrong values and miscalculation. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the reasoning framework and entity identification are correct. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) as the answer addresses the right question structure and context.",

      "original_answer": "Investors should evaluate Duke Energy's $698 million in noncurrent regulatory liabilities with caution due to Southern Company Gas' detailed disclosures about the uncertainty of cost recovery in Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. Southern Company Gas highlights that regulatory recovery is not guaranteed and depends on decisions by the Commissions, which may disallow certain costs or require refunds. This uncertainty affects how regulatory liabilities are ultimately settled and could impact future rate-setting decisions that influence Duke Energy's ability to recover similar costs in those states.",
      "llm_answer": "Investors should view Duke Energy’s $698 million of non‑current regulatory liabilities (the “regulatory liability” line on Duke Energy Florida’s balance sheet) as a contingent amount that may be reduced—or even refunded—if the state commissions in Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia do not approve full cost recovery. Southern Company Gas explicitly warns that its regulated subsidiaries face “risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of the costs of providing utility service” and that such judgments are highly subjective (see Southern Company Gas 10‑K, page 183). Therefore, investors should closely monitor the pending rate‑case proceedings, assess the probability of recovery versus a future rate reduction or refund, and treat the $698 million liability as a material regulatory‑risk exposure rather than a guaranteed obligation.",

The dollar amount is correct and properly contextualized. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $698 million figure is correctly stated, and no calculations are required beyond accurate representation of the value. Format variation (e.g., $698 million vs $698,000,000) is acceptable and handled appropriately. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across Duke Energy (liability amount) and Southern Company Gas (regulatory risk disclosures), drawing a logical inference about contingent liability treatment based on precedent regulatory uncertainty in overlapping jurisdictions. It correctly cites Southern Company Gas’ 10-K page 183 (plausible source location) and interprets the risk of disallowed cost recovery as a factor affecting Duke Energy’s liability treatment. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer emphasizes Duke Energy’s exposure due to *similar* regulatory environments, while the LLM slightly overreaches by implying Duke Energy Florida’s liability is directly subject to GA, TN, VA commissions—though the core logic of cross-entity regulatory precedent remains valid. (4) Scores reflect near-perfect factual alignment, strong reasoning, and high relevance. The answer adds value by suggesting investor actions (monitor rate cases, assess recovery probability), which are consistent with but not explicitly in the ground truth.

T amortizes its wireless licenses over a weighted-average life of 21.6 years, having accumulated $696 million in amortization by 2024, which suggests a more conservative approach to asset value retention. In contrast, VZ reports its wireless licenses at nearly full value with no accumulated amortization disclosed, indicating a potentially indefinite life or a different accounting policy, which may signal stronger long-term value retention for its licenses.",

The ground truth states that T's wireless licenses are valued at $2,999 million ($2.999 billion), but the LLM reports $125.1 billion—over 40 times higher. VZ's value is close ($156.6 billion vs. $156.613 billion), but the combined total is severely inflated: $281.7 billion vs. the correct $159.612 billion. This renders the quantitative foundation of the answer incorrect. (2) The calculation of the combined value is mathematically consistent within the LLM’s own numbers but based on wrong inputs, so it fails verification against ground truth. (3) The reasoning about amortization practices is completely reversed: the ground truth states that T *does* amortize (with $696M accumulated amortization over 21.6 years), while VZ reports *no* accumulated amortization, suggesting indefinite life. The LLM incorrectly claims the opposite—that AT&T does *not* amortize and Verizon *does*. This inversion undermines the qualitative analysis of long-term value retention. (4) Despite correct identification of companies (T and VZ) and the relevant concept (amortization policy reflecting value retention), the answer fails on core facts and multi-hop synthesis.

The LLM correctly identifies that DIS's method ties expenses to revenue patterns, whereas NFLX's ties them to amortization schedules based on viewing forecasts. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present.

The combined total is therefore $506M - $104M = $402 million, not $518 million. The LLM incorrectly reports Thermo Fisher’s figure as positive $12 million instead of negative $104 million, which is a significant error in both magnitude and direction.

      "original_answer": "AT&T (T) does not amortize its FCC wireless licenses and instead tests them annually for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach on an aggregate basis. However, AT&T does amortize its wireless licenses in Mexico over a 25-year average economic life. In contrast, Verizon (VZ) treats its wireless licenses as indefinite-lived intangible assets and also does not amortize them, testing them annually for impairment. The difference in amortization policy means that AT&T recognizes periodic depreciation expense for its Mexican licenses, which affects earnings, while Verizon does not record any amortization expense for its licenses. This results in differing financial impacts on asset valuation and income statements, with AT&T experiencing a gradual reduction in asset value over time for Mexican licenses, while Verizon’s wireless license values remain on the balance sheet unless impaired.",
      "llm_answer": "AT&T treats its U.S. FCC spectrum licenses as indefinite‑lived intangibles (no amortization, annual impairment test) but it **amortizes the wireless licenses it holds in Mexico over an estimated 25‑year remaining life**. Verizon, by contrast, classifies all of its wireless spectrum licenses as indefinite‑lived intangibles and **does not amortize any of them**, relying solely on annual impairment testing. Consequently, AT&T will recognize periodic amortization expense that gradually reduces the carrying amount of its Mexican licenses, whereas Verizon’s license balances remain unchanged on the balance sheet (unless an impairment is recorded), resulting in a higher reported asset value for Verizon’s spectrum.",

(1) It correctly identifies that AT&T does not amortize its U.S. FCC wireless licenses but amortizes its Mexican licenses over a 25-year life, while Verizon treats all its wireless licenses as indefinite-lived and does not amortize any. These entity-specific policies are accurately represented. (2) The quantitative detail—'25-year' amortization period for Mexican licenses—is correct and matches the original answer. No other numbers or calculations are involved, and all financial impacts are correctly described. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in amortization policy between two companies and correctly infers the financial statement implications—AT&T recognizes amortization expense and gradual asset reduction, while Verizon does not, leading to higher reported asset values unless impairment occurs. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing both amortization policy differences and their financial impact on asset valuation and income. Wording differs slightly (e.g., 'spectrum licenses' vs 'wireless licenses'), but terminology is standard and interchangeable in this context.

      "question": "How did the changes in programming and production costs for sports events in 2023 at CMCSA compare to the changes at DIS, considering the specific cost impacts of events like the FIFA World Cup and streaming platform expenditures?",
      "original_answer": "CMCSA experienced a decrease in programming and production costs in 2023, primarily due to the absence of major sports events like the Beijing Olympics, Super Bowl, and FIFA World Cup, which were broadcast in 2022, and reduced entertainment content costs, despite higher costs at Peacock and international sports programming, including the timing impact of the 2022 FIFA World Cup matches shifting to early 2023. In contrast, DIS saw a slight 1% increase in total programming and production costs in 2023, with Hulu's costs rising by $317 million (from $8,265M to $8,582M), partially offset by a decrease in Disney+ and other costs (from $5,694M to $5,499M). Thus, while CMCSA benefited from lower sports programming costs, DIS faced increased streaming content costs, particularly on Hulu.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Comcast’s (CMCSA) total programming‑and‑production costs fell year‑over‑year, but the company reported that “other domestic and international sports programming costs” rose because the 2022 FIFA World Cup costs were recognized in the first half of 2023 (page 47). By contrast, Disney (DIS) saw a modest 1 % increase in total programming‑and‑production expenses (from $13,959 m to $14,081 m) and explicitly attributed the rise to higher cricket‑programming costs for two ICC tournaments on Disney+ Hotstar (page 42).

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer captures the general trend correctly: CMCSA saw a decline in total programming and production costs in 2023, while DIS experienced a slight increase. However, there are significant quantitative inaccuracies. First, the LLM incorrectly states that DIS's total programming and production costs rose from $13,959M to $14,081M (a $122M increase), but the ground truth shows a more nuanced picture: Hulu's costs increased by $317M (from $8,265M to $8,582M), while Disney+ and other costs decreased (from $5,694M to $5,499M), resulting in a net 1% increase. The LLM's aggregate figures do not match the component data provided in the original answer, suggesting incorrect summation or sourcing. Additionally, the LLM attributes DIS's cost increase primarily to cricket programming on Disney+ Hotstar, which is not mentioned in the ground truth; instead, the original answer emphasizes Hulu's rising costs as the key driver. While the LLM correctly notes that CMCSA's overall costs decreased despite higher international sports costs due to the timing of the FIFA World Cup, it fails to mention the absence of major events like the Super Bowl and Beijing Olympics in 2023 as key reasons—information present in the original answer. The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing trends between CMCSA and DIS—but relies on incorrect or unsupported numerical aggregates and misattributes causal factors. Wording and structure are relevant and clear, but factual precision is compromised. Thus, the answer is partially correct with significant errors in numbers and reasoning details.",

In contrast, Tesla's Automotive Segment generates revenue through the design, development, manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles, along with automotive regulatory credits, services, and other activities such as used vehicle sales and Supercharging, as detailed in their 2023 10-K filing. These differences highlight distinct business models centered around the Automotive Segment.",
      "llm_answer": "- General Motors’ automotive segment is not just vehicle sales; a sizable share of its automotive‑related revenue comes from financing activities – e.g., GM Financial subvention income of $1.2 billion (interest subvention) and $1.5 billion (leased‑vehicle subvention) in 2023, and retail finance receivables of about $30 billion (see GM 10‑K p. 75‑73).  \n\n- Tesla’s automotive segment, by contrast, is reported as a single revenue line of $90.7 billion that is driven primarily by the design, manufacture, sales and leasing of electric vehicles, automotive regulatory‑credit sales and related services such as used‑vehicle sales, Supercharging and insurance (see Tesla 10‑K p. 93).  \n\nThus, GM’s automotive revenue is heavily supported by its financing and subvention business, whereas Tesla’s automotive revenue is focused almost entirely on vehicle sales and associated services/credits.",

These numbers are consistent with GM's 2023 10-K (pages 73–75), though the page reference order is reversed (75–73), which is a minor clerical issue but does not affect factual accuracy. (2) For Tesla, the LLM correctly reports a single automotive revenue line of $90.7 billion (accurate per Tesla’s 10-K, p.93) and accurately describes its sources: EV sales, leasing, regulatory credits, used vehicle sales, Supercharging, and insurance. The inclusion of insurance is slightly beyond the original answer but is factually correct and supported by Tesla’s filing.

The use of 'about 11%' is acceptable given rounding conventions. Altria's employee decline from 7,100 in 2020 to 6,000 in 2021 is accurately reported, including the approximate 15% decline (actual: ~15.49%), and the absence of a rebound in 2022 is correctly noted. (2) All numeric values—employee counts, years, and calculated percentages—are factually correct and consistent with the ground truth. The calculation (31,000 ÷ 273,000) × 100 ≈ 11.35% is correctly approximated as 'about 11%', which is reasonable for narrative reporting. Altria’s drop of 1,100 employees represents a 15.49% decrease, and 'roughly 15%' is an appropriate simplification. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (Costco and Altria) over overlapping periods (2020–2022), compares growth trends, and draws a valid contrast—Costco’s expansion vs. Altria’s contraction. The mention of Altria’s 2022 data not showing a rebound aligns with the ground truth, even though the exact reason (sale of wine business) is omitted.

NVDA's increase is correctly stated as $107 million (from $3,807M to $3,914M), which matches the ground truth. However, the combined increase is wrong: the correct total is $183 million ($76M + $107M), but the LLM calculates it as roughly $350 million, likely due to the incorrect AMD figure.

The LLM reports a combined decline of $2.705 billion, while the ground truth states $2,750 million ($2.75 billion). This difference arises from rounding or calculation error: $1.633B + $1.072B = $2.705B, which is accurate based on the provided figures, but the ground truth asserts $2,750 million, suggesting either a data inconsistency or a different source value. However, the individual company declines—$1,633 million for Costco and $1,072 million for Altria—are correctly stated in both answers (with format variation: billion vs million). Costco’s cash drop of $3.794 billion is accurately reported and correctly compared to Altria’s total decline, with the LLM noting it is about 3.5 times larger, which aligns with the ground truth claim that Costco’s cash drop exceeds Altria’s total current asset decline. (2) All key numbers—Costco’s total current asset decline, Altria’s decline, and Costco’s cash drop—are factually correct and match the ground truth in magnitude. The only deviation is the combined total, which should be $2,705 million if the components are correct, yet the ground truth says $2,750 million. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth or unexplained adjustment, but the LLM’s arithmetic is sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly identifies data for two companies across two years, computes changes, synthesizes the combined effect, and makes a cross-company comparison between a component (cash) and a total (current assets). (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both sub-questions. Due to the unexplained discrepancy in the combined total (despite correct component values and arithmetic), a full 9–10 is not justified, but the error is minor and may reflect source data variance.

Similarly, for the 5-10 year maturity bucket, the correct combined value is $3,337 million, but the LLM calculates $9,838 million—more than double the correct amount. These errors stem from incorrect values attributed to Company C: the LLM uses $95,229 million (1–5 years) and $6,501 million (5–10 years), which do not align with the ground truth data. Only PYPL’s values ($4,980 million and $3,337 million) appear consistent with the source. (2) Calculations are internally consistent in the LLM answer (e.g., summing its own numbers correctly), but since the inputs are wrong, the totals are factually incorrect. The comparison that the 1–5 year bucket is 'ten times larger' is therefore also false—the ground truth shows it is about 22 times larger ($74,277M vs $3,337M), but only because the long-term bucket is much smaller than the LLM claims. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model identifies both companies, the correct maturity buckets, and attempts to sum across entities. However, it fails in execution due to incorrect extraction of Company C’s data, undermining the synthesis.

      "question": "What is the combined value of receivables from affiliated companies for both DUK and SO in 2021, and how does this compare to their respective total receivables for the same year?",
      "original_answer": "The combined value of receivables from affiliated companies for DUK and SO in 2021 is $116 million. For DUK, receivables from affiliated companies were $65 million, and total receivables were $127 million. For SO, affiliated receivables were $51 million, and total receivables were $139 million. Together, their affiliated receivables represent 87.3% of their total receivables ($116 million out of $133 million).",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 Duke Energy Progress reported **$33 million** of receivables from affiliated companies, and Southern Power reported **$65 million** – together **$98 million**. Southern Power’s total receivables (customer accounts $127 million + VIE receivables $574 million + affiliated receivables $65 million) amounted to **$766 million**, so the affiliated balances were roughly **8½ %** of its overall receivables.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors. It reports $33 million for Duke Energy (DUK) and $65 million for Southern Power (SO), totaling $98 million, whereas the ground truth states $65 million for DUK and $51 million for SO, totaling $116 million. These numbers are incorrect for both entities. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly identifies Southern Power as SO and attributes $766 million in total receivables, which is not supported by the ground truth; the correct total receivables for SO is $139 million. The percentage calculation (8.5%) is therefore also wrong—the correct proportion is 87.3% of combined total receivables. (2) The calculation of combined affiliated receivables ($33M + $65M = $98M) is mathematically correct but based on incorrect inputs. The claimed total receivables for Southern Power ($127M + $574M + $65M = $766M) uses misidentified line items (e.g., VIE receivables of $574M not mentioned in ground truth), indicating confusion in metric identification. The ground truth reports DUK total receivables as $127M and SO as $139M, summing to $266M, not $133M as misstated in the original answer (though the original answer incorrectly states $133M as total, it should be $266M; however, the 87.3% figure implies a denominator of $133M, suggesting a possible error in the ground truth explanation—still, the LLM’s $766M is indefensible). (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model confuses subsidiaries (Duke Energy Progress, Southern Power) with parent companies (DUK, SO), uses incorrect financial figures not aligned with the knowledge graph, and cannot compute the correct comparison due to wrong data. It also claims that DUK’s total receivables are not disclosed, which contradicts the ground truth. (4) Scores are low due to major quantitative and entity errors. Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure addresses the question’s intent, but factual foundation is flawed.",

      "question": "Based on their 2023 filings, how did Comcast's cost reductions in programming and production compare to Disney's cost changes across Hulu and Disney+, and what does this suggest about their respective content strategies?",
      "original_answer": "Comcast reported a decrease in programming and production costs in 2023, primarily due to lower costs associated with content licensing sales, influenced by the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages. While exact dollar figures were not disclosed for Comcast’s cost reductions, the directional decrease suggests a reduction in content production activity. In contrast, Disney reported specific figures: programming and production costs for Hulu increased by 4% to $8,582 million in 2024 from $8,265 million in 2023, while Disney+ and other services saw a 3% decrease to $5,499 million from $5,694 million. This mixed trend indicates that Disney continued to invest heavily in content for Hulu even as it reduced spending on Disney+. The differing trends suggest that Comcast may have scaled back content production more broadly due to external disruptions, while Disney reallocated resources between platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast reported that its programming‑and‑production expenses fell in 2023 – the Studios segment’s cost dropped 9.3% (to $7.96 billion) and the Media segment also saw a decline, driven by lower content costs for its broadcast and entertainment networks (though partly offset by higher Peacock spend).  \n\nDisney’s 2023 filing shows total programming‑and‑production costs fell about 9% (to $4.17 billion); the decline came from lower Disney+ and other non‑sports content costs, while Hulu’s programming‑and‑production outlay actually rose about 4% (to $8.27 billion).  \n\nThe contrast suggests Comcast is broadly cutting content spend across its TV and studio businesses, whereas Disney is trimming Disney+ content costs but continuing to invest in Hulu’s live‑TV offering, reflecting a strategy of overall cost discipline at Comcast and a more targeted reallocation of resources within Disney’s streaming portfolio.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It claims Comcast's Studios segment programming-and-production cost dropped 9.3% to $7.96 billion, but the original answer states no exact dollar figures were disclosed for Comcast’s cost reductions. This fabricated number is a major factual error. Similarly, the LLM states Disney’s total programming-and-production costs fell to $4.17 billion, which does not align with the ground truth: Disney reported Hulu costs increased to $8,582 million (from $8,265 million) and Disney+ costs decreased to $5,499 million (from $5,694 million). The LLM’s $4.17 billion figure is not supported and appears to be a misinterpretation or miscalculation. The LLM also reports Hulu’s costs rose to $8.27 billion, while the correct figure is $8.582 billion in 2024 (from $8.265 billion in 2023). Additionally, the LLM incorrectly attributes the 4% increase to 2023, while the original answer states the increase was reported in the 2024 filing, reflecting 2024 costs. 2) The LLM invents precise percentages and dollar amounts not present in the original answer, failing the quantitative accuracy test. The original answer emphasizes that Comcast did not disclose exact figures, yet the LLM provides specific numbers, undermining factual correctness. 3) While the LLM correctly identifies the directional trends—Comcast reducing costs broadly and Disney cutting Disney+ spending while increasing Hulu investment—the reasoning is based on incorrect data. The multi-hop synthesis (comparing strategies) is conceptually sound but built on false premises. 4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses the question’s structure: it compares cost changes and infers strategic differences. However, the use of incorrect financial data severely undermines the correctness score. Despite reasonable interpretation of strategic implications, the factual foundation is flawed, leading to a low quantitative accuracy and moderate qualitative accuracy due to correct directional logic but incorrect specifics.",

      "original_answer": "The combined value of non-cash additions related to lease financing for Chevron and ExxonMobil in 2024 is $3,869 million. Chevron reported non-cash additions of $2,205 million for right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified lease liabilities, while ExxonMobil disclosed non-cash additions of $1,664 million in its reconciliation of consolidated assets. Both companies include these non-cash additions as part of their broader capital investment strategies, with Chevron explicitly linking these additions to operating and finance leases, and ExxonMobil incorporating them into its total additions to property, plant, and equipment.

It incorrectly states that ExxonMobil reported $0 in non-cash lease-financing additions due to lack of disclosure, while the ground truth confirms ExxonMobil disclosed $1,664 million. Additionally, Chevron's total non-cash additions are misrepresented: the LLM splits it into $2,205M (operating lease) and $40M (finance lease), totaling $2.245B, but the original answer states Chevron's total is $2,205M (inclusive of both lease types), not $2,245M. The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM reports ~$2.2B, while the correct combined value is $3,869M. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: Chevron's figure is overstated by $40M, ExxonMobil's is understated by $1,664M, and the sum is off by ~$1.6B. These are material errors in financial reporting context. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to synthesize data from both companies’ 10-Ks—but fails due to incorrect interpretation of ExxonMobil’s filing. The claim that ExxonMobil 'does not disclose any separate non-cash lease-financing additions' contradicts the ground truth, which confirms a disclosed $1,664M in the reconciliation of consolidated assets. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the discussion of capital investment strategies is plausible for Chevron, but the analysis of ExxonMobil is flawed due to incorrect data.

The ground truth states LLY's 2021 Immunology revenue was $1.88 billion, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $3.36 billion. This leads to a major error in the combined revenue calculation: the correct total is $18.68 billion (JNJ $16.8B + LLY $1.88B), but the LLM calculates $20.2 billion based on incorrect inputs. Additionally, the LLY 2020 revenue is wrong—the LLM states $2.46 billion, while the truth is $1.37 billion. Although the LLM's calculated growth rate for LLY (~36%) is close to the correct 37.1%, it is based on incorrect underlying data. JNJ's figures ($16.8B revenue, 11.3% growth) are accurate. (2) Calculations: The sum $16.8B + $3.36B = $20.2B is mathematically correct but based on false inputs. The LLY growth rate calculation (from $2.46B to $3.36B) yields ~36.6%, which rounds to 36%, but again uses incorrect base values. The correct increase is from $1.37B to $1.88B (+$509.5M, or 37.1%). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across companies and years and correctly compares growth rates, showing understanding of the required logic. However, due to incorrect data retrieval for LLY, the synthesis fails at the factual level. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is 4 due to partial accuracy (JNJ correct, LLY mostly wrong), quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to major number errors, qualitative reasoning is moderate (5) as logic is sound but based on wrong data, and contextual relevance is high (8) because the structure and intent align well with the question.",

In contrast, Tesla does not disclose a present value for its operating leases and instead reports gross lease receivables of $4,577 million.

The numbers are accurately represented: HD's present value is stated as $6.2 billion (ground truth: $6,183 million), and Tesla's gross lease receivables are reported as $4.6 billion (ground truth: $4,577 million). These are acceptable rounding approximations and do not affect factual accuracy. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high—both figures are within reasonable rounding of the original data. The ground truth includes a breakdown of HD’s total lease payments ($7,095 million) and imputed interest ($912 million), which the LLM omits, but this detail is not essential to answering the core question about comparability. Tesla’s figure is correctly interpreted as lease receivables (an asset), not a liability, which aligns with the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: the model correctly infers that comparing a discounted liability (HD) with an undiscounted asset (Tesla) undermines comparability of their lease obligations. It correctly identifies the conceptual mismatch in measurement basis (present value vs. gross, liability vs. asset), which is the central issue affecting comparability. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing how the difference in disclosure practices limits comparability. While it could have explicitly mentioned the time value of money or suggested adjustments for comparability (as in the original answer), the core logic and conclusion are equivalent. Minor omission of the total payment and interest breakdown prevents a perfect 10, but the response remains highly accurate and insightful.",

In 2021, COP reported a net book value of $52 billion for proved oil and gas properties and recorded $7.0 billion in DD&A expense. XOM also uses the unit-of-production method to amortize acquisition costs of proved properties, based on total proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes.

This is a critical factual error. The LLM appears to have confused general intangible asset reporting with the specific long-term asset classifications MO actually discloses.

However, the LLM mischaracterizes the $678 million figure for COST as a 'deferred-tax asset arising from operating-lease liabilities', while the ground truth states that operating lease liabilities contribute $652 million to deferred tax *liabilities* (not assets) in COST, which partially offsets its deferred tax assets. This is a significant qualitative error in direction (asset vs liability). For MO, the $3,032 million contribution from intangible assets to deferred tax liabilities is correctly cited. (2) Quantitative accuracy is high: all major figures (MO: $3,744M, COST: $221M, MO intangibles: $3,032M, implied difference ~$3.5B) are correct or acceptably rounded. The $652M vs $678M discrepancy for COST’s lease impact is minor but notable; more importantly, the LLM misassigns the role of this figure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially flawed: while the model correctly contrasts MO’s intangible-driven liabilities with COST’s lease-related impacts, it incorrectly frames COST’s lease effect as generating a deferred tax asset rather than contributing to liabilities, undermining the causal explanation.

The LLM incorrectly reports Company C's amount as $117,055 million (sum of AFS and HTM at $30,123M + $86,932M), which is over three times the correct total and includes HTM securities not mentioned in the original answer. It also reports PYPL as $1,587 million instead of $1,583 million. These numbers do not match the ground truth, and the calculation is based on erroneous inputs. (2) Completeness: The question asks specifically for the combined fair value of debt securities held after 10 years by both companies. The LLM introduces AFS and HTM categories not referenced in the original answer, suggesting a misinterpretation of the required data. The synthesis fails because it uses incorrect underlying data. (3) Entity Accuracy: While the companies (Company C and PYPL) and date (December 31, 2024) are correctly identified, the financial metrics are misrepresented. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop reasoning is flawed. The model appears to pull data from unrelated contexts or misreads the maturity categories, combining AFS and HTM when the ground truth only references a single fair value figure per company. It fails to correctly identify what constitutes 'debt securities held after 10 years' as defined in the knowledge graph.

Similarly, it reports ExxonMobil’s gross-to-net ratio using gross 1,903 thousand and net 1,342 thousand acres, but the ground truth specifies a ratio of 379 gross to 190 net, which is approximately 2.0 — not 1.42. These numbers appear to be fabricated or pulled from unrelated contexts (e.g., possibly from different regions or metrics). (2) Calculations are therefore completely off: 232 × 1.42 ≈ 329 thousand gross acres for Chevron is based on false inputs. Adding this to ExxonMobil’s reported 1,903 thousand gross acres (which is also incorrect — ground truth is 394 thousand) yields 2,232 thousand acres, whereas the correct total is 404 thousand. The final number is over 5.5 times larger than the truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to apply ExxonMobil’s gross-to-net ratio to Chevron’s net acreage to estimate Chevron’s gross, then adds ExxonMobil’s gross — but it fails completely due to incorrect data extraction.

It reports $5.7 billion for LLY in 2021, while the ground truth is $3.0288 billion—a major overstatement. This error directly impacts the combined revenue calculation: the LLM implies a total of ~$20.2 billion ($14.5B + $5.7B), whereas the correct combined revenue is $17.5288 billion. The growth rate for LLY is approximately correct at 8% vs. the true 8.5%, but the underlying revenue figures used are wrong. JNJ's figures ($14.5B and +17.6%) are accurate and correctly cited. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low due to the incorrect aggregation of LLY's oncology revenue. The LLM appears to have summed U.S. and non-U.S. values from different categories—$3,028.8 million (U.S.) and $2,712.5 million (Outside U.S.)—but these do not both belong to oncology; the $3,028.8 million is the correct global oncology number in millions ($3.0288 billion), and the $2,712.5 million likely refers to another category or is misattributed. Thus, the doubling of LLY’s revenue is a critical error. (3) The qualitative reasoning about growth dynamics is partially sound: JNJ's strong growth due to key drugs is correctly attributed, and LLY's more moderate growth with mixed product performance is conceptually accurate. However, the claim that Alimta contributed to gains contradicts the ground truth, which states Alimta was declining—only Verzenio showed strong growth.

Honeywell's reported fair value of Non-U.S. plan assets was correctly cited as $8.45 billion (or $8,450 million), which matches the original answer. The difference calculated by the LLM (~$3.7 billion) is therefore incorrect; the actual difference is $8,450M - $89M = $8,361 million, not $3.7 billion. The LLM reversed the comparison and used an inflated figure for Caterpillar. (2) The calculation is fundamentally flawed due to the incorrect Caterpillar number. Even though $8.45 billion for Honeywell is accurate (matching $8,450 million), the use of $4.73 billion for Caterpillar — which is over 50 times higher than the true value — invalidates all quantitative reasoning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the Caterpillar allocation data. It incorrectly treats Caterpillar’s allocation as a large funding amount comparable to Honeywell’s asset base, when in reality Caterpillar’s contribution was minimal in comparison. The conclusion about Caterpillar having a 'modest funding posture' may seem plausible but is based on false premises. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to compare pension funding strategies between the two firms and interprets the implications of asset levels — a relevant line of reasoning — but the qualitative analysis is undermined by severe quantitative inaccuracies. Thus, correctness is very low (2/10), quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10), qualitative reasoning is partially sound but built on false data (3/10), and contextual relevance is acceptable given structure and intent (6/10).",

      "question": "How do the differences in valuation methodologies for future fair values of private equity investments between DHR and MDT affect their expected liquidity and contribution requirements for retirement benefit plans in 2022?",
      "original_answer": "DHR estimates future fair values of private equity investments using market multiples, third-party appraisals, or quoted market prices, with valuation adjustments based on changes in operating results or financial condition. This approach may impact the accuracy of fair value estimates and influence DHR's U.S. and non-U.S. pension contribution requirements of $10 million and $48 million, respectively, in 2022. In contrast, MDT values private equity investments using year-end net asset values of partnerships, with unfunded commitments totaling $204 million as of April 29, 2022, and an estimated liquidation period of one to 15 years. MDT’s methodology may affect its ability to rebalance asset allocations closer to targets over the intermediate term, especially given the strong equity performance during the fiscal year. Therefore, DHR’s reliance on market-based adjustments and MDT’s use of NAV practical expedient create different liquidity profiles and contribution planning assumptions for their retirement benefit plans.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher (DHR) values its private‑equity holdings primarily with market‑based inputs—quoted prices, comparable‑company multiples and third‑party appraisals—so the fair‑value numbers it reports are tied to observable market prices and are treated as relatively liquid. Medtronic (MDT) values its private‑equity and partnership interests using a net‑asset‑value (NAV) practical‑expedient and Level‑3 inputs, with redemption windows of 45‑95 days and expected liquidation periods of 1‑15 years, which makes those fair‑value estimates far less liquid and more uncertain. Because Danaher’s valuations are more market‑based, its 2022 cash‑contribution forecasts for its U.S. and non‑U.S. defined‑benefit plans are modest ($10 million and $48 million, respectively), whereas Medtronic’s reliance on illiquid, long‑term‑lock‑up private‑equity valuations implies a greater need for discretionary funding to cover plan obligations, even though the exact 2022 contribution amount is not disclosed.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: DHR's U.S. and non-U.S. pension contributions of $10 million and $48 million in 2022 are accurately reported. MDT's unfunded commitments of $204 million as of April 29, 2022, are not explicitly mentioned in the LLM answer, which is a minor omission, but no incorrect numbers are stated. The liquidation period of 1–15 years for MDT is correctly included. (2) The valuation methodologies are accurately described: DHR uses market multiples, third-party appraisals, and quoted prices; MDT uses NAV practical expedient with Level-3 inputs. The LLM correctly notes that DHR’s market-based approach leads to more liquid valuations, while MDT’s NAV-based method implies lower liquidity and longer lock-up periods. (3) The reasoning is sound: the answer correctly links DHR’s more transparent, market-adjusted valuations to lower, more predictable contributions, while MDT’s illiquid, long-term private equity holdings imply less flexibility and potentially higher discretionary funding needs. The conclusion about differing liquidity profiles and contribution planning is logically derived and matches the original answer’s intent. (4) The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention MDT’s $204 million unfunded commitments, which is a relevant detail for contribution requirements and liquidity. However, it does reference the long liquidation period and lack of disclosed 2022 contribution, which captures the essence. Overall, the answer demonstrates strong multi-hop synthesis across valuation methodology, liquidity implications, and pension funding outcomes for both companies, with only a slight reduction in completeness.",

It reports Capital One's 2024 net charge-off rate as 2.10%, which is incorrect; the ground truth is 5.88%. This is a major error that undermines the entire analysis. PayPal's rate is correctly stated as 4.5%, and its decrease from 7.2% in 2023 is accurate. (2) The calculation of the difference between the two companies' 2024 rates is implied but incorrect due to the wrong Capital One figure — the LLM suggests a difference of about 2.4 percentage points, whereas the true difference is 1.38 points (5.88% - 4.5%). Additionally, the LLM claims Capital One's increase is 'modest' from 1.76% to 2.10%, but in reality, it increased from 4.57% (5.88% - 1.31%) to 5.88%, a 131 basis point rise, which is substantial, not modest. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly identifies that PayPal improved and attempts to contrast it with Capital One — but the flawed data leads to incorrect conclusions about the magnitude and nature of Capital One's performance. The synthesis fails because it uses incorrect source data for one of the two entities. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the structure and intent of the response align with the question — comparing credit trends using charge-off rates — and PayPal's data is accurate. However, the severe inaccuracy in Capital One's numbers drastically reduces factual correctness. Hence, correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low; qualitative reasoning is partially valid but based on false premises; relevance remains moderate due to correct framing and accurate PayPal data.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains a minor quantitative inaccuracy in the combined 2023 total. The LLM states Duke Energy paid $528 million and NextEra $2,463 million, which sum to $2,991 million (or $2.991 billion), but rounds it to 'about $2.99 billion'. The ground truth combined total is $3,009 million, indicating a $18 million discrepancy. This could stem from incorrect individual figures or rounding too early. The 2022 totals are accurate: $546M (DUK) + $1,375M (NEE) = $1,921M, matching the ground truth. The year-over-year increase is reported as 'roughly $1.07 billion', while the exact difference is $3,009M - $1,921M = $1,088M. The LLM's $1.07B ($1,070M) is close but underestimates by $18M. The percentage increase is not mentioned in the LLM answer (56.6% in ground truth), which is a minor omission. (2) Calculations: Sum for 2023 is off by $18M; difference calculation is off by $18M. Individual components may be misstated—NextEra’s 2023 interest payment is likely incorrect at $2,463M if the total is wrong, assuming Duke’s figure is accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, the correct metric (cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized), and the two years, then synthesizes across entities and years to compute totals and trends. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness 8 due to close but inaccurate totals and missing percentage; Quantitative Accuracy 8 due to small but notable errors in sum and delta; Qualitative Accuracy 9 for strong reasoning and entity matching; Contextual Relevance 10 as all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate context.",

      "original_answer": "In both audits, Deloitte & Touche LLP evaluated the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by inquiring about changes in regulatory orders and comparing recorded balances to independently developed expectations. At Duke Energy (DUK), auditors performed trend analyses and obtained management representations asserting the probability of recovery. For Southern Company Gas (SO), auditors extended these procedures by reading regulatory orders from multiple states (Georgia, Illinois, Tennessee, and Virginia), inspecting regulatory filings for intervenor challenges, and testing the completeness and accuracy of capitalized project costs. The regulatory uncertainties evaluated for SO included the risk that the Commissions might not approve full recovery of incurred costs or invested capital, and potential future rate reductions or refunds, which could significantly impact financial recoverability.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing derived 86% of its revenue in 2021 from fixed-price contracts, which exposes it to cost overruns and estimation risks. Lockheed Martin explicitly states that fixed-price contracts, especially for complex development programs, increase financial risk because cost and timing are difficult to estimate, often leading to losses. Furthermore, Lockheed Martin notes that bidding on cost-reimbursable development work with follow-on fixed-price production options increases the risk of lower margins or losses because contractors must estimate production costs before development is complete. Given Boeing’s heavy reliance on fixed-price contracts, this exposure significantly amplifies the financial risks Lockheed Martin describes, particularly in environments where cost estimation is inherently uncertain and inflationary pressures may further compress margins.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing reported that 86 % of its 2021 revenue came from fixed‑price contracts (see page 129). Lockheed Martin warns that fixed‑price development work is especially risky because the technical, cost and schedule uncertainties of complex programs are hard to estimate, and when actual costs exceed the bid price the contractor can incur “losses on certain fixed‑price development programs” and lower‑than‑expected margins (page 17). Because such a large share of Boeing’s earnings is tied to fixed‑price pricing, any under‑estimation of development or production costs would affect a far greater portion of its revenue and backlog, magnifying the same cost‑estimation and loss‑risk that Lockheed Martin describes.",

It accurately references Lockheed Martin’s warning about fixed-price development programs leading to losses due to cost, technical, and schedule uncertainties. The core financial risk—cost overruns leading to losses—is correctly conveyed. (2) All quantitative elements are accurate: the 86% figure for Boeing in 2021 is correct, and no calculations are required beyond accurate reporting of percentages and references. Format variations (e.g., '86 %' vs '86%') are minor and acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes Boeing’s revenue exposure with Lockheed Martin’s stated risks about fixed-price contracts, correctly concluding that Boeing’s high reliance amplifies the same risks. It captures the logic that underestimation of costs would affect a larger portion of Boeing’s revenue and backlog. One minor omission is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the added risk from bidding on cost-reimbursable development with follow-on fixed-price production (a key point in the original), which slightly weakens the completeness of the synthesis.

Similarly, IBM's 2022 10-K filing notes that 'if the company's brand image is tarnished by negative perceptions, its ability to attract and retain customers... could be impacted.' Both companies face risks where reputational damage from security or brand issues could reduce customer retention, thereby weakening their competitive positioning in the Information Technology sector.

      "original_answer": "Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM) both highlight the importance of refining margins in influencing their earnings. According to Chevron's 2024 10-K filing, changes in refining, marketing, and chemicals margins are among the key factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil specifically notes that its Energy Products segment earnings are closely tied to industry refining margins, which decreased in 2024 to the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010–2019). This decline in refining margins would directly impact ExxonMobil’s earnings, as refining margins are a function of the difference between raw material costs and product prices, which are influenced by global supply and demand, geopolitical events, and other market dynamics. Since both companies depend on refining margins, the volatility in this financial metric affects their earnings outlooks, with ExxonMobil experiencing a measurable decline in margins that would constrain profitability, while Chevron's forward-looking projections become more uncertain due to this sensitivity.",

However, it incorrectly states that Union Pacific (UNP) does not report a comparable 'accrued wages' line item, when in fact the ground truth confirms UNP reported $50 million in accrued wages for 2023. This is a significant factual omission. (2) Quantitatively, the CAT figure is accurate (within rounding), but the UNP figure is missing entirely, preventing a valid comparison. The model fails to report the $50 million value, which is central to the question’s comparative analysis. (3) The reasoning about workforce size and payroll timing is plausible and aligns with the ground truth interpretation, but the multi-hop synthesis fails because it assumes UNP lacks data rather than using the actual disclosed amount.

It reports AMT's real estate acquisition spending as $52.3 million, while the ground truth is $91.8 million. SPG's figure is close at $56.1 million (vs. $56.105 million), but the AMT number is substantially incorrect. As a result, the difference is wrongly calculated as -$3.8 million (indicating AMT spent less), whereas AMT actually spent $35.695 million more than SPG. The combined spending is reported as $108.4 million, which is far below the correct total of $147.905 million. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs: $52.3M + $56.1M = $108.4M is arithmetically correct, but both inputs are wrong—especially AMT’s figure. The difference of $3.8M less is incorrect due to using the wrong AMT value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model used an incorrect metric for AMT—'capital expenditures' instead of 'real estate acquisitions'. This reflects a failure to correctly identify and extract the relevant financial line item from AMT’s filing, leading to flawed synthesis. While it correctly interpreted SPG’s 'Acquisitions' line, it did not align the same concept across both companies accurately. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, year, and type of spending, and attempts proper comparison and summation.

However, it reports TXN's operating cash flow for operating leases as $61M instead of the correct $69M from the ground truth, leading to an incorrect total of $215M instead of $223M. This error propagates into the final difference: LLM calculates $476M - $215M = $261M, while the correct difference is $476M - $223M = $253M. (2) Number verification: NVDA's lease asset ($266M) and operating lease outflow ($154M) are correct. TXN's lease asset ($210M) is correct, but its operating lease cash outflow is wrong ($61M vs. $69M). The sum of cash outflows should be $154M + $69M = $223M, not $215M.

(1) Quantitatively: Johnson & Johnson's 2021 Neuroscience revenue is correctly reported as $7.0 billion (ground truth: $7,011 million = ~$7.0 billion). Eli Lilly's total Neuroscience revenue is given as $1.9 billion, which matches the ground truth sum of $614.8M (U.S.) + $1,283.7M (Outside U.S.) = $1,898.5M ≈ $1.9 billion. The combined total is correctly approximated at $8.9 billion ($7.0B + $1.9B). Percentage changes are accurate: J&J’s 7.1% increase matches the ground truth; Eli Lilly’s increase from $1,831.3M to $1,898.5M is indeed a 3.7% increase (correctly stated), despite the original answer initially saying 'decreased' then concluding '3.7% increase'—this internal inconsistency in the ground truth does not penalize the LLM, which correctly interprets the math.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GM experienced a $1.7 billion increase in finance charge income and a $0.3 billion increase in investment income, both primarily due to higher benchmark interest rates. However, this also led to a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense due to higher effective interest rates on debt. Meanwhile, Starbucks reported that changes in fair value due to benchmark interest rates affected $350 million of its August 2029 notes, which were hedged using interest rate swaps. Therefore, while GM benefited from higher interest rates on income-generating assets, it faced higher financing costs, and SBUX actively managed interest rate exposure through hedging instruments.",

It also accurately notes that Starbucks used interest rate swaps to hedge its August 2029 notes (though it adds 'October 2023 senior notes' not mentioned in the original). However, the LLM omits GM's $1.8 billion increase in interest expense, a key part of the financial impact, which reduces completeness. 2) Quantitatively, all provided numbers are accurate: $1.7B and $0.3B for GM are correct, and the reference to $350M of August 2029 notes is implied in the ground truth but not explicitly quantified in the LLM answer. The omission of the $1.8B interest expense is a significant quantitative gap. 3) The reasoning correctly links higher benchmark rates to increased finance revenue at GM and to fair value changes in SBUX's hedges. The multi-hop synthesis across GM and SBUX is mostly sound, but the failure to mention GM's rising interest expense weakens the full financial picture. 4) Contextually, the answer is highly relevant, addressing both companies and the impact of benchmark rate changes.

For TXN, the LLM incorrectly states the full $12 billion from the 2018 program remained as of December 31, 2021, but in reality, part of that had already been used; the combined total of $19.24B implies TXN’s remaining authorization was much less than $12B.

According to the ground truth, ADBE's net value is $2,030 million (not $1,490 million), and ORCL's net value is $21,536 million (not ~$17.07 billion). The LLM incorrectly uses ADBE's gross value ($1.49 billion) as the net value, conflating the two figures. For ORCL, it assumes the net computers and equipment value is approximately equal to total PPE-net ($17.07 billion), but the correct net value for computers and equipment alone is $21,536 million. The combined net value is therefore miscalculated: LLM reports ~$18.6 billion vs. the correct $18,758 million (~$18.76 billion). While close, this stems from incorrect inputs and flawed reasoning.\n\n2) Calculations: The sum of $1.49B + $17.07B = $18.56B is mathematically correct, but based on wrong underlying values. The correct sum is $2,030M + $21,536M = $23,566M, which contradicts the ground truth combined value of $18,758M — indicating a possible inconsistency in the original answer. However, per the provided ground truth, the LLM should have used ADBE net = $2,030M and ORCL net = $21,536M, summing to $23,566M, not $18,758M. This suggests a potential error in the ground truth or mislabeling. But since evaluators must follow the provided ground truth, the LLM fails to match it due to incorrect individual values.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies the need to extract net values for both companies and compare gross investments to assess infrastructure scale. It correctly infers that ORCL has a much larger technology footprint than ADBE, which aligns with the ground truth reasoning. However, it fails to accurately isolate the 'net' computers and equipment line items, especially for ORCL, where it substitutes total PPE-net as a proxy without justification.\n\n4) Despite these issues, the qualitative comparison about ORCL’s larger infrastructure due to its cloud and enterprise services role vs. Adobe’s more focused platform is reasonable and contextually sound. The entities (ADBE, ORCL, 2023), metrics (computers and equipment), and intent are correctly identified. Wording differences are acceptable, but factual mismatches in key financial figures reduce correctness. The combined value in the ground truth ($18,758M) does not match the sum of its components ($2,030M + $21,536M = $23,566M), suggesting a possible data inconsistency, but the LLM cannot be credited for matching an internally inconsistent answer.

      "original_answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for Duke Energy and NextEra Energy as of December 31, 2022, is $3,111 million. Duke Energy reported $202 million in noncurrent derivative liabilities, while NextEra Energy reported $2,909 million. This significant difference highlights that NextEra Energy has a much greater long-term exposure to derivative obligations compared to Duke Energy, which may reflect differences in hedging strategies, commodity exposure, or financial structuring.",
      "llm_answer": "- Duke Energy’s non‑current derivative liabilities at 12/31/2022 total ≈ $476 million (commodity $434 m + interest‑rate $2 m + foreign‑currency $40 m).  \n- NextEra Energy’s non‑current derivative liabilities at 12/31/2022 are disclosed as $2,909 million.  \n\nCombined, the two companies carry about **$3.4 billion** in non‑current derivative liabilities. The stark contrast—Duke’s modest $0.5 billion versus NEE’s nearly $3 billion—shows that NEE relies far more on long‑term derivative contracts (commodity, interest‑rate and currency hedges) to manage its exposure, while Duke Energy’s long‑term derivative obligations are comparatively limited.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities. The ground truth states Duke Energy reported $202 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports $476 million (breaking it down into commodity, interest-rate, and foreign currency components not present in the original data). This error propagates to the combined total: the correct sum is $3,111 million ($202M + $2,909M), but the LLM calculates $3.4 billion (~$3,400 million), which is inaccurate. NextEra Energy’s figure of $2,909 million is correct. (2) Calculations are flawed: $476M + $2,909M = $3,385M (~$3.4B), which matches the LLM’s stated total, but since the inputs are wrong (especially Duke’s), the result is incorrect. The correct combined total is $3,111 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to synthesize data across both companies and draws a qualitative comparison about exposure to long-term derivatives. However, because the underlying numbers for Duke Energy are wrong, the conclusion about the 'stark contrast' is exaggerated and based on faulty premises. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the answer uses appropriate terminology, correct company tickers (DUK, NEE), correct date (12/31/2022), and addresses both parts of the question: total combined liabilities and interpretation of exposure differences. The reasoning structure is logical and contextually relevant, but the quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine factual correctness. Hence, correctness score is low due to major number errors, though not completely wrong since NEE’s data and the general direction of analysis are accurate.",

However, the LLM incorrectly reports DUK's net cash provided by operating activities as $7,500 million instead of the correct $4,118 million from the original answer. This leads to an incorrect percentage calculation for DUK's interest expense as a share of operating cash flow (≈12.7% vs. the correct 23.17%). The NEE calculation is accurate: $1,034M / $8,296M ≈ 12.46%, which the LLM approximates correctly as ≈12.5%. The combined operating cash flow and combined percentage are based on the incorrect DUK figure, leading to a distorted total of $15,796 million and a combined percentage of ≈12.6%, which is not requested in the original question and distracts from the required individual comparisons. (2) Number verification: Interest payments are correct. DUK operating cash flow is wrong ($7,500M vs. $4,118M). Percentage for DUK is therefore miscalculated (12.7% vs. 23.17%). NEE figures are correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to calculate percentages for each company, but uses incorrect data for DUK’s operating cash flow, breaking the reasoning chain. It also introduces a 'combined' percentage not asked for, while failing to report the correct individual percentages as required. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to partial correctness: key input numbers (interest paid) are accurate, but a critical financial figure (DUK operating cash flow) is wrong, leading to significant error in analysis. Quantitative accuracy is 5 due to one major data error despite correct totals. Qualitative accuracy is 6 because reasoning structure is sound but based on faulty data.

In contrast, LMT warns that a $100 million increase in environmental liabilities would result in an $87 million probable future recovery and a $13 million charge to earnings, indicating potential for increasing liability exposure depending on regulatory changes.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. The ground truth states that Boeing's initial liability decreased from $652 million in 2020 to $11 million in 2021 — a reduction of $641 million — which the LLM correctly identifies. However, the LLM incorrectly claims that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) environmental liability balance fell from $789 million to $742 million (a $47 million reduction), which is not supported by the original answer. The original answer does not provide LMT’s actual liability balances but instead discusses a hypothetical scenario: a $100 million increase in liabilities would lead to an $87 million probable recovery and a $13 million charge. Thus, the LLM fabricates actual balance figures for LMT that are not in the ground truth. (2) Calculations: While the $641 million drop for Boeing is accurate based on $652M - $11M, the $47 million reduction for LMT is incorrect because no such real balances were stated. The LLM also mischaracterizes LMT’s exposure as having 'modestly reduced,' which contradicts the original answer’s implication of potential liability growth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: The question asks to compare changes in estimates for environmental liabilities at LMT to Boeing’s reduction. The original answer contrasts Boeing’s actual large reduction with LMT’s forward-looking risk of increasing exposure. The LLM instead treats both as historical reductions, missing the hypothetical and cautionary nature of LMT’s disclosure. It fails to recognize that LMT’s statement is about sensitivity to future changes, not a past trend. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and general topic, but the incorrect use of fabricated numbers and misrepresentation of LMT’s financial exposure severely undermine factual correctness. The conclusion about Boeing showing a steeper decline is technically consistent, but it's based on a false comparison with LMT. Therefore, despite correct Boeing numbers, the misrepresentation of LMT’s data leads to a mostly incorrect overall assessment.",

The ground truth reports $8,050 million ($8.05 billion), but the LLM adds an extra $390 million for equity affiliates, which is not part of the reported DD&A expense in the original answer or question scope.

The difference from Chevron’s 2022 DD&A should be $25,376M - $16,319M = $9,057M (~$9.1B), not $9.4B — the error stems from the inflated ConocoPhillips figure.

However, this was offset by a $1.8 billion increase in interest expense on debt, also driven by higher benchmark interest rates. On the other hand, Starbucks actively hedges against changes in benchmark interest rates using interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to mitigate risk associated with anticipated debt issuances. This shows that while both companies are exposed to benchmark interest rate fluctuations, GM experiences both positive and negative financial impacts, whereas Starbucks proactively manages its exposure through hedging instruments.",

It also accurately describes Starbucks' use of interest rate swaps and treasury locks for hedging. The only minor omission is that the original answer does not mention the net impact on GM Financial’s adjusted EBT ($1.091 billion decline), which is present in the LLM answer but not in the ground truth — however, this additional detail does not contradict the ground truth and appears to be factually consistent with the filings. (2) All numeric values match exactly or are presented in equivalent formats (e.g., $1.7 billion = $1.7B). The LLM adds a precise net effect figure not in the original, but it aligns with the arithmetic: ($1.7B + $0.3B) - $1.8B = $0.2B pre-tax benefit, though the stated $1.091B decline may reflect further adjustments beyond simple arithmetic; regardless, it doesn't conflict with the core data provided. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how benchmark rate changes affect GM both positively (income) and negatively (expense), and contrasts this with Starbucks’ proactive hedging strategy. It connects mechanisms (swaps, treasury locks) to risk mitigation for debt issuance, as required. (4) The answer is contextually complete and highly relevant, addressing both companies, their exposure to benchmark rates, specific financial impacts, and strategic responses. The slight addition of a net EBT figure enhances rather than detracts from accuracy.

(1) It correctly identifies that AMT excludes real estate related depreciation, amortization, and accretion from segment gross margin by first including it in gross margin and then subtracting it in reconciliation (supported by the $1,879.6 million figure from page 49), which is semantically equivalent to saying it is excluded from segment gross margin. (2) The quantitative data is correct: the $1,879.6 million amount for 2024 is accurately cited from the reconciliation table, and the reference to SPG's 'Real Estate and Accumulated Depreciation' schedule on page 155 is valid. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (AMT and SPG), two financial statements (income statement treatment vs. balance sheet valuation), and two reporting methodologies. (4) The LLM adds more granular detail than the original answer—specifying that depreciation is subtracted after being included in gross margin and citing the exact financial statement location—without introducing errors. The only minor gap is that the original answer emphasizes SPG 'includes' depreciation in asset valuation (as a contra-asset), while the LLM describes it accurately but more passively as 'accumulated depreciation on the balance sheet.' This is a nuance in phrasing, not a factual error. All entities (AMT, SPG, December 31, 2024), metrics, and years are correct. The answer fully addresses the comparative treatment of depreciation in segment reporting vs. asset valuation. Thus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness due to slightly different framing on SPG’s treatment, but remains factually and quantitatively precise.",

According to the ground truth, NVIDIA's long-term net deferred tax asset was $1.22 billion, and Texas Instruments' was $176 million in fiscal year 2022. However, the LLM incorrectly swaps these values: it states NVIDIA had $176 million and Texas Instruments had $1.20 billion. This reversal leads to a completely incorrect conclusion. (2) The calculation of the difference is also wrong. The LLM computes a $1.02 billion difference (with Texas Instruments having more), but the correct difference is $1.22B - $176M = $1.044 billion, with NVIDIA having the larger asset. Even the arithmetic in the LLM answer ($1.20B - $176M ≈ $1.02B) is approximately correct only under its incorrect inputs, but the direction of comparison is wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the deferred tax positions for the two companies. It misattributes the values, undermining the entire comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts the right type of comparison (difference in deferred tax assets) and references the correct companies and fiscal year.

      "original_answer": "COP calculates its standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows using 12-month average prices, assuming continuation of year-end economic conditions, which may not reflect future volatility. XOM notes that extended low prices could reduce capital spending and affect partners' ability to fund joint projects, thereby impacting proved reserves. Together, these approaches suggest that while COP's methodology smooths price volatility, it may mask the longer-term effects of sustained low prices, which XOM explicitly identifies as a risk that could reduce both the level and timing of proved reserves. This creates a potential misalignment in how each company accounts for price volatility in reserve estimation.",

      "original_answer": "Charles Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities decreased from 2.67% in 2020 to 1.78% in 2021, yet interest revenue from these securities increased from $1,560 million to $4,537 million due to a significant rise in average balances from $58,181 million to $253,555 million. This contributed to the overall net interest revenue growth from $6,113 million in 2020 to $8,030 million in 2021, a $1,917 million increase. BNY Mellon, in its 10-K, highlights that it monitors net interest revenue closely as part of its financial outlook and risk management, noting its sensitivity to market trends such as interest rates and asset composition. Therefore, BNY Mellon would be strategically interested in understanding how shifts in asset yields and balances impact net interest revenue, as seen at Schwab, to better model and manage its own revenue streams under varying economic conditions.",

According to the ground truth, Schwab's average yield on available-for-sale securities was 2.67% in 2020 and 1.78% in 2021, not 1.78% and 1.30% as stated. This misrepresents both the starting and ending yields. Additionally, the LLM claims net interest revenue rose about 31% (≈$1.9 billion), which aligns numerically with the $1,917 million increase in the ground truth, but incorrectly frames it as a 31% increase on the total net interest revenue—actual growth from $6,113M to $8,030M is approximately 31.3%, so this part is roughly correct. However, the LLM fails to report the actual interest revenue from available-for-sale securities increasing from $1,560M to $4,537M, instead vaguely attributing growth to 'adding interest-earning assets' and the TD Ameritrade acquisition. (2) Calculations: While the $1.9 billion increase is close to the true $1,917M, the percentage change is only approximately correct, and the core yield figures are wrong. The average balances increase—from $58,181M to $253,555M—is entirely omitted, which is a critical driver in the ground truth explanation. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies the conceptual paradox of falling yields but rising revenue due to balance sheet expansion, and links this to BNY Mellon’s interest in interest-rate sensitivity. It also correctly infers that BNY Mellon would find strategic value in understanding how balance growth can offset yield declines. However, it introduces the TD Ameritrade acquisition as a causal factor not present in the original answer or explicitly supported in the provided context, which may be true in reality but is not part of the knowledge graph ground truth. (4) Despite incorrect core metrics, the answer captures the general strategic implication for BNY Mellon, hence a moderate contextual relevance and partial qualitative accuracy.

According to the ground truth, DHR used a discount rate of 2.80% and MDT used 13.10% for Non-U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022. However, the LLM incorrectly reports DHR's rate as ≈2.5% and, critically, MDT's rate as ≈1.4%, which is not only wrong but nearly the inverse of the correct relationship. This flips the entire analysis: MDT actually used a much higher rate than DHR, not lower. (2) The calculations are based on incorrect numbers and flawed logic. The LLM assumes a 1.1-percentage-point difference (2.5% - 1.4%), but the actual difference is 10.3 percentage points (13.10% - 2.80%). The estimated impact on MDT’s PBO ($19M decrease) is fabricated without clear basis—no such figure can be derived from the provided (incorrect) inputs or the ground truth. The actual effect would be far more significant given the large rate difference.

In contrast, Duke Energy’s smaller position suggests a more conservative or limited use of such instruments for long-term risk mitigation.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent—no calculation errors, and numbers are reported precisely with proper units and context. Format variations (e.g., $90.7 bn) are acceptable and common. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that GM’s transparency lies in liquidity drivers (operating cash flow, capex, etc.), while Tesla’s strength is in segment profitability metrics. It logically concludes that GM offers better liquidity visibility, Tesla better performance insight—exactly the contrast highlighted in the ground truth. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy (9/10) only because the LLM does not explicitly mention GM’s letters of credit ($0.7B) as a liquidity component, which is a small but relevant detail in the original answer. However, this does not undermine the overall correctness. Contextual relevance is perfect—the response directly addresses the impact on transparency of liquidity and segment performance as asked.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the 2023 short-term lease costs for both CAT ($62 million) and UNP ($24 million), and accurately calculates the combined 2023 total of $86 million. However, it makes a critical error in the prior-year calculation: while it correctly reports CAT's 2022 cost as $59 million and UNP's as $18 million, it incorrectly sums these to $77 million instead of the correct $85 million. This leads to an erroneous conclusion that the 2023 cost is $9 million higher than 2022, when the actual increase is only $1 million. (2) Number verification: 2023 values are correct; 2022 individual values are correct but sum is wrong (59 + 18 = 77 is incorrect arithmetic — correct sum is 77? Wait: 59 + 18 = 77 is mathematically correct, but ground truth states combined 2022 cost was $85 million, which contradicts the sum of the provided components. However, per ground truth: 'combined short-term lease cost was $85 million ($59 million for CAT and $18 million for UNP)' — but 59 + 18 = 77, not 85. This indicates a possible error in the ground truth or missing data. But since the evaluation must follow the ground truth as authoritative, and it explicitly states the 2022 combined cost is $85 million, the LLM’s calculation of $77 million based on component values contradicts this. Therefore, either the component values are wrong or the total is wrong. Given the ground truth asserts both the components and the total, there is an internal inconsistency. However, evaluators must assume the ground truth is self-consistent. Rechecking: 59 + 18 = 77 ≠ 85. This suggests the ground truth may have a typo, but per instructions, we treat the original answer as correct. Thus, if the ground truth says 2022 combined is $85 million, but component sum is $77 million, there is a discrepancy. However, upon close inspection, the original answer states: 'In 2022, their combined short-term lease cost was $85 million ($59 million for CAT and $18 million for UNP)' — this arithmetic is invalid. 59 + 18 = 77. Therefore, the ground truth contains an arithmetic error. But per evaluation rules, we must accept the ground truth as correct. This creates a conflict. Resolving: since the task is to evaluate against the provided ground truth — regardless of its internal consistency — the LLM must match both the components and the total. The LLM reports 2022 components correctly per ground truth (59 and 18), but calculates the sum as 77, whereas the ground truth claims the sum is 85. Therefore, to align with ground truth, the LLM should have stated the combined 2022 cost as $85 million even if the math doesn't add up — implying other unreported components. But the LLM performs correct arithmetic on the given numbers, arriving at $77 million, which contradicts the ground truth total. Hence, the LLM's quantitative output does not match the ground truth. However, this suggests the ground truth may include additional entities or a reporting nuance not reflected in the component breakdown. Given the instructions require strict adherence to the ground truth, the LLM's calculation of $77 million for 2022 is incorrect *relative to the expected answer*, even if mathematically sound. Therefore, the LLM fails on quantitative accuracy due to mismatched totals. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies both companies, extracts correct values for each year and entity, and attempts comparison — showing sound reasoning structure. However, the final comparison (increase of $9 million vs $1 million) is wrong due to the sum error. (4) Correctness score is 6 because key components are accurate (individual values per company and year), but the final synthesis (total and delta) is incorrect, undermining the conclusion. Quantitative accuracy is 5 due to the major error in the summed total and resulting difference. Qualitative accuracy is 7 because reasoning process is logical and entities are correct. Contextual relevance is 9 — the answer directly addresses the question with appropriate structure and focus.",

The difference in service costs—DHR's $(44) in 2022 versus MDT's $64 in 2022—contributes to the contrasting financial impacts, with MDT's higher service cost contributing to a positive net cost while DHR's lower service cost supports a net benefit.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is significantly incorrect in its core quantitative claim. The ground truth states that DHR reported a net periodic pension *benefit* cost of $(32) (i.e., a $32 million benefit), and MDT reported a $37 million cost, resulting in a combined total of $5. However, the LLM incorrectly claims DHR's amount is $0 due to lack of explicit disclosure, which contradicts the ground truth. This leads to a completely wrong combined total of $37 million instead of $5. (2) The LLM correctly identifies MDT's $37 million net periodic pension benefit cost and $64 million service cost, which matches the ground truth. However, it fails to recognize DHR's $(32) million net cost and $(44) million service cost, instead asserting these are not reported and effectively zero—this is a critical error. The calculation of $37 + $0 = $37 is therefore factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to synthesize the correct data for DHR despite the ground truth confirming its values. It incorrectly infers absence of explicit disclosure as zero value, rather than recognizing negative values (benefits) may be reported in different formats or sections. The contrast in service costs—DHR's $(44) vs MDT's $64—is entirely missed, undermining the explanation of how service costs influence the total. (4) Scores are low due to major factual and calculation errors.

Additionally, the $97 million pension/OPEB mark-to-market gain is not mentioned in the original answer and appears to be fabricated or misattributed without support from the provided knowledge.

      "original_answer": "T reported a significant increase in Debt Maturing Within One Year from $7,467 million in 2022 to $9,477 million in 2023, indicating a growing short-term liquidity need. In contrast, VZ manages its short-term obligations through asset-backed debt secured by receivables and participation interest, with proceeds classified under Debt Maturing Within One Year and Long-Term Debt. VZ's strategy includes restricted cash and segregated accounts for debt servicing, limiting the impact on general liquidity. T's increase in short-term debt without similar structured arrangements suggests a more direct reliance on near-term financing, which may constrain its liquidity flexibility compared to VZ's structured approach.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, T's (AT&T's) Debt Maturing Within One Year increased from $7,467 million to $9,477 million (approximately $2,010 million increase), which the LLM rounds to $7.5B and $9.5B — this is acceptable as a rounding approximation. However, the LLM incorrectly states that VZ (Verizon) increased from $6.8B to $7.5B. The original answer does not provide VZ’s short-term debt figures for 2022 and 2023; instead, it emphasizes VZ’s structured asset-backed debt arrangements without citing specific year-over-year totals. Thus, introducing comparative numerical data for VZ that is not in the ground truth is a factual overreach and likely incorrect. (2) The calculation of AT&T’s increase (~$2B) is approximately correct, but VZ’s purported increase (~$0.7B) cannot be verified and is not supported by the original answer, undermining quantitative accuracy. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly infers that T’s rising short-term debt suggests greater reliance on unsecured short-term financing, while VZ uses structured, asset-backed mechanisms. It captures the contrast in liquidity strategies — securitization vs. direct borrowing — which reflects valid multi-hop reasoning based on the entities’ financial behaviors. However, it adds unsupported specifics about VZ’s short-term debt levels, weakening the reasoning chain. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response directly addresses the comparative liquidity strategies and links them to the observed debt trends. Despite incorrect or fabricated numbers for VZ, the core conceptual contrast aligns with the original answer. The correctness score is limited by the introduction of false quantitative data for VZ, even though the strategic interpretation remains plausible.",

(2) The LLM adds a specific dollar amount—$84.3 billion in net sales for Sam's Club—from WMT's 10-K, which is factually correct and enhances the answer, though this specific number was not in the original ground truth. Since it does not contradict and supports the reasoning, it is a valid addition. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly connects PEP’s customer relationship with Walmart to the structure of WMT’s reportable segments, noting that Sam’s Club is a distinct segment in WMT’s 10-K. This aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on Sam’s Club being a material, reportable segment. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that Sam’s Club being a reportable segment underscores its significance as a material customer for PEP—this logical connection is implied but not articulated as clearly as in the original answer.

      "original_answer": "The 2023 salary increase assumption for DUK is in the range of 3.50% - 4.00%, while NEE assumes a higher rate of 4.90%. This difference impacts the projected growth of pension obligations, as higher salary increases lead to larger future liabilities.

According to the ground truth, Duke Energy's accounts payable to affiliated companies decreased by $26 million (from -$42 million in 2023 to -$68 million in 2024), but the LLM incorrectly states it decreased from $135 million to $67 million — a $68 million decrease — which is entirely inaccurate in both values and direction (the actual values are negative, indicating liabilities, while the LLM reports positive values). Southern Company’s numbers are partially correct: the LLM correctly states a decrease from $89 million to $75 million (a $14 million decrease), matching the ground truth. However, the combined net change is wrong: the LLM calculates $68M + $14M = $82M decrease, but the correct combined change is $26M + $14M = $40M decrease, and the ground truth states $14 million — which suggests possible misinterpretation of 'net change' (potentially net of other items or directional signs). But even under standard interpretation, $40M decrease is expected, not $14M or $82M. The LLM’s final combined decline of $82 million is therefore factually incorrect. (2) Number verification: Duke Energy’s values are completely wrong (135 → 67 vs. -42 → -68); Southern Company’s values are correct (89 → 75, Δ=-14M). Calculations: Duke’s Δ should be -26M (not -68M), Southern’s is correct at -14M; sum should be -40M (not -82M). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model identifies both companies and the correct metric and time period, showing proper entity alignment and intent to synthesize. However, due to incorrect source data for Duke Energy, the synthesis fails. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major numerical and directional errors; Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) — only Southern’s numbers are right; Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the reasoning structure and entity identification are sound; Contextual relevance is high (9/10) — the answer addresses the right question with correct framing and format.",

Additionally, the LLM inflates Chevron's total costs and expenses to $175.3 billion, which is more than triple the correct value of $46,167 million. (2) Calculations are fundamentally flawed: the sum of non-existent quarterly figures is invalid, the difference in DD&A is incorrect, and the percentages (18% and 4%) are based on false inputs.

Difference: LLM computes $196 million ❌, correct difference is $2,166M - $134M = $2,032M. Percentage: LLM says ~0.7% (using $196M / $26.9B), but correct is $2,032M / $26,914M = 7.55% ≈ 7.6% ❌. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to compare SG&A expenses and compute the revenue proportion, which shows correct structural reasoning, but the synthesis fails due to using an incorrect value for TXN. The model likely confused TXN's total operating expenses or another metric with SG&A. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and calculation errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because most numbers and the final percentage are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the model understands the required operations (difference, proportion) and entities (NVDA, TXN, SG&A, net revenue). Contextual relevance is high (8/10) as the answer addresses the right companies, time period, and financial concepts, just with incorrect data.",

The format '14 %' (with a space) is a minor typographical variation but does not affect accuracy.\n\n3) The reasoning is sound and captures the multi-hop aspect: it connects Walmart's global physical and digital retail presence with the significance of PEP's revenue dependence on this single customer. While the LLM does not explicitly mention the concentrate sales to independent bottlers (a minor omission in the supply chain detail), it correctly infers the strategic importance of the relationship to PepsiCo's earnings.\n\n4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original in intent and factual content. It addresses both parts of the question: the quantitative share (14%) and the qualitative significance of the relationship with a major global retailer. The omission of the bottler detail slightly reduces qualitative accuracy but does not undermine the core correctness.

MDT's total Non-U.S. pension payments over the next 10 years amount to $666 million.

It also correctly reports Medtronic’s (MDT) non-U.S. pension payments over the next 10 years as $666 million. These values match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation of the shortfall ($1,184M - $521M = $663M) is accurate, and the comparison to MDT’s $666M payments is correctly framed as 'slightly lower', which aligns with the original answer’s conclusion that they are 'nearly equivalent'. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (DHR and MDT), correctly attributes the shortfall to the combined plans (though it only cites Danaher’s ABO and assets, implying the total), and compares it to MDT’s future payments. However, there is a minor ambiguity: the original answer states the $1,184M ABO and $521M assets are *across both companies*, but the LLM attributes them solely to Danaher, which could mislead. Despite this, the final shortfall figure is correct, suggesting the model used the correct aggregated values. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question with precise data and meaningful comparison. The only deduction is for the slight misattribution of the aggregate figures to Danaher alone, though the net result remains factually accurate.

BAC's interest benefit is part of a broader accrual for interest and penalties related to income taxes, which stood at $105 million at December 31, 2024. MET's interest benefit of $4 million is included in other expenses and reflects its overall liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which could increase or decrease in the next 12 months due to potential U.S. federal tax legislation or regulatory changes.

      "original_answer": "For BKNG, indirect taxes increased general and administrative expenses in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher travel transaction taxes and digital services taxes, which were driven by improved revenue performance. For GM, indirect taxes contributed to liabilities through potential retrospective recoveries and adjustments tied to unique events, such as recent Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting salaried workers in GMI. These differing business factors—BKNG's tax exposure from transaction-based growth and GM's legal and settlement-related tax impacts—show how indirect taxes influence each company's financial obligations through distinct operational and regulatory channels.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Booking Holdings (BKNG)** – The 2021 rise in indirect taxes – such as travel‑transaction and digital‑services taxes that are calculated on the higher travel‑booking revenue – was recorded as part of the increase in General & Administrative expenses (G&A rose to $620 million from $581 million) because the company’s revenue growth directly raised the tax bases on which those levies are assessed【page_64】.  \n\n- **General Motors (GM)** – Indirect‑tax issues generate a **potential settlement liability** (or benefit) in the “adjustments” line of the segment results; GM disclosed a possible settlement with third parties over retrospective recoveries of indirect taxes, which reflects disputes with tax authorities on past indirect‑tax payments in its GMI segment【page_99†a】【page_100†a】.  \n\nThus, BKNG’s indirect‑tax changes affect operating costs through higher G&A as revenue expands, while GM’s indirect‑tax changes affect the bottom line through a contingent settlement related to past tax recoveries, driven respectively by travel‑booking growth and tax‑authority litigation over historic indirect‑tax filings.",

(1) For BKNG, it correctly identifies that indirect taxes (travel-transaction and digital-services taxes) increased general and administrative (G&A) expenses in 2021 due to higher revenue, which matches the original answer’s explanation. The dollar figures for G&A ($620M in 2021 vs $581M in 2020) are correctly cited and support the claim of an increase, though the original answer does not include these specific numbers—this is an enhancement, not an error. (2) For GM, the LLM accurately states that indirect taxes contribute to potential settlement liabilities through retrospective recoveries, particularly in the GMI segment, and ties this to disputes with tax authorities, which aligns with the ground truth’s reference to Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting salaried workers. While the LLM does not explicitly name the Korea Supreme Court, it captures the essence of legal/tax authority disputes leading to contingent liabilities.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains partially correct information but includes significant factual inaccuracies and misrepresentations, particularly regarding the financial statement presentation and classification of pension-related items for PEP and WMT. (1) Quantitatively, the LLM answer omits the specific dollar amounts for WMT's 'other (gains) and losses' ($1,538 million in 2023 and $3,027 million in 2024) mentioned in the ground truth, which are critical for accuracy. These numbers are not optional details but key data points that define the magnitude and trend of the impact. (2) The LLM incorrectly states that PepsiCo presents pension activity as a separate line item called 'Other pension and retiree medical benefits income' that is included in operating profit. The ground truth does not confirm this specific line item name or its placement in the income statement before net interest; rather, it describes PEP's 'other gains and losses' as embedded within pension expense calculations influenced by actuarial assumptions. There is no evidence in the ground truth that PEP includes these gains/losses in operating profit, nor that they are presented as a standalone line item. (3) The claim that Walmart rolls pension-related gains into 'Other (gains) and losses' is plausible but not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth, which only states that WMT reports this line item with specific amounts and that it impacts income before taxes. The ground truth does not specify that these amounts are pension-related, so attributing them solely or primarily to pensions is an unsupported inference. (4) The reasoning contrast—PEP's items affecting operating performance vs. WMT's being non-operating—is a plausible interpretation but goes beyond the ground truth, which emphasizes differences in presentation (embedded in pension expense vs. standalone line item) and nature (actuarial/long-term vs. immediate/one-time), not operating vs. non-operating classification. The LLM introduces a structural income statement claim (placement relative to operating profit) not present in the original answer. (5) While the answer addresses the comparative aspect of the question and attempts multi-hop synthesis between PEP and WMT, it distorts the nature and presentation of the items. Semantic equivalence is not achieved due to these material misstatements. The contextual relevance is high because the response stays on topic and attempts to compare financial statement treatment and impact on performance. However, correctness is compromised by unsupported specifics and missing quantitative data.",

(1) The individual values for Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized are correct: DUK = $158 million and NEE = $1,034 million, summing to the correct combined total of $1,192 million. Capital expenditures are correctly reported as $939 million for DUK and $9,302 million for NEE. (2) Calculations are accurate: the combined capex is correctly implied at $10,241 million, and the LLM correctly states that the combined interest ($1,192M) is about 12% of combined capex ($10,241M), which is mathematically sound (1,192 / 10,241 ≈ 11.6%, rounded to 12%). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is correctly synthesized across two companies and two financial metrics (interest paid and capex) for 2023. (4) While the LLM does not explicitly break down the comparison to each company’s individual capex (e.g., 128% of DUK’s capex, 12.8% of NEE’s) as in the original answer, it provides a valid and relevant alternative summary by focusing on the combined capex comparison. This omission is minor and does not detract from overall correctness, as the core question—combined interest and comparison to capex—is fully addressed. Wording differs but semantic meaning and factual content are equivalent. All entities (DUK, NEE, 2023, correct metrics) are accurate.

The $50 million figure for GE is unverified and not part of the ground truth, making it a significant factual overreach. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in linking actuarial assumption changes to pension expense sensitivity, but fails in synthesis by fabricating a specific dollar impact for GE that was not in the source data. The original answer draws a qualitative parallel between Union Pacific and GE on sensitivity, but does not provide or imply a $50 million effect for GE. (4) The correctness score is reduced due to the introduction of incorrect quantitative data for GE, despite the correct Union Pacific figure.

It accurately reports the $459 million revenue impact on Starbucks and the 15% growth in NIKE Direct. However, it states total Nike revenue grew 5% to $46.7 billion, while the ground truth specifies a 6% currency-neutral revenue increase—this discrepancy affects quantitative accuracy. The $46.7 billion figure may be factual, but the 5% growth conflicts with the 6% currency-neutral figure in the original, and the LLM does not clarify currency effects. For Starbucks, the LLM mentions only a $19 million (0.3%) rise in International net revenues and a $250 million segment gain, but the ground truth emphasizes a $459 million international revenue loss and a 33% drop in international operating income to $833.2 million—this key financial impact is underreported. (2) The $459 million figure is correct. The NIKE Direct 15% growth is accurate. However, the 5% total revenue growth for Nike is inconsistent with the 6% currency-neutral growth in the original, and the LLM introduces $46.7 billion without confirming if that matches the knowledge graph. The Starbucks international revenue change is misrepresented as a $19 million increase rather than a $459 million decline, which is a major quantitative error.

      "original_answer": "The $5.00 billion note issued by NVDA in June 2021 led to a $52 million increase in interest expense (from $184 million in fiscal year 2021 to $236 million in fiscal year 2022). This increase in interest expense reflects the direct cost of borrowing. However, NVDA also reported $107 million in income from 'Other, net' in fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by unrealized gains from investments in non-affiliated entities. This suggests that while the debt issuance increased financial costs, NVDA was able to offset some of that burden through investment gains. If TXN were to issue similar debt, they would face comparable interest costs, which could constrain financial flexibility by diverting funds from operations or capital investments. TXN’s ability to manage this burden would depend on their capacity to generate offsetting income streams, such as from investment gains or operational efficiencies, as NVDA did.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s $5 billion senior note issued in June 2021 added roughly $52 million of interest expense in FY 2022 (interest expense rose to $236 million from $184 million), which ate into the “Other income (expense), net” line – even though that line still showed a $107 million gain because of unrealized investment gains. If Texas Instruments were to issue comparable debt in today’s market, the additional interest cost would similarly depress its “Other income (expense), net” and, as TXN warns, could divert cash that would otherwise support operations, acquisitions or share‑repurchase programs, thereby tightening its financial flexibility.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key facts: NVDA's $5.00 billion debt issuance in June 2021, the increase in interest expense from $184M to $236M (a $52M increase), and the $107M gain in 'Other, net' in FY2022 due to investment gains. These numbers match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $5 billion = $5.00 billion). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $52M increase is correctly calculated ($236M - $184M), and all financial figures are accurately represented. (3) The reasoning correctly links the debt issuance to higher interest expense, explains its impact on 'Other income (expense), net' (even though the line remained positive due to gains), and extends the logic to TXN by noting how similar debt would affect their financial flexibility—diverting cash from operations, acquisitions, or share repurchases. This reflects sound multi-hop reasoning across NVDA’s actual data and TXN’s hypothetical scenario. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly rephrases the impact on 'Other income (expense), net' as if interest expense directly reduces that line, whereas in GAAP reporting, interest expense is typically separate from 'Other, net'. However, in NVDA’s 10-K, interest expense is included in 'Other, net', so the characterization is contextually accurate. The answer also appropriately infers TXN’s risk based on NVDA’s example and adds relevant context about TXN’s potential use of cash, aligning with their shareholder communications. Thus, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high score.",

According to the ground truth, both Costco and Philip Morris experienced decreases in lease costs, but the LLM incorrectly states that Philip Morris's lease costs increased from $403M to $448M (+11%), when in fact they decreased. The ground truth indicates that the difference in lease cost changes is $109M, with Costco showing an 8.7% decrease and Philip Morris a 6.7% decrease. The LLM reports a $90M decrease for Costco (vs. correct $109M difference), and falsely claims Philip Morris had an increase, which contradicts the ground truth. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: the claimed $135M gap in changes is wrong because it compares a $90M decrease to a $45M increase, whereas both companies actually decreased, and the $109M difference refers to the gap in the magnitude of their decreases, not a net difference between decrease and increase. Additionally, the LLM reports a 13% decrease for Costco, but the correct figure is 8.7%, making the percentage error significant. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly extract and synthesize the lease cost trends for both companies, incorrectly inferring an increase for Philip Morris, which invalidates the comparison. The conclusion that Costco had the larger percentage decrease is correct in direction but based on incorrect data (13% vs actual 8.7%), and the reasoning fails because Philip Morris did decrease, not increase. (4) Scores are low due to fundamental errors in quantitative data and directional trends.

This is a significant underreporting. The AMD Xilinx acquisition value of $35 billion is correctly reported. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: the LLM claims AVGO's notes were 'about $30 billion less' and 'one-seventh' the size of AMD's deal, but the actual difference is $19.5 billion, and $15.5B is roughly 44% of $35B (not one-seventh).

For MO in 2021, the correct value is $45.22, while the LLM states $46.84—this is close but still inaccurate. The calculated difference in the LLM answer is $291.60, whereas the correct difference is $430.84 ($476.06 - $45.22), a substantial miscalculation. (2) These quantitative errors undermine the core of the answer, as the question hinges on precise financial figures and their comparison. While the LLM correctly identifies the companies (COST and MO) and the relevant metric (weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs), the incorrect numbers lead to an erroneous difference. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—multi-hop synthesis is attempted by comparing RSU valuations across two companies and years and interpreting the implication—and the conclusion about relative valuation is directionally reasonable (higher RSU value suggests higher company valuation or market confidence). However, the flawed inputs invalidate the quantitative conclusion. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses both parts of the question: the numerical difference and its implication.

(2) The dollar amounts used by the LLM for COP—$12.13 in 2020 and $30.63 in 2021—appear to be fabricated or misattributed, as they do not align with the known data that would produce an 89% increase. For CVX, the LLM reports $11.11 in 2020 and $29.10 in 2021, which does result in approximately a 162% increase and matches the ground truth trend, suggesting this data point may be accurate.

GM Financial also identified no impairment indicators in its leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, despite a potential future decline in used vehicle prices, which were still expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.

The LLM correctly identifies that BKNG's conclusion was based on internal assumptions about cash flow recovery and discount rates for OpenTable and KAYAK, reflecting expectations of post-COVID travel recovery.

The combined total is stated as 'approximately $5.2 billion,' which is a rounded but acceptable representation of the exact $5.18 billion (sum of $680 million and $4.5 billion). The minor rounding is permissible under semantic equivalence. (2) All numeric values are accurate: $680 million for ABT and $4.5 billion for PFE are exact matches. The sum is correctly approximated—$680 million + $4.5 billion = $5.18 billion, and stating it as $5.2 billion is a reasonable rounding. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (ABT and PFE) for the same year (2021), computes the total, and interprets the implication regarding tax uncertainty exposure. It correctly notes that Pfizer’s larger amount drives most of the combined risk, which is a valid qualitative inference. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both the quantitative total and the qualitative interpretation about tax uncertainty. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of the precise $5.18 billion figure, opting instead for $5.2 billion, which prevents a perfect 10 but still reflects high accuracy. Thus, scores are high across all dimensions, with correctness at 9 due to the slight rounding without explicit qualification.",

It reports General Motors' Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes as $10,403 million, which is incorrect — the ground truth is $12,716 million. This number appears to be confused with GM's operating income, which the LLM later cites as $12,357 million (also incorrect; ground truth is $10,465 million). Amazon's pre-tax income ($37,557M) and operating income ($36,852M) are correctly reported. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: the combined pre-tax income is incorrectly calculated as $47,960 million (vs. correct total of $50,273 million). The LLM also claims that combined operating income ($49,209M) is $1.25B *higher* than combined pre-tax income, which is factually backward — in reality, pre-tax income should be higher than operating income due to non-operating items, and the correct combined pre-tax income is actually higher than operating income. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly identifies GM's metrics, swaps operating and pre-tax income values, and draws an invalid conclusion about the relationship between operating and pre-tax income. It does not correctly analyze that GM’s pre-tax income exceeds operating income due to positive non-operating items — instead, it inverts the logic.

      "original_answer": "Chevron's proved reserves are concentrated with approximately 86% located in OECD countries, which are typically characterized by stable regulatory environments and strong governance frameworks. This geographic concentration likely reduces Chevron's exposure to political and regulatory risks compared to ExxonMobil, which manages a more globally dispersed portfolio of reserves, including both consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. ExxonMobil explicitly notes that its reserves estimates are subject to regulatory changes, fiscal and commercial terms, government policies, and consumer preferences, which vary significantly across jurisdictions. Therefore, ExxonMobil’s broader and less concentrated reserves base likely increases its exposure to geopolitical and regulatory volatility compared to Chevron’s more OECD-focused reserves position.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s proved reserves are heavily weighted toward OECD nations—about 86 percent—so the company is largely exposed to the relatively stable, predictable regulatory frameworks and lower political‑risk environments that characterize those economies. ExxonMobil’s reserves are spread across the United States, Canada, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia/Oceania, and its disclosed risk factors note that the timing and amount of reserve recovery can be affected by “regulatory approvals, government policies, … consumer preferences” in each of those jurisdictions; this broader geographic mix subjects ExxonMobil to a wider range of regulatory and political risks, even though diversification can soften the impact of any single country’s adverse actions.",

However, the LLM incorrectly states that both companies use an 'undiscounted cash flow test for long-lived assets'—the ground truth specifies only COST uses this method for long-lived assets; MO’s filing relates to goodwill and intangible assets, not long-lived tangible assets. This mischaracterization of MO’s methodology for long-lived assets introduces a factual inaccuracy in the comparison. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: 10% discount rate and 2% growth rate are accurately reported, and there are no incorrect calculations. The absence of disclosed impairment charges for both firms in 2022 is correctly stated, though the ground truth notes MO’s tests were performed in 2021, not 2022—a minor but relevant discrepancy the LLM overlooks.

      "original_answer": "EMR provides a granular breakdown of its Net Periodic Pension Expense, showing specific components like service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and net amortization for both U.S. and Non-U.S. plans across multiple years. For 2022, EMR reports a Net Periodic Pension Expense of $(3) million for U.S. plans and $5 million for Non-U.S. plans. In contrast, RTX only mentions the existence of a section titled 'The components of the net periodic pension (income) expense' without disclosing any actual figures or breakdowns, indicating a less transparent approach to pension reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "EMR’s 10‑K breaks out the pension numbers by geography – the tables on pages 64 and 66 list U.S. and non‑U.S. service cost, interest cost, expected return, discount rates and the resulting net periodic pension expense for each year. Raytheon Technologies, by contrast, reports pension expense only in aggregate (pages 96‑100) and merely notes that most of its obligations are U.S.‑qualified plans, without providing a separate U.S./non‑U.S. expense line. This shows that EMR adopts a more granular, transparent disclosure of its pension obligations, while RTX relies on higher‑level, less detailed reporting.",

(1) It correctly identifies EMR's granular disclosure of U.S. and non-U.S. Net Periodic Pension Expense, including specific components like service cost, interest cost, and expected return, while noting RTX's lack of detailed figures. Although the LLM does not explicitly state the 2022 dollar amounts ($(3) million for U.S. and $5 million for Non-U.S.) from the ground truth, this omission is minor given the focus on comparative disclosure practices rather than exact numbers. (2) No incorrect numbers are presented; the absence of specific dollar figures does not constitute a factual error but a slight reduction in quantitative completeness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that EMR provides geographic breakdowns while RTX only offers aggregate reporting and mentions plan types without figures, leading to a valid conclusion about transparency differences. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing the contrast in reporting detail and inferring transparency practices. The mention of specific 10-K pages adds precision. Overall, the answer captures the essence and factual basis of the ground truth with high fidelity, warranting a correctness score of 9.",

      "original_answer": "The combined increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to current year tax positions for META and T in 2024 is $3,251 million ($2,882 million from META and $369 million from T). This represents a significant increase compared to their respective 2023 figures, where META's increase was $1,204 million and T's was $1,026 million, totaling $2,230 million. Therefore, the 2024 combined increase is $1,021 million higher than in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024 the increase in unrecognized tax benefits tied to current‑year tax positions was $2.882 billion for Meta and $0.369 billion for AT&T, a combined $3.251 billion. By comparison, the prior‑year (2023) increases were $1.204 billion for Meta and $1.026 billion for AT&T, or $2.230 billion in total—meaning the 2024 combined increase was about $1.0 billion larger than the combined 2023 increase.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key numerical values: Meta's 2024 increase ($2.882 billion = $2,882 million), T's 2024 increase ($0.369 billion = $369 million), combined 2024 increase ($3.251 billion = $3,251 million), Meta's 2023 increase ($1.204 billion = $1,204 million), T's 2023 increase ($1.026 billion = $1,026 million), and the total 2023 increase ($2.230 billion = $2,230 million). The comparison correctly notes that the 2024 combined increase is about $1.0 billion higher than 2023, which aligns with the ground truth difference of $1,021 million. (2) All calculations are accurate: 2,882 + 369 = 3,251; 1,204 + 1,026 = 2,230; 3,251 - 2,230 = 1,021. The LLM rounds $1,021 million to 'about $1.0 billion', which is a reasonable approximation and does not misrepresent the data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (Meta and T) and two years (2024 and 2023), computes totals, and makes a valid year-over-year comparison. The use of 'AT&T' instead of 'T' is semantically acceptable as T is the ticker for AT&T. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing both parts of the question: the combined 2024 increase and the comparison to prior year. The only minor deduction is for the slight rounding of $1,021 million to 'about $1.0 billion' without specifying the exact difference, which slightly reduces precision in qualitative terms, hence a 9 instead of 10 in qualitative accuracy.

The total difference between the two companies' net deferred income tax positions is $15,303 million.

(1) Quantitatively: The net deferred tax asset for CAT is correctly stated as $2,180 million (presented as $2.2 billion, which is a reasonable rounding). UNP's net deferred tax liability is accurately reported as approximately $13.1 billion, close to the exact $13,123 million. The difference is approximately $15.3 billion, and the LLM's 'roughly $15 billion' is a reasonable approximation. The valuation allowance for CAT is exactly correct at $934 million. (2) Calculations: The explanation that gross deferred tax assets of $5.2 billion minus the $934 million valuation allowance results in a net asset of $2,180 million is correct. For UNP, the LLM mentions $13.9 billion in liabilities less $824 million in assets, resulting in ~$13.1 billion net liability—this aligns with the ground truth net liability of $13,123 million, though the component figures are not in the original answer; however, they are plausible and do not contradict the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly synthesizes data across two companies (CAT and UNP), computes the effective difference, and explains the role of valuation allowances in CAT’s financial position—addressing both sub-questions. (4) Wording differences (e.g., 'modest asset' vs 'large liability') are interpretive but contextually appropriate.

The ExxonMobil Syncrude (67 k bbl/d) and Kearl (249 k bbl/d) figures are correct. However, due to the incorrect COP value, the final sum is wrong: 936 + 67 + 249 = 1,252 k bbl/d (LLM) vs. the correct total of 173 + 67 + 249 = 489 k bbl/d. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised—while two of the three input numbers are correct, the erroneous COP production value and the resulting miscalculation of the total significantly undermine the answer. The calculation method (simple addition) is correct, but the inputs are flawed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model identifies the need to combine production from three sources across two companies (COP and ExxonMobil’s two operations). However, it fails in retrieving the correct value for COP, indicating a failure in data retrieval or synthesis for that entity. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the model correctly interprets the question, identifies the relevant entities and operations, and attempts the correct aggregation.

(2) Number verification: NFLX 2023: $2,076.9 million (correct, matches $2,076,899,000); T 2023: $20,905 million (incorrect, should be $20.905 million); sum: $2,076.9M + $20,905M = $22,981.9M (wrong due to unit error); correct sum: $2,076.899M + $20.905M = $2,097.804M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly attempts to synthesize data across two companies and two years and compute a comparison, showing awareness of the required logic. However, the reasoning fails due to a critical unit misinterpretation (mixing millions and thousands). (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (3/10) due to severe numerical inaccuracies despite correct entities and structure. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2/10) due to order-of-magnitude errors and incorrect totals. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4/10) as the approach and terminology are correct, but execution fails. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) because the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate framing and structure.",

      "original_answer": "The combined change in Total Comprehensive Income (Loss) from 2022 to 2023 for Google and Verizon is an improvement of $3,021 million. Specifically, Google’s Total Comprehensive Loss decreased from $7,603 million in 2022 to $4,402 million in 2023, a positive change of $3,201 million, largely driven by a $2,512 million increase in unrealized gains on investments. Meanwhile, Verizon’s Total Comprehensive Loss improved from $1,865 million in 2022 to $1,380 million in 2023, a positive change of $485 million, primarily due to a $536 million unrealized gain on fair value hedges.

According to the ground truth, Google’s Total Comprehensive Loss improved from $7,603 million to $4,402 million (a $3,201 million improvement), and Verizon’s improved from $1,865 million loss to $1,380 million loss (a $485 million improvement), resulting in a combined improvement of $3,021 million. However, the LLM claims Google had no change and attributes the entire improvement to Verizon, incorrectly stating Verizon improved by $1.34 billion (from -$856M to +$485M), which contradicts the ground truth on both the direction (Verizon still reports a loss in 2023) and magnitude. (2) Specific number verification: Google’s unrealized gains contribution is stated as only $88M improvement in hedges and minor changes in securities, totaling near zero, whereas ground truth reports a $2,512 million increase in unrealized gains on investments—this is a massive understatement. For Verizon, the LLM correctly identifies a $536 million gain on fair value hedges, which matches the ground truth, but incorrectly frames other components and total impact. The claim that Verizon went from a loss to a gain in total comprehensive income is false—it remained a loss, just smaller. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the comprehensive income changes across both companies and years, miscalculates the direction and magnitude of changes, and incorrectly concludes Google had no change. It also fails to compute the correct combined change of $3,021 million, instead reporting ~$1.34 billion, which is less than half the correct value. (4) Despite these major errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, time frame, and financial concepts (unrealized gains, hedges, comprehensive income), and attempts multi-hop analysis.

      "original_answer": "Booking.com estimated a reasonably possible loss of €20 million ($22 million) related to VAT assessments in France, based on potential adverse impacts from a court decision, and did not accrue any liability for Italian VAT audit recommendations of €154 million ($175 million) or Turkish tax assessments totaling 813 million Turkish Lira ($61 million), as it believes it is in compliance with applicable laws. In contrast, GM accrued $2.8 billion in warranty recall campaign liabilities, including $2.0 billion for the Chevrolet Bolt recall, and estimated its reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be insignificant, indicating a higher degree of certainty in its obligations. This reveals that Booking.com's contingent liabilities are largely uncertain and under dispute, while GM's liabilities were more quantifiable and largely covered by supplier reimbursements, resulting in minimal additional exposure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies regarding quantitative disclosures. According to the ground truth, Booking.com did **not** accrue a liability for its VAT-related contingencies in Italy (€154M) or Turkey (₺813M / $61M), and only disclosed a reasonably possible loss of €20M ($22M) related to France. However, the LLM incorrectly states that Booking.com 'has accrued a liability' for VAT audits and implies a range of possible losses, which contradicts the original answer—Booking.com explicitly did not accrue for major exposures and only provided point estimates, not ranges. Similarly, GM’s $2.8B accrual and $2.0B Bolt-specific cost are omitted, and while the LLM correctly notes that GM views excess loss as 'insignificant,' it fails to mention the key detail about supplier reimbursements reducing exposure, which is central to the qualitative comparison. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: no correct numbers are cited from either company—Booking.com’s €20M/$22M, €154M/$175M, ₺813M/$61M, and GM’s $2.8B and $2.0B figures are all missing or misrepresented. The LLM invents the idea of a 'range of amounts' for Booking.com, which is not supported by the ground truth. (3) Reasoning and multi-hop synthesis are partially sound—the LLM correctly contrasts Booking.com’s uncertain tax contingencies with GM’s more certain recall liabilities and infers differing natures of obligation (tax vs. operational). However, it misses the critical insight that GM’s liabilities were largely covered by supplier reimbursements, weakening the comparative analysis. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the response addresses the core question about differences in estimation approaches and what they reveal about the nature of obligations. Despite incorrect facts, the structure and intent align well with the question.

However, it incorrectly calculates the 2023 combined total as 436 kb/d (81 + 355), while the ground truth is 426 kb/d. This suggests a possible typo or arithmetic error (81 + 355 = 436, but ground truth states 426). This quantitative discrepancy affects the comparison: LLM reports a 43 kb/d increase (≈11%), while the correct increase is 33 kb/d (426 - 393 = 33), or about 8.4%. (2) Number verification: Chevron and ExxonMobil individual values match the ground truth. The 2022 sum (66 + 327 = 393) is correct.

(2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable but assumed correct by absence. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing treatment across two companies with different reporting models—is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes that both expense the costs but with different line-item placements and timing nuances. (4) Minor wording difference: the LLM says Costco embeds costs 'at the point of sale (or shipment for e-commerce)', while the ground truth specifies 'at the point of shipment'—this is a slight overgeneralization but not factually incorrect, as shipment triggers recognition. Also, the LLM groups both under 'cost of sales' while the ground truth distinguishes 'merchandise costs' vs 'cost of sales'—but in Costco's case, merchandise costs are part of COGS, so this is semantically acceptable.

The average discount rate for MDT in 2022 is approximately 4.36% (midpoint of the range). This leads to a difference of about 1.66 percentage points (4.36% - 2.7%). A higher discount rate, as used by MDT, implies a lower present value of future pension obligations, suggesting that MDT's pension liabilities may be valued lower than DHR's for 2022, assuming similar future cash flows.",

The LLM does not explicitly calculate the midpoint (4.36%) or the 1.66 percentage point difference, but it correctly characterizes MDT's rate as a range and DHR's as 2.7%, so the omission of the exact average is minor and does not impair factual correctness. (2) The reasoning is sound: the explanation that a higher discount rate reduces the present value of future obligations, leading to lower pension liabilities (smaller projected benefit obligation for MDT), is correct and well-articulated. (3) Multi-hop synthesis across DHR and MDT filings is properly executed, with correct entity identification (Danaher and Medtronic, using both full names and tickers implicitly), correct year (2022), and correct financial concept (discount rate impact on liability valuation).

While BLK's value is approximately correct ($4.2B vs $4.165B), AXP's is severely inflated. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: $18.5B + $4.2B ≠ $7.165B. The sum itself is wrong, and one component is grossly inaccurate. Number formats are acceptable (e.g., $4.2 billion = $4,200 million), but the values do not match the source data. (3) The qualitative reasoning about the drivers is partially sound: AXP’s increase due to higher operating liabilities (book overdrafts, merchant payables, Membership Rewards liability) aligns with the original answer. Similarly, BLK’s outflows from accounts receivable and other assets, partially offset by accrued compensation and other liabilities, are correctly identified in direction and nature. This shows some correct multi-hop synthesis of the qualitative factors. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question—total cash flow and the differing contributions from operating assets/liabilities—so relevance is high.

      "question": "How does the treatment of the Allowance for Credit Losses differ between NFLX and T in their 2023 financial reporting, and what does this reveal about their respective risk exposure and financial strategies?",
      "original_answer": "NFLX disclosed that its Allowance for Credit Losses was not material as of December 31, 2023, indicating minimal risk in collecting receivables, likely due to its subscription-based model with recurring revenue and low credit risk from individual members. In contrast, T reported an ending balance of $756 million in its Allowance for Credit Losses for 2023, showing a significant provision for potential credit losses. This difference reveals that T faces higher credit risk, possibly due to business-to-business receivables with longer payment terms or higher exposure to economically sensitive customers. NFLX’s minimal allowance suggests a more stable and predictable cash flow, while T’s larger allowance reflects a more cautious financial strategy in managing credit exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s 2023 filing states that its allowance for credit losses “was not material” for the year, meaning the company recorded only a negligible provision on its subscription‑based receivables. In contrast, AT&T reports a $756 million balance in its Allowance for Credit Losses at year‑end 2023, reflecting a sizable provision for trade receivables, loans and contract assets. This contrast shows that Netflix’s business model generates very low credit‑risk exposure, while AT&T’s broader telecom and financing operations carry significant credit risk, prompting a more conservative provisioning strategy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that NFLX's allowance for credit losses was 'not material' as of 2023, and that T (AT&T) reported a $756 million allowance, matching the ground truth exactly in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Company names are accurately interpreted (NFLX as Netflix, T as AT&T), and the year 2023 is correctly referenced. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $756 million figure is correctly cited, and the characterization of NFLX's allowance as immaterial aligns with the original. No calculations are required, but the comparison is factually sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model synthesizes information from both companies' 2023 filings, contrasts their credit loss allowances, and correctly infers that Netflix’s subscription model leads to low credit risk while AT&T’s larger allowance reflects higher exposure, likely from B2B operations or financing activities. The conclusion about AT&T’s more conservative provisioning strategy is logically supported. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the reason for T’s higher risk (e.g., longer payment terms or economically sensitive customers), which is included in the ground truth and adds depth to the risk exposure analysis. However, the core insight about differing business models and risk profiles is clearly conveyed. Thus, the answer is factually complete and semantically equivalent with only slight omission in explanatory depth.",

      "question": "How do the dependencies of both Google and Verizon on market rates affect their respective credit facilities and borrowing costs, and what specific financial risks does this expose each company to?",
      "original_answer": "Google's credit facilities are tied to market rates, with $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and $6.0 billion in April 2028, and interest rates are determined using market rates and sustainability progress. Verizon, on the other hand, faces increased borrowing costs and reduced financing availability due to exposure to market rate fluctuations. This exposes Google to potential increases in interest costs if market rates rise before refinancing, while Verizon risks higher debt servicing costs, reduced flexibility, and vulnerability during business downturns due to its significant reliance on external financing.",
      "llm_answer": "Google’s revolving credit facilities are priced off a formula that incorporates “certain market rates” (and sustainability‑goal metrics). Because no amount is currently drawn, a rise in those benchmark rates would simply raise the interest cost on any future borrowings, exposing Google to higher‑rate‑risk and the possibility that its cost of capital could increase faster than anticipated.  \n\nVerizon’s debt program is likewise tied to prevailing market rates; the 10‑K notes that “adverse changes in the financial markets, including increases in interest rates… could increase our cost of borrowing… and expose us to increased interest‑rate risk” (see VZ pages 16‑18). With roughly $128 billion of unsecured debt and a sizable revolving facility, a climb in market rates would lift interest expense on its variable‑rate obligations, tighten cash‑flow flexibility, and heighten refinancing and collateral‑requirement risks.",

      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer correctly captures the core financial risks both Google and Verizon face due to their exposure to market rates, with accurate qualitative reasoning and strong contextual relevance. It correctly identifies that Google's credit facilities are tied to market rates and sustainability metrics, and that while no funds are currently drawn, rising rates would increase future borrowing costs—aligning with the ground truth's concern about refinancing risk and rising interest costs. For Verizon, the LLM accurately notes its exposure to interest rate fluctuations, increased borrowing costs, and reduced flexibility, citing specific risks like cash flow pressure and refinancing challenges, which matches the original answer's emphasis on higher debt servicing costs and vulnerability during downturns.\n\nHowever, the quantitative accuracy is slightly lower because the LLM omits specific dollar amounts and expiration dates for Google’s credit facilities mentioned in the ground truth: $4.0 billion expiring in April 2024 and $6.0 billion in April 2028. While the LLM correctly references Google’s use of market rates, it fails to include these key figures, which are central to the multi-hop aspect of the question (i.e., linking specific credit facilities to market risk). Additionally, the $128 billion debt figure for Verizon is accurate and well-integrated, but the original answer does not specify this number, so its inclusion may reflect external knowledge—though consistent with public filings, it slightly exceeds the provided ground truth scope.\n\nThe reasoning is sound and synthesizes the implications of variable-rate exposure across both firms, demonstrating strong qualitative accuracy. The answer addresses all parts of the question: how market rates affect credit facilities and borrowing costs, and the specific financial risks each company faces. Wording differs but meaning is semantically equivalent in most aspects, except for the missing Google facility details. Hence, the correctness score is 8—core facts and risks are correct, but key quantitative details are omitted.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains minor inaccuracies in numerical precision. It reports Costco's dividends as $1.5 billion (actual: $1,498 million or ~$1.498B), Altria's as $6.4 billion (actual: $6,490 million or $6.49B), leading to a combined dividend estimate of ~$7.9B (actual: $7,988 million). Similarly, net income is rounded: Costco $5.9B (actual: $5,844M), Altria $2.5B (actual: $2,475M), resulting in combined net income of ~$8.4B (actual: $8,319M). The comparison conclusion—that dividends are slightly lower than net income—is correct, though the exact difference is $331M, not reflected numerically.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is high but not perfect. All figures are directionally accurate and within reasonable rounding, but precise values are slightly off. For example, $6.4B vs $6.49B for Altria’s dividends is a $90M understatement. Combined net income is overstated (~$8.4B vs $8.319B), affecting the implied difference. Calculations are logically sound but based on rounded inputs.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts dividend and net income figures for FY2022, aggregates across entities, and makes a valid comparative statement. Entity identification (Costco, Altria), metrics (cash dividends, net income), and time period (FY2022) are all accurate.\n\n4) The answer is contextually excellent—clearly structured, directly responsive, and semantically aligned with the ground truth. Minor rounding is acceptable under format flexibility, but because multiple figures are approximated and the final difference is not quantified, full quantitative accuracy is not achieved. A score of 8 reflects high correctness with small but notable numerical deviations.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities for Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra Energy (NEE) in 2023 is $24,088 million. Duke Energy reports $14,039 million in Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities, while NextEra Energy reports $10,049 million. The difference of $3,990 million is largely due to Duke Energy having significantly higher asset retirement obligations ($8,560 million) compared to NextEra Energy's asset retirement obligation regulatory expense difference ($4,066 million), indicating that Duke Energy faces a more immediate burden in asset retirement costs, which are likely tied to older infrastructure or differing regulatory requirements across their service territories.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 non‑current regulatory liabilities were **$14,039 million for Duke Energy** (see the “Regulatory liabilities” line under Other non‑current liabilities in Duke’s balance sheet) and **$10,049 million for NextEra Energy** (see the “Regulatory liabilities – Noncurrent” total in the NEE regulatory‑assets‑liabilities table). Together they amount to **approximately $24.1 billion**.\n\nDuke’s larger non‑current regulatory liability reflects its much bigger asset‑retirement obligation exposure – notably its extensive nuclear‑decommissioning trust funds and a broader portfolio of regulated generation assets that are accounted for as regulatory liabilities. NextEra’s lower figure shows how its regulatory environment (primarily FERC‑ and Florida PSC‑based accounting) allocates ARO costs more through regulatory assets and a smaller nuclear base, resulting in a comparatively smaller non‑current regulatory liability balance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly reports Duke Energy's Noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities as $14,039 million and NextEra Energy's as $10,049 million, matching the ground truth exactly. The combined total is stated as approximately $24.1 billion, which is a valid rounding of the exact sum ($24,088 million), so quantitative accuracy is perfect. (2) All numbers are correct: $14,039M + $10,049M = $24,088M, and the LLM's 'approximately $24.1 billion' is semantically equivalent. The difference of $3,990 million is implied though not explicitly stated, but the comparative analysis still holds. (3) The reasoning correctly identifies that Duke Energy's higher liability is due to greater asset retirement obligations (AROs), particularly from nuclear decommissioning and a larger regulated asset base. It accurately contrasts this with NextEra’s regulatory treatment under FERC and Florida PSC, noting that ARO costs are more often reflected in regulatory assets rather than liabilities, which aligns with the ground truth's implication about differing regulatory environments. The LLM adds contextual detail (e.g., nuclear decommissioning trusts, regulatory jurisdiction differences) that enhances the explanation without introducing error. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the specific ARO figures ($8,560M for DUK, $4,066M for NEE) from the ground truth, which slightly reduces qualitative completeness, but the core causal logic remains sound and well-supported.

      "question": "How do Google and Verizon estimate and allocate standalone selling prices for their respective bundled service and device contracts, and what impact does this have on their revenue recognition patterns?",
      "original_answer": "Google allocates revenues in contracts with multiple performance obligations based on the relative standalone selling price, which is generally determined by the prices charged to customers. Verizon, on the other hand, estimates standalone selling prices for wireless devices as their retail price excluding subsidies or discounts, and for wireless service as the price offered to customers on month-to-month contracts. Both companies use these standalone selling price estimates to allocate transaction prices between services and equipment in bundled contracts, which directly affects the timing and pattern of revenue recognition—Google recognizes revenue ratably over the contract term for subscription-based services, while Verizon recognizes equipment revenue at the point of delivery and service revenue over the enforceable contract term.",
      "llm_answer": "Google (Alphabet) treats a bundle of a subscription‑type service, a platform or an app purchase, and a device as a contract with multiple performance obligations.  It first determines each obligation’s **stand‑alone selling price** from the price actually charged to customers (i.e., the price listed for the service on a month‑to‑month basis and the retail price of the device excluding any subsidies) and then allocates the total transaction price to the obligations on that relative basis【page_58】.  As a result, **device revenue is recognized at the point of transfer (when the device is delivered and control passes), while service‑related revenue (e.g., subscriptions, cloud usage) is recognized ratably over the subscription or usage period**【page_58】.  \n\nVerizon follows a similar approach for its wireless bundles.  It estimates the **stand‑alone selling price of the device** as the retail price without subsidies or conditional discounts and the **stand‑alone selling price of the wireless service** as the price of an equivalent month‑to‑month, cancel‑any‑time plan【page_59】.  The total contract price is then allocated between equipment and service based on those estimates, causing **equipment revenue to be recorded when the device is delivered (or as a contract asset when subsidized) and service revenue to be spread over the contract term using an output method**, with contract liabilities created for the prepaid service portion【page_59‑60】.  \n\nThus, both companies use price‑charged‑to‑customers to derive SSPs, but the allocation determines whether revenue is recognized up‑front (device/equipment) or over time (service), shaping the timing of their revenue‑recognition patterns.",

(1) All key facts are correct: both Google and Verizon estimate standalone selling prices (SSP) based on prices charged to customers, with Verizon specifically using retail price excluding subsidies for devices and month-to-month plan prices for service. Google uses actual customer prices for services and retail device prices. Revenue allocation follows relative SSP, impacting revenue recognition timing. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no calculations were required, and none were misstated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes how SSP estimation methods differ slightly in context but are both based on observable prices, and how allocation drives different revenue recognition patterns—upfront for equipment (at point of delivery) vs. ratably over time for services. The mention of contract assets/liabilities and output method for Verizon adds appropriate detail beyond the ground truth but remains consistent. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong: while the LLM elaborates slightly more than the original (e.g., mentioning contract assets/liabilities), it does not introduce inaccuracies. One minor point: the original specifies Google recognizes subscription revenue ratably, while the LLM generalizes to 'service-related revenue'—still correct, but slightly less precise.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Oracle’s hybrid model with TI’s strategic shift toward direct engagement, and identifies the distinct benefits each company emphasizes—Oracle highlights performance-based compensation via direct sales, while TI emphasizes broader market reach, deeper customer insight, and higher product sell-through. The LLM captures TI’s investments in e-commerce, localized experiences, and inventory consignment indirectly through context (e.g., TI.com growth), though it does not explicitly mention 'consignment programs' or 'e-commerce enhancements' as operational investments. (4) This minor omission prevents a perfect 10 on qualitative accuracy, but the core reasoning and synthesis across companies and strategies are strong. The answer is fully relevant, directly addressing both companies’ sales strategies and the financial/operational benefits highlighted.",

The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM calculates ~$4,292 million, while the correct sum is $14,738 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low due to the major error in CVX's deficit figure, despite correct use of XOM's data and proper calculation logic (addition of two numbers). The format variations ($ million, billion) are acceptable, but the underlying numbers are not. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM identifies both companies, extracts relevant pension data, and attempts to sum them—but fails due to incorrect source data for CVX.

However, there is a critical error in the directional impact of a one-percentage-point increase in Abbott’s rebate rate: the LLM states this would *increase* the combined total by $227 million, whereas the ground truth specifies it would *decrease* the combined total by that amount. This suggests a misunderstanding of the financial mechanism—likely confusing an increase in expense with a reduction in net revenue or miscalculating the effect on provisions. (2) All numerical values (individual provisions, sum, and $227 million impact) are quantitatively accurate and correctly formatted. The arithmetic ($56.8B + $3.9B = $60.7B) is correct. The $227 million figure is correctly cited in magnitude but misapplied in direction. (3) The multi-hop reasoning correctly synthesizes data from both AbbVie and Abbott for 2023 and performs the required addition.

      "original_answer": "Oracle emphasizes the need to generate sufficient taxable income in specific jurisdictions to realize deferred tax assets, factoring in future growth, forecasted earnings, taxable income, jurisdictional mix, historical earnings, and tax planning strategies. Texas Instruments, on the other hand, focuses on external factors such as changes in U.S. or international tax laws and market conditions that could affect future taxable income, leading to adjustments in valuation allowances. Both companies tie changes in valuation allowances directly to net income in the period of determination, but Oracle includes potential adjustments to goodwill during acquisition measurement periods, while Texas Instruments highlights sensitivity to customer demand, technology shifts, and inventory write-offs as additional sources of financial uncertainty.",
      "llm_answer": "**Oracle** – Oracle follows the ASC 740 two‑step approach for uncertain tax positions: it first determines whether a position is “more‑likely‑than‑not” to be sustained and then measures the benefit at the largest amount that is more than 50 % likely to be realized.  To decide whether its deferred tax assets (DTAs) are realizable, Oracle records a valuation allowance unless it can “generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions” and looks at **future growth, forecasted earnings, the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, historical earnings, prior‑year taxable income (including any carry‑back rights) and any prudent tax‑planning strategies**【page_44】.  When the assessment changes, the valuation allowance (or its reversal) is recorded in the provision for income taxes and can also affect goodwill, thereby directly impacting earnings and net income.\n\n**Texas Instruments** – Texas Instruments evaluates the realizability of its DTAs by estimating **future taxable income, the timing and amount of cumulative losses and tax‑credit carryforwards, the expiration dates of those credits, and the effect of expected tax‑planning actions**.  If it concludes that it is not more‑likely‑than‑not that the DTAs will be recovered, it records a valuation allowance that reduces the DTA balance and is reflected in the income‑tax provision, thereby affecting the effective tax rate and net earnings.\n\n**Difference in impact** – Oracle’s assessment places heavier emphasis on jurisdiction‑specific growth prospects, historical earnings mix and the ability to use carry‑backs, and any change to the allowance can also adjust goodwill.  Texas Instruments’ assessment is driven primarily by projected taxable income versus cumulative losses and credit expirations, so changes to its allowance mainly affect the tax provision and effective tax rate.  Both approaches can cause material adjustments to earnings, but the specific factors each company weighs lead to different timing and magnitude of those adjustments in their financial statements.",

Texas Instruments' focus on future taxable income, cumulative losses, tax-credit carryforwards, expiration dates, and tax-planning actions is also correctly reported. The impact on financial reporting—valuation allowance changes affecting the tax provision, net income, and effective tax rate—is properly conveyed. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in terms of calculations, but all referenced concepts (e.g., 'more-likely-than-not') are used correctly. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in the two companies' approaches, highlighting Oracle’s inclusion of goodwill adjustments during acquisition periods and Texas Instruments’ sensitivity to market and operational risks (implied through credit expirations and income projections). While the LLM does not explicitly mention 'customer demand, technology shifts, and inventory write-offs' as Texas Instruments' sources of uncertainty (noted in the ground truth), it captures the essence via 'projected taxable income versus cumulative losses and credit expirations,' which are driven by those underlying business risks. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing the question about differences in impact on financial reporting and the specific factors each company considers. The only minor omission is the lack of explicit mention of external factors like tax law changes for Texas Instruments, though this is partially covered under 'expected tax-planning actions.'

(2) All numeric values are accurate: $439M and $1,675M are correct, and their sum is mathematically accurate (439 + 1,675 = 2,114). The use of 'about $2.1 billion' is a reasonable approximation of $2,114 million and does not misrepresent the total. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly identifies two separate companies, retrieves the correct metric (common stock repurchases), for the correct fiscal year (2022), and synthesizes the total.

This indicates a critical error in either data interpretation or source analysis. The LLM’s calculation of $77 million for COF may be factually correct based on its filing, but it fails to account for AXP’s actual increase, resulting in a significant underreporting. The reasoning is flawed because absence of explicit disclosure should not be interpreted as zero change in a multi-hop financial reasoning task — the model should have retrieved the actual values from the knowledge graph.

The combined 2023 total ($18,419 million) is accurately calculated. The 2023 difference ($8,817 million) and 2022 difference ($8,653 million) are correct. (2) All calculations are accurate: sum for combined total and differences across years are mathematically sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong—information is correctly synthesized across two companies and two years. However, there is a minor error in interpretation: the original answer states the difference decreased from $8,653M to $8,817M, which is an increase in the gap, but describes it as a change of -$164 million (i.e., a reduction in Duke's lead), which is ambiguous. The LLM correctly computes the widening of the gap by $164 million ($8,817M - $8,653M = +$164M) and states the gap widened, which is factually accurate. The ground truth’s phrasing 'decreased from $8,653M to $8,817M' is numerically incorrect (it increased), so the LLM answer is actually more logically consistent. (4) Despite this, the LLM slightly diverges in qualitative interpretation by saying the gap 'widened' while the original answer incorrectly claims it 'decreased', suggesting the LLM may have better reasoning. Scores reflect high accuracy with a minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to potential ambiguity in how 'difference' is framed, though the math and directionality are correct.",

      "original_answer": "$0 — Gulf Power ceased to exist as a separate operating segment of NEE effective January 1, 2022, after being fully merged into FPL. The intercompany agreements involving Gulf Power (with entities like Alabama Power and Mississippi Power) referenced in Southern Company's 10-K indicate Gulf Power participated in shared infrastructure and operational contracts prior to the merger, but these agreements no longer applied as Gulf Power was fully integrated into FPL's single ratemaking entity structure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022 Gulf Power was no longer reported as a stand‑alone operating segment of NextEra Energy; the January 1, 2022 merger of Gulf Power into Florida Power & Light combined Gulf Power’s generation, transmission and distribution assets with FPL’s, so that the former Gulf Power service area is now part of a single ratemaking entity and a single operating segment of NEE (see NEE 10‑K p. 38‑39). Because Gulf Power’s assets are now folded into the unified FPL segment, any inter‑company contracts it has with Southern Company subsidiaries (e.g., power‑purchase or fuel‑supply agreements) are reflected in the regulated‑utility results of the combined FPL segment and therefore influence NEE’s cost‑recovery clauses, fuel‑cost recoveries and operating cash flows (the Southern Company filing lists its subsidiaries and their audited schedules, indicating the existence of such inter‑company relationships – Southern Co 10‑K p. 344‑348).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer correctly identifies the key date (January 1, 2022) and the merger of Gulf Power into Florida Power & Light (FPL), aligning with the ground truth that Gulf Power ceased to exist as a separate segment. It accurately references the NEE 10-K pages and correctly states that Gulf Power is no longer a standalone operating segment, which supports a high quantitative accuracy score. However, the LLM makes a critical factual error in asserting that intercompany contracts between Gulf Power and Southern Company subsidiaries (e.g., power-purchase or fuel-supply agreements) still influence FPL’s regulated results in 2022. This contradicts the ground truth: Gulf Power was fully integrated into FPL, and any prior intercompany agreements with Southern Company entities (which were referenced in Southern Company’s filings) were historical and no longer applicable post-merger. The LLM incorrectly implies ongoing operational impact from these agreements on NEE’s regulated utility operations, when in fact they ceased with the dissolution of Gulf Power as a legal and operational entity. This reflects a failure in multi-hop reasoning: while the model correctly synthesizes information about the merger, it misinterprets the implications of Southern Company’s 10-K disclosures, which describe past arrangements, not current ones. The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured but fundamentally flawed in its conclusion about ongoing intercompany impacts, which undermines the qualitative accuracy and overall correctness. Thus, the correctness score is reduced to 4 due to this significant factual and logical error despite correct dates and structural details.",

It also accurately reports CMCSA's repurchase of 212 million shares for $8.6 billion and the dividend increase to $1.24 per share. However, the LLM introduces a new figure — '$4.8 billion in dividends' — which is not present in the original answer and not derivable from the provided ground truth (though it may be plausible in reality, it's an addition not supported by the source). 2) All numbers and calculations are correct: $4.38B - $0.691B = $3.689B ≈ $3.69B, and the CMCSA figures match exactly. Format variations like $0.691 billion vs $691 million are acceptable and equivalent. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Meta’s class-specific dividend payouts with CMCSA’s strategy of buybacks and dividend increases.

(2) Calculations: The LLM correctly notes a small change for CMCSA (down $2 million) but this is based on incorrect base values. META's year-over-year increase is approximately correct at $3.5 billion (actual: $3,463 million), and implied growth rate (~6.9%) is reasonable. However, the combined total is wrong due to CMCSA's misreported value. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and years, but fails on CMCSA's data, breaking the multi-hop logic. It compares YoY changes as requested, but one leg of the comparison is based on incorrect data. (4) Scores justified: Correctness scored low (4) due to major numerical inaccuracies, especially the severely understated CMCSA expense. Quantitative accuracy is 4 due to large magnitude errors despite partial correctness on META. Qualitative accuracy is 5 because reasoning structure is sound and entities are correctly identified (CMCSA, META, 2024, 'Other Costs and Expenses'), but synthesis fails on one key entity. Contextual relevance is 8 because the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate structure and terminology.",

      "original_answer": "MetLife's preferred stock dividends of $195 million in 2021 directly reduce the net income available to common shareholders, which was $6,353 million in that year. This highlights the financial obligation companies in the financial sector face in maintaining preferred dividend payments. Meanwhile, Bank of New York Mellon (BK) discloses several risk factors, such as regulatory constraints, capital adequacy requirements, and the potential impact of economic weakness or cybersecurity incidents, which could materially affect its ability to generate sufficient earnings and maintain dividend payments. Together, these factors imply that while preferred dividends are a binding obligation, broader operational and regulatory risks at firms like BK could constrain their ability to sustain such payments, thereby affecting the stability of shareholder returns across the financial sector.",
      "llm_answer": "MetLife’s statement of operations shows that preferred‑stock dividends are taken out of net income before calculating the amount “available to common shareholders” – $6,575 million of net income minus $195 million of preferred dividends leaves $6,353 million for common shareholders (page 160). In contrast, BNY Mellon’s risk‑factor discussion warns that higher funding costs, capital‑adequacy limits, and the need to meet preferred‑stock dividend obligations could restrict or even halt the company’s ability to pay dividends (pages 3‑4). Thus, MetLife’s impact is a predictable, disclosed reduction to common earnings, whereas BNY Mellon faces regulatory and liquidity risks that could make dividend payments more uncertain, implying that shareholder‑return stability is generally more predictable for insurers like MetLife than for banks that are exposed to broader capital‑and‑funding constraints.",

This matches the ground truth numerically and contextually. The reference to page 160 and pages 3–4 adds document-level precision, though not required. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts are correct, and the subtraction ($6,575M – $195M = $6,353M) is accurate. The years align (2021 implied), and no numbers are misstated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts MetLife’s predictable preferred dividend obligation with BNY Mellon’s risk factors (capital adequacy, funding costs, regulatory constraints) that could threaten dividend continuity. It synthesizes information across two companies and document sections, drawing a logical implication about shareholder return stability. (4) The only minor shortcoming is a slight overstatement in the conclusion—saying returns are 'more predictable for insurers like MetLife than for banks'—which generalizes beyond the two examples. The ground truth emphasizes sector-wide implications without making a comparative stability claim. Still, the core insight about binding obligations vs. external risks is preserved.

      "original_answer": "AXP recognizes Card Member Rewards expense in the period when members earn rewards, recording a liability based on expected redemptions and estimated cost of points, particularly for Membership Rewards, while COF records rewards expense as an offset to interchange income when rewards are earned and calculates its liability based on estimated future redemption costs, factoring in historical redemption behavior and program terms. These differences reflect distinct approaches to timing and estimation methodology in recognizing rewards-related costs.",
      "llm_answer": "- **American Express (Card Member Rewards)** – The reward expense is recorded in the period the card‑member actually earns the reward (i.e., when spending occurs).  A liability is created for the “Card Member rewards” that reflects the amount of rewards expected to be redeemed **plus** an estimate of the cost of the points earned, and it is adjusted for enrollment levels, attrition, volume of points earned and redemption costs.  \n\n- **Capital One (Customer Rewards)** – Rewards expense is also recognized when the customer earns the reward (recorded as an offset to interchange income).  The “customer rewards reserve” is a liability measured as the estimated future cost of all earned rewards that are expected to be redeemed, calculated using historical redemption and spending behavior and reduced as rewards are redeemed.  \n\nThus, both companies expense rewards when earned, but AXP’s liability incorporates enrollment‑ and attrition‑driven estimates of points and redemption costs, whereas COF’s reserve is based on a model of expected redemption cost derived from historical usage patterns.",

AXP records the expense in the period the card member earns the reward and establishes a liability based on expected redemptions and estimated cost of points, including adjustments for enrollment, attrition, and redemption behavior—this matches the original answer. COF records the expense as an offset to interchange income when earned and calculates the liability using historical redemption patterns and program terms, which the LLM accurately captures. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes disclosures from both companies’ 2023 10-Ks to compare timing (both recognize when earned) and differences in liability calculation methodology (AXP includes enrollment/attrition/volume dynamics; COF relies on historical behavior models). (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly underemphasizes that COF’s approach is explicitly tied to a 'model' of expected redemption cost, though it does mention 'historical redemption and spending behavior,' which implies modeling. Also, the original answer notes COF's liability is 'factoring in program terms,' which the LLM omits. These are minor omissions that do not detract from overall correctness.

This combined financial obligation indicates that Netflix bears a significantly larger interest burden, suggesting a more aggressive debt-financed strategy, particularly for content investment, compared to AT&T’s smaller interest payment, which may reflect a more conservative or mature capital structure.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix paid $684.5 million in interest in 2023 (“Interest paid 684,504” in the cash‑flow statement)【page_43】, while AT&T paid $7.37 billion in interest that year (“Interest $ 7,370” in the cash‑flow statement)【page_96】. Combined, the two companies expended roughly $8.05 billion in interest. This contrast shows Netflix’s relatively modest debt burden and disciplined financing, whereas AT&T’s much larger interest outlay reflects its far higher leverage and reliance on debt to fund its extensive capital‑intensive operations.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in the reported interest payments. According to the ground truth, Netflix paid $684,504,000 (correctly approximated as $684.5 million), but AT&T paid only $7,370,000 ($7.37 million), not $7.37 billion as stated. The LLM incorrectly reads AT&T's interest payment as $7,370 (thousands?) on page 96 as $7.37 billion, when it should be $7.37 million — a 100x overstatement. This leads to a grossly inflated combined total of $8.05 billion instead of the correct $691.874 million. (2) The calculation is therefore completely wrong: $684.5 million + $7.37 billion ≠ $8.05 billion (actual sum would be ~$8.054 billion if the AT&T number were correct, but it is not). The correct sum is ~$691.9 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect data synthesis: the model misreads AT&T’s interest expense magnitude, reversing the conclusion. Instead of Netflix having a much larger interest burden, the LLM claims AT&T does — which contradicts the ground truth. This flips the interpretation of debt strategies: in reality, Netflix’s high interest reflects aggressive debt use for content; AT&T’s low interest suggests conservative or de-leveraged management. The LLM draws the opposite and incorrect inference. (4) Despite correct citation formatting and addressing both companies and the combined total, the severe numerical and interpretive errors justify a very low correctness score.

      "original_answer": "Comcast incurs programming and content production costs primarily through multiyear distribution agreements with per-subscriber fees, and its monetization strategy focuses on individual content licensing and distribution. In contrast, Meta's content costs are embedded within broader cost of revenue and tied to infrastructure and partner arrangements, reflecting its ad-based and platform-driven monetization model. These differences show that Comcast's content costs are directly tied to subscriber growth and contractual programming fees, while Meta's are more aligned with maintaining technical infrastructure and platform partnerships to support ad delivery and product monetization.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast treats the creation and acquisition of film‑ and TV‑content as a long‑lived asset – it capitalizes owned production costs and the cost of licensed libraries (page 78) and then amortizes them over the estimated life of each title or usage pattern (page 77).  Revenue from that content is recognized when the film or program is delivered or licensed to a third‑party, often under multi‑year fixed‑price agreements (page 75), so the cost structure mirrors a “sell‑or‑license‑over‑time” monetization model.  \n\nMeta, by contrast, does not capitalize its video‑ or music‑licensing fees; it expenses them as incurred because the fees are tied directly to the amount of advertising or subscription revenue generated in the period (page 95).  Under ASC 606 Meta records ad revenue when impressions or actions are delivered (page 94), so its content costs are a short‑term, variable‑consideration expense that supports an advertising‑driven, on‑demand monetization strategy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth in both factual content and reasoning. (1) It correctly identifies Comcast's content cost structure as involving capitalization and amortization of programming costs over time (per pages 77-78), tied to multi-year licensing agreements, and matches this with a monetization model based on content licensing and distribution. It accurately contrasts this with Meta's approach of expensing content costs as incurred (page 95), due to their linkage with ad revenue, and ties this to an ad-driven, on-demand model under ASC 606 (page 94). (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes revenue recognition practices (ASC 606 for Meta, fixed-price licensing for Comcast) with cost treatment (capitalized vs. expensed) and links them to broader monetization strategies (subscription/licensing vs. advertising). The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention Meta's cost of revenue being embedded in infrastructure or partner arrangements, which is a nuance present in the ground truth. However, referencing ad-revenue-linked expenses and partner arrangements (page 95) implies this. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addresses the question about cost structures and monetization strategies using contractual obligations and revenue recognition.

While the ground truth cites 'efficiency of its manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter production,' the LLM states 'factory loading' as the key driver.

      "llm_answer": "CMCSA’s $10 billion sports‑rights spend is predicated on selling premium CPMs that are anchored to the high‑value audience and “must‑see” events (e.g., NFL, NBA) described in its 2024 filing (see pages 12‑14).  Meta’s 2024 filing makes clear that its newer formats (Reels) now monetize at a lower rate than its core Feed and Stories products and that broader targeting‑ and measurement‑limitations are pulling overall digital‑ad pricing down (pages 21‑23).  As the industry baseline for digital CPMs falls, advertisers will compare TV rates to cheaper digital inventory, putting pressure on CMCSA to either keep sports‑event CPMs at historically premium levels through strong audience demand or accept a gradual compression of those rates over the life of the agreements.",

(1) All key facts are correct: CMCSA's $10 billion investment in sports rights (including NFL and NBA through 2034), the reliance on premium CPMs for linear TV, and META's acknowledgment that Reels monetize at lower rates than Feed and Stories. The dollar amount ($10 billion) and the time horizon (through 2034) are correctly stated. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no calculations were required, but the financial figures and timeframes match exactly. Format variations (e.g., $10 billion vs $10 billion) are acceptable and do not affect meaning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes information from CMCSA’s content investment strategy and Meta’s monetization challenges to infer downward pressure on digital CPMs, which in turn could affect linear TV ad pricing. It accurately identifies the risk of CPM compression for CMCSA due to advertisers comparing cheaper digital inventory (Reels) with premium TV spots. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the potential need for CMCSA to 'increase volume' of ads to recoup investment, as noted in the original answer. However, the concept of 'gradual compression of those rates' and the trade-off between maintaining premium levels or accepting lower rates captures the core economic tension. Wording differs slightly but semantic equivalence is strong. Contextual relevance is excellent—the response directly addresses the impact of shifting digital ad baselines on CMCSA's ability to sustain premium CPMs over the term of its agreements.",

COP reported a net change in income taxes of $(14)$ million for 2024, indicating a slight negative adjustment, while XOM reported a significant positive adjustment of $42,591 million.

According to the ground truth, COP had a net change of $(14)$ million (a slight negative adjustment), and XOM had a massive positive adjustment of $42,591 million, resulting in a combined net change of $42,577 million. In contrast, the LLM claims COP had a $79 million decrease and XOM had a $3.756 billion decrease, leading to a combined $3.835 billion reduction—this is directionally and numerically wrong. The actual combined change is a large increase, not a decrease. (2) The numbers are grossly inaccurate: $3.756 billion vs. $42,591 million (over 10x difference for XOM), and $79 million decrease vs. $14 million decrease for COP (wrong sign and magnitude). The sum of $3.835 billion reduction is entirely incorrect; the correct combined change is a $42,577 million increase. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly interprets the direction of tax changes and misrepresents the scale of adjustments. It introduces details like 'discounted-future-cash-flow table' and 'standardized-measure table' not present in the original answer, suggesting possible hallucination. The ground truth emphasizes XOM’s large positive adjustment indicating increased tax liability or deferred tax assets, while the LLM describes large decreases, which contradicts the facts. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right companies and metric (net change in income taxes in 2024), but the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine the answer.

PepsiCo, while also citing the pandemic as a key factor in its impairment assessments, did not report any specific impairment charges related to it. Instead, PepsiCo emphasized its use of discounted cash flow models and qualitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets. The difference in outcomes stems from the specific exposure of Filorga's business model to pandemic-related restrictions, whereas PepsiCo's broader portfolio and internal forecasting did not trigger impairment charges during the same period.",
      "llm_answer": "Colgate‑Palmolive said that the pandemic‑related government restrictions and reduced consumer mobility in the duty‑free, travel‑retail and pharmacy channels forced it to cut its internal forecasts for the Filorga skin‑health reporting unit, which triggered an interim impairment review and led to a $204‑million trademark write‑down and a $367‑million goodwill charge. PepsiCo, on the other hand, treats COVID‑19 only as one of several macro‑economic, industry and brand‑specific factors that feed into its qualitative and quantitative impairment tests for indefinite‑life intangibles; the pandemic influences the assumptions used in those tests but does not by itself constitute a distinct impairment trigger.",

This affects quantitative accuracy. (2) The $204 million trademark write-down is accurate and matches the ground truth in both amount and context. The additional $367 million goodwill charge is unsupported by the original answer and appears to be extraneous or incorrectly synthesized information. No other numbers (e.g., carrying value of $588 million) are mentioned in the LLM response, resulting in partial omission. (3) The reasoning is strong in comparing Colgate-Palmolive’s direct impairment trigger to PepsiCo’s more generalized use of the pandemic as one of many factors in its impairment models. The LLM correctly captures the multi-hop contrast: Filorga’s business model was specifically vulnerable, while PepsiCo’s broader portfolio and forecasting approach did not result in reported charges. The logic behind differing outcomes based on business exposure and assessment methodology is sound and well-articulated.

The higher salary increase assumption at NEE implies a faster-growing benefit obligation compared to DUK, which could lead to a larger liability on NEE's financial statements if other actuarial assumptions (like discount rate and employee demographics) are held constant. This contrast in salary increase assumptions suggests that NEE may be recognizing a more aggressive growth in employee compensation, which would increase the present value of pension obligations more significantly than under DUK's more moderate and consistent assumptions.",

Because the projected benefit obligation is discounted future cash‑flows that are multiplied by the assumed salary growth, NEE’s higher, fixed rate will push its obligation upward more than DUK’s lower, bounded range, and DUK’s consistent range implies a more modest and less volatile impact on its obligation valuation.",

(2) The entity identification is correct: COP and XOM are accurately referenced with correct years (2023–2024) and correct 2024 ratios (27% for COP, 13.4% for XOM). However, the conclusion that 'ExxonMobil had the lower ratio' is correct (13.4% < 27%), but the original answer mistakenly claims COP had a lower ratio (27% vs 13.4%), which is mathematically impossible—this suggests an error in the ground truth. Despite this, the LLM answer contradicts the ground truth on this point, and since 13.4% is indeed lower than 27%, the LLM is factually correct here, but the ground truth appears flawed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly retrieves individual company data from presumably separate sources and performs correct individual change calculations. However, the synthesis of 'combined percentage change' is flawed—either the ground truth uses a non-additive method (e.g., average change), or there is a data discrepancy. The LLM assumes additive combination, which is a reasonable interpretation, but does not match the ground truth. (4) Scores reflect that core numbers are accurate (hence moderate quantitative and qualitative scores), but the key combined change metric is wrong, and the final comparison contradicts the ground truth (which itself seems erroneous).

These figures are off by over $600 million, indicating a major factual error. Additionally, the LLM claims that HD’s 2023 stock option exercise value is not disclosed, but the ground truth confirms it was $79.7 million based on 743,000 shares at $106.96 per share — information that should have been extractable from the filing. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent ($61M + $152M = $213M), but the inputs are factually wrong. The comparison to HD is omitted due to the incorrect assertion of missing data, so the final comparative analysis (that NKE’s total is $773.3M higher) is entirely missing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly extract or synthesize data from both companies and time periods. It incorrectly concludes data is unavailable for HD when it is, and uses incorrect values for NKE, suggesting either misreading of the source or reliance on incorrect data. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and metric (stock option exercise value) and attempts the comparison, but fails on factual accuracy and completeness.

      "original_answer": "AMT's tenant leases, which include fixed escalation percentages or inflationary index-based rent increases, along with financial penalties for early termination, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream by discouraging tenants from terminating leases prematurely. This contrasts with SPG's exposure to leasing risks from e-commerce growth and public health crises, which can reduce consumer foot traffic, lower tenant performance, and result in store closures or underreported sales. AMT's lease structure could serve as a risk mitigation strategy for SPG if applied, as it would reduce the impact of tenant turnover and rent volatility caused by these external threats.",
      "llm_answer": "American Tower’s leases are typically “non‑cancellable” for five‑to‑ten years, contain annual rent hikes that are set at a fixed escalation percentage (or tied to an inflation index), and impose financial penalties if a tenant walks out before the term ends【page_99】. Those features lock in a predictable, growing cash‑flow stream and make it costly for tenants to terminate, which cushions the tower owner against the same risks that threaten Simon Property Group – namely, lower foot‑traffic and rent‑payment pressure from e‑commerce‑driven store closures and pandemic‑related shutdowns that can force tenants to default or abandon space【page_16】.

No specific numeric values (e.g., exact percentages or dollar amounts) are present in either answer, so no discrepancies exist; format and references to escalation types are consistent. (2) The answer fully addresses the multi-part question by explaining how AMT’s lease terms reduce volatility and protect against external factors like e-commerce growth and public health crises, which impact SPG through reduced foot traffic and tenant defaults. (3) Entities—American Tower (AMT) and Simon Property Group (SPG)—are correctly identified, and the comparison between their leasing models is logically sound.

Meanwhile, COP achieved a reserve replacement rate of 123% in 2023, driven by development drilling, extensions, discoveries, and purchases. This indicates that while both companies focus on sustaining production through new field development, XOM emphasizes large-scale capital investment in a diverse portfolio, whereas COP highlights successful reserve additions through a mix of exploration and acquisitions.

However, for CSCO, the LLM incorrectly calculates the intermediate-term debt due between 1 to 3 years as $2.250 billion ($500M + $750M + $1,000M), while the ground truth states $2,240 million. Though close, this is factually incorrect. Additionally, the final combined total is $3.386 billion ($3,386 million), whereas the correct total is $3,106 million — a difference of $280 million. (2) Calculations: ADBE subtotal ($693 + $443 = $1,136 million) is correct. CSCO’s sum of $500M + $750M + $1,000M = $2,250M is mathematically correct but based on incorrect data inclusion — the ground truth does not support summing these specific notes as all falling within the 1–3 year bucket in 2022; the correct reported value is $2,240 million. Final sum: $1,136 + $2,250 = $3,386 million is wrong; correct is $693 + $443 + $2,240 = $3,106 million. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies both companies (ADBE and CSCO), the relevant metric (intermediate-term debt due 1–3 years), and the year (2022).

In contrast, UPS disclosed in its 2022 10-K that it reports operating profit and other financial metrics excluding the impact of goodwill and asset impairment charges, indicating a strategy to adjust for such one-time financial impacts when evaluating performance.

In its 2022 filing the company does not quantify any such charge, but flags the macro‑economic environment as a catalyst that could generate them.\n\nUnited Parcel Service, by contrast, explicitly reports the amounts of goodwill and asset‑impairment charges (‑$46 million in 2021 and $686 million in 2020) and then removes those charges – together with related tax effects – from its “adjusted” operating‑expense and income‑before‑tax measures (see UPS 10‑K p. 30‑31).

(3) The reasoning and synthesis are partially sound: the LLM correctly infers that Exxon's reduction suggests a trimming of future development inventory, and that ConocoPhillips’ inclusion of undeveloped acreage in PUD reflects a focus on future growth. This aligns with the qualitative interpretation in the ground truth. However, the flawed data undermines the validity of the comparison. (4) Scores reflect that while the conceptual framework and intent to compare strategic approaches are correct (contextual relevance high), the quantitative inaccuracies severely limit factual correctness. The answer fails on core data points, warranting a low quantitative accuracy score and moderate qualitative accuracy due to correct use of terminology and logical direction.",

      "original_answer": "AMT generates over $60 billion in non-cancellable tenant lease revenue due to long-term contracts with wireless carriers and a 3% average annual rent escalation, combined with a 3% churn rate, which ensures consistent revenue growth and low cash flow volatility. In contrast, SPG faces significant uncertainty in tenant leasing due to risks like oversupply reducing market rents, e-commerce competition impacting occupancy rates, and safety concerns affecting consumer foot traffic. These factors expose SPG to higher tenant turnover and lower leasing demand, making its revenue outlook more volatile compared to AMT’s stable and predictable revenue base.",

It also correctly contrasts this with SPG's exposure to higher churn and vacancy risks due to retail-specific vulnerabilities like tenant bankruptcies, anchor-store closures, and sales-based rents. However, the LLM omits several key quantitative and qualitative elements from the ground truth: (1) the $60+ billion in non-cancellable lease revenue for AMT is not mentioned, (2) the 3% annual rent escalation is missing, and (3) SPG's specific risks related to e-commerce competition, oversupply reducing market rents, and safety concerns affecting foot traffic are not fully addressed. While the LLM captures the general idea of SPG's volatility, it lacks the multi-hop synthesis of how these external factors directly impact tenant demand and revenue outlook.

      "original_answer": "NVIDIA experienced a 64.9% overall gross margin in fiscal year 2022, up from 62.3% in fiscal year 2021. This improvement was primarily driven by a higher-end mix within Graphics, which saw its gross margin increase. However, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced a gross margin decline due to a shift in product mix. Texas Instruments' Embedded Processing revenue and operating profit increased in 2022 primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit. Given that both companies operate in the semiconductor space and serve overlapping markets (e.g., automotive, industrial, and computing), NVIDIA's product mix shift and margin dynamics could signal market demand changes that may create opportunities for Texas Instruments to capitalize on or face increased competition in embedded processing applications.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2022 NVIDIA’s Graphics segment saw a higher‑end product mix that lifted its gross margin, while the Compute & Networking segment shifted toward lower‑margin items (and a reduced automotive contribution), pulling that segment’s margin down. For Texas Instruments, the stronger, higher‑margin GPU demand may crowd out lower‑priced, compute‑intensive workloads that TI’s embedded‑processing products target, whereas the margin pressure and mix shift in NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking business could create a cost‑sensitivity gap that TI’s analog‑ and embedded‑processing solutions—especially for industrial and automotive customers—can exploit as a lower‑cost alternative.",

It accurately notes that Graphics saw a higher-end mix lifting margins, while Compute & Networking faced margin pressure due to product mix changes, including reduced automotive contribution. While the original answer includes specific gross margin percentages (64.9% overall in FY2022 vs 62.3% in FY2021), the LLM omits these exact figures but still captures the directional change correctly. (2) No explicit numbers are stated in the LLM answer, so there are no incorrect calculations or misstatements—this is a minor omission rather than an error. The absence of the precise margin percentages and year-over-year comparison slightly reduces completeness but does not affect factual correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links NVIDIA’s segment-level margin shifts to potential implications for Texas Instruments’ Embedded Processing business, recognizing both competitive threats (crowding out of lower-priced workloads by high-margin GPU demand) and opportunities (cost-sensitive customers转向 TI’s lower-cost analog and embedded solutions). This reflects valid synthesis across companies and segments. (4) The answer is contextually highly relevant, directly addressing how NVIDIA’s mix shift creates both challenges and opportunities for TI.

MetLife specifically notes that differences between LIBOR and alternative reference rates may impact the value and return on financial instruments, investments, and interest rates on debt, which could increase costs or reduce returns.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. The total dollar value of repurchases is incorrect: the LLM states $16.5 billion (AIG $7.5B + MA $9.032B), but the ground truth is $9,082.8 million ($9.0828 billion), meaning the LLM overstates the total by more than double. The LLM incorrectly uses AIG’s board authorization amount ($7.5B) rather than the actual repurchase amount, which is not supported by the ground truth. For MA, the LLM reports $9.032B repurchased, but the ground truth implies MA’s repurchase amount must be subtracted from the total to find AIG’s portion: $9,082.8M total - MA’s $9,032M = $50.8M for AIG, not $7.5B. Thus, AIG’s actual repurchase value is drastically overstated. (2) The average price calculation for AIG is based on flawed inputs: the LLM divides $7.5B by 50.8M shares, but the 50.8M shares are not confirmed in the ground truth, and the $7.5B was authorized, not spent. The ground truth states AIG’s implied average price was $561.02, not $148. This results in a completely incorrect comparison. MA’s average price of $379.49 is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize actual repurchase amounts from both companies, instead using an authorization figure for AIG and misadding values. It fails to recognize that the total repurchase value is a sum of two actual expenditures, not one actual and one authorization. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant—addressing both parts of the question and attempting correct metrics—and MA’s average price is accurate.

While it correctly states NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities as $2,101 million, it incorrectly reports Duke Energy's combined noncurrent derivative liabilities as $699 million, whereas the ground truth is $255 million. This leads to an incorrect difference of 'about $1.4 billion' instead of the correct $1,846 million ($2,101M - $255M). The $699 million figure appears to be fabricated or misextracted, as it does not match the ground truth sum across Duke's operating segments. (2) Calculations are therefore inaccurate: $2,101M - $699M = $1,402M, which aligns with the LLM's 'about $1.4 billion' statement, but this is based on incorrect input data. The correct difference is $1,846 million, which is materially larger. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model identifies the need to sum Duke Energy's operating segments and compare with NEE's total—but fails in execution due to incorrect underlying data. Entity identification is mostly correct: companies and segments are properly named, and the metric (noncurrent derivative liabilities) is accurate. The time period (implied year-end) is consistent.

In contrast, UPS adjusts its financial measures by excluding mark-to-market gains or losses to provide a non-GAAP view of its performance. Therefore, CAT incorporates these gains or losses directly into its pension cost trends, while UPS removes them to assess underlying operations.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE INACCURACY: The LLM claims CAT had an $833 million pre-tax mark-to-market gain in 2021 and a net periodic benefit cost of -$1.122 billion, and projects -$121 million for 2022. However, the ground truth states that the $168 million increase in expense for 2022 *excludes* mark-to-market impacts — it does not report actual 2021 or 2022 net periodic benefit costs or a specific $833M gain. These numbers are fabricated or hallucinated. (2) QUALITATIVE INACCURACY: The LLM incorrectly states that CAT 'treats the amount separately from the net periodic benefit cost' and shows it as a 'distinct line item', implying it is excluded. But the ground truth says CAT *includes* mark-to-market gains/losses *in* its net periodic benefit cost — the opposite of what the LLM claims. This reverses the fundamental accounting treatment. (3) REASONING: While the LLM attempts multi-hop synthesis by comparing CAT and UPS and analyzing year-over-year impact, the reasoning is built on false premises. The conclusion that the cost is '$1 billion higher' in 2022 due to absence of gains is unsupported by the original answer, which only notes that the $168M expected increase excludes mark-to-market effects.

      "original_answer": "NFLX stated that accrued participations and residuals were not material as of December 31, 2021, indicating the amount had a negligible impact on its financial position. In contrast, T reported accrued participations and residuals of $2,966 million as of December 31, 2021, which represented a significant portion of its total accounts payable and accrued liabilities ($50,661 million). This shows that while NFLX considered the liability immaterial, T had a quantifiably substantial obligation in this category, suggesting differing scales or structures of content-related liabilities between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s 2021 filing simply notes that “the amount of accrued participations and residuals was not material,” and it does not provide a dollar figure. In contrast, AT&T lists accrued participations and residuals as a separate line within accounts payable and accrued liabilities, reporting $2.966 billion for 2021. This contrast shows that the liability is immaterial for Netflix (hence omitted) but material for AT&T, requiring explicit disclosure.",

The absence of a dollar figure for NFLX is correctly noted. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that NFLX deemed accrued participations and residuals immaterial, consistent with the original answer. (3) The reasoning correctly infers that the lack of disclosure by NFLX implies immateriality, while T’s explicit line-item disclosure indicates materiality—this reflects sound multi-hop logic comparing disclosure practices and their implications. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that T’s $2,966 million liability was part of a larger $50,661 million accounts payable and accrued liabilities balance, which provides context for the relative size of the obligation. While this detail is omitted, the core conclusion about materiality differences remains valid. All entities (NFLX, T/AT&T), years (2021), and financial concepts are accurately used. The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in substance, with slightly less contextual detail on T’s total liabilities.",

The combined difference is calculated as $2,193 million, which is accurate in magnitude. However, the LLM reports the net gap as $2,193 million (positive), whereas the ground truth specifies it as -$2,193 million. While the absolute value is correct and the directionality is implied in the explanation (CMCSA's position being more favorable), the sign of the combined difference is technically incorrect if interpreted strictly as a mathematical difference (CMCSA - META = -2,126 - 67 = -2,193). (2) All numbers are factually correct and properly attributed to the right companies and years. Calculations are accurate except for the sign convention in the final difference, which does not affect magnitude but slightly misrepresents directionality. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes tax data from two different companies, computes the difference, and interprets the contrasting tax positions. It correctly infers that CMCSA has a favorable tax position (benefit) versus META's unfavorable (expense).

(1) On quantitative and entity accuracy: The years (2022) and companies (NVDA, TXN) are correct, and there are no explicit numerical values to verify, so quantitative accuracy is acceptable. (2) However, the qualitative inaccuracies are critical: The LLM incorrectly states that Texas Instruments recognizes unrealized gains and losses on equity-method and non-marketable equity investments directly in operating income. This contradicts the ground truth, which specifies that TXN records credit losses (not general unrealized gains/losses) on available-for-sale debt securities in Operating Income and Expenses (OI&E), while unrealized gains/losses go to AOCI. The LLM conflates different types of investments and misattributes the treatment of unrealized gains. (3) For multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly synthesize the distinction between credit losses (affecting operating income) versus general unrealized gains/losses (affecting AOCI) for TXN, and incorrectly implies that TXN’s unrealized gains impact operating income broadly. In contrast, for NVDA, the LLM correctly notes that unrealized gains/losses are recorded in AOCI but adds that they were immaterial—this aligns with the ground truth that NVDA considers them 'not significant.' However, the model misrepresents NVDA’s policy by implying a standard accounting treatment when the key point is materiality.

However, the LLM incorrectly claims $256 million, $255 million, and $267 million for those years—over 30 times higher than actual. This invalidates the comparison. While Colgate-Palmolive’s estimated cash outlay of $180–$216 million is correctly derived from 90% of $200–$240 million pre-tax charges, the erroneous PepsiCo figures lead to a completely reversed conclusion.

The ground truth states that the combined ROIC of General Motors and Nike is 49.4%, implying GM's ROIC is 2.9% (49.4% - 46.5%). However, the LLM claims GM's ROIC is not disclosed numerically, which contradicts the ground truth that must have derived GM's ROIC to compute the combined value. This failure to report GM's ROIC undermines the correctness of the quantitative synthesis. (2) Nike's ROIC of 46.5% is correctly reported, matching the ground truth. However, the combined ROIC of 49.4% is not acknowledged, and the LLM incorrectly concludes it cannot be calculated due to missing GM data—yet the ground truth clearly provides the combined figure, implying GM's ROIC was available in the source data. The calculation of combined ROIC (sum or otherwise) is misrepresented as impossible when it should have been feasible. (3) The qualitative analysis of how each company defines ROIC is strong: the LLM correctly identifies GM’s adjustments for automotive debt, pension liabilities, and tax assets as reflective of its capital-intensive model, and Nike’s use of operational EBIT and asset-light denominator aligns with its brand-driven focus. This shows sound reasoning in interpreting the differing capital structures and operational models. (4) Contextually, the answer is well-structured and relevant, addressing both the quantitative and qualitative parts of the question. However, the failure to report GM's ROIC and the combined total—despite the ground truth containing this information—results in a significant drop in correctness and quantitative accuracy.

For AMT, the ownership of shares in such subsidiary REITs would fail to be qualifying assets under REIT asset tests, and any dividend income or gains from the subsidiary would no longer count toward the 75% gross income test. This could materially affect AMT’s ability to maintain its own REIT status. Additionally, AMT would economically bear the federal income tax, penalties, and interest incurred by the subsidiary REIT. For SPG, failure of its subsidiary REITs to qualify would similarly disrupt its REIT compliance, particularly regarding income sourcing and asset composition, and could result in corporate-level taxes and a 4% nondeductible excise tax if distributions fall short.

If a subsidiary loses REIT status, its shares no longer count as “qualifying assets” and any dividend or interest it pays ceases to be “qualified REIT income,” so the parent may fall short of the asset‑ and income‑tests and be forced to sell assets, borrow or cut distributions to stay compliant.  Simon’s filing spells out that a loss of REIT status would eliminate the deduction for distributions, subject the company to corporate‑level income tax (and, where applicable, a 1 % excise tax on stock repurchases and possible AMT liability) and disqualify it for four years; American Tower warns that a similar failure would trigger corporate‑rate tax on its taxable REIT income, strip the REIT distribution deduction, could invoke the 1 % excise tax and erode cash available for debt service, growth or distributions.",

It appropriately notes the broader strategic impacts like forced asset sales, borrowing, or distribution cuts. However, there are key quantitative and factual discrepancies: (1) The original answer specifies a 4% nondeductible excise tax for SPG if distributions fall short, but the LLM incorrectly states a 1% excise tax (and conflates it with stock repurchases, which is not in the ground truth); (2) The LLM mentions AMT liability for SPG, but the original answer does not reference Alternative Minimum Tax implications for SPG in this context; (3) The four-year disqualification period is mentioned, which aligns with general REIT rules, but was not explicitly stated in the ground truth and thus introduces unverified detail. Entity identification (AMT = American Tower, SPG = Simon Property Group) is correct. The reasoning is logically sound in connecting subsidiary failure to parent-level compliance risks, demonstrating multi-hop understanding across corporate structures and REIT requirements. While the overall message is directionally accurate and contextually relevant, the incorrect excise tax rate and introduction of AMT liability reduce quantitative accuracy. Semantic equivalence is mostly preserved, but not fully due to these specific errors.",

The ground truth states that PepsiCo reported $2 million in cash expenditures in both 2021 and 2020, totaling $4 million. However, the LLM incorrectly claims $247 million in 2021 and $289 million in 2020, totaling $536 million—this is a severe factual inaccuracy. Colgate-Palmolive's projected cash expenditures of $180–$216 million are correctly calculated as 90% of the $200–$240 million pre-tax charges, so this part is accurate. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s math is internally consistent (90% of $200–$240M = $180–$216M), but the PepsiCo sum is completely wrong. The correct total is $4M, not $536M. The comparison conclusion is therefore inverted: in reality, Colgate’s lower bound ($180M) is 45 times PepsiCo’s $4M, not the other way around. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across two companies and timeframes, which is appropriate, but due to incorrect data retrieval for PepsiCo, the synthesis fails. The reasoning structure is sound, but based on false premises. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness is low (2/10) due to critical numerical errors that reverse the conclusion. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because PepsiCo’s numbers are wildly off. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the model identifies the correct initiative, company, and type of expense, and applies correct percentage logic for Colgate.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures. While the value for Citigroup (C) in 2024 is correct at $6,971 million, the value for BAC is incorrect: the LLM reports $314,460 million, whereas the ground truth is $284,325 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $321,431 million instead of the correct $291,296 million. The prior-year value for C in 2023 ($11,350 million) is correctly reported. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on incorrect inputs. The LLM’s sum of $314,460 + $6,971 = $321,431 is mathematically correct, but the BAC input is wrong. The comparison stating the combined total is '$310.1 billion higher' than C’s 2023 value is numerically derived but misleading due to the inflated total. The actual increase from C’s 2023 value should be $291,296 - $11,350 = $279,946 million, or ~$279.9 billion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM identifies both companies, extracts fair values for 2024, sums them, and compares to C’s prior-year value—but fails due to incorrect data extraction for BAC. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question and cites document locations. However, the major quantitative error in BAC’s trading assets severely undermines factual correctness. The discrepancy suggests a possible misreading of the source (e.g., confusing total assets with trading-account assets).

The increase in EMR's discount rates led to actuarial gains and a reduction in the accumulated benefit obligation from $5,634 to $3,910, contributing to overfunding of $513 for U.S. plans.

(2) The calculation of EMR's rate increase (~2.7 percentage points) is approximately correct (actual: 2.72 and 2.7 pts), but GD's rate change is misrepresented: a decrease from 3.19% to 2.54% is a 0.65 pt drop, not 'no material change'. The LLM also fails to mention GD’s 2020 rate, breaking the multi-hop comparison across the full period. (3) The reasoning about the directional impact on pension valuations is partially sound: rising rates reduce obligation present value (correct for EMR), but the LLM incorrectly concludes GD’s valuation was 'essentially unchanged' when falling rates would increase liabilities, as correctly stated in the ground truth. This misjudges the financial mechanism for GD. (4) While the LLM captures EMR’s situation well and explains the valuation impact correctly for that company, it fails on GD’s data and thus provides an incomplete and partially incorrect comparative analysis. The contextual relevance is high as it addresses all question components, but factual errors in key numbers and implications reduce correctness.

However, the LLM fails to include key quantitative details from the ground truth: specifically, ACN's reclassification impacted operating income growth by $786 million or 9% for fiscal 2024 vs. 2023 (not 2023 vs. 2022 as the LLM states), which is a significant omission. The LLM incorrectly frames the comparison as 2023-to-2022, while the original answer references fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 for ACN, introducing a factual error in time period alignment. Additionally, the LLM does not highlight the key distinction in the ground truth — that ACN’s reclassification was tied to a specific geographic realignment (EMEA) affecting growth comparability, while TXN’s reclassification ensures internal consistency but lacks a direct link to specific growth figures. This nuance in purpose and impact between the two companies' reclassifications is missing, weakening the multi-hop synthesis. While the general reasoning about reduced comparability due to differing reclassification practices is implied, it is not explicitly drawn, reducing qualitative accuracy. Overall, the answer captures the general theme but misses critical specifics on numbers, timing, and comparative implications, resulting in partial correctness.",

      "original_answer": "VZ reported a decrease of $82 million in customer premise equipment costs due to lower volumes sold, treating these costs as operating expenses that directly reduced current period profitability. In contrast, CMCSA capitalizes customer premise equipment costs associated with installation as part of property and equipment, spreading the expense over the asset's estimated useful life rather than recognizing it immediately. This results in different financial impacts: VZ's approach lowers current expenses and potentially short-term profitability, while CMCSA's capitalization defers costs to future periods through depreciation.",
      "llm_answer": "Verizon reports the $82 million drop in customer‑premise‑equipment (CPE) as a reduction of “cost of services” in its operating‑expense line, so the spend is taken directly against the period’s income. Comcast, by contrast, records the purchase and deployment of new CPE as a capitalized asset (“customer premise equipment” with a six‑year useful life) and expenses it through depreciation over time. Thus, the same type of cost is expensed immediately by Verizon but capitalized and amortized by Comcast, illustrating opposite accounting treatments for comparable operational outlays in the sector.",

While it correctly identifies GM's net cash provided by financing activities as $2.6 billion and BKNG's net cash used in financing activities as $1.2 billion, it misrepresents both the direction and the comparison. It incorrectly states that GM had a 'net cash outflow'—when financing activities 'provided' cash (i.e., inflow)—and similarly mislabels BKNG's 'net cash used' as an 'outflow', which, while semantically closer, is inconsistently framed. The key error is in the calculation: the difference between $2.6 billion (inflow) and -$1.2 billion (outflow) is $3.8 billion, not $1.4 billion. The LLM appears to have subtracted $1.2B from $2.6B as if both were outflows, yielding $1.4B, which is incorrect. (2) Numeric values for the individual companies are accurate ($2.6B and $1.2B), but the final calculated difference ($1.4B) is wrong. The correct difference is $3.8B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails in synthesis: the model does not correctly interpret that one value is positive (cash provided) and the other negative (cash used), so the total difference spans from +2.6 to -1.2, totaling 3.8.

It incorrectly assigns $30 billion in crude oil revenue to ConocoPhillips (COP) and $143 million to ExxonMobil (XOM), which is the reverse of the ground truth: COP had $143 million and XOM had $6,944 million in crude oil revenue. The combined total is thus grossly incorrect at $30.1 billion instead of the correct $7,087 million (~$7.1 billion). Additionally, the total revenues cited are wrong: the LLM uses $56,141 million for XOM (which may be from a different year or metric) instead of $20,528 million, and does not provide a correct total revenue for COP (should be $8,203 million). (2) The percentages are completely inaccurate: claiming COP’s crude oil revenue is 55% of total revenue (vs. actual ~1.7%) and XOM’s is 0.3% (vs. actual ~33.8%) shows severe miscalibration.

Similarly, for PM, the ground truth reports a 9.7% net revenue increase excluding currency and acquisitions, but the LLM cites 6.2% and attempts to quantify volume/mix as $190 million, which is not present in the original and misrepresents the data. These numerical discrepancies are severe and undermine the core of the answer.

(3) While the LLM correctly identifies that MDLZ's favorable volume/mix came from AMEA, Latin America, and Europe — which aligns with the ground truth — this is the only correct element.

The LLM adds that Lockheed made similar contributions in 2019, which is consistent with known filings and does not contradict the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts liquidity use between two industrial sector companies—FedEx (logistics) focusing on growth and shareholder returns vs. Lockheed Martin (aerospace/defense) managing pension-driven cash flow volatility. This synthesis across companies and financial behaviors aligns with the question’s intent. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the LLM does not explicitly mention FedEx’s planned $1.5 billion stock buyback in 2023, a specific detail in the original answer. However, the general reference to 'large share-repurchase plan' preserves semantic equivalence. Otherwise, the answer is complete, contextually relevant, and accurately framed.",

The ground truth specifies $156.7 million, so the rounding to $156 million is acceptable and common in financial communication. For SPG, the increase in average annual initial base minimum rent per square foot is correctly reported as rising from $55.41 to $66.39, a difference of $10.98. The LLM rounds this to '$11 per sq ft', which is a reasonable approximation and semantically equivalent in context. (2) All numeric values are accurate or appropriately rounded. The calculations (differences) are correct: 402.4 - 245.7 = 156.7 (correctly approximated), and 66.39 - 55.41 = 10.98 (correctly approximated to $11). No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two different companies (AMT and SPG), two different metrics (value of new operating leases vs. average rent per sq ft), and compares their directional changes year-over-year. The contrast between declining lease value for AMT and rising pricing power for SPG is implied through accurate data presentation. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, directly addressing the comparative change in lease metrics for both companies. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit interpretive conclusion (e.g., 'this indicates...') as in the original, but the core factual and quantitative content is fully preserved. Hence, a high score of 9 is justified—excellent accuracy with only slight omission in qualitative framing.",

It incorrectly substitutes ConocoPhillips for Chevron (COP), despite the question explicitly asking about Chevron and ExxonMobil (XOM). This is a major entity error. (2) Quantitatively, the production volumes are partially correct—ExxonMobil’s 355 MBD (k bbl/d) aligns with ground truth, and 81 MBD matches Chevron’s volume—but the attribution is wrong because the LLM assigns 81 MBD to ConocoPhillips instead of Chevron. The calculated volume difference of ≈274 k bbl/d is numerically accurate but based on incorrect entity pairing. More critically, the price per barrel for ExxonMobil is stated as $49.64, which contradicts the ground truth of $42.15 for both companies. The claimed price difference of $7.50 is therefore entirely incorrect—the actual price difference is $0. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect entity identification and data sourcing. The model does not correctly synthesize bitumen production and pricing for the correct pair of companies (Chevron and ExxonMobil), undermining the comparison. (4) While the structure of the response attempts to address the question by computing volume and price differences, the severe factual inaccuracies in both entities and financial figures result in a fundamentally incorrect conclusion. The contextual relevance is moderate because the format and intent align with the question, but correctness is severely compromised.

      "original_answer": "AIG estimates the fair value of liabilities by using market-observable interest rates and considers factors such as the coupon rate, yield curves, and other relevant factors, particularly in the context of securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Schwab, on the other hand, bases its fair value measurements for interest rate swaps on both spot and forward rates on the swap yield curve, considering the coupon rate of the fixed leg and the variable coupon rate on the floating leg of the contract. Both companies incorporate coupon rates into their valuation models, but Schwab explicitly references the dual-leg structure of interest rate swaps, while AIG focuses on broader market observables like yield curves.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG values its liability contracts with an **internal discounted‑cash‑flow model** that first adds a credit‑protection cost (single‑name CDS spreads, cash‑issuance spreads and other observable spreads) to a benchmark interest‑rate curve, then discounts the cash flows using that rate; for repurchase‑type liabilities it also uses market‑observable rates and explicitly factors the contract’s coupon, the relevant yield curve and any other “relevant factors” such as cash‑issuance spreads.  \n\nSchwab, by contrast, prices its interest‑rate‑swap liabilities **entirely from market‑observable yield data** – the fixed‑leg coupon, the floating‑leg coupon, and spot and forward rates from the swap yield curve – and validates the result with counter‑party (CCP) quotations, without a separate credit‑spread adjustment.",

It adds detail about AIG's use of credit-protection costs (e.g., CDS spreads) and an internal discounted cash-flow model, which is consistent with AIG's methodology and provides additional nuance not contradicted by the ground truth. (2) For Schwab, the LLM accurately states that fair value is based on spot and forward rates from the swap yield curve, and explicitly mentions both fixed and floating coupon legs—this matches the dual-leg structure emphasized in the original answer. The mention of CCP quotations for validation is an accurate and relevant addition. (3) There are no numerical values to verify, so quantitative accuracy is scored as 10 by default. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly differentiates the two companies' approaches, synthesizes the role of coupon rates in each, and highlights key distinctions—AIG’s broader market observables and internal modeling vs. Schwab’s reliance on direct market data from swap curves. (5) The LLM adds specificity (e.g., CDS spreads, CCP validation) that enriches the answer without introducing errors. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the original answer does not mention CCP validation or the internal DCF model explicitly, so while plausible and consistent, these details may go slightly beyond the source.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the correct numeric values: $6.70 for General Motors and $3.75 for Nike (both match the ground truth), and the sum is correctly calculated as $10.45. All financial figures and the year (2022) are correct, satisfying quantitative accuracy. The answer addresses all parts of the question: it reports individual EPS values, computes the combined value, and implicitly compares the sum to the individual values by stating the total exceeds each company's individual EPS. However, while the ground truth explicitly notes that General Motors' EPS is higher than Nike's by $2.95, the LLM answer omits this direct comparison, which is part of the original question's requirement to explain how the sum compares to the individual values. This minor omission in comparative detail slightly affects qualitative accuracy but does not undermine the core correctness. The entities (General Motors, Nike, diluted earnings per share, 2022) are correctly identified, and the reasoning across sources (multi-hop) is sound. The answer is contextually relevant and well-supported with document references. Overall, the response is factually complete and semantically equivalent to the ground truth with only a slight shortfall in comparative depth.",

      "question": "AIG's 2024 10-K highlights its need to maintain sufficient capital levels to support its insurance operations, including its major operating companies like National Union and Lexington. Schwab's 2024 10-K states that its capital management strategy includes a target common dividend payout of 20% to 30% of net income and reports a consolidated capital ratio of 6.8%. How does Schwab’s reported capital ratio influence its ability to maintain its dividend payout range, and what does this suggest about the relationship between capital ratios and financial flexibility for firms like AIG and Schwab operating under different regulatory capital requirements?",
      "original_answer": "Schwab’s 2024 consolidated capital ratio of 6.8% indicates a relatively strong capital position, which supports its ability to maintain a dividend payout targeting 20% to 30% of net income. This capital buffer allows Schwab to balance returns to shareholders with maintaining sufficient liquidity, especially in light of potential future needs such as migrating IDA balances onto its balance sheet. For AIG, maintaining sufficient capital is tied to its ability to underwrite insurance and manage risk through entities like National Union and Lexington, which are subject to insurance regulatory capital requirements. Therefore, capital ratios directly affect financial flexibility—Schwab uses its capital to support dividends and strategic balance sheet decisions, while AIG must ensure capital adequacy to sustain underwriting activities and meet regulatory thresholds.",
      "llm_answer": "Schwab’s consolidated capital ratio of 6.8 % – well above the 4 % Tier 1 leverage floor and comfortably above the 5 %–6.5 % target for its banking subsidiary – gives the firm a sizable cushion that lets it meet all regulatory capital tests while still returning 20 %‑30 % of net income as dividends. The same principle holds for AIG: maintaining robust capital (e.g., a 17 % debt‑to‑capital ratio and $43 billion of equity) is required to satisfy insurance‑sector capital rules and to preserve the flexibility needed for underwriting, acquisitions and shareholder‑return programs. In both cases, a strong capital ratio under the applicable regulator’s requirements translates directly into greater financial flexibility to fund dividend payouts and other capital‑return activities.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Schwab’s 6.8% capital ratio and its relevance to dividend payouts (20%-30% of net income), which aligns with the original answer. It also correctly links capital strength to financial flexibility for both Schwab and AIG. However, it introduces specific quantitative details not present in the original answer or question: the '4% Tier 1 leverage floor', '5%–6.5% target for its banking subsidiary', AIG’s '17% debt-to-capital ratio', and '$43 billion of equity'. These figures, while potentially accurate, are not mentioned in the provided ground truth or question context and thus cannot be verified as supported by the cited 2024 10-Ks. Their inclusion risks misrepresenting the source material.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised because the added numbers (e.g., 4%, 5%–6.5%, 17%, $43B) are not in the original answer or question prompt. While Schwab’s 6.8% capital ratio and 20%–30% dividend target are correctly stated, the unsupported specifics reduce confidence in factual fidelity. No calculation errors are present, but extraneous unverified metrics lower precision.\n\n3) The reasoning is logically sound and reflects good multi-hop synthesis: it connects Schwab’s capital ratio to dividend capacity and contrasts this with AIG’s insurance-focused capital needs. The conceptual link between capital strength and financial flexibility is well-articulated and consistent with the original answer. Entity identification (Schwab, AIG, National Union, Lexington implied) and fiscal year (2024) are accurate.\n\n4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: how Schwab’s capital ratio supports its dividend policy, and the broader implication for financial flexibility under different regulatory regimes. Despite adding unverified specifics, the core logic and synthesis match the ground truth’s intent. The answer could have been stronger by grounding all claims strictly in the provided information.",

In contrast, AT&T (T) actively issued $19,032 million in debt during 2021, which significantly increased its cash inflows from financing activities. This divergence in debt strategy shows that while T leveraged debt to strengthen its liquidity or fund operations, NFLX relied on other financing mechanisms or existing cash reserves, which contributed to a more constrained cash flow position in the same year.",

The LLM accurately breaks down AT&T’s debt issuances into $8,931 million from long-term debt and $10,100 million from credit-agreement borrowings, which sum to $19,031 million—off by $1 million due to rounding, which is acceptable.

The LLM cites specific line items from the 10-Ks (e.g., page numbers and phrasing), enhancing credibility. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Netflix’s lack of debt issuance with AT&T’s active issuance, links this to cash flow from financing activities, and infers the divergent impact on their cash positions. It synthesizes data from two companies and interprets the implications correctly. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more detail on AT&T’s debt composition. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly reference Netflix’s 2020 debt proceeds ($1,002 million) as context for the year-over-year decline, though the implication is present.

It reports Comcast's (CMCSA) 2023 Business Services Connectivity revenue as $9.3 billion (ground truth: $9,255 million ≈ $9.3 billion), and Verizon's (VZ) Business Wireless service revenue as $13.4 billion (ground truth: $13,372 million ≈ $13.4 billion). The combined total is correctly approximated as $22.6 billion (ground truth: $22,627 million ≈ $22.6 billion). The Adjusted EBITDA margin for CMCSA is correctly stated as 57.2%. The proportion of VZ's total Wireless service revenue from Business services is calculated as $13.4B / $76.7B ≈ 17.4%, matching the ground truth ($13,372M / $76,730M = 17.4%). (2) Minor rounding is used ($9.3B vs $9,255M, $13.4B vs $13,372M, $76.7B vs $76,730M), but all calculations remain accurate within reasonable rounding conventions. The division 13.4 / 76.7 correctly yields ~17.4%. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies two different companies (CMCSA and VZ), extracts distinct revenue figures from different service segments (Business Services Connectivity vs Business Wireless), computes a sum, retrieves CMCSA's margin, calculates a proportion for VZ, and makes a valid comparison between a margin (57.2%) and a revenue proportion (17.4%). (4) The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slight rounding of input figures, though this is presented clearly as 'roughly' and is standard in financial communication. All core facts, calculations, entities, and logic are correct. Contextual relevance is perfect—every part of the question is addressed with appropriate synthesis.",

While it correctly reports HD's 'Interest Income and Other, Net' as -$201 million and SBUX's as $122.8 million, it incorrectly calculates the combined total as -$78.2 million. The correct combined total is $323.8 million (as stated in the ground truth), which is the sum of the absolute values of income and expense, not the net difference. The LLM instead computes a net of -$78.2 million (i.e., -201 + 122.8), which misrepresents the intended 'combined total'—a sum of magnitudes, not a net contribution. This is a critical error in interpretation and calculation. (2) The individual numbers are accurate: HD's -$201M and SBUX's $122.8M match the ground truth. However, the combined total is wrong. The EBIT figures mentioned ($19,406M for HD and $4,969.6M for SBUX) are not in the original answer and were introduced without verification, reducing quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM correctly identifies that the line item affects earnings before taxes for both companies. However, it misinterprets the question's request for the 'combined total' as a net figure rather than a sum of absolute values, failing the synthesis step. The ground truth treats 'combined total' as $323.8M (201 + 122.8), implying additive magnitude regardless of sign, while LLM treats it as a net financial impact. This is a fundamental reasoning flaw. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both companies, the correct metric, and fiscal year 2024, and explains the impact on pre-tax earnings. However, due to the critical calculation error and incorrect combined figure, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. The answer would be more accurate if it had matched the ground truth's interpretation of 'combined total' as a sum of reported values in absolute terms, not netted.",

However, it notes this figure is from the year ended December 31, 2021, as disclosed in the 2022 filing—this nuance is factually correct based on typical SEC filing practices but slightly diverges from the ground truth, which attributes the $104M directly to 2022 without qualification. This is a minor discrepancy in temporal attribution but reflects accurate reading of source documents. (2) All numeric values—0.5% and $104 million—are correct and properly formatted; no calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two companies (EMR and GD), compares relative (percentage) vs. absolute (dollar) metrics, and draws a logical inference about product reliability strategies. It correctly infers that Emerson’s low percentage suggests high reliability or low risk exposure, while GD’s large dollar outlay reflects higher post-sale obligations, likely due to complex defense/aerospace systems.

The net difference of $135M (sum of the magnitudes of the changes) is accurately calculated and reported. (2) All numbers match the ground truth exactly, and the arithmetic is correct: $692M - $602M = $90M; $448M - $403M = $45M; $90M + $45M = $135M.

      "question": "How much greater was Boeing's cash provided by operating activities in 2023 compared to FedEx's total U.S. federal operating loss and capital loss carryovers, and what specific component of Boeing's 2022 operating cash flow included a tax-related inflow?",
      "original_answer": "Boeing's cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was $6.0 billion, while FedEx's total U.S. federal operating loss and capital loss carryovers were $157 million. Therefore, Boeing's operating cash flow was $5.843 billion greater than FedEx's U.S. federal loss carryovers. A specific component of Boeing's 2022 operating cash flow included a $1.5 billion income tax refund.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing generated roughly **$5.8 billion more** cash from operating activities in 2023 ($5.96 billion) than FedEx’s **$157 million** of U.S. federal operating‑loss and capital‑loss carryovers. The 2022 operating cash flow was boosted by a **$1.5 billion income‑tax refund**.",

      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually correct in all key aspects. It correctly identifies Boeing's 2023 operating cash flow as $5.96 billion (close to the ground truth $6.0 billion—likely a rounding difference) and FedEx's U.S. federal loss carryovers as $157 million. The calculated difference of $5.8 billion is accurate when rounding: $5.96B - $0.157B = $5.803B, which rounds to $5.8B as stated. The ground truth states $5.843B, so the LLM's $5.8B is a minor rounding approximation but semantically acceptable. (2) The tax-related inflow in Boeing's 2022 operating cash flow is correctly identified as a $1.5 billion income tax refund, matching the ground truth exactly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (Boeing and FedEx) and across years (2023 vs. carryovers from FedEx's filings, and Boeing's 2022 tax refund), correctly interpreting the components and their relevance. (4) All entities (Boeing, FedEx, operating cash flow, loss carryovers, tax refund), years, and metrics are accurate. The slight discrepancy in Boeing’s cash flow ($5.96B vs $6.0B) does not materially affect the conclusion and may reflect source variation or rounding. Thus, the answer is highly accurate, complete, and contextually appropriate, warranting a 9 for correctness and quantitative accuracy, with full marks for qualitative and contextual performance.",

      "question": "What is the combined 2021 foreign income of AMGN and GILD, and how does the difference between their foreign income figures compare to their respective total income before income taxes in the same year?",
      "original_answer": "The combined 2021 foreign income of AMGN and GILD is $4,542 million. AMGN's 2021 foreign income is $4,851 million, while GILD's 2021 foreign income is ($309 million), resulting in a difference of $5,160 million. AMGN's foreign income represents 72.4% of its total income before income taxes ($4,851M / $6,701M), whereas GILD's negative foreign income offsets 3.7% of its total income before income taxes ($309M / $8,278M).",

The difference between their foreign incomes is correctly calculated as $5.160 billion. These quantitative elements are accurate, earning a high score on quantitative accuracy. (2) However, the LLM makes a critical error in the interpretation of the comparison: instead of stating the percentage of foreign income relative to each company's total income before taxes as in the original answer (72.4% for AMGN and 3.7% offset for GILD), it incorrectly claims the $5.160 billion gap equals 77% of AMGN’s and 62% of GILD’s total income before taxes. This is factually wrong—the gap is not being used correctly in context. The original answer compares foreign income to total income for each firm individually, not the inter-company difference as a percentage of total income. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails in the final synthesis: while the model pulls correct figures from both companies and computes the difference accurately, it misinterprets what the question asks in the second part—comparing the difference to their respective total incomes—leading to flawed qualitative reasoning. It should have reported the proportions of foreign income within each company’s total income, not the gap relative to those totals. (4) Despite this major reasoning flaw, the answer remains contextually relevant and includes all key entities (AMGN, GILD, 2021, foreign income, total income before taxes) with correct numbers. Thus, correctness is reduced to 7 due to significant but not total failure in the analytical component.",

      "question": "How does the change in Capital One's (COF) net charge-off rate from 2020 to 2021, driven by performance in its energy loan portfolio, contrast with PayPal's (PYPL) definition and treatment of net charge-off rate in its merchant loan business?",
      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) reported a decrease in its net charge-off rate by 49 basis points to 0.00% in 2021, primarily driven by lower net charge-offs in its energy loan portfolio. This reflects an improvement in credit performance and economic conditions, especially in the energy sector, compared to 2020. In contrast, PayPal (PYPL) defines its net charge-off rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily balance of those receivables. While COF's metric reflects a specific improvement in a core loan segment (energy), PYPL's definition emphasizes a structural, formulaic approach focused on merchant credit risk without factoring in fraud, indicating differing risk management frameworks and portfolio compositions between the two financial institutions.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s commercial‑banking net charge‑off rate fell dramatically – it dropped 49 basis points from 0.49 % in 2020 to essentially 0.00 % in 2021, a decline the company attributes to lower charge‑offs in its energy‑loan portfolio. In contrast, PayPal defines the net charge‑off rate for its merchant‑finance business as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud) on merchant loans, advances and fees to the average daily balance of those receivables, and it reports that rate at 18.9 % in 2020 and 4.7 % in 2021, using it as a standard credit‑quality metric rather than a near‑zero figure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. While it correctly states that Capital One's net charge-off rate decreased by 49 basis points, it incorrectly claims the 2020 rate was 0.49% and dropped to 0.00% in 2021. The ground truth confirms the rate reached 0.00% in 2021, but does not specify the 2020 rate as 0.49%—this specific figure is unsupported by the original answer and introduces a potentially false inference. More critically, the LLM introduces PayPal's net charge-off rates as 18.9% in 2020 and 4.7% in 2021, which are entirely absent from the original answer and not part of the ground truth. These numbers are major factual errors. (2) The calculation of a 49 basis point drop is consistent with the original answer, but the derivation from 0.49% to 0.00% is speculative and not confirmed. The inclusion of PayPal's specific rates (18.9%, 4.7%) is unsupported and incorrect in this context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts COF’s energy portfolio-driven improvement with PYPL’s definitional approach to net charge-offs. It captures the structural difference in how the two companies treat the metric—COF showing a performance outcome, PYPL emphasizing a formulaic definition. However, the reasoning is undermined by fabricating PayPal's numerical trends, which were not requested or present in the ground truth. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both companies, the correct metric, and the conceptual contrast. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because the conceptual framing is reasonable, but quantitative accuracy is low due to the invention of specific, unsupported percentages for PayPal. Correctness score is 6 because while the core idea of contrasting COF’s performance-driven decline with PYPL’s definitional approach is present, the inclusion of false numerical data significantly undermines reliability.",

However, it incorrectly calculates the difference between the two figures. The correct difference is $359M - $56M = $303M, but the LLM states a gap of 'about $415 million', which is factually wrong. This is a critical error in quantitative reasoning. (2) The LLM introduces a new figure—$568 million other-expense for UPS—which is not present in the original answer and may be a misinterpretation of total investment income turning into an expense; while this might appear in filings, it is not part of the ground truth provided and thus cannot be validated as relevant.

      "original_answer": "The difference in net charge-off rates between COF (0.37%) and PYPL's definition of the metric—excluding fraud losses on merchant loans and advances—reflects contrasting credit risk management approaches. COF's lower net charge-off rate indicates stronger credit quality and loss mitigation in its loan portfolio, particularly in auto and consumer banking. PYPL, by excluding fraud losses from its net charge-off rate calculation, highlights a different risk exposure tied to merchant loans and advances, which may carry unique credit risks not captured in the metric. This distinction shows that COF's credit management strategy results in lower realized losses, while PYPL's approach focuses on separating fraud-related losses from credit performance metrics, affecting how each company measures and manages credit risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s consumer‑banking portfolio posted a net charge‑off rate of **0.37 %** (Table 9, 2021) – a level that fell 50 basis points as a result of strong loan performance and large allowance releases, indicating a very conservative underwriting and loss‑mitigation stance. In contrast, PayPal’s disclosed net charge‑off rates are **4.3 %** for consumer loans and **4.7 %** for merchant loans (Table on page 44), and the company explicitly **excludes fraud losses** from those rates, showing that its credit‑risk exposure is materially higher and that it separates fraud‑related losses from credit‑loss metrics to manage risk differently. Thus, Capital One’s low rate reflects tight credit standards and effective provisioning, whereas PayPal’s higher, fraud‑adjusted rates reveal a more aggressive merchant‑financing model that requires distinct treatment of fraud versus credit losses.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. The ground truth states that COF's net charge-off rate was 0.37% in 2022, but the LLM incorrectly cites this figure as being from 2021 (Table 9, 2021), which misaligns the time period. More critically, the LLM introduces specific numbers not present in the original answer or implied by the question: it claims PYPL has net charge-off rates of 4.3% for consumer loans and 4.7% for merchant loans. These figures are entirely absent from the ground truth, which does not provide any numerical rate for PYPL—only that its definition excludes fraud losses. This is a major quantitative fabrication. (2) The calculation and comparison of rates are therefore invalid. The LLM builds a narrative around a 0.37% vs ~4.5% difference, but the original answer makes no such numerical comparison and only contrasts the methodological definitions. The core metric for PYPL is not quantified in the ground truth, so asserting specific percentages constitutes a serious error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that it identifies a contrast in credit risk management: COF’s low rate reflecting conservative underwriting vs PYPL excluding fraud losses to separate risk types. This conceptual distinction aligns with the original answer. However, the reasoning is undermined by the incorrect data, leading to a distorted conclusion about the magnitude of risk differences. (4) While the LLM captures the general idea that PYPL excludes fraud losses and that COF has strong loss mitigation, the introduction of false quantitative data severely compromises factual correctness. The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right companies, metric, and general theme of credit risk management, but the incorrect numbers and year make the answer misleading. Thus, the correctness score is low despite some conceptual alignment.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the final calculation and reported difference. While the individual components for COST and Philip Morris are mostly accurate, the final difference is incorrect. The LLM states COST's total is $155M ($97M + $58M) and Philip Morris's is $74M ($72M + $2M), which are correct calculations based on the provided numbers. However, the difference is calculated as 'about $81 million', which is wrong: $155M - $74M = $81M is not accurate—this should be exactly $81 million, not 'about $81 million' when the inputs are precise. But more critically, the ground truth states the correct difference is $104 million, meaning the input numbers used by the LLM do not match the ground truth data. Therefore, either the amortization or interest figures for one or both companies are factually incorrect in the LLM's response. (2) Specifically, if the correct answer is $104 million, and Philip Morris’s total were $74M, then COST’s total would need to be $178M, not $155M—indicating the LLM has underreported COST’s costs by $23M. Alternatively, if COST’s cost were indeed $155M, then Philip Morris’s would need to be $51M for the difference to be $104M—meaning Philip Morris’s cost is misstated. Either way, at least one of the component numbers does not align with the knowledge graph. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—summing amortization and interest for each company, then computing the difference—but the factual inputs or calculations are flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses the exact question structure and uses appropriate entities and metrics. However, due to the significant quantitative error in the final result compared to ground truth ($81M vs $104M), the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.

The comparison of 'more than 250 times' is logically sound—231,733 / 0.907 ≈ 255.5, so 'over 250 times' is a reasonable approximation of the 255x magnitude difference. (2) All numeric values are correct: AIG’s $231,733 million = $231.7 billion, COF’s $907 million = $0.907 billion, and the ratio is accurately represented in magnitude. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (AIG and COF), two different financial metrics (total fair value vs. AOCI change), and draws a valid conclusion about absolute vs. relative exposure to fair value fluctuations. It correctly infers that AIG’s larger portfolio implies greater absolute exposure, while COF’s change reflects relative sensitivity despite smaller size. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the quantitative comparison and the implied risk exposure. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly state 'over 255 times' as in the ground truth, opting for 'more than 250 times'—a slight simplification but semantically acceptable.

For NEE, the LLM swaps the companies' data, falsely attributing DUK's numbers to NEE and claiming a $134 million increase due to $429 million in reserve amortization — which is unsupported by the original answer. The original answer states that NEE's changes were due to amortization adjustments related to accrued asset removal costs under the 2016 rate agreement, not a simple increase of $134M. (2) Calculations are entirely incorrect: the claimed net increase of $10 million is based on fabricated numbers. The correct change for DUK alone is +$656M, while NEE’s specific dollar change is not quantified in the original answer, only the nature of the regulatory mechanism. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the LLM confuses the two companies, misattributes financial figures, and invents a reserve amortization amount not present in the ground truth.

In contrast, UPS recognized a mark-to-market gain of $3.3 billion ($2.5 billion after tax) in 2021 related to its pension plan following the enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act, which was included in Investment income and other on the income statement. Emerson's gain was tied to an equity investment linked to a specific acquisition, while UPS's gain stemmed from pension plan adjustments due to regulatory changes.

(4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM attributes the margin contraction to a 'mixed sales picture' without explicitly citing the ground truth reasons—increased wage investments, deleverage, and promotional activity—which outweighed pricing benefits. While implied, this causal mechanism is less precise than the original answer, justifying a 9 instead of 10 on qualitative accuracy. However, the core facts, calculations, and synthesis remain fully correct, warranting a 9 on overall correctness.",

      "question": "How did Emerson's 2022 pretax gain from the Therm-O-Disc divestiture and General Dynamics' exposure to forward exchange contracts jointly impact their respective financial risk profiles in managing international operations?",
      "original_answer": "Emerson recognized a pretax gain of $486 from the divestiture of its Therm-O-Disc business, which positively contributed to its financial position during restructuring and exit from non-core operations. Meanwhile, General Dynamics had $6.8 billion in notional forward exchange contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2021, indicating significant exposure to foreign exchange risk. A 10% unfavorable movement in exchange rates could have led to substantial pretax losses for General Dynamics, increasing its financial volatility. Therefore, while Emerson's divestiture gain provided a one-time financial boost that could offset some restructuring costs, General Dynamics' reliance on forward contracts introduced material market risk, particularly in the context of international operations and currency fluctuations.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s May 31 2022 sale of the Therm‑O‑Disc business generated a **pretax gain of $486 million** (page 28), which was booked as part of the $1.173 billion increase in 2022 pretax earnings and helped offset other cost items, thereby strengthening its balance sheet and giving the company extra cash to absorb foreign‑currency swings in its 54 %‑international sales mix.  \n\nGeneral Dynamics, by contrast, carries **$6.8 billion of forward‑exchange contracts** (page 52); a 10 % adverse move in those contracts would produce an un‑recognized pretax loss of about **$196 million** (plus a $1 million recognized loss), indicating that its risk profile for international operations is driven by active currency‑hedging exposure that could become material if rates move sharply.  \n\nTogether, Emerson’s one‑time divestiture gain reduces its financial‑risk burden for overseas activity, while GD’s ongoing hedge positions create a measurable, but managed, market‑risk exposure that must be monitored to protect its international earnings.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the $486 million pretax gain from Emerson's Therm-O-Disc divestiture is correctly reported (original answer states $486, which in context implies millions, consistent with SEC filing conventions). The $6.8 billion notional amount of General Dynamics' forward exchange contracts is accurate and matches the ground truth. The LLM adds a calculated estimate of a $196 million pretax loss from a 10% adverse move, which is a reasonable derivation (10% of $6.8B = $680M; however, the $196M figure likely reflects net hedged positions or specific exposure, possibly from footnote details not in the ground truth). While this specific loss figure isn't in the original answer, it doesn't contradict it and may reflect deeper document insight. (2) The date 'May 31, 2022' is a precise addition not in the ground truth but plausible and not incorrect. (3) Entity accuracy is strong: both companies, the divestiture, and the hedging instruments are correctly identified. (4) Reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts Emerson’s one-time gain (strengthening financial position, aiding in absorbing currency swings) with General Dynamics’ ongoing market risk from hedges, capturing the multi-hop synthesis required. (5) The answer addresses all parts of the question: impact on financial risk profiles in international operations for both firms. The only minor deviation is the $196M loss estimate, which isn't in the ground truth and slightly introduces unverified specificity, preventing a perfect 10. However, it does not undermine the overall correctness. Semantic equivalence is maintained, and contextual relevance is excellent.",

      "original_answer": "Altria recognizes the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The benefit is measured as the largest amount greater than 50% likely of being realized. PepsiCo, on the other hand, focuses on internal controls and procedures to identify uncertain tax positions, involving tax professionals to evaluate the company's tax structure, transactions, and interpretations of tax law, particularly transfer pricing arrangements. PepsiCo also monitors for new information such as tax examination progress or new tax laws that could affect unrecognized tax benefits. This indicates that while Altria emphasizes a quantitative threshold (more than 50% likelihood of realization), PepsiCo emphasizes procedural rigor and continuous reassessment based on evolving legal and regulatory inputs.",
      "llm_answer": "Altria follows the “more‑likely‑than‑not” rule – it records a tax‑benefit on the balance sheet only for the portion of an uncertain position that it judges has a greater than 50 % chance of being sustained, and it accrues any related interest and penalties as part of its income‑tax provision (Altria – Note 63). PepsiCo, by contrast, sets up a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits when it believes a position is likely to be challenged and not survive, treating the uncertain amount as a liability rather than recognizing a benefit (PepsiCo – Note 120). Thus Altria’s policy emphasizes recognizing probable benefits, while PepsiCo’s policy is more conservative, emphasizing the potential liability of disputed positions.",

The mention of accruing interest and penalties as part of the income tax provision adds detail consistent with Altria’s disclosures. However, the characterization of PepsiCo’s approach is partially inaccurate. The LLM claims PepsiCo 'sets up a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits when it believes a position is likely to be challenged and not survive, treating the uncertain amount as a liability rather than recognizing a benefit,' which implies a more conservative, liability-focused policy. While PepsiCo does maintain reserves, the ground truth emphasizes that PepsiCo’s approach centers on procedural rigor—using tax professionals, evaluating transfer pricing, and continuously monitoring tax developments—not simply a conservative bias toward liability recognition. The LLM misses this key procedural and dynamic reassessment aspect, instead framing PepsiCo’s approach as inherently more conservative in outcome, which is not explicitly supported in the original answer. This misrepresents the nature of the contrast: Altria uses a quantitative threshold, while PepsiCo emphasizes process and ongoing evaluation. The reasoning is sound in comparing two different philosophies but oversimplifies PepsiCo’s methodology. Contextual relevance is high as the response directly addresses the question about differing approaches to tax benefit recognition and liabilities.

      "original_answer": "ACN reclassified prior period amounts due to the movement of Middle East and Africa market units into the EMEA geographic market, which affected the presentation of operating income by region, such as a 9% increase in overall operating income and specific changes in EMEA driven by foreign exchange rates and cost reductions. Meanwhile, INTC adjusted all prior-period amounts in its goodwill footnote to reflect changes in operating segments, reallocating goodwill among reporting units based on relative fair value.

(1) All entities—ACN (Accenture) and INTC (Intel)—are correctly identified, and the fiscal year (2023) and nature of changes (geographic reclassification for ACN, goodwill reallocation for INTC) are accurately described. (2) There are no explicit numerical values (e.g., 9% increase in operating income) in the LLM answer that appear in the original answer, but the absence of these numbers does not constitute an error because the LLM correctly describes the qualitative impact (preserving comparability, retrospective adjustments). The lack of specific percentages like '9% increase' is a minor omission but does not undermine the factual correctness, as the focus of the LLM response is on the structural and reporting implications rather than quantifying performance changes. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that both companies adjusted prior periods but through different mechanisms—ACN via geographic realignment (Middle East and Africa moved to EMEA), and INTC via goodwill reallocation based on fair value. It correctly identifies that both actions enhance comparability across periods. (4) The LLM cites specific pages (45–47 for ACN, 98 for INTC), which adds precision and supports credibility, even if not required.

According to the ground truth, Duke Energy reported $255 million in Noncurrent Derivative Liabilities, but the LLM incorrectly states $276 million. This error propagates into the combined total: the correct sum is $255M + $1,023M = $1,278 million, whereas the LLM calculates $276M + $1,023M = $1,299 million, which is inaccurate. While NextEra Energy's value ($1,023 million) is correctly reported, Duke Energy's figure is not, undermining the quantitative foundation of the response. (2) Calculations are internally consistent within the LLM’s incorrect inputs, but the final comparison — stating the combined total is 'about 4½ times' Duke’s liability — is misleading. With correct numbers: $1,278M / $255M ≈ 5.01x, not 4.5x. Even with the LLM’s numbers, $1,299M / $276M ≈ 4.71x, which is closer to 4.7x than 4.5x, so this comparison is also imprecise. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound — the model identifies both companies, retrieves their respective liabilities, computes a total, and makes a comparative statement — demonstrating correct qualitative approach and entity identification (Duke Energy, NextEra Energy/NEE, year 2022, correct metric). (4) Contextual relevance is high, as the answer addresses both parts of the question using appropriate financial terminology and logical flow. However, due to the incorrect Duke Energy figure and resulting miscalculations, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are significantly reduced. A score of 4/10 on correctness reflects that while some data is right (NEE’s liability, general direction of comparison), core facts are wrong, leading to an inaccurate conclusion.",

The LLM incorrectly attributes the UPS gain to 2021, despite the question and ground truth focusing on 2023 fiscal results. Only Emerson's $56 million gain is correctly identified. (2) Quantitative accuracy is poor: the LLM reports a combined total of $56 million, whereas the correct total is $3.36 billion ($56 million + $3.3 billion). The $3.3 billion figure is entirely omitted, and no accurate calculation is performed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not synthesize the correct gain for UPS in 2023, misidentifies the timing of the UPS gain, and thus cannot accurately compare the contexts. The explanation of Emerson’s gain is accurate, but the contrast with UPS is invalid due to the factual error about UPS’s 2023 financials.

Similarly, CVS Health's correct value is 1,314 million, but the LLM states 1,329 million. The calculated difference in the ground truth is 359 million (1,673 - 1,314), whereas the LLM computes 448 million (1,777 - 1,329), which is incorrect due to the wrong inputs.

      "question": "How does the difference in average production costs per oil-equivalent barrel between XOM's operations in Canada/Other Americas and its operations in Europe affect its regional profitability, and how might this contrast with COP's global production cost disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "XOM's average production costs in Canada/Other Americas are $22.47 per oil-equivalent barrel, while in Europe the costs are significantly higher at $31.79 per barrel. This $9.32 per barrel difference suggests that XOM's European operations are less profitable on a per-barrel basis than its operations in Canada and the Other Americas. COP, in contrast, discloses its global average production cost per BOE as part of its supplementary data but does not break it down regionally. Therefore, while we can assess XOM's cost-driven regional profitability differences, we cannot directly compare COP's regional cost structure due to its lack of granular cost disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "Exxon Mobil’s 2023 filing shows that the average cost to produce a barrel‑of‑oil‑equivalent in its Canada/Other Americas segment was **$19.94**, whereas in Europe it was **$36.37** – a gap of roughly **$16‑$17 per BOE**.  Because the Canadian segment also earned a higher crude price ($80.51 vs $71.99 per barrel), its margin is materially stronger than Europe’s, where a lower price is combined with a substantially higher cost, compressing regional profitability.  By contrast, ConocoPhillips reports only a single, company‑wide average production cost (its 10‑K lists “average production costs per BOE” without regional break‑outs), so it does not disclose the same cost‑differential that drives Exxon’s varied regional earnings.",

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numerical values. According to the ground truth, XOM's production cost in Canada/Other Americas is $22.47 per BOE, not $19.94, and in Europe it is $31.79, not $36.37. The calculated difference in the LLM answer is ~$16.43, whereas the correct difference is $9.32 — a substantial deviation that affects the interpretation of cost impact on profitability. Additionally, the LLM introduces data not present in the original answer — specifically, crude prices of $80.51 and $71.99 — which are not mentioned or supported in the ground truth, leading to an unsupported claim about price-driven margin differences. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies undermine the reliability of the analysis: both input numbers and the resulting cost gap are wrong. While the directionality (higher costs in Europe) is correct, the magnitude is misrepresented. (3) The reasoning structure is sound — the model correctly infers that higher costs in a region reduce profitability and contrasts XOM’s regional disclosures with COP’s lack of regional breakdown — which aligns with the multi-hop requirement. However, the synthesis relies on incorrect data and introduces unverified external details (crude prices), weakening the logical foundation. (4) Despite the factual errors, the answer remains contextually relevant by addressing both parts of the question: XOM’s regional cost differences affecting profitability and COP’s disclosure limitations. The qualitative logic is partially accurate, but the incorrect numbers and fabricated price data significantly reduce factual correctness. Hence, the correctness score is limited to 4 due to major quantitative errors, even though the overall framework and intent of the response are appropriate.",

      "original_answer": "Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) experienced a 198 basis point decrease in its Net Charge-Off Rate to 1.90% in 2021, which contributed to a $8.2 billion decrease in the Provision for Credit Losses, resulting in a benefit of $902 million due to strong credit performance. This improvement indicates better loan recovery or fewer defaults, which enhances profitability and reduces risk. PayPal (PYPL), on the other hand, defines its Net Charge-Off Rate as the annual ratio of net credit losses (excluding fraud losses) on merchant loans and advances relative to the average daily loan balance. This definition implies that PYPL’s credit risk exposure is directly tied to the performance of its merchant loan portfolio, and a higher Net Charge-Off Rate would signal increased credit deterioration and potential financial loss.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s credit‑card net‑charge‑off rate fell from 3.88 % in 2020 to 1.90 % in 2021 – a 198‑basis‑point decline – which turned the 2020 credit‑loss provision of $7.3 billion into a $902 million benefit in 2021.  That release of reserves helped lift income from continuing operations before tax from $1.8 billion to $10.2 billion and net income from $1.4 billion to $7.8 billion, driving the sharp improvement in the segment’s profitability【page_71】.  \n\nPayPal defines the net‑charge‑off rate as “the annual ratio of net credit losses, excluding fraud losses, on consumer (or merchant) loans … as a percentage of the average daily amount of the loan balance”【page_44】, so a higher rate directly signals greater credit‑loss exposure and would require larger allowances, while a lower rate indicates weaker credit risk and improves its risk profile.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer is highly accurate in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. It correctly states that Capital One's Net Charge-Off Rate decreased from 3.88% in 2020 to 1.90% in 2021, a 198 basis point decline, matching the ground truth. It accurately notes the $902 million benefit in 2021 (vs. a $7.3 billion provision in 2020), which aligns with the $8.2 billion decrease in Provision for Credit Losses (since $7.3B + $0.902B ≈ $8.2B release). The financial impacts on income before tax and net income are consistent with the data. For PayPal, the definition of Net Charge-Off Rate is correctly quoted and interpreted, emphasizing exclusion of fraud losses and focus on merchant/consumer loans relative to average daily balance.\n\n2) All numbers are correct: 3.88%, 1.90%, 198 bps, $7.3B, $902M, and implied $8.2B swing. The LLM adds more precise context (e.g., 2020 provision amount) not in the original answer but factually consistent. No calculation errors.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: connects Capital One’s charge-off improvement to reserve release and profitability, then contrasts with PayPal’s definition to infer credit risk exposure. Synthesis across companies and metrics is logical and complete.\n\n4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly broadens PayPal’s definition by including 'consumer loans' alongside merchant loans, while the ground truth specifies 'merchant loans and advances'. However, the core insight — that PayPal’s credit risk exposure is tied to loan performance and reflected in this rate — remains valid and well-reasoned. This does not materially misrepresent the risk implication.\n\nThus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness due to near-perfect accuracy and strong reasoning, with only a slight overgeneralization in PayPal’s loan scope.",

The difference between these amounts is $1,187 million. In terms of net exposure, COF reported a net exposure of $2,322 million after accounting for all collateral, while AIG’s disclosure does not include a net exposure figure but highlights a significant amount of collateral held.

The ground truth states AIG reported $1,200 million (i.e., $1.2 billion) in securities collateral pledged *to them*, but the LLM incorrectly claims AIG pledged $2.723 billion *to counterparties*—this reverses the direction of collateral flow and misstates the amount. Additionally, the LLM attributes $2.6 billion in borrowings and net exposure for AIG not present in the original answer, which explicitly states AIG did not disclose a net exposure figure. Only COF’s $13 million pledged and $2,322 million net exposure are correctly reported. (2) The difference calculation is based on incorrect values: $2.723 billion – $0.013 billion = $2.71 billion difference, but the correct difference is $1,200M – $13M = $1,187M. The LLM’s calculation is mathematically correct but based on false inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing collateral pledged and linking to net exposure—but flawed due to incorrect data synthesis. The LLM conflates 'collateral pledged by AIG' with 'collateral pledged to AIG', a critical directional error in financial context. It also fabricates AIG’s net exposure, failing to acknowledge the absence of such data in the source. (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant, addressing both companies, the correct date (December 31, 2023), and attempting to interpret collateral strategy differences. However, due to major quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, especially the reversal of collateral direction and invented figures, the correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised; qualitative reasoning is partially logical but based on false premises; contextual relevance is strong as the structure and intent align with the question.",

In contrast, T disclosed a consistent increase in amortization of network software, reaching $3,076 million in 2024, indicating sustained investment in software supporting its network infrastructure.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is largely correct and captures the core contrast between CMCSA and T (AT&T) in software amortization trends and their implications for capital investment. (1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly states that CMCSA saw a decrease in software amortization in 2024 and that AT&T's network software amortization increased, reaching approximately $3.1 billion in 2024. The ground truth specifies $3,076 million ($3.076 billion), so the LLM's $3.1 billion is a reasonable rounding. However, the LLM introduces a figure not in the original—claiming AT&T's amortization rose from $3.0 billion in 2023 to $3.1 billion in 2024 with a $53 million increase—which is plausible but not verifiable from the provided ground truth, which only reports the 2024 value. This is a minor overreach in specificity. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the companies (CMCSA as Comcast, T as AT&T), the relevant metric (amortization of software/network software), and the year (2024). (3) The reasoning is sound: it draws a valid inference from the opposing trends—CMCSA reducing software amortization while AT&T increases it—and links this to differing capital investment patterns. The conclusion that AT&T is investing in fiber and wireless infrastructure adds context not in the original but is a reasonable interpretation. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the comparison of amortization changes and the implication for capital investment. The only shortcomings are the unverified 2023 figure and the slightly stronger claim of 'pulling back' on software outlays for CMCSA, whereas the original suggests 'managing more cautiously'—a nuance lost.

However, the per-share earnings are significantly off: the LLM states LMT’s diluted EPS is 'about $23.5' and calculates a per-share difference of '$9.2', whereas the ground truth is LMT EPS = $22.76, FDX EPS = $14.33, and the correct difference is $8.43. This results in a material error in the second part of the answer. (2) The total earnings difference is stated as 'roughly $2.5 billion', which is acceptable rounding from the exact $2,496 million. However, the per-share difference is miscalculated: $23.5 - $14.33 = $9.17 (as implied), but the correct values yield $8.43—a difference of $0.74 per share, which is significant.

      "question": "What is the combined financial impact on Emerson (EMR) and UPS from their respective mark-to-market adjustments in 2023, and how does this reflect opposing effects on their financial statements?",
      "original_answer": "Emerson (EMR) recognized a mark-to-market gain of $56 million from its equity investment in National Instruments, while UPS reported a mark-to-market loss of $359 million from remeasurements of its defined benefit plans. The combined financial impact of these mark-to-market adjustments is a net loss of $303 million ($56M gain - $359M loss). This reflects opposing effects on their financial statements: Emerson experienced a positive valuation adjustment on its investment, whereas UPS faced a significant loss tied to pension plan remeasurements, which was a reversal from a $1.1 billion gain in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s equity‑investment in National Instruments generated a **$56 million mark‑to‑market gain** in 2023, while United Parcel Service recorded a **$359 million mark‑to‑market loss** on its defined‑benefit pension and post‑retirement plans for the same year. Together, the two adjustments produced a net‑negative impact of roughly **$303 million** on the combined financial results. The Emerson gain boosted its earnings, whereas the UPS loss reduced its other income and lowered overall profitability, illustrating opposite effects on each company’s financial statements.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key facts: Emerson's $56 million gain from its investment in National Instruments and UPS's $359 million loss from pension plan remeasurements are accurately reported. The net impact of $303 million ($56M - $359M = -$303M) is correctly calculated and described as a net-negative impact. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—values match the ground truth exactly, including correct signs (gain vs. loss), magnitudes, and the resulting net figure. Format variations (e.g., 'million' vs. 'M') are acceptable and do not affect meaning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different companies (EMR and UPS), two distinct financial events (equity investment gain vs. pension remeasurement loss), and correctly contrasts their effects on financial statements. It accurately notes opposing impacts—Emerson’s gain boosting earnings vs. UPS’s loss reducing profitability. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits the contextual detail mentioned in the original answer about UPS’s loss being a reversal from a $1.1 billion gain in the prior year. While this doesn’t affect the core correctness of the 2023 figures or the net calculation, it slightly reduces completeness in explaining the 'opposing effects' in a broader trend context. However, the main qualitative and quantitative requirements are fully met, and the answer remains semantically equivalent in substance. Hence, a high score of 9 is justified.",

      "original_answer": "The percentage of franchised restaurants in McDonald's U.S. segment is 95% as of December 31, 2023. This aligns with McDonald's overall franchising strategy, as evidenced by the 89% franchised ratio in the International Operated Markets segment and the 98% franchised ratio in the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment, showing a consistent global preference for franchising.",
      "llm_answer": "As of December 31 2023, 95 percent of the restaurants in McDonald’s U.S. segment were franchised. By contrast, the company’s other reportable segments are also overwhelmingly franchised—approximately 89 percent in International Operated Markets and about 98 percent in International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate—showing that McDonald’s global strategy relies on franchising for the vast majority of its restaurants across all regions.",

      "original_answer": "For KO, volume-based incentive programs are a component of variable consideration, which is estimated and included in net operating revenues upon completion of performance obligations. KO considers factors like customer sales volumes and discount rates in estimating this variable consideration. For PM, volume-based incentives are treated as reductions of revenue and are recorded as sales occur, based on estimates of customer target achievement. These estimates directly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognized for both companies, though each uses a different method for incorporating these incentives into financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "The Coca‑Cola filing explains that the cash discounts, promotional funds and **volume‑based incentive programs** promised to bottlers are treated as **variable consideration**; the company estimates the amount of that consideration (using historical data and a portfolio‑level approach) and includes it in the transaction price that is recognized as **net operating revenue** when the related performance obligations are satisfied, subject to the constraint that a reversal is not probable. In contrast, Philip Morris states that it **estimates the cost of volume‑based incentives** for each customer, determines the likelihood that the targets will be met and **records the estimated incentive as a reduction of revenue (trade‑promotion expense) at the time the sale occurs**, using historical utilization rates for other promotions.",

(1) It accurately describes how KO treats volume-based incentives as variable consideration, estimating it using historical data and including it in net operating revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations, subject to the constraint against probable reversal—this aligns with KO's 2022 10-K disclosure. (2) For PM, the LLM correctly states that volume-based incentives are estimated per customer, based on likelihood of target achievement, and recorded as a reduction of revenue (trade promotion expense) at the time of sale, using historical utilization rates—consistent with PM's revenue recognition policy in its 2022 10-K. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes distinct accounting treatments from two different companies (KO and PM) and maps them to the appropriate financial statement impacts (revenue recognition vs. trade promotion cost estimation). (4) There are no numerical inaccuracies; while no specific dollar amounts or percentages are cited in the original or LLM answer, the qualitative descriptions of methods, timing, and estimation techniques are semantically equivalent and factually precise.

      "original_answer": "PYPL explicitly excludes fraud losses from its net charge-off rate calculation, whereas COF does not specify such an exclusion in its reporting. This difference in methodology makes it difficult to directly compare COF's 0.37% net charge-off rate in 2021 with PYPL's rate, as PYPL's metric reflects only non-fraud credit losses, potentially presenting a more favorable credit performance picture for PYPL if fraud losses were material.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s 2021 net‑charge‑off rate is **calculated after removing fraud losses** – the filing states that the “net charge‑off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses, **excluding fraud losses**, on consumer loans receivable” (COF 10‑K p. 44).  \n\nPayPal, by contrast, does not carve fraud out of its charge‑off metric. Its 10‑K groups fraud with other “transaction losses” (buyer‑seller protection, charge‑backs, etc.) and reports a single “transaction and credit‑losses” figure that includes fraud (PYPL 10‑K p. 43). Because PayPal’s net‑charge‑off rate is derived from net charge‑offs that are not expressly separated from those transaction‑loss components, the rate may reflect fraud‑related losses that Capital One’s rate omits.  \n\nTherefore, the two rates are not directly comparable: Capital One’s figure is a “pure” credit‑loss rate, while PayPal’s figure potentially incorporates fraud‑related losses, making PayPal’s reported net‑charge‑off rate higher (or at least not equivalent) to Capital One’s for 2021.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains a critical factual error: it incorrectly states that Capital One (COF) excludes fraud losses from its net charge-off rate, when the ground truth confirms that COF does *not* specify such an exclusion. Instead, the LLM wrongly attributes to COF the methodology that actually belongs to PYPL. Conversely, it claims PayPal (PYPL) does *not* exclude fraud losses, while the ground truth states that PYPL *does* explicitly exclude fraud from its net charge-off calculation. This complete reversal of methodologies between the two companies undermines the entire analysis. The 2021 net charge-off rate of COF (0.37%) is mentioned in the ground truth but not in the LLM response, representing a missing key quantitative data point. The LLM also fails to cite PYPL’s actual net charge-off rate. While the general structure of the comparison and the conclusion about non-comparability are reasonable, the reasoning is based on inverted facts, leading to an incorrect explanation. The references to 10-K pages are plausible but misinterpreted in direction. Due to the fundamental swap of fraud treatment between the two companies, the multi-hop synthesis is invalid. Semantic equivalence is not achieved because the core factual claims are reversed. The answer is contextually relevant in framing the issue of comparability but fails on correctness.",

The calculated difference is reported as approximately 47.3 percentage points, which is numerically accurate (97 - 49.75 = 47.25, so ≈47.3 is acceptable rounding). The ground truth states 47.75%, which appears to be an error in the original answer—97 - 49.75 is 47.25, not 47.75. Thus, the LLM's calculation is actually more accurate than the ground truth. (2) All numeric values are correct: AIG’s range (6.25% to 49.75%) and MS’s (6% to 97%) are accurately cited with correct sources. The subtraction is properly executed.

Duke Energy reported $116 million in noncurrent derivative assets, while NextEra Energy reported $1,135 million. The significant difference suggests that NextEra Energy employs a more extensive long-term hedging strategy or has larger long-term commodity, interest rate, or foreign currency exposures compared to Duke Energy, which may reflect a more aggressive or diversified risk management approach in managing future price volatility.",

The combined total is stated as 'about $1.25 billion', which is a rounded approximation of the exact sum ($1,251 million), and while not precise to the exact $1,228 million in the ground truth, this appears to be a minor discrepancy possibly due to rounding or source variation. Given that $116M + $1,135M = $1,251M, the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct, but the ground truth reports $1,228M—suggesting a potential data variance. However, since the individual components match exactly and the sum is arithmetically sound, the error (if any) may lie in the ground truth or in different reporting scopes; thus, the LLM should not be heavily penalized. (2) All entities—Duke Energy (parent), NextEra Energy (NEE), and the date December 31, 2021—are correctly identified. The financial metric 'noncurrent derivative assets' is accurately used. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two companies, computes the total, and interprets the strategic implications of the difference in positions. The explanation that NextEra employs a more extensive long-term hedging strategy due to larger exposures aligns with the ground truth's interpretation.

It reports CMCSA's 2023 broadband revenue as $10.5 billion, but the ground truth is $25,489 million ($25.489 billion), more than double the stated amount. This severely undermines the quantitative accuracy. T's 2024 broadband revenue is correctly reported as $11.2 billion (matching $11,212 million). The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM calculates $21.7 billion, but the correct sum is $36,701 million ($36.701 billion). (2) The year-over-year growth rate of T (7.2%) is accurately reported. However, the comparison between T and CMCSA is factually incorrect: the LLM claims AT&T’s 2024 base is about $0.8 billion larger than Comcast’s 2023 business, but in reality, CMCSA’s $25.489 billion is much larger than T’s $11.212 billion—by about $14.3 billion. Thus, the direction and magnitude of the comparison are wrong.

The difference is accurately calculated as $1.095 billion, which the model appropriately rounded to $1.1 billion—this is acceptable under the allowed format variations and standard rounding practices. (2) All numeric values are correct: $6.315B = $6,315M, $5.220B = $5,220M, and the difference of $1.095B is correctly represented as ~$1.1B. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesized data from two different companies (LMT and FDX) for the same fiscal year (2021) and performed a valid comparison of net earnings, despite differing metric phrasings (e.g., 'net earnings' vs 'net earnings allocable to common shares'). (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with only formatting differences (billion vs million, rounding). The minor rounding of $1.095B to $1.1B prevents a perfect 10 due to slight loss of precision, but this is reasonable and common. All entities, years, and metrics are accurate.

According to the ground truth, ConocoPhillips (COP) added 335 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) from extensions and discoveries in 2023, which is correct in the LLM answer. However, ExxonMobil (XOM) is reported as adding 1,997 MMBOE in the LLM answer, which is incorrect — the correct value from the knowledge graph is 1,065 MMBOE. This leads to an incorrect combined total of 2,332 MMBOE instead of the correct 1,400 MMBOE. The calculation error is substantial and materially misrepresents the scale of reserve additions. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: while COP's number is correct, XOM's is off by over 87%, and the sum is inflated by nearly 67%. These are not minor rounding or formatting issues but major discrepancies. (3) The qualitative reasoning about the contribution to overall reserve growth contains plausible elements — for example, noting that extensions and discoveries were a main source of growth for COP and that XOM’s reserves were offset by production — but this contextual analysis is undermined by the incorrect base numbers. The multi-hop synthesis (aggregating across two companies and interpreting impact) is logically structured but built on faulty data. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses both parts of the question — total increase and contribution to reserve growth — and uses appropriate terminology and structure. However, due to the critical numerical inaccuracies, especially in the XOM figure and the combined total, the overall correctness score is low. A score of 3 reflects that only one of the two primary data points is correct, and the derived conclusion (combined increase) is therefore invalid.",

This misrepresents the scale by a factor of 1,000 for ACN and distorts the combined total to $1.66 trillion instead of the correct $6.83 million.

(2) The individual depreciation percentages (60% and 56%) are approximately correct and match the ground truth (60.0% and 56.1%), but the supporting numbers are again off by a factor of 1,000 due to the erroneous 'million' suffixes.

For GOOGL, while the $5.2 billion increase is correctly stated (82.4B - 77.2B), the conclusion that operating margin improved is plausible but not supported by the ground truth, which states the cost increase put upward pressure on margins unless offset—this nuance is misrepresented as a definitive margin improvement. More critically, for T, the LLM claims Other Cost of Revenues increased due to higher amortization, but the ground truth states there was a $395 million *decrease* due to a change in accounting estimate extending amortization periods. This is a direct contradiction. (2) Quantitative inaccuracies: The LLM reports rising amortization costs for T ($541M increase to $3.48B), but the ground truth indicates a cost *reduction* from a change in estimate—no such increase occurred.

For GOOGL, the $5.2B increase and $479M severance charge are correct, but the implication that margin improved is not confirmed in the ground truth and may be misleading.

      "original_answer": "The combined total Net Property and Equipment (Net P&E) for HD and MCD in 2023 is $45.754 billion. HD reported Net P&E of $26.154 billion as of January 28, 2024, which is derived from total Property and Equipment of $53.257 billion less accumulated depreciation and finance lease amortization of $27.103 billion. MCD reported Net P&E of $20.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, which is after deducting accumulated depreciation and amortization of $14.5 billion. Therefore, the total accumulated depreciation and amortization from both companies is $41.603 billion, significantly reducing their gross property and equipment to arrive at the net values.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, HD's Net P&E is $26.154 billion (correctly reported by LLM as $26,154 million), but MCD's Net P&E is incorrectly stated as $24,907.6 million ($24.9 billion) instead of the correct $20.1 billion. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $51.1 billion instead of the correct $45.754 billion. Additionally, MCD's accumulated depreciation is reported as $18,662.4 million ($18.7 billion) by the LLM, but the ground truth states $14.5 billion. The gross property and equipment for MCD is also wrong: LLM says $43,570 million, but ground truth implies $34.6 billion ($20.1B + $14.5B). (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: the sum of $26.154B + $24.908B = $51.062B is mathematically correct but based on incorrect inputs. The correct sum is $26.154B + $20.1B = $46.254B (rounded to $45.754B in original answer—note: likely a typo in original; $26.154 + $20.1 = $46.254, not $45.754). Even with that, LLM’s use of $24.9B for MCD is unsupported. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to explain how accumulated depreciation impacts net P&E for both companies and identifies relevant components like finance lease amortization. However, it introduces incorrect data for MCD, undermining the synthesis. It also mentions $1.2 billion amortization for HD finance leases, which is not in the ground truth and appears fabricated. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the structure addresses both parts of the question: total Net P&E and the role of accumulated depreciation. But due to severe quantitative inaccuracies, especially for MCD, the correctness score is low. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because reasoning framework is logical, but entity/metric accuracy fails on MCD side. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to multiple incorrect numbers and miscalculations.",

The ground truth states the combined increase in proved undeveloped reserves from extensions and discoveries for COP and XOM in 2023 is 1,067 million barrels of oil equivalent (335 MMBOE for COP and 732 MMBOE for XOM). However, the LLM reports 312 MMBOE for COP and 556 MMBOE for XOM, totaling 868 MMBOE—substantially underreporting both individual and combined values. These discrepancies are material and affect the core of the question. (2) Calculations in the LLM response are internally consistent (e.g., net reserve changes derived from additions minus revisions/production), but they are based on incorrect base figures. For example, it correctly notes that COP’s net increase in proved undeveloped reserves was 292 MMBOE, but attributes this to 312 MMBOE in extensions and discoveries, which contradicts the ground truth of 335 MMBOE. Similarly, XOM’s reported 556 MMBOE is far below the true 732 MMBOE. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to synthesize data across both companies and links extensions/discoveries to overall reserve growth, which addresses the second part of the question. It references correct document pages and breaks down regional contributions for COP, showing effort in synthesis. However, because the foundational numbers are wrong, the conclusions about contribution to reserve growth, while logically framed, are based on incorrect inputs. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question (combined increase and contribution to growth), uses appropriate terminology, and provides contextual detail (e.g., regional breakdowns, net changes).

      "original_answer": "ACN adjusts its tax liabilities or assets quarterly based on changing facts and circumstances, such as audit progress or statute expirations, and acknowledges that final determinations could materially differ from estimates, impacting income tax provision, net income, or cash flows. QCOM, on the other hand, participates in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process for tax years prior to fiscal 2021, aiming to resolve all issues with the IRS before filing its federal return, which may reduce the likelihood of unexpected tax liabilities. If both companies were to face unexpected tax liabilities not accounted for in their estimates, ACN would likely record adjustments to its tax liabilities in the period the new information arises, while QCOM may experience a larger-than-anticipated reversal of previously recorded tax liabilities, both affecting their financial statements significantly but through different mechanisms.",

Quantitatively, there are no numerical inaccuracies—since the question does not involve explicit numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates), the absence of incorrect figures supports a high quantitative accuracy score. However, the qualitative accuracy is lower due to a critical reversal in entity attribution: the LLM incorrectly states that AIG uses credit-risk metrics (like probability of default) in its allowance for credit losses and cites Morgan Stanley’s 10-K (p. 69) as the source, which is factually wrong—this information belongs to Morgan Stanley, not AIG. Conversely, the LLM attributes to Morgan Stanley the use of credit-spread sensitivity and stress testing, which aligns with the ground truth, but misrepresents AIG’s role in using such metrics. The ground truth clearly states that Morgan Stanley incorporates credit risk metrics into its allowance for credit losses and risk mitigation, while AIG only accounts for its own credit risk in OCI. The LLM flips parts of the comparison, misassigning risk management practices between the two firms. This undermines the multi-hop reasoning, as the synthesis across companies is flawed. Contextually, the answer is well-structured and relevant, addressing both accounting treatment and use of metrics, but the core differentiation between the two companies is partially incorrect.

This indicates a growing pressure on Google's cost structure from content and labor-related expenses. AT&T's disclosure reveals that amortization costs related to customer contract acquisition and fulfillment—primarily included in 'Selling, general and administrative' and 'Other cost of revenues'—suggest a different composition of operational expenses focused on customer acquisition rather than content and labor. This comparison highlights distinct cost drivers within the communication services sector: Google faces rising content and compensation costs, while AT&T's operational expenses are significantly shaped by customer acquisition amortization.",

While the original answer references a $11.9B increase from 2021 to 2022 (not 2022 to 2023), the LLM does not contradict this; instead, it provides more granular and up-to-date 2023 data not in the original answer, which is acceptable and possibly reflects updated knowledge.

The direction of comparison is correct (ExxonMobil > Chevron), but the magnitude is wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to reliance on inaccurate data.

This results in an incorrect comparison claiming PM’s change was $1.1 billion less than Coca-Cola’s, when in fact it was only about $0.47 billion less. Additionally, the LLM fails to answer the final part of the question — the total change across both companies — which should be $4,607 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model retrieves and compares data for both companies, but the calculation for PM’s change is wrong (likely due to incorrect subtraction: $33.1B - $31.6B = $1.5B, not $1.44B, and still off from the true $2.068B), and the synthesis of the total change is missing. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to correct directional trends and approximate values for KO, but major errors in PM’s numbers and missing total.

According to the ground truth, COF's total allowance was $11,430 million and PYPL's was $201 million at the end of 2021, resulting in a difference of $11,229 million. However, the LLM incorrectly calculates PYPL's total allowance as $487 million by summing $201 million (merchant) and $286 million (consumer), which is not supported by the ground truth. The ground truth states PYPL's total allowance was $201 million at year-end, not $487 million. Similarly, the LLM claims PYPL's beginning allowance was $835 million (summing $483 million and $352 million), but the ground truth reports $483 million as the beginning balance. This leads to an incorrect decrease of $348 million instead of the correct $282 million. (2) All key calculations are wrong: the difference between COF and PYPL allowances is stated as ~$10.94 billion instead of $11,229 million (~$11.23 billion), and the change in PYPL's allowance is reported as $348 million decrease instead of $282 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model incorrectly assumes that PYPL has separate merchant and consumer allowances that must be summed, when the ground truth already provides the total allowance. It also introduces a consumer allowance of $286 million and $352 million at the beginning, which are not in the original data.

      "original_answer": "Accenture's total cash outlay for dividends in 2022 was $2,457,306, while Qualcomm paid $3,212 in dividends during the same period. This indicates that Accenture allocated significantly more capital to dividend payments compared to Qualcomm, which focused more heavily on stock repurchases ($3,129) as part of its capital return strategy.

Conversely, it claims Qualcomm paid $3.2 billion in dividends, but the correct amount is $3,212 (about $3.2 thousand), again reversing the scale. These errors completely invert the comparison. (2) The numbers are not just misstated—they are catastrophically inaccurate. The LLM swaps millions for billions and vice versa, leading to a total reversal of the financial reality. Accenture actually paid ~$2.46 billion (not million), and Qualcomm paid ~$3.2 thousand (not billion). The calculation and comparison are therefore entirely incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model draws the opposite conclusion based on flipped numbers. It claims Qualcomm emphasizes dividends and Accenture uses modest dividends, when in fact Accenture pays a large dividend and Qualcomm pays a minimal one, focusing instead on buybacks. The synthesis is logically consistent within its own incorrect data, but the foundation is false. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the structure addresses capital return strategies and cites document pages, but the qualitative analysis is based on incorrect data, rendering the insight invalid. The model appears to confuse repurchase and dividend figures between the companies.

This led to a core sales growth (non-GAAP) of 23.0% for DHR and an organic growth rate of 15% for TMO.

According to the ground truth, DHR's acquisitions/divestitures had a negative impact of 16.5%, not -7.5% as stated. Similarly, TMO's acquisitions/divestitures contributed positively by 5%, not -0.5% as implied. The organic growth rate for TMO is reported as 31%, which is incorrect — the correct value is 15%. Only DHR’s organic growth rate (23.0%) is correctly stated. (2) Calculations are therefore also incorrect: the difference in impact of acquisitions/divestitures is stated implicitly as 7.0 percentage points (from -7.5% vs -0.5%), but the correct difference is -21.5 percentage points (16.5% negative vs +5% positive). The final comparison of organic growth rates is stated as 8 points in favor of TMO, but since TMO’s organic growth is falsely inflated to 31%, this conclusion is based on wrong data — although the 8-point difference is numerically correct (23% - 15% = 8%), the direction is wrong (DHR is actually 8 points higher, not lower). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially attempted — the model tries to compare both companies’ acquisition impacts and organic growth — but due to incorrect data retrieval, the synthesis fails. The model misrepresents both the magnitude and direction of acquisition effects and reports an incorrect organic growth rate for TMO, undermining the entire comparative analysis. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure addresses the right concepts (impact of M&A on growth, organic growth comparison), but factual inaccuracies severely limit usefulness.

While the LLM condenses the original answer, it preserves the essential meaning: operational disruption due to vendor failure leading to adverse financial impact. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly pulls Amazon's fulfillment expense from one entity (Amazon, 2021) and cross-applies a risk factor from another (Lowe’s vendor reliance disclosure), synthesizing across companies and contexts as required. 4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the LLM omits some nuance from the original—such as the possibility of temporary impact 'until we are able to replace them' and the explicit mention of 'sole or primary source' providers—but the core risk is accurately conveyed.

      "original_answer": "Emerson incurred a pretax loss of $181 million from exiting its operations in Russia, while General Dynamics estimated a hypothetical pretax loss of $680 million (10% unfavorable movement on $6.8 billion in contracts) from its foreign exchange and interest rate exposure. These figures indicate that Emerson’s loss was realized and operationally driven, directly impacting its financial results in 2022, whereas General Dynamics’ figure represents a market risk exposure that could materialize under adverse conditions. The comparison highlights differing financial risk profiles: Emerson faces operational restructuring costs, while General Dynamics is significantly exposed to macroeconomic fluctuations.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson recorded a **pretax loss of about $181 million** on the exit of its Russian operations.  General Dynamics says that a 10 % adverse shift in its forward‑exchange and interest‑rate‑swap portfolio would generate roughly **$197 million of pretax loss** (the $1 million recognized loss plus $196 million of unrecognized loss for 2021).  Both amounts are modest relative to each company’s earnings—Emerson’s loss trims its profit by a few percent, while GD’s market‑risk exposure would produce a comparable, but slightly larger, hit that is not expected to materially affect its overall financial position.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key quantitative figures. While it correctly states Emerson's pretax loss of $181 million from exiting Russia, it incorrectly reports General Dynamics' hypothetical pretax loss as $197 million. The ground truth states that General Dynamics estimated a $680 million loss from a 10% adverse movement on $6.8 billion in contracts. The LLM's figure of $197 million appears to be based on a misinterpretation of a different data point—possibly mixing recognized and unrecognized losses from 2021—but this is not equivalent to the hypothetical 10% scenario described in the question. This is a major quantitative error. (2) The calculation in the original answer ($6.8B × 10% = $680M) is straightforward and correct; the LLM fails to reflect this and instead introduces an unsupported calculation involving $1M + $196M. There is no mention of the $6.8 billion exposure in the LLM response, breaking the multi-hop logic required. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in that it attempts to contextualize the losses relative to earnings and distinguish between realized and hypothetical losses, but it mischaracterizes the nature of General Dynamics' exposure by anchoring to incorrect data. The comparison between operational restructuring (Emerson) and macroeconomic risk (General Dynamics) is conceptually valid but undermined by inaccurate inputs. (4) The contextual relevance is fair—the answer addresses both companies, discusses pretax losses, and attempts to assess financial implications—but due to the critical error in the General Dynamics figure, the conclusion that both losses are 'modest' and 'comparable' is misleading, as $197M vs $680M is a substantial difference. The answer would imply General Dynamics has less risk exposure than it actually does, which affects financial interpretation. Therefore, the correctness score is low due to a major factual and quantitative error, despite some structural and conceptual alignment.",

It reports XOM's reserves as 'liquids proved reserves' starting at 11,471 million barrels in 2022 and declining to 11,184 million in 2023 (a drop of 287 million), but the ground truth states XOM's total proved reserves (oil-equivalent) were 14,258 million at the start and 13,716 million at year-end (a decline of 542 million). This is a major discrepancy in both absolute values and the change. The LLM uses 'liquids' instead of 'oil-equivalent', which may explain part of the difference, but the question and ground truth specifically refer to oil-equivalent barrels, so this substitution is incorrect. (2) COP's numbers are correct: increase from 6,599 to 6,758 million (a gain of 159 million). However, the combined starting total in the LLM answer is wrong because it uses incorrect XOM figures: 11,471 + 6,599 = 18,070 million (vs. correct 20,857 million). The LLM calculates a net decline of 128 million, but the correct net change is a decrease of 383 million (from 20,857 to 20,474 million). The LLM's calculation of 287 million loss (XOM) minus 159 million gain (COP) = 128 million net loss is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but the inputs themselves are factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly attempts to compute individual changes and aggregate them—but it fails due to incorrect source data. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question and follows the correct analytical path. However, due to major quantitative errors in XOM's reserves, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.

It states a total of $1.18 billion, but the correct total from the ground truth is $979 million. This error arises from miscalculating the sum: Johnson & Johnson's charges are correctly stated as $200 million in 2023 and $200 million in 2024 (totaling $400 million), and Merck's charge is correctly stated as $779 million. However, the LLM incorrectly sums these to $1.18 billion ($400M + $779M = $1.179B), which contradicts the ground truth that the combined total is $979 million. This implies the ground truth treats Johnson & Johnson’s total impairment for M710 as $200 million (with the 2024 charge being a full impairment after a prior partial), not $400 million. Thus, the LLM misinterprets the nature of the J&J impairments—double-counting what may be a single $200M asset impaired in stages. (2) The individual components—Merck’s $779M in 2023 and J&J’s $200M in 2023 and 2024—are numerically accurate in isolation, but the synthesis is flawed. The LLM assumes both J&J charges are additive to total impairment, while the original answer suggests the 2024 charge is the full write-off of an asset previously partially impaired, meaning total J&J impairment for M710 is $200M, not $400M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking regulatory failure (FDA Complete Response Letter) to impairment and explaining financial risk is correct and well-articulated. Entity and year mappings are accurate: J&J, Merck, M710, MK-7264, 2023, 2024. (4) Despite strong contextual and qualitative understanding of the financial implications, the major calculation error and misinterpretation of the impairment timeline severely undermine factual correctness. The answer overstates the total by ~20%, which is material in financial reporting.

      "original_answer": "FedEx incurred $278 million in business realignment costs in 2022, which were specifically tied to workforce reductions in Europe and were managed through a structured program with expected future costs of approximately $420 million through fiscal 2023. These costs were directly linked to operational restructuring and were disclosed with specific estimates and timelines. In contrast, Lockheed Martin's approach to loss contingencies focuses on legal proceedings, where reserves are established based on U.S. GAAP assessments of probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. Lockheed Martin does not provide specific dollar amounts for these contingencies, indicating uncertainty in predicting the materiality of potential costs, especially due to evolving legal and regulatory environments. This reflects a more conservative and reactive strategy for managing unpredictable liabilities compared to FedEx's proactive and quantifiably planned approach to known restructuring costs.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx treats the workforce‑reduction plan as a concrete, incurred liability and records the $278 million of severance and related expenses directly in the income statement as “business‑realignment costs.” Lockheed Martin, by contrast, does not have a comparable definite outlay; it follows U.S. GAAP by estimating the probable amount of its unresolved legal claims and books a reserve for those loss contingencies, reflecting a precautionary, estimate‑based approach to uncertain liabilities.",

The answer correctly identifies both companies and the nature of their respective liabilities—FedEx's workforce reduction costs and Lockheed Martin's legal contingency reserves.

These omissions reduce the depth of the multi-hop synthesis, particularly around the proactive vs. reactive financial strategy comparison. While the LLM captures the core contrast—FedEx recognizing a definite liability versus Lockheed Martin using estimated reserves—the qualitative analysis is slightly less developed than the original answer, which explicitly frames FedEx’s approach as 'proactive and quantifiably planned' versus Lockheed Martin’s 'conservative and reactive' strategy.

      "original_answer": "ACN faces higher financial exposure from client contract cancellations because many of its consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration and can be terminated with as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue loss with limited time to replace it. In contrast, ADBE recognizes consulting revenue on a time-and-materials or relative performance basis, meaning it earns revenue progressively as services are delivered, reducing the risk of unrecovered costs from sudden cancellations. This difference in contract duration and revenue recognition timing means ACN is more vulnerable to abrupt revenue shortfalls, while ADBE's approach aligns revenue with service delivery and mitigates financial impact from late-stage cancellations.",
      "llm_answer": "Accenture’s consulting agreements are typically under 12 months and often allow a client to walk away with as little as 30 days’ notice; the firm records revenue as the services are performed, so a cancellation removes the expected billings almost immediately and can leave Accenture with unrecovered costs (see Accenture page 18). Adobe, by contrast, derives ≈ 92 % of its revenue from multi‑year subscriptions that it recognizes ratably over the contract term, and its consulting services are recognized only as the work is performed (Adobe page 45); therefore a client’s decision to cancel mainly reduces future deferred‑revenue balances rather than causing an abrupt loss of current‑period revenue, giving Adobe a lower near‑term exposure to contract cancellations.",

This figure is extraneous and unsupported in the ground truth, introducing a factual error. Additionally, while both companies recognize consulting revenue as services are performed (time-and-materials or performance-based), the LLM incorrectly implies Adobe’s lower exposure is due to deferred revenue from subscriptions, conflating subscription revenue with consulting services. The original answer focuses solely on consulting contracts, but the LLM shifts part of the rationale to Adobe’s subscription model, which, while true, is not directly relevant to consulting cancellations. Despite this, the core qualitative insight—that ACN faces immediate revenue loss from short-term cancellations while ADBE recognizes revenue progressively—is accurate and well-reasoned. Entity identification (ACN, ADBE) and document references (page numbers) are plausible but not verifiable; however, they do not contradict the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "The total Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized by DUK and NEE in 2021 is $921 million. This combined interest expense represents approximately 12.6% of their combined Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities for 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 Duke Energy paid **$335 million** and NextEra Energy (via Florida Power & Light) paid **$586 million** in cash for interest, net of the amount capitalized – a combined total of **$921 million**.  The two companies together generated **$7,314 million** of net cash from operating activities, so the combined interest cash outflow represented roughly **12.5 %** of that operating cash flow.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized for both DUK and NEE in 2021 as $335 million and $586 million, respectively, summing to the correct total of $921 million, matching the ground truth. The combined Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities is accurately stated as $7,314 million, and the calculated percentage (12.5%) is a precise approximation of the actual ratio (921 / 7,314 ≈ 12.59%), which rounds to the ground truth's 'approximately 12.6%'. The minor difference in decimal presentation (12.5% vs 12.6%) is within acceptable rounding tolerance and does not constitute a factual error. (2) All numeric values are correct: individual interest payments, total interest, total operating cash flow, and derived percentage are accurate. Calculations are sound: 335 + 586 = 921; 921 / 7,314 ≈ 0.1259 → 12.5% or 12.6% depending on rounding. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is correctly executed: the model synthesizes data from two companies (DUK and NEE), extracts the correct metric (Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized) for the correct year (2021), computes the sum, retrieves combined operating cash flow, and computes the percentage. Entity identification (Duke Energy, NextEra Energy, Florida Power & Light as subsidiary) is accurate. (4) The answer is contextually complete and directly addresses both parts of the question. The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is the slight rounding discrepancy in the percentage (12.5% vs 12.6%), though this is negligible and common in financial reporting. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and fully aligned with the ground truth.",

However, it incorrectly reported EMR's defined contribution expense as $200 million (breaking it into $130M U.S. and $70M non-U.S.), whereas the ground truth states EMR's total defined contribution expense was $32 million. This is a significant factual error. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer ($990M - $200M = $790M) is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but since one of the inputs (EMR's $200M) is factually wrong, the final difference of $790M is incorrect. The correct difference is $958M ($990M - $32M). (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly identified the need to compare LMT's pension contributions with EMR's defined contribution expense—but failed in entity-specific data retrieval for EMR.

      "original_answer": "JNJ records accruals for legal proceedings and product liability claims based on management's judgment and actuarially determined estimates, with self-insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. Claims exceeding insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In contrast, MRK accrues for legal contingencies when a liability is probable and reasonably estimable, with a portion of the accrual actuarially determined, factoring in past experience, reported claims, and estimates of claims not yet reported. MRK also specifically accounts for defense costs, with reserves of $225 million as of December 31, 2024, based on factors such as trial costs, case progression, and legal strategy. These differences reflect variations in risk management strategies and litigation exposure between the two companies.",
      "llm_answer": "J&J records legal‑contingency accruals by applying management’s judgment that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, using actuarial estimates where appropriate and adding separate accruals for any claims that exceed the limits of its captive self‑insurance program. Merck, by contrast, bases its product‑liability accruals on actuarial calculations that incorporate past claim experience, the number of reported claims and incurred‑but‑not‑reported (IBNR) estimates, while its legal‑defense reserves are set by evaluating actual defense costs incurred, the number and status of cases, trial outcomes and the timing and scope of ongoing litigation. Thus, J&J’s accruals are driven mainly by probability/estimation judgment and coverage limits, whereas Merck’s are driven by actuarial claim‑frequency data and detailed litigation‑cost factors.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: J&J uses management judgment and actuarial estimates, with accruals for claims exceeding captive insurance coverage; Merck uses actuarial models incorporating past experience, reported claims, and IBNR, and separately accounts for defense costs. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—while the ground truth mentions Merck’s $225 million reserve as of December 31, 2024, the LLM answer does not include this number but does not contradict it either. The omission is minor and does not affect the overall correctness, especially since the question focuses on strategies and influencing factors rather than specific dollar amounts. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in accrual methodologies between JNJ and MRK, identifying JNJ’s reliance on judgment and insurance limits versus Merck’s use of actuarial data and litigation-specific cost drivers. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—though the LLM uses slightly different phrasing (e.g., 'incurred-but-not-reported' instead of 'claims not yet reported'), the meaning is identical. The only minor shortcoming is the absence of the $225M defense reserve figure, which was present in the original answer and directly tied to Merck’s strategy. However, since the question emphasizes 'strategies' and 'factors' rather than required disclosure of all numerical reserves, this does not constitute a major error.

      "original_answer": "Emerson's 2022 margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points due to slightly dilutive effects from price less net material inflation and higher freight and other inflation, despite leverage from increased sales and cost reduction savings. In contrast, General Dynamics' defense segments saw margin performance influenced by contract mix and performance adjustments, where profitability changes stemmed from shifts in the volume of higher- versus lower-margin work and updates to cost estimates on long-term contracts. This highlights a divergence in margin drivers: EMR's margins were pressured by external inflationary factors and internal pricing strategies, while GD's margins were shaped by internal contract selection and evolving cost estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s 2022 margin rose to about 20 percent because higher‑priced sales more than offset material‑cost inflation, with the benefit of a favorable product mix and lower restructuring and freight‑inflation impacts. In contrast, General Dynamics said its defense‑segment margins were shaped primarily by the mix of contracts (the share of higher‑margin, fixed‑price work versus lower‑margin, cost‑reimbursable work) and by performance‑adjustments that change estimated costs at completion, rather than by price‑cost dynamics or general inflation.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual inaccuracies. The ground truth states that Emerson's 2022 margin *decreased* by 0.6 percentage points due to inflationary pressures, while the LLM claims Emerson's margin *rose to about 20 percent* and was positively impacted by pricing and product mix. This is a direct contradiction. There is no mention in the original answer of Emerson achieving a 20% margin or margin expansion. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: the 0.6 percentage point decline in Emerson’s margin is completely omitted and replaced with an unsupported claim of margin improvement to 20%. No such figure appears in the ground truth. The LLM invents a specific margin level (20%) and direction (increase) that are not present in the original. (3) While the description of General Dynamics’ margin drivers—contract mix (fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable) and performance adjustments affecting cost estimates—is qualitatively accurate and aligns with the ground truth, the treatment of Emerson is fundamentally flawed. The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model incorrectly characterizes one side of the comparison (EMR), undermining the contrast. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses the right companies (EMR, GD), time period (2022), and general topic (margin drivers), and correctly identifies GD’s contract mix and cost adjustments as key factors. However, the incorrect portrayal of Emerson’s margin performance and the forces behind it severely compromises the overall correctness. The divergence in margin drivers—external inflation vs. internal contract dynamics—is misrepresented because Emerson’s experience is falsely framed as successful price-cost management rather than margin pressure from inflation.",

      "original_answer": "Adobe recognizes revenue from consulting contracts either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts, which provides more immediate and predictable revenue recognition. In contrast, Accenture faces risks due to the short duration of many of its consulting contracts (often less than 12 months), with some allowing termination on as little as 30 days' notice, leading to potential revenue volatility and unpredictability. This contrast in contract structure and duration means Adobe has greater revenue predictability from its consulting services, while Accenture must manage a higher risk of sudden revenue loss and client retention challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe’s 10‑K explains that its consulting engagements are sold on a time‑and‑materials or fixed‑fee basis and are recognized as the work is performed (or on a relative‑performance basis for fixed‑fee work), so revenue is earned and recorded over the life of the contract rather than up‑front. In contrast, Accenture notes that most of its consulting contracts are under 12 months and can be ended with as little as 30 days’ notice, meaning the firm can lose the anticipated fees abruptly and must replace them before the next period. Consequently, Adobe’s consulting revenue is more predictable and spread out, whereas Accenture’s short‑term, easily‑terminable contracts create greater volatility and make revenue forecasting less certain.",

These contracts are not speculative and are used to economically mitigate exchange risk, although they do not qualify for hedge accounting. In contrast, PM's 2024 operating income variance shows a $205 million favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations, indicating that exchange rate movements had a measurable effect on its financial performance.

The original answer only mentions a $205 million favorable impact for PM—no adverse impact or regional breakdown is provided. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised: while the $205 million favorable impact is correct, the additional $592 million adverse impact is unsupported by the ground truth and changes the interpretation of PM's overall FX effect. The COST contract value of $1,212 million mentioned in the original is omitted entirely, a significant missing figure.

The ground truth states that NextEra Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts not designated as hedging instruments is $2,997 million, calculated as total derivative liabilities ($2,198 million) minus current portion ($1,201 million), but the LLM incorrectly reports $1,713 million directly as the noncurrent amount, which contradicts the ground truth calculation. Duke Energy's value of $132 million is correct. The combined total is therefore wrong: LLM reports $1,845 million vs. the correct $3,129 million. (2) Calculations are internally consistent in the LLM answer (132 + 1,713 = 1,845), but the inputs are flawed—especially the misinterpretation of NextEra’s noncurrent liability. The ground truth requires a multi-hop calculation using total and current liabilities to derive the noncurrent portion, which the LLM failed to perform correctly.

While it correctly states JNJ's 2023 sales ($85.1 billion) and calculates a $3.7 billion increase (to $88.8 billion in 2024), it incorrectly reports MRK's 2024 sales as $64.2 billion, implying a $5.1 billion increase from $59.1 billion. However, the ground truth combined increase is $11.8 billion, which means the correct individual increases should sum to that amount. The LLM's calculated total increase of $8.8 billion ($3.7B + $5.1B) does not match the ground truth of $11.8 billion, indicating at least one of the company-specific increases is wrong. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are critical: even if one increase were correct, the sum is off by $3 billion, a major error in financial context. The final combined increase is materially understated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM identifies both companies, references correct base years and sales figures, computes individual increases, and attempts to sum them—but the underlying data for MRK (and possibly JNJ) are factually incorrect, breaking the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, metric (worldwide sales), time frame (2023–2024), and performs the correct type of calculation (sum of increases).

According to the ground truth, ABI has $188,003 million in long-term assets and 'Other Investments' has $232 million, totaling $188,235 million. However, the LLM incorrectly assigns $9,676 million to ABI and $188,003 million to 'Other Investments', reversing the major components and inflating the total to ~$197.7 billion (incorrect). Similarly, for liabilities, the ground truth shows $91,791 million for ABI and $3 million for 'Other Investments', totaling $91,794 million. The LLM incorrectly reports $0 for ABI and $91,791 million for 'Other Investments', misallocating nearly all liabilities to the wrong category. (2) Calculations are also flawed: the LLM's stated combined assets (~$197.7 billion) is incorrect (should be $188.235 billion); the correct sum is $188,003 + $232 = $188,235 million. The LLM’s liability total (~$91.8 billion) is numerically close but misattributed across entities, which matters for multi-hop reasoning. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is unsound: the model fails to correctly associate the right financial figures with the correct investment categories (ABI vs. Other Investments), indicating a failure in entity-metric linkage across sources. The conclusion that assets are 'more than double' liabilities is misleading because while assets do exceed liabilities, the correct ratio is ~188.2 / 91.8 ≈ 2.05, based on wrong inputs in the LLM answer.

In contrast, ADBE does not report a specific dollar amount for consulting revenue but explains that it recognizes consulting revenue either on a time-and-materials basis as services are performed or on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts.

The ground truth only says ACN reports a total consulting revenue figure ($37.9 billion in fiscal 2022) and measures performance via new bookings growth (24% USD, 28% local currency), but does not specify its accounting methodology. Thus, the LLM introduces a technical detail (cost-to-cost) not present in the source, leading to a factual inaccuracy. (2) Quantitatively, the $37.9 billion figure is correctly referenced (implied in context), and no incorrect calculations are made—hence high quantitative accuracy.

According to the ground truth, DHR's acquisitions/divestitures had a negative impact of 0.5% on core sales growth in 2021, but the LLM incorrectly states a 16.5 percentage point drag. This is a massive deviation. TMO's contribution from acquisitions/divestitures is correctly stated as +3%, which matches the ground truth. However, due to the incorrect DHR figure, the net difference is calculated as 19.5 percentage points instead of the correct 3.5 percentage points (3% - (-0.5%) = 3.5%). (2) The calculation in the LLM answer (16.5 + 3 = 19.5) is arithmetically correct but based on a fundamentally wrong input for DHR. The correct calculation is 3% - (-0.5%) = 3.5%, which the LLM fails to report. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to compare the two companies' acquisition/divestiture impacts and compute a net difference—but it fails due to incorrect data retrieval for DHR. This suggests a failure in information extraction or knowledge grounding for Danaher's 2021 results. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies (DHR and TMO), the correct year (2021), and the right metric (impact of acquisitions/divestitures on growth), and attempts the correct comparison.

This misrepresents a key metric. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly frames the comparison by stating that this 4-percentage-point outperformance is '0.3 percentage point less than JNJ’s overall sales increase of 4.3%', which distorts the intended comparison: the question asks how much faster MRK's oncology-driven growth outpaced FX impact *relative to* JNJ’s overall growth, not whether the outperformance margin is smaller than JNJ’s growth rate. (2) Calculation verification: JNJ sales = $88.8B, MRK = $64.2B → sum = $153.0B (close to $153.021B, acceptable rounding).

Additionally, the LLM swaps the total lease liabilities: it claims Amazon has $5,323 million total lease liabilities, but that is Lowe’s correct total; Amazon’s actual total lease liability is $52,573 million.

In contrast, XOM's proved undeveloped reserves declined from 4,631 MMBOE at the end of 2022 to 4,389 MMBOE at the end of 2023.

The increase came from 354 MMBOE of upward revisions, 60 MMBOE of purchases and 335 MMBOE of extensions/discoveries, partially offset by a 10 MMBOE sale and a 447 MMBOE transfer to proved‑developed reserves.  \n\nExxonMobil’s proved‑undeveloped reserves grew from 12,263 MMBOE at 31 Dec 2022 to 13,716 MMBOE at 31 Dec 2023 – a net gain of about 1,453 MMBOE (≈12 %).

This suggests that COF had a more substantial number of unexercised or unvested awards that would have been dilutive if included, compared to MA, which had very few or none. The difference reflects a variation in the structure and scale of equity compensation plans between the two financial companies.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 Capital One excluded **26 thousand anti‑dilutive share‑based awards** from its diluted‑EPS computation, whereas Mastercard’s filing notes that only a “minimal” amount of anti‑dilutive awards was excluded – effectively **zero** shares. The contrast reflects Capital One’s larger pool of share‑settled RSUs and performance‑share units that can become anti‑dilutive, while Mastercard’s share‑based compensation program generates far fewer dilutive securities, resulting in little or no anti‑dilutive adjustment.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) excluded 26 thousand anti-dilutive awards in 2021, matching the ground truth exactly. It accurately states that Mastercard (MA) excluded only a 'minimal amount,' which the model interprets as effectively zero—this is semantically consistent with the original answer’s 'very few or none' and acceptable given the qualitative nature of 'minimal.' No calculation errors are present. (2) All numeric values (26 thousand, minimal/zero) are factually correct and properly attributed to the right companies and year (2021). Format variations (e.g., '26 thousand' vs '26,000') are acceptable and do not affect accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from both COF and MA filings, compares their anti-dilutive award disclosures, and infers differences in share-based payment structures. It goes slightly beyond the original by specifying RSUs and performance-share units as components of COF’s compensation plan—this is plausible and contextually reasonable, though not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth. This adds insight without introducing error. (4) The answer fully addresses the question about how the difference reflects variations in share-based payment structures. The reasoning is logical and relevant, with only a minor extrapolation (about RSUs) that does not detract from factual accuracy. Thus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness—excellent but not perfect due to the slight assumption in mechanism. Quantitative accuracy is perfect (10), qualitative reasoning is strong (9), and relevance is complete (10).",

      "original_answer": "A sustained equity market downturn would reduce AIG's fee income as variable annuity account values decline, increasing net amount at risk while decreasing rider fees tied to the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. This would diminish AIG's ability to offset hedging costs from rebalancing and option expenses. For Blackstone, the same market downturn would reduce fee-based revenue directly tied to market activity levels, investment preferences, and savings trends. Both companies would experience financial pressure, though AIG has partial mitigation through volatility-index-linked rider fees, while Blackstone lacks explicit offset mechanisms in its disclosed risk factors.",
      "llm_answer": "A sustained equity‑market decline would hit both firms through the fee streams that are tied to market performance. For AIG, lower equity returns would reduce the account values of its variable‑annuity and mutual‑fund assets, cutting the fee income that is calculated as a percentage of those balances; at the same time, the same market weakness would lower the cost of the equity‑linked hedges and the volatility‑index rider fees that partially offset those hedging expenses (AIG 10‑K p. 59). Blackstone’s 10‑K likewise warns that a slowdown in market activity depresses the fee‑based revenues it earns from asset‑management and advisory services, which are a large share of its earnings (BK 10‑K p. 2‑4). Consequently, a prolonged equity downturn would compress AIG’s net investment and fee income—though hedging cost offsets would soften the hit—while simultaneously eroding Blackstone’s fee‑based revenue and profitability as disclosed in its market‑sensitivity risk factors.",

(1) All factual elements are correct: AIG's fee income declines due to lower variable annuity account values, which impacts rider fees and hedging cost offsets; Blackstone's fee-based revenue is directly affected by market downturns. The LLM correctly identifies AIG's partial mitigation via volatility-index-linked rider fees and notes Blackstone's lack of explicit offset mechanisms, consistent with its disclosures. (2) There are no numeric values in the original or LLM answer requiring verification—both rely on qualitative financial mechanisms—so quantitative accuracy is not compromised.

(4) Semantic equivalence is strong: while the LLM adds minor contextual details (e.g., mutual-fund assets, advisory services), these do not distort meaning and are consistent with the companies’ business models.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains multiple critical factual errors. First, it incorrectly states that SPG's total property value is $38.8 billion (which matches the ground truth of $38,784.918 million), but then claims this is $33.6 billion more than AMT's value. The correct difference is $31,516.618 million ($38,784.918M - $7,268.3M), not $33.6 billion. The LLM's calculation is off by over $2 billion. More seriously, the breakdown of SPG's property value is completely swapped: it assigns $9.6 billion to land and $3.6 billion to buildings and improvements, but the ground truth is $3,643.432 million ($3.64 billion) for land and $35,141.486 million ($35.14 billion) for buildings and improvements. The LLM reversed the components and introduced a fabricated $9.6 billion land value not present in the original data. (2) Number verification: SPG total is correctly cited as ~$38.8 billion (acceptable rounding). However, AMT's value is not stated numerically in the LLM answer, and the difference is miscalculated. The land/buildings values are swapped and incorrect—$9.6 billion for land is wrong; $3.6 billion for buildings is a severe understatement. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model correctly identifies SPG and AMT as the entities and uses 2023 data, but fails to correctly extract and synthesize the component values from SPG's filing. It appears to confuse gross asset values or misattribute line items (e.g., possibly misreading 'gross land' as 'gross buildings'). The comparison between SPG and AMT lacks accurate arithmetic. (4) Correctness score is low due to major factual and calculation errors, especially the component reversal. Quantitative accuracy is poor due to wrong numbers and miscalculations. Qualitative accuracy suffers from flawed reasoning and entity/metric confusion.

      "original_answer": "Costco's policy on repurchased shares involves retiring them in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. This affects its diluted net income per share calculation because the treasury stock method is used to account for potentially dilutive common shares, such as those subject to RSUs, by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding. In contrast, Philip Morris provides a quantitative disclosure of the issued, repurchased, and outstanding shares without specifying a retirement policy or its implications on earnings per share calculations. Therefore, Costco's detailed policy on share retirement and its impact on diluted EPS contrasts with Philip Morris's more general disclosure about repurchased shares.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco states that any shares it buys back are **retired** (the par value is removed from common stock and the excess price is allocated to additional‑paid‑in‑capital and retained earnings). Because the shares are cancelled, they are excluded from the weighted‑average share count used in both the basic and the diluted net‑income‑per‑share calculations, which lowers the denominator of diluted EPS 【page_50】.  \n\nPhilip Morris, by contrast, only discloses the number of shares repurchased and outstanding and does **not** say the shares are retired; the repurchased shares are therefore treated as treasury stock and are accounted for under the treasury‑stock method when computing diluted EPS, rather than being removed from the share count 【page_106】.",

It accurately states that retired shares are excluded from the weighted-average share count for both basic and diluted EPS, thus lowering the denominator in EPS calculations. This directly addresses how Costco’s policy affects diluted net income per share. (2) For Philip Morris, the LLM correctly notes that the company only discloses repurchase activity without stating retirement, implying the shares are held as treasury stock and accounted for under the treasury stock method. This contrasts with Costco’s approach, as treasury shares remain issued but not outstanding, affecting dilutive potential differently. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two companies, linking share retirement policy to its impact on EPS calculation methodology. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to slightly stronger implication that Philip Morris explicitly uses the treasury stock method—while logically sound, the original answer notes PM merely doesn’t disclose retirement, rather than affirming a method.

This reflects a platform-centric model where Google leverages external content to drive engagement and monetization through advertising and distribution. In contrast, Netflix's cost of revenues is dominated by amortization of content assets, which includes expenses related to content acquisition, licensing, and production, such as payroll, stock-based compensation, and production costs. This highlights Netflix's vertically integrated model, where it invests heavily in acquiring and producing exclusive content to monetize directly through subscriptions.

Thermo Fisher's $312 million in costs is also accurately reported, with correct linkage to the PPD acquisition. The only minor issue is that the LLM describes the $312 million as a 'package' that includes transaction-related, restructuring, and debt-extinguishment expenses, which is accurate per the source (pro-forma section), but slightly less precise than the ground truth's explicit statement that the $312 million was 'directly tied to the acquisition of PPD' and specifically represented debt extinguishment costs. However, the LLM does correctly attribute the costs to the PPD acquisition and mentions debt extinguishment as a component, preserving the core factual integrity. (2) All numeric values—$63 million, $2.85 billion, $15.99 billion, and $312 million—are correct and match the ground truth or are consistent with it (e.g., $2.85 billion vs. $2.850 billion is a formatting difference). No calculation errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (Abbott and Thermo Fisher), links each to the correct 2021 event, and compares the costs appropriately. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both the quantitative comparison and the underlying corporate transactions. The slight nuance in characterizing the $312 million as part of a broader expense category prevents a perfect 10, but the answer remains highly accurate and informative.",

However, it incorrectly states that XOM did not record any impairment charges related to unproved properties in 2023. The ground truth confirms XOM recognized $3.4 billion in after-tax impairment charges primarily related to the idled Upstream Santa Ynez Unit assets and an additional $0.6 billion on an equity investment — both part of unproved property impairments. The LLM fails to acknowledge these charges as relevant to unproved properties, leading to a significant factual error. (2) Quantitatively, the COP numbers are accurate within rounding tolerance, and the $2.1 billion decrease is reasonable. But the LLM omits XOM’s $4 billion total in related impairment charges (3.4 + 0.6), misrepresenting XOM’s financial activity. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — it compares COP’s declining asset values to XOM’s reporting — but fails the synthesis because it incorrectly concludes XOM had no unproved property impairments. This undermines the comparative analysis of asset management strategies. The ground truth shows both companies took significant actions, but the LLM portrays XOM as inactive, missing the nuance that XOM did take write-downs, just under different categorization. (4) Correctness is scored 6 due to major omission of XOM’s impairment charges, despite correct COP data and reasonable interpretation of strategy. Quantitative accuracy is 8 because COP figures are correct and rounded appropriately. Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to flawed reasoning about XOM’s strategy based on incomplete data.

The LLM incorrectly states that the difference is $5,304 million, which is actually the total amount HD paid, not the difference. Furthermore, the LLM claims this difference represents a 100% increase relative to MCD’s provision of $5,304 million — this is incorrect on two counts: MCD’s provision was $1,583 million, not $5,304 million, and a $3,721 million difference relative to $1,583 million is a 235% increase, not 100%. (2) The numbers are significantly off: the difference, MCD’s base provision, and the percentage increase are all wrong. The only potentially correct number is HD’s total tax provision of $5,304 million, which aligns with the implied value in the ground truth, but it is misused as the difference rather than the total.

The original answer does not specify a dollar amount for ABT's indefinitely reinvested earnings—only that the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable to determine. Thus, the $24 billion figure for ABT is fabricated and unsupported by the ground truth, making the combined total claim of $48 billion incorrect. The correct combined total is 'at least $24 billion' (TMO's $24B plus an unspecified amount from ABT). (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: TMO's $24 billion is accurate, but ABT's $24 billion is not present in the original answer and is therefore wrong. The sum of $48 billion is thus invalid. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly assumes symmetry between the two companies' disclosures and invents a matching $24 billion for ABT without evidence. It also reverses the accounting treatments: the original answer states that TMO intends to repatriate only when no net tax cost occurs, while ABT is the one that finds the deferred tax liability not practicable to determine. The LLM incorrectly attributes the 'not practicable' reasoning to TMO and the 'no net tax cost' strategy to ABT, when in fact these are reversed between the two companies. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question (total amount and accounting treatment)—but the factual and logical errors severely undermine correctness.

The ground truth only mentions that FX effects were part of the $14.6 billion other income (expense), net, without specifying a $3.6 billion adverse impact. This number appears to be fabricated or misattributed, severely undermining quantitative accuracy. (2) The $14.6 billion figure is correctly cited, and the characterization of this line as including currency-related gains is consistent with the original answer. However, the introduction of the $3.6 billion adverse effect — absent from the ground truth — introduces a major inaccuracy. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts AMZN’s quantified FX impact (as part of a net income item) with NKE’s qualitative risk warning, and captures the bidirectional risk (positive/negative swings) and partial hedging. It synthesizes the multi-hop comparison between how two companies report FX exposure, which addresses the core of the question.

      "original_answer": "Comcast's Studios segment programming and production costs decreased in 2023 due to lower costs associated with content licensing sales, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages, while Disney's total programming and production costs slightly increased by 1% to $13.959 billion in 2023. This reflects that both companies were affected by industry-wide challenges, with Comcast experiencing cost reductions due to halted production activity while Disney absorbed slightly higher costs despite similar pressures, indicating varied strategic responses to the same external disruptions.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast’s Studios segment cut its programming‑and‑production outlay by 9.3 % in 2023 (to $7.96 billion from $8.78 billion), mainly because “lower costs associated with content‑licensing sales, including the impact of the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages” reduced the amount of new material it could amortize 【page_48】.  \n\nDisney’s total programming‑and‑production expense also fell in 2023 (down 9 % to $4.17 billion from $4.57 billion), driven by “fewer hours of scripted programming…reflecting the impact of production delays as a result of guild strikes” and the timing of content availability 【page_40】.  \n\nTogether, the two companies show that industry‑wide disruptions such as writers/actors strikes and the resulting lag in content supply directly trimmed entertainment‑related cost bases in 2023.",

According to the ground truth, Disney's total programming and production costs increased by 1% to $13.959 billion in 2023, but the LLM incorrectly states they decreased by 9% to $4.17 billion—both the direction and magnitude are wrong, as is the dollar amount. Similarly, while the LLM correctly notes Comcast's cost decrease due to work stoppages, it provides specific figures ($7.96B from $8.78B, a 9.3% drop) that are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified against the ground truth, which only states a decrease without quantification. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: Disney’s actual cost was ~$13.959B, not $4.17B (a massive underreporting), and the 9% decrease contradicts the 1% increase in the original. The Comcast figures, while plausible, are unsupported by the ground truth and appear fabricated. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the LLM correctly identifies industry-wide challenges (Writers Guild and SAG strikes) affecting both companies and links them to production costs—but draws an incorrect collective conclusion. The original emphasizes divergent responses (Comcast reduced costs, Disney slightly increased them), while the LLM claims both cut costs, misrepresenting Disney’s strategic response.

(2) Numeric values are correct with acceptable formatting variations: $8.6 billion = $8,617 million and $5.8 billion is appropriately rounded. The final total is reported as 'roughly $14.4 billion', which is semantically equivalent to $14.417 billion.

      "question": "How do fluctuations in foreign exchange (FX) rates impact both Amazon's tax liabilities and Nike's international sales, and by what mechanism do these effects manifest in their respective financial results?",
      "original_answer": "Foreign exchange rate fluctuations affect Amazon's effective tax rate due to changes in the relative value of foreign earnings in jurisdictions with varying statutory tax rates, and they impact Nike's international sales when foreign currencies weaken against the U.S. Dollar, reducing the dollar value of Nike's foreign currency-denominated sales. Amazon specifically notes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are among the factors that could significantly affect its effective tax rates. Nike states that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. Both companies are exposed to FX risk, but the financial impact manifests differently: for Amazon, it affects tax liabilities, while for Nike, it directly affects reported revenues and earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Amazon:**  The 10‑K notes that changes in foreign‑exchange rates are a “critical accounting judgment” that “significantly affect our reported results” and that “our effective tax rates could be affected…by …changes in foreign currency exchange rates” (Amazon 10‑K p. 19‑20).  When the dollar moves relative to the currencies in which Amazon earns foreign profits, the translation of those earnings (and inter‑company balances) into U.S. dollars alters the amount of taxable income reported in each jurisdiction, which in turn changes the company’s overall tax provision and effective tax rate.  \n\n- **Nike:**  Nike’s filing states that “foreign currency fluctuations…could…adversely affect the U.S. Dollar value of the Company’s foreign‑currency‑denominated sales and earnings” and that “weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of …foreign‑currency‑denominated sales” (Nike 10‑K p. 15).  Because most of Nike’s revenue is earned outside the United States, the translation of those foreign‑currency sales into dollars directly raises or lowers the reported international sales figure and related margins.  \n\nThus, FX movements affect Amazon mainly through the translation of foreign earnings that changes its taxable income and tax rate, while for Nike they affect the dollar‑denominated amount of international sales through currency translation of foreign‑currency revenue.",

This indicates that tax-exempt income lowered MET's overall tax liability. In contrast, COF adjusts its Commercial Banking revenue and yields to a tax-equivalent basis using the federal statutory tax rate of 21% and applicable state taxes to account for investments that generate tax-exempt income, which is a proactive reporting methodology rather than a retrospective adjustment.

This is a critical error in both direction and magnitude. The LLM also incorrectly claims the tax provision was $560 million after adjustments, which is not supported by the original answer. (2) The LLM falsely attributes a tax-equivalent reporting approach to MetLife in Commercial Banking, stating it reports revenue on a 'taxable-equivalent basis' using the 21% federal rate—this is factually incorrect.

MET does not apply tax-equivalent adjustments to revenue; instead, it reflects tax-exempt income as a reduction in the tax provision.

Oracle, on the other hand, incurred severance expenses specifically in fiscal 2022 related to its restructuring plan, without a disclosed prior-year comparison, suggesting a more recent or intensified focus on workforce restructuring.

These numbers are incorrect and contradict the original statement that no prior-year comparison was disclosed. Intel's $48 million in 2021 is correctly reported, matching the ground truth, and the drop from $124 million in 2020 is accurate. However, the LLM incorrectly implies Oracle had comparable detailed year-over-year data, which undermines the core contrast in the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the Oracle figures ($431M and $191M) are entirely fabricated or misattributed—no such numbers appear in the ground truth. The Intel numbers are correct.

This number is accurately broken down from a total $68 million severance charge, with $48M allocated to SG&A — a detail not in the original answer but factually consistent and supported by citation. However, the LLM incorrectly states that Thermo Fisher does *not* include changes in fair value of contingent consideration in SG&A, directly contradicting the ground truth, which explicitly says Thermo Fisher *does* record such changes in SG&A. This is a critical factual error in the comparative analysis. (2) All numeric values (e.g., $48M, $68M split) are accurate and correctly cited. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: while the Abbott portion is well-supported and correctly interpreted, the Thermo Fisher portion misrepresents the company's accounting treatment. The LLM claims contingent consideration adjustments are excluded from SG&A and cites pages 89–93 as evidence, but the ground truth — derived from actual filings — confirms they *are* included in SG&A. This undermines the core comparison. (4) The correctness score is 6 due to one major factual error in the Thermo Fisher treatment despite strong quantitative accuracy and relevance. The answer is partially correct but contains a significant qualitative inaccuracy in the comparative reasoning, which is central to the question.",

      "original_answer": "BA excluded certain common shares from diluted loss per share calculations because their inclusion would have been antidilutive based on strike price or unmet performance conditions, indicating that performance conditions played a role in the exclusion. In contrast, EMR stated that an inconsequential number of shares were excluded from diluted earnings per share in 2023 because the effect would have been antidilutive, but it did not specifically tie these exclusions to performance conditions. This reveals that while both companies excluded antidilutive shares, BA explicitly linked the exclusion to performance conditions, whereas EMR treated the exclusions as minor and not performance-dependent.",
      "llm_answer": "In Boeing’s 2023 filing, the diluted‑EPS reconciliation lists specific potential shares (performance‑award RSUs, stock options, etc.) that were left out because the related performance conditions were not satisfied or because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. Emerson’s 2023 filing simply states that an “inconsequential” number of shares were excluded because they would have been antidilutive, without detailing performance‑condition exclusions. This contrast shows that Boeing’s EPS is materially affected by unmet performance targets—those shares are excluded to avoid diluting earnings—whereas Emerson’s EPS is barely impacted, reflecting only a trivial antidilutive effect.",

      "original_answer": "EMR's unbilled receivables increased significantly from $528 million in 2021 to $1,399 million in 2022, indicating a large buildup of revenue recognized but not yet billed. GD disclosed that it expected to collect substantially all of its year-end 2021 receivables during 2022, which suggests that its revenue realization cycle for long-term contracts is more advanced, with receivables being collected shortly after recognition.

The ground truth states $2,820 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports $21,745 million, which is more than 7.5 times higher and inconsistent with known data. McDonald's pre-tax charges of $290 million are correctly stated. However, due to the incorrect Tesla figure, the combined total of $22,035 million is wrong; the correct total is $3,110 million.

      "original_answer": "SPG capitalizes improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life, increase capacity, or improve the efficiency of the asset, indicating a focus on long-term asset enhancement. AMT, on the other hand, uses cash flows to fund maintenance and improvements, communications site and data center construction, and managed network installations, suggesting a more operational and growth-oriented approach. The interaction implies that SPG emphasizes capital efficiency and asset longevity through selective capitalization, while AMT prioritizes ongoing investment in infrastructure to sustain and grow its operations.",
      "llm_answer": "Simon Property Group records tenant allowances and tenant‑improvement costs as capitalized assets that are amortized over the lease term (or the remaining useful life when the work extends life, adds capacity or improves efficiency).  American Tower, by contrast, does not rely on a specific lease‑based capitalization rule; it simply uses the cash generated from operations to fund “maintenance and improvements” and other capital‑expenditure programs.  Together this shows that SPG’s strategy is to match the cost of tenant‑driven upgrades to lease income and preserve asset value through accounting‑level amortization, while AMT’s strategy is to sustain asset value by reinvesting operating cash flow directly into upkeep and upgrades.",

AMT uses operating cash flows to fund maintenance, improvements, and construction, which is correctly interpreted as a reinvestment strategy. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a traditional sense, but all descriptive financial concepts (capitalization, cash flow usage) are correctly represented—hence a score of 10. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: the model correctly contrasts SPG’s accounting-driven, capital-efficiency approach with AMT’s operational reinvestment model. The only minor gap is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention 'communications sites and data centers' or 'managed network installations'—specific uses of AMT’s cash flows noted in the original—making it slightly less complete, hence a 9 on qualitative accuracy.

Texas Instruments reported accrued expenses and other liabilities of $911 million and operating lease liabilities of $3,320 million, resulting in a ratio of 27.4%.

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains partially correct information but fails on a key quantitative and reasoning point. For Salesforce, the numbers are accurate: $372 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and $3.162 billion in operating lease liabilities (reported as $518M + $2,644M = $3.162B), resulting in a ratio of ~11.8%, which rounds to the stated 12% — this is acceptable under semantic equivalence. However, for Texas Instruments, the LLM incorrectly claims that operating lease liabilities are not disclosed as a separate line item, stating they are 'rolled into other long-term liabilities.' This contradicts the ground truth, which explicitly provides TXN's operating lease liabilities as $3,320 million, indicating this figure was available in the filing. Therefore, the claim that a direct comparison cannot be made is factually incorrect. (2) The absolute values for TXN’s accrued expenses ($911M) are correct, and the operating lease obligation should have been recognized as $3,320M, yielding a correct ratio of ~27.4%, but the LLM fails to compute or report it due to a misreading of data availability. This is a critical error in quantitative synthesis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model did not retrieve or acknowledge the operating lease liability for Texas Instruments despite it being available (per ground truth), breaking the comparative analysis required by the question. The conclusion that a direct comparison cannot be made undermines the entire response, even though the data exists. (4) While the response is well-structured and contextually relevant, with correct fiscal years (2024 for CRM, 2023 for TXN) and proper metric identification, the failure to access and use a key disclosed number (TXN's operating lease liability) results in a major factual gap.

This reflects a strategy of investing more heavily in content to support growth. In contrast, T's 'Other Cost of Revenues' decreased by approximately $395 million due to an accounting policy change that extended the amortization period for customer acquisition and fulfillment costs. This change indicates a cost management strategy focused on spreading expenses over a longer period, reducing short-term cost impact.

Similarly, McDonald's US revenue increased from $5,136M to $5,694M (11%), which the LLM approximates reasonably well ($5.1B to $5.7B, 10.9%), though it incorrectly refers to this as 'operating income' rather than revenue. (2) The combined percentage increase is incorrectly calculated: the LLM states a '22.5% total percentage increase', which misrepresents how combined percentage growth should be interpreted. The ground truth reports individual increases (11% and 23%) and implies a simple sum of percentage points (34%) or an aggregate effect, but not a 'combined percentage increase' of 21%—however, the LLM’s method of adding percentage changes weighted by size is not standard and results in an incorrect figure. More critically, the numbers behind the calculation are wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present—the model attempts to compare growth rates and revenue sizes in 2023 and draws a conclusion about absolute vs. relative impact—but it fails due to incorrect base data. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate: the structure addresses the question's intent, discussing both companies' growth and comparing their scale, but the use of incorrect financial figures and metrics undermines the validity. Referring to McDonald's 'operating income' instead of 'revenue' shows a misunderstanding of financial statements.

      "original_answer": "The total projected benefit obligation for Non-U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022 is $1,125 million for DHR and $45 million for TMO, totaling $1,170 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key numbers. It incorrectly states TMO's 2022 projected benefit obligation (PBO) for Non-U.S. Pension Benefits as $2,010 million ($2.0 billion), whereas the ground truth is $45 million. DHR's PBO is correctly stated as $1,125 million. The combined total is therefore wrong: $3.1 billion instead of the correct $1,170 million. Additionally, the expected Non-U.S. pension payments for TMO over 2022–2026 are stated as $247 million in the LLM answer, but the correct figure is $287 million. (2) Calculations: The sum of $1,125M + $2,010M = $3,135M (~$3.1B) is arithmetically correct but based on incorrect inputs. The correct sum is $1,125M + $45M = $1,170M. The comparison to TMO's expected payments is flawed due to incorrect obligation and payment figures. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize data across DHR and TMO and compare total obligation to future payments, which aligns with the question’s intent. However, because both input values are incorrect, the reasoning collapses. The model failed to retrieve the correct PBO for TMO, possibly confusing it with another liability or misreading the data source. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and numerical errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) — only DHR’s number is correct. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the structure and intent of the response are sound. Contextual relevance is acceptable (7/10) — the answer addresses the right question type and entities, just with wrong data.",

It incorrectly states that Netflix's total contractual obligations are $42.5 billion and AT&T's are $337.5 billion, reversing the actual magnitudes. According to the ground truth, NFLX has $42,541,407 (~$42.5 million) and T has $337,473 (~$0.34 million), making NFLX's obligations significantly larger, not AT&T's. The calculated difference in the LLM answer ($295 billion) is completely incorrect; the correct difference is $42,203,934. Additionally, the LLM claims AT&T has $337.5 billion in obligations, which is over 1,000 times larger than the actual figure. (2) The content obligations for NFLX are stated as $21.7 billion in the LLM answer, but the correct value is $21,713,349 (~$21.7 million). Similarly, T's long-term debt is reported as $146 billion instead of $146,064. These are off by a factor of 1,000,000. Calculations like '72% of total obligations' for AT&T are based on false numbers and thus invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The LLM incorrectly identifies AT&T as having larger obligations and attributes the difference to AT&T’s debt, when in fact NFLX’s obligations are vastly larger due to its content commitments. The model fails to correctly synthesize the data across entities and misattributes the driver of the difference. (4) The qualitative reasoning is poor due to incorrect entity scaling and reversed comparison logic. Contextual relevance is low because the answer misrepresents the core financial reality. While the structure attempts to address the question, the extreme numerical inaccuracies render the response misleading and factually wrong.

      "question": "How does the difference in depreciation methods for property and equipment between HD and MCD affect their long-term asset management strategies?",
      "original_answer": "HD uses the straight-line method for depreciating buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment over their estimated useful lives, while MCD also uses the straight-line method but specifies different useful life ranges—buildings up to 40 years, leasehold improvements based on the lesser of asset life or lease terms, and equipment between 3 to 12 years. This difference in depreciation policy specificity allows MCD to adjust asset valuations more dynamically based on economic and technological changes, potentially influencing when asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation occur. HD's approach, by contrast, appears more static, which may limit flexibility in responding to rapid changes in asset utility. These differing methods reflect contrasting long-term asset management strategies: HD emphasizes consistency, while MCD emphasizes adaptability.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that both HD and MCD use the straight-line method and provides useful life ranges for both companies. However, it introduces a specific range for HD (e.g., equipment 2–20 years, buildings 5–45 years) that is not present in the original answer or ground truth. The ground truth does not specify numerical ranges for HD’s useful lives—only that HD uses straight-line depreciation over estimated useful lives—while MCD’s ranges (buildings up to 40 years, equipment 3–12 years) are accurately reflected. This addition of unverified numeric ranges for HD reduces quantitative accuracy. (2) The LLM’s claim about HD’s equipment being depreciated over 2–20 years and buildings over 5–45 years lacks support in the ground truth and may be inferred from external knowledge, making it factually questionable in this evaluation context. MCD’s ranges are correctly stated. (3) The reasoning and synthesis are strong: the LLM correctly infers strategic implications—HD’s longer depreciation horizon supports asset retention and cash flow smoothing, while MCD’s shorter, category-specific lives suggest more frequent renewal and tighter cost control. This aligns semantically with the ground truth’s conclusion about HD emphasizing consistency and MCD adaptability. (4) Despite the unsupported numeric ranges for HD, the core comparison and strategic interpretation are logically sound and contextually relevant.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: MCD’s finance lease payments are off by over $28 billion, leading to a grossly incorrect difference. Only Tesla’s number is accurate.

Second, the LLM claims XOM uses 'gross sales volumes' (total barrels sold without subtracting consumed/flared gas), which is incorrect: XOM uses net production available for sale (excluding consumed/flared), while the ground truth confirms COP includes all net production (without such exclusions). Thus, the roles are reversed in the LLM answer, leading to a fundamentally flawed comparison. The reasoning about comparability issues due to differing denominators is conceptually sound and contextually relevant, and the direction of the impact (one company spreading costs over smaller volume) shows some qualitative understanding. However, because the core entity-specific methodologies are swapped, the multi-hop synthesis fails.

According to the ground truth, the combined 2023 value is $2,507 million, but the LLM calculates $2,384 million. This discrepancy arises because the LLM reports Costco's 2023 CIP as $1,266 million and Mondelez's as $1,118 million, which sum to $2,384 million—however, the correct total per ground truth implies different underlying values (likely $1,389M and $1,118M or similar). Additionally, the LLM states Costco’s 2022 CIP was $1,266 million—the same as 2023—which contradicts the expected change, and calculates a combined 2022 total of $2,145 million, whereas the ground truth reports $2,138 million.

The correct combined total is $12,796 million ($1.874B + $10.922B), not $21.9B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model misattributes data between companies—this is a critical error in entity alignment across sources. It also cites incorrect page numbers (e.g., page 68, 70) that do not reflect the actual data distribution. (4) Despite the severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right question about treasury stock purchases over 2019–2020 for both companies and attempts proper synthesis.

The combined total is accurately calculated as $2,504 million ($2.504 billion). However, the ground truth does not explicitly state Tesla's D&A as a direct expense line item nor confirm it as a standard D&A expense — instead, it references a deferred tax liability 'related to' D&A, which may not equate directly to the actual expense. By treating this $2,122 million as a direct D&A expense and calculating its percentage of revenue (2.6%), the LLM makes an assumption not fully supported by the original answer, introducing a factual overreach. (2) Revenue figures: McDonald's $25,494 million is correct. Tesla's revenue of $81,460 million is not provided in the ground truth, so the 2.6% calculation, while mathematically correct ($2,122 / $81,460 ≈ 2.6%), is based on external or unverified data not present in the original answer.

While it correctly states Boeing's decrease in unbilled receivables ($8,634M to $8,317M, a $317M reduction), it fails to report Emerson's actual change in unbilled receivables. Instead of noting the increase from $1,453M to $1,599M (a $146M increase), it incorrectly introduces Emerson's total net contract assets of $556M — a figure not requested and not equivalent to the change in unbilled receivables. This leads to a completely incorrect comparison: the LLM computes a difference of $239M ($556M - $317M), which misrepresents both the question and the data. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: Emerson’s change was +$146M, not $556M. The correct difference in impact is $317M (Boeing reduction) + $146M (Emerson increase) = $463M, not $239M. The $556M figure appears to be a misinterpretation of Emerson’s net contract asset balance rather than the year-over-year change.

In contrast, XOM provides a concrete figure of $0.9 billion invested in its Low Carbon Solutions business in 2024, specifically targeting carbon capture and storage, lithium, and carbon-free hydrogen projects. This contrast indicates that while both companies are investing in low-carbon technologies, XOM is making a more quantifiably directed financial commitment to these initiatives, whereas COP's investment appears to be ongoing but less specifically itemized, suggesting a potentially broader or less mature allocation of resources toward low-carbon solutions.",

However, the ground truth states that COP does *not* disclose a specific dollar amount for low-carbon investments. This $137 million figure is not supported by the original answer and contradicts the ground truth, which explicitly notes the absence of a disclosed amount. The XOM figure of $0.9 billion is correct and matches the ground truth. (2) The quantitative accuracy is low because the core number for COP is fabricated or misattributed.

The comparison of 'order-of-magnitude larger' is based on this incorrect premise. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing strategic priorities via investment levels—but fails on multi-hop synthesis because it uses an unsupported figure for COP.

Similarly, for TXN, the LLM reports $836 million in 2023 and $799 million in 2022 (a $37M increase), but the ground truth shows TXN's accrued compensation increased from $22 million in 2022 to $29 million in 2023—an increase of only $7 million. These numbers are not just inaccurate but misrepresent the scale of liabilities by hundreds of millions of dollars. (2) Calculations are also incorrect: the LLM claims CRM’s accrued comp rose by $7M, but in reality it decreased by $100M; TXN’s increase is overstated at $37M instead of $7M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model conflates the companies’ data: it attributes TXN-level magnitudes to CRM and vice versa. The fiscal years are also misaligned—CRM’s change is between 2023 and 2024 (not 2022–2023), while TXN’s is correctly referenced as 2022 to 2023, though with wrong values. (4) Despite these severe inaccuracies, the answer attempts to address both parts of the question—change in accrued compensation and interpretation of liability management approaches—so it retains partial contextual relevance. However, the reasoning and conclusions are based on false premises, making the qualitative analysis invalid. The interpretation of CRM showing a 'restrained' approach while TXN shows 'expansive' accruals contradicts the ground truth where CRM actually reduced liabilities and TXN modestly increased them.

However, several of its U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries are subject to capital adequacy or other liquidity, regulatory, or contractual restrictions that limit their ability to provide such payments. These restrictions include local regulatory stress test requirements and inter-affiliate arrangements tied to Citigroup Inc.'s resolution plan. Similarly, Wells Fargo’s subsidiary banks are restricted under federal law from transferring funds or assets to the Parent or its nonbank subsidiaries in excess of 10% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus for any single affiliate and 20% in the aggregate for all affiliates. These limitations, combined with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length transaction terms, constrain the ability of both Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo to reallocate capital internally, thereby reducing flexibility in managing liquidity and capital during periods of financial stress or regulatory scrutiny.",

      "question": "How does the change in Caterpillar's customer advances from 2022 to 2023 compare to the significance of customer advances in General Dynamics' revenue recognition timing, particularly in their defense and aerospace segments?",
      "original_answer": "Caterpillar's customer advances increased from $1,860 million in 2022 to $1,929 million in 2023, reflecting a $69 million growth. This increase indicates a shift in the timing and volume of advance payments received from customers. In contrast, General Dynamics explicitly describes the role of customer advances in shaping revenue recognition timing, particularly in their defense and aerospace segments. In defense, customer advances are less common, and billing typically follows revenue recognition, creating contract assets. However, international contracts sometimes result in customer advances before revenue is recognized, creating contract liabilities. In aerospace, General Dynamics often receives deposits upon contract execution and milestone achievements, which are later liquidated as revenue. Therefore, while Caterpillar's customer advances grew modestly, General Dynamics highlights a more structured and segment-specific impact of these advances on financial reporting timing.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar’s “customer advances” grew from $1.86 billion in 2022 to $1.93 billion in 2023 – an increase of roughly $69 million (about a 4 % rise). In contrast, General Dynamics treats customer advances and deposits as contract‑liability balances; these amounts are recorded before revenue is earned and are only liquidated when work‑progress or milestone criteria are satisfied, making advances a pivotal factor that can shift the timing of revenue recognition in its defense and aerospace segments.",

The 4% rise is a reasonable approximation (69 / 1860 ≈ 3.71%, rounded to 4%), which is acceptable given the context. 2) The qualitative explanation of General Dynamics' use of customer advances is accurate: advances are treated as contract liabilities and liquidated upon meeting progress or milestones, particularly in defense and aerospace. The LLM captures the core idea that these advances affect revenue recognition timing. However, it omits some segment-specific nuances present in the ground truth—namely, that in defense, billing usually follows revenue recognition (creating contract assets), while international contracts may create contract liabilities; and in aerospace, deposits are tied to contract execution and milestones. These details are not fully elaborated, resulting in a minor completeness gap. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly compares Caterpillar’s quantitative change with General Dynamics’ qualitative role of advances in revenue timing. Entities (Caterpillar, General Dynamics, customer advances, 2022–2023), metrics, and years are all accurate. 4) Despite the omission of some segment-level detail from General Dynamics, the LLM conveys the essential comparison and maintains factual correctness on all reported numbers and core concepts, warranting a high score.

However, the LLM reports a combined total of $42,145 million, which is incorrect.

Alphabet disclosed changes in monetization metrics for Google Network revenues, which are impression- and cost-per-impression-based, but did not provide specific growth percentages or drivers for impression volume growth. This makes a direct performance comparison between Disney's impression growth and Alphabet's impression monetization metrics impossible, though both companies highlight impressions as a key advertising revenue driver.",

(1) QUANTITATIVE ACCURACY: The claim that Alphabet's Google Network impressions fell 5% year-over-year is not supported by the ground truth. The Original Answer states that Alphabet disclosed changes in monetization metrics but did not provide specific growth percentages or drivers for impression volume growth. Therefore, the -5% figure is fabricated and incorrect. (2) COMPLETENESS: While the LLM correctly identifies Disney's 26% ad revenue growth and its drivers (ad-supported Disney+ launch and cricket programming), it incorrectly asserts a specific negative trend at Alphabet, which was not disclosed. This leads to a false comparison. (3) ENTITY ACCURACY: Companies (Disney, Alphabet), services (Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, Google Network), and timeframes (2023) are correctly identified. (4) REASONING: The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM invents data for Alphabet to make a direct comparison, whereas the ground truth explicitly states such a comparison is impossible due to lack of disclosed metrics. The conclusion that 'Disney’s impression-driven ad revenue grew strongly, while Alphabet’s impression volume actually declined' is therefore unsupported. (5) SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE: The LLM answer contradicts the ground truth by asserting specific performance data for Alphabet that was not disclosed. Despite correct details on Disney, the core comparative claim is false. The answer would have been acceptable if it had noted the lack of comparable data, as in the original.

While it correctly identifies CVS's nonvested shares as 16,994 thousand, it incorrectly calculates Medtronic's (MDT) total. The LLM states MDT had 2,422 thousand non-vested performance-share units and 6,142 thousand restricted-stock units, totaling 8,564 thousand. However, the ground truth indicates the correct combined nonvested shares for MDT is 6,142 thousand (not the sum of 2,422 + 6,142). This suggests the LLM misinterpreted MDT's filing, double-counting or misreading the components. The correct total should be 16,994 (CVS) + 6,142 (MDT) = 23,136 thousand, but the LLM reports 25,558 thousand, which is 2,422 thousand too high—exactly the amount of MDT's performance shares that were likely already included in the 6,142 thousand. (2) The calculation error is critical: the LLM adds two components that should not be summed, indicating a failure in accurate data extraction from the MDT filing. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure—correctly identifying the need to sum nonvested shares across both companies and noting different fiscal year-ends—but flawed in execution due to incorrect data interpretation. (4) Contextually, the answer is well-framed and relevant, citing correct companies, timeframes, and metric types, but the core numerical conclusion is incorrect due to the miscalculation.

The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM specifies the incentive period ends at the 'end of the calendar-year'—which is present in the original—but adds 'i.e., at the end of the calendar-year incentive period' at the end, slightly overemphasizing timing of recognition rather than just accrual over the period.

For PG, the answer correctly identifies that property taxes from operating leases are treated as part of other operating costs and recognized in the period incurred, consistent with the original answer.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $963 million for COST in 2024 is correctly cited. The additional years (2023, 2022) are accurate per known filings and do not detract. No calculations were required, but the numbers match or exceed the detail in the ground truth.\n\n3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (COST and PG), two types of expenses (retirement vs. property tax), and two accounting treatments (SG&A inclusion vs. lease-related operating costs). It draws a valid contrast in how 'other operating costs' are composed differently across firms.\n\n4) The only reason for not scoring a 10 is minor: the original answer emphasizes COST's focus on 'employee-related long-term benefits' and PG's 'property-related obligations tied to leased assets' as illustrative of broader categories within other operating costs. The LLM captures this distinction but could have slightly better emphasized the conceptual contrast in the nature of the costs (personnel vs. asset-based).

According to the ground truth, Capital One (COF) spent $7,605 million (not $5.9 billion) on treasury stock purchases in 2021, while Mastercard (MA) spent $5,904 million (approximately $5.9 billion, which is correct). The LLM incorrectly reports Capital One's buyback as $5.9 billion instead of $7.605 billion, leading to a major error in the combined total: $11.8 billion vs. the correct $13,509 million ($13.509 billion). (2) The net cash used in financing activities is also incorrect for both companies. Ground truth shows COF had $7,030 million and MA had $6,555 million, but the LLM states both had ~$6.6 billion, which is inaccurate for COF and slightly off for MA. Consequently, the percentage comparisons are wrong: the LLM claims buybacks were slightly lower than financing outflows for both, but in reality, COF's buyback spending ($7,605M) exceeded its net cash used in financing ($7,030M), representing 108%, while MA’s was 90% ($5,904 / $6,555). The LLM incorrectly concludes both were below, failing the comparative analysis.

It explains that debt securities are classified as current or long-term based on contractual maturities or the intent to sell within twelve months, and it outlines a structured process for evaluating credit-related impairments and non-credit-related losses. This indicates a more structured and market-sensitive approach to managing investment risk and liquidity. In contrast, MDT references 'current investments' only in the context of its overall liquidity and flexibility, stating that its cash, cash equivalents, current investments, and credit facilities will satisfy its current and future obligations. MDT does not specify the composition or management methodology of its current investments, suggesting a more generalized reliance on liquidity without the same level of detail or risk segmentation as CVS. This difference reflects that CVS adopts a more granular and proactive strategy for managing investment-related liquidity risks, while MDT emphasizes broad financial strength and flexibility without elaborating on specific investment management practices.",

(1) The key factual elements are correct: CVS’s classification of debt securities as current based on contractual maturities within twelve months or intent to sell, its use of fair value accounting, and description of assets as highly liquid are all consistent with the ground truth. MDT’s more generalized reference to current investments as part of a broader liquidity pool—including cash, credit facilities, and commercial paper—is also accurately represented. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a traditional sense, but all descriptive metrics (e.g., 'three-month-or-less instruments') are correctly stated and align with typical SEC filing language. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that CVS provides a detailed, structured methodology (indicating proactive risk management), while MDT offers a high-level, aggregated view (emphasizing overall financial strength), thus reflecting different strategic emphases on liquidity risk. (4) The LLM omits minor details present in the ground truth—such as CVS’s discussion of credit-related impairments and non-credit losses, and MDT’s explicit statement about satisfying current and future obligations—but these omissions do not undermine the central comparison.

However, it omits the specific quantitative impact on ACN's tax rate (a 2.1 percentage point reduction in 2023), which is a key part of the original answer. While QCOM's mention of FDII is accurately represented as a referenced deduction, the LLM does not confirm whether QCOM quantifies the impact, only that it is mentioned—this matches but lacks precision. (2) The quantitative accuracy is penalized because the 2.1 percentage point reduction for ACN is missing, a significant factual omission. No incorrect numbers are stated, but the absence of this specific figure reduces accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that both companies use FDII as part of their tax strategy involving foreign-derived intangible income, linking the deduction mechanism to lower effective tax rates. The logic that structuring foreign-based intangible earnings under FDII reduces U.S. tax burden is valid and consistent with tax policy. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer directly addresses the question’s focus on tax strategy implications. Qualitative accuracy is strong due to correct entity identification (ACN, QCOM, FDII, 10-K disclosures) and proper conceptual explanation, though the lack of the specific numerical effect lowers the overall correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts is $70 million for Duke Energy and $500 million for NextEra Energy, resulting in a total of $570 million. This significant difference suggests that NextEra Energy has a much larger long-term risk exposure tied to commodity contracts compared to Duke Energy, indicating a more aggressive hedging strategy or greater involvement in commodity markets.",

According to the ground truth, Duke Energy's noncurrent derivative liabilities for commodity contracts are $70 million, but the LLM reports $207 million (split into designated and non-designated), which is not supported by the ground truth. Similarly, NextEra Energy's liability is stated as $500 million in the original answer, but the LLM reports approximately $1,199 million (~$1.2 billion), a major discrepancy. The combined total in the ground truth is $570 million, whereas the LLM calculates $1.41 billion—over double the correct amount. These errors severely undermine factual correctness. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s sum of $207M + $1,199M = $1.41B is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but since both inputs are factually wrong, the result is invalid. The ground truth requires a sum of $70M + $500M = $570M, which the LLM fails to match. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: While the LLM attempts to synthesize data across two companies and draw strategic inferences about risk exposure—correctly interpreting that higher liabilities imply greater hedging activity and risk—the reasoning is based on incorrect data, weakening the validity of the conclusion. The qualitative logic (contrasting strategies) aligns with the question’s intent, but rests on false premises. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses both parts of the question: total liabilities and interpretation of risk exposure. It uses appropriate terminology and cites pages, suggesting document grounding.

Additionally, the LLM uses CVS's GAAP operating income ($8,516 million) as 'operating earnings', but the ground truth calculates CVS's relevant earnings as $16,313 million (earnings before taxes, adjusting for interest and other income), which is a different metric entirely. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on wrong inputs: $1,878 + $2,025 = $3,903 is correct arithmetic, but the inputs are inaccurate. The comparison percentages are missing entirely—LLM states amortization is 'well below' operating earnings but fails to compute the 54.3% and 54.7% figures from the ground truth, which are central to the question.

These numbers, while plausible, are factually unverifiable from the provided knowledge and represent a significant deviation. Similarly, stating that P&G's price increases accounted for a '4% lift in net sales' (as a driver of only 2% overall growth) contradicts the original answer, which states that price changes contributed a 4% increase to net sales growth—implying pricing was a component of overall growth, not that it caused a 4% lift in a 2% growth context. (2) The original answer does not mention basis points, volume elasticity, or net sales impact in bps, nor does it state overall sales growth was only 2% for P&G. Thus, the quantitative claims in the LLM answer are not aligned with the ground truth. (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Costco’s sales are modestly affected by gasoline price fluctuations (volume-sensitive, low-margin), while P&G actively uses pricing power as a strategic lever.

Instead, the LLM cites a 39% increase in cash outflows and 13% growth in amortization from Netflix’s 2021 filing (page 30), which, while contextually relevant, does not appear in the original answer and introduces unverified data. Similarly, the LLM claims Comcast recognizes most revenue within 6–12 months and the bulk within two years (citing page 94), whereas the original specifies 'half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue' in deferred revenue—close but not identical in meaning or precision. (2) The numbers in the LLM answer (39%, 13%, 6–12 months, two years) are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified as equivalent; thus, quantitative accuracy is compromised. The original answer’s $1.408B and $4.4B figures are completely omitted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes contrasting financial timing challenges—Netflix’s cash flow pressure vs. Comcast’s revenue recognition lag—and links them to broader industry challenges. Entity accuracy (Netflix, Comcast, Studios segment, content licensing, amortization) is correct, and the conceptual explanation aligns well. (4) The correctness score is 7 because the core insight is accurate and the qualitative reasoning is strong, but the answer substitutes or omits key quantitative details from the ground truth. Quantitative accuracy is 6 due to unsupported percentages and missing dollar figures. Qualitative accuracy is 8 due to correct logic and entity use. Contextual relevance is 9—highly relevant with only minor deviations.",

However, it makes a critical error in calculating CVS's total cost of products sold across all segments in 2022. The LLM claims it is $242,843 million by summing $160,738 million (Health Services) + $82,063 million (Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness) + $42 million (Corporate/Other). This contradicts the ground truth, which states the total is $160,738 million — meaning the LLM has misinterpreted the segment breakdown, likely treating the $160,738 million as a segment value rather than the total. (2) The percentage calculation of $100,769 million / $242,843 million ≈ 41% is mathematically correct based on the LLM's erroneous total, but incorrect relative to the ground truth, where the correct percentage is ~62.6%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: while the model correctly pulls two required values (ABT 2024 and CVS PCW 2022), it incorrectly reconstructs CVS's total cost by adding segments that do not sum to the reported total, indicating a failure in understanding the structure of the financial data.

SPG, on the other hand, capitalizes construction-related costs—including interest and real estate taxes—during the development period until the asset is ready for its intended use.

However, the reported total cost of products sold for CVS in 2023 is wrong in the LLM answer — it should be $110,153 million, not $266,872 million.

In contrast, Goldman Sachs’ investment management revenue of $10.596 billion encompasses a broader set of services, including private wealth management and institutional asset management, and is not solely dependent on ETF inflows. This highlights Goldman Sachs’ diversified revenue base, which includes investment banking, market making, and other principal transactions, distinguishing it from BlackRock’s more focused asset management model.",

No calculation errors are present given this level of precision.\n\n3) The reasoning is sound and reflects the multi-hop synthesis required: it contrasts BlackRock’s ETF-focused, asset-gathering model with Goldman Sachs’ diversified financial services platform. It correctly explains that BlackRock’s inflows grow AUM and future fee revenue, while Goldman Sachs’ investment management revenue is only one component of a broader business. The explanation captures the core distinction in business models, though it could have more explicitly mentioned that BlackRock’s revenue is also derived as a percentage of AUM (implied but not stated).\n\n4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addresses both the numerical difference and the underlying business model implications. The use of source tags like 【page_40】【page_71】 suggests grounding in evidence. Only a minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to slightly less detailed explanation of revenue mechanics compared to the original, but overall meaning and insight are preserved. Hence, a 9/10 on correctness.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains minor quantitative inaccuracies. The ground truth states the 2021 combined Cash Paid for Interest, Net of Amount Capitalized for DUK and NEE is $699 million, while the LLM reports $700 million (sum of $114M for DUK and $586M for NEE). However, the ground truth values for 2021 are $114M for DUK (correctly reported) and $585M for NEE (not $586M), making the correct total $699M. The LLM thus overstates NEE's 2021 value by $1M and the total by $1M. The 2019 values are correctly reported as $84M (DUK) and $614M (NEE), totaling $698M. (2) Calculations: The LLM computes $114M + $586M = $700M (correct arithmetic but based on incorrect input). The actual sum should be $114M + $585M = $699M. The comparison states a $2M increase from 2019 ($700M - $698M), but the correct difference is $1M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, the correct metric, and the two years, and synthesizes across entities and time periods. It correctly compares the combined totals across years. (4) Despite minor numerical discrepancies, the overall conclusion that the combined figure is nearly unchanged is valid. The error is limited to a $1M overstatement in total and difference. Hence, the answer is factually close but not fully accurate on numbers, warranting a 7 for correctness and quantitative accuracy. Qualitative accuracy is high due to correct reasoning and entity identification. Contextual relevance is perfect.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer is highly accurate in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. It correctly identifies the 2023 segment operating profits for RTX ($4.749 billion) and UPS ($8.387 billion), which sum to $13.136 billion—matching the ground truth of $13,136 million (equivalent to $13.136 billion). The LLM rounds this to 'about $13.1 billion', which is acceptable given the context. 2) RTX's operating profit margin is correctly stated as 6.7%. For UPS, the LLM calculates the proportion of segment operating profit to total consolidated revenue as $8.387 billion ÷ $90.958 billion ≈ 9.2%, while the ground truth states 'approximately 9.1%'. This minor discrepancy (0.1 percentage point) likely stems from rounding differences in intermediate calculations but does not materially affect accuracy. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies, computes a total, and compares margins using appropriate financial logic. It identifies that UPS has a higher profitability proportion relative to revenue than RTX, aligning with the ground truth conclusion. 4) All entities (RTX, UPS, 2023, segment operating profit, operating margin, consolidated revenue) are correctly identified and used. Wording differs slightly (e.g., 'proportion' vs 'margin'), but semantic meaning is preserved. The answer is fully relevant and addresses all parts of the question.

The LLM states that NVIDIA had $5.0 billion remaining as of fiscal year end 2022, but the ground truth implies a higher remaining amount. Similarly, for Texas Instruments, the LLM reports $10.10 billion remaining, which may be based on a misinterpretation of the filing date (as of December 31, 2021) versus the fiscal year ending 2022. (2) The calculation itself ($10.10B + $5.0B = $15.1B) is mathematically correct, but the inputs are factually wrong, leading to an incorrect total. The ground truth value of $19.24B suggests that either one or both companies had higher remaining authorizations than reported by the LLM.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, AMZN's unrealized net loss on investments in 2024 was $(13.6) billion, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $1.3 billion—a tenfold discrepancy. This error directly impacts the combined unrealized loss calculation. The LLM computes a total loss of about $1.288 billion, whereas the correct combined loss is $(13.588) billion, due to AMZN's much larger loss. Tesla’s figure of $12 million gain is correctly reported and matches the ground truth. (2) Number verification: AMZN’s value is off by a factor of 10 ($1.3B vs $13.6B), which is a major quantitative error. TSLA’s $12M is accurate. The sum is therefore incorrect: $-1.3B + $0.012B = $-1.288B (LLM) vs correct $-13.6B + $0.012B = $-13.588B. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to combine AMZN and TSLA data and assess impact on financial statements—but fails due to the incorrect input for AMZN. The description of where the items are recorded (‘Other income (expense), net’ for AMZN and ‘other comprehensive income’ for TSLA) aligns with the ground truth, though the original answer specifies the TSLA item is in comprehensive income net of tax, which the LLM captures. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to one major numerical error undermining the core of the answer, despite correct handling of TSLA and reasonable explanation of financial statement impact.

      "original_answer": "At INTC, the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment in wafer fabrication facilities were increased from 5 to 8 years effective January 2023, which reduces annual depreciation expense going forward. This change was influenced by factors such as process technology cadence, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and reuse of machinery across process generations. At CRM, costs capitalized related to new revenue contracts are amortized over four years — longer than the typical initial contract period — based on factors including estimated life cycles of offerings and customer attrition. This amortization period directly affects marketing and sales expense on the income statement. Both companies use straight-line depreciation/amortization methods, but the differing amortization periods reflect distinct operational factors: CRM focuses on customer lifecycle and renewal expectations, while INTC considers technological longevity and manufacturing transitions.",
      "llm_answer": "- Intel (INTC) lengthened the depreciation schedule for a class of wafer‑fab machinery from 5 years to 8 years beginning in Q1 2023.  The longer useful‑life estimate reduces quarterly depreciation expense, raises net‑income (and the related tax shield) and leaves a larger net‑book value for the equipment on the balance sheet; the change was driven by Intel’s assessment of its process‑technology cadence, the anticipated reuse of tools across multiple node generations and other operational‑planning factors.  \n\n- Salesforce (CRM) capitalizes sales‑related commissions and other acquisition costs and then amortizes them straight‑line over four years for new contracts (and over two years for renewal‑ and partner‑success‑fee costs).

The comparison that UNH’s rise was '$300M larger than Pfizer’s increase' is therefore completely incorrect and based on false data.

However, it fails to provide DUK's data, claiming it is not in the provided excerpts, while the ground truth includes DUK's figures ($5,566M noncurrent and $6,044M total), indicating that the information should have been available. This omission leads to an incomplete and incorrect combined total — the LLM states it cannot compute the sum due to missing DUK data, whereas the correct combined total is $17,847 million. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers for NEE are accurate and calculations correct (e.g., $11,273 / $11,562 ≈ 97.5%). However, the absence of DUK's numbers — which are part of the ground truth — results in a major quantitative gap. The model does not attempt or report DUK’s $6,044M total or $5,566M noncurrent liabilities, nor the 92.0% ratio. (3) The reasoning is flawed in the multi-hop aspect: the question requires synthesizing data for both DUK and NEE to compute a combined total and compare proportions. By incorrectly asserting DUK’s data is unavailable, the model fails the core multi-hop requirement. This suggests either a failure to extract or recognize DUK’s data in the input, undermining the synthesis. (4) Contextually, the response is well-structured and relevant, focusing on the right metrics and companies. However, the failure to include DUK’s data — despite it being part of the expected knowledge base — severely limits correctness.

Actually, the ground truth contains an error in its narrative: it says the combined 2024 value ($2,260M) is a decrease from $2,197M in 2023, which is impossible since 2,260 > 2,197. The LLM correctly computes the numbers and concludes an increase of $63M, which is mathematically sound.

In contrast, Lilly explicitly states that due to the high risk and uncertainty in pharmaceutical R&D, it cannot reliably estimate the total costs or future revenue potential of its development projects, and project-level cost data are considered insufficiently reliable for external reporting.

It states that PM (PMI) had a $203 million reduction in pension-related accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI), but the ground truth indicates a $164 million increase in loss. This is a critical error in both direction and magnitude. The LLM incorrectly interprets the change in AOCI as a reduction in loss when it should be an increase. For TGT, the $22 million reduction is correct and matches the ground truth. However, the combined change is reported as $225 million improvement (i.e., reduction in loss), whereas the correct combined change is a $142 million increase in loss. The LLM’s calculation is therefore fundamentally wrong. (2) Number verification: PM’s change is wrong — from $(2,325)M to $(2,122)M is a $203M decrease in absolute value, implying a reduction in loss, but ground truth says PM had a $164M increase in loss. This contradicts the knowledge graph. TGT’s change from $719M to $697M is correctly calculated as $22M reduction. Combined effect should be +$164M (PM) - $22M (TGT) = +$142M net increase in loss, but LLM reports a $225M improvement (i.e., decrease), which is directionally and numerically incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the direction of change for PM, misinterpreting a worsening in pension loss as an improvement. It also does not compute the net combined change accurately. The explanation about actuarial gains and amortization methods lacks support from the ground truth and introduces unsupported qualitative claims. (4) Correctness score is low due to major quantitative and directional errors. Quantitative accuracy is very low because key numbers and calculations are incorrect.

The correct values from the knowledge graph imply AMD's total is $724 million (possibly correct), but CRM's must be $3,296 million to reach the $4,020 million combined total, not $4,004 million. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: the LLM computes CRM's obligation as $3,280 million larger than AMD's ($4,004M - $724M), but the correct difference per the original answer is $2,572 million. This indicates a major error in either data extraction or synthesis.

It reports Duke Energy's cash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized, as $308 million, but the ground truth value is $321 million (since $907M - $586M = $321M). This leads to an incorrect combined total of $894 million instead of the correct $907 million. The difference compared to NEE's amount is stated as $308 million, which is incorrect—it should be $321 million. (2) Calculations are flawed: $308M (DUK) + $586M (NEE) = $894M, not $907M. The correct sum per ground truth is $907M. The comparison 'which is $308 million more than NEE' repeats DUK's incorrect value instead of computing the actual difference ($907M - $586M = $321M). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is logically structured—LLM identifies both companies, the correct metric, and year, and attempts to sum and compare—but fails due to incorrect input data. The model references specific document pages, suggesting retrieval capability, but the numbers extracted are inaccurate. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the answer addresses all parts of the question, uses proper entities (DUK, NEE, 2021, correct financial metric), and maintains relevant context.

However, it incorrectly states that Disney's dollar amount is not disclosed, when in fact the knowledge graph confirms that the combined $3.18 billion net cash inflow difference across both companies is the correct total. This implies that Disney's change, while not explicitly stated in isolation, was accounted for in the aggregate figure. The LLM fails to recognize that the total impact is already provided as $3.18 billion across both firms, leading to an incorrect conclusion that only Verizon’s portion can be quantified. (2) The calculation for Verizon is accurate: going from a $2.3 billion outflow to an $880 million inflow represents a $3.18 billion swing ($2.3B + $0.88B = $3.18B), which is correct. However, the model does not reconcile this with the fact that this $3.18B figure is already the combined total impact for both companies, not just Verizon. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model should have recognized that if the total difference is $3.18 billion and Verizon alone accounts for $3.18 billion, then Disney’s net change must be approximately zero — or that the $3.18 billion figure in the ground truth is the sum total, not a component. Instead, the model treats Verizon’s $3.18B as exclusive and concludes Disney’s data is missing, failing to synthesize the full picture. (4) Scores reflect partial correctness: quantitative accuracy is moderate due to correct Verizon math but incorrect attribution of the total; qualitative accuracy is low due to flawed reasoning; contextual relevance is high because the response addresses the right companies, years, and concept of collateral cash flows.",

      "original_answer": "HD reports an estimated useful life of 5-45 years for leasehold improvements, while MCD depreciates leasehold improvements using the lesser of the asset's useful life or the lease term, which generally includes certain option periods. This difference suggests that HD may adopt a more standardized approach to depreciation over a fixed range, whereas MCD tailors depreciation timelines based on lease agreements. As a result, MCD may experience more variability in annual depreciation expense depending on lease structures, while HD's approach could lead to more predictable long-term expense patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Home Depot states that lease‑hold improvements are depreciated on a straight‑line basis over a **wide range of 5 – 45 years**, allowing the company to spread the cost over a long horizon and keep annual depreciation relatively low. McDonald’s, by contrast, depreciates lease‑hold improvements over **the shorter of the asset’s useful life or the lease term**, which often means the depreciation period is limited to the lease’s remaining years and can be considerably shorter than 45 years. Consequently, Home Depot’s strategy yields a more gradual, long‑term depreciation expense, while McDonald’s approach can front‑load depreciation (higher expense in early years) and reduce it later as leases expire.",

(2) The LLM correctly identifies both companies' depreciation policies and draws a logical conclusion about their long-term expense strategies. (3) The reasoning is sound: HD’s broad fixed range supports more predictable, gradual depreciation, while MCD’s lease-linked approach introduces variability and potential front-loading—this is a reasonable inference from the policy difference. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer notes MCD includes 'certain option periods' in lease terms, which the LLM omits; this slightly reduces completeness in multi-hop synthesis.

      "original_answer": "MA's strategy to expand digital payment options, including accelerating digitization and growing acceptance, increases transaction volume across its network. This growth in transaction volume could lead to a decline in credit card borrowing activity, as consumers shift toward alternative payment methods. According to COF's 10-K filing, a decline in consumer borrowing activity, including credit card use, could materially and negatively affect COF's business and financial results. Therefore, while MA benefits from higher transaction volume through its digital payments expansion, this trend may indirectly reduce COF's revenue from credit-related products.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is factually accurate and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor differences in emphasis. (1) All key facts are correct: MA's expansion of digital payment options (e.g., real-time payments, buy-now-pay-later, disbursements) increases transaction volume across its network, which can shift consumer behavior away from traditional credit card use. This shift could reduce Capital One's (COF) interchange fee revenue, which COF explicitly states could have a 'material adverse effect' on its financial results. The citation of COF's 10-K language ('material adverse effect') matches the original answer's reference to 'materially and negatively affect.' (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—scored as 10 by default. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links MA's digital expansion → increased non-credit transaction volume → reduced credit card usage → negative impact on COF’s interchange revenue. The original answer frames the mechanism as reduced 'borrowing activity,' while the LLM focuses on reduced 'card-based spend' and interchange fees. These are complementary perspectives—interchange fees are tied to transaction volume, while COF also earns interest from revolving balances. The LLM slightly narrows the impact to interchange but still captures a valid and significant channel of harm. (4) Contextual relevance is perfect: the response directly addresses both parts of the question—how MA's expansion affects transaction volume and the resulting negative impact on COF. The only reason for not scoring a 10 in correctness is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the broader decline in 'credit card borrowing activity' (a key point in the original), focusing instead on interchange fees.

It incorrectly states that AMD has a net deferred tax asset of $3.4 billion, while the ground truth shows AMD has a net deferred tax asset of only $339 million. Conversely, it claims Salesforce has a net deferred tax asset of $339 million, but the truth is Salesforce has a net deferred tax asset of $4,770 million—reversing the companies' positions. The difference in net deferred tax liability positions is therefore completely wrong: the correct difference is $4,431 million ($4,770M - $339M), not implied $3.06B in the LLM answer. (2) The LLM incorrectly attributes a $3.6 billion deferred tax liability on acquired intangibles to Salesforce, but in reality, it is AMD that reports a $3,614 million deferred tax liability related to acquired intangibles. This is a critical inversion of data between the two companies. Additionally, the LLM claims AMD has no comparable liability, which contradicts the ground truth stating AMD’s $3,614M liability is a major contributor to its net position. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails due to incorrect entity-metric alignment. The model fails to correctly associate each company with its respective deferred tax positions and the impact of acquired intangibles, undermining the comparative analysis. Instead of showing how AMD’s liability from intangibles reduces its net asset (to $339M), and CRM’s intangibles support a large net asset ($4,770M), the LLM reverses the narrative. (4) Despite these severe factual and directional errors, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right question, uses appropriate financial terminology, and attempts a comparative analysis based on acquired intangibles.

It correctly identifies DIS's current accounts receivable as $10.5 billion (rounded from $10,463 million) and VZ's current portion of device payment plan receivables as $1.0 billion, which aligns with the ground truth. The combined total is correctly calculated as $11.5 billion (rounded from $11,463 million). VZ's total device payment plan agreement receivables are accurately reported as $28.4 billion (rounded from $28,448 million). The comparison stating the combined total is 'well under half' (about 40%) is mathematically sound: $11,463 / $28,448 ≈ 40.3%. 2) All numbers are accurate within acceptable rounding: $10.5B ≈ $10,463M, $1.0B = $1,000M, $28.4B ≈ $28,448M. The sum $11.5B ≈ $11,463M is reasonable. The percentage calculation (40%) is correct. 3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (DIS and VZ), distinguishes between current accounts receivable and device payment plan receivables, and makes a valid comparative analysis. 4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly different phrasing but identical meaning and intent. The only minor deviation is the use of rounded figures and the focus on the current portion of device payment plan receivables rather than explicitly stating 'current accounts receivable' for VZ, but in context, the $1.0B figure refers to the correct line item. No critical information is missing. Thus, the answer is highly accurate and complete.",

HD's net cash provided by operating activities was $16,571 million and MCD's was $9,141.5 million in the same year.

The percentage of combined interest relative to operating cash flow is stated as '9–10%', while the exact value is 9.6% ($2,466.3 / $25,712.5), so the range is reasonable and conveys the same insight.

In contrast, V reports a maximum daily settlement exposure of $137.4 billion for fiscal 2024 and holds $7.7 billion in total collateral as of September 30, 2024, to mitigate this risk.

      "original_answer": "Boeing's 2023 backlog for 737 and 777X aircraft saw a net ASC 606 adjustment of $20,605 million due to a net decrease in those aircraft, signaling delivery delays or reduced customer commitment. This volatility in the aerospace sector, particularly around key models, likely increases risk for companies indirectly exposed through contracts or assets like Emerson’s $310 million backlog intangible asset with a 3-year estimated useful life. If Emerson’s backlog value is sensitive to sector-specific disruptions similar to Boeing’s, the useful life could be shortened due to reduced predictability or cancellations, especially if aerospace demand weakens. Thus, Boeing’s backlog adjustments suggest potential downward pressure on EMR's asset life estimate.",

The ground truth states that Boeing's 2023 backlog adjustment for 737 and 777X aircraft was $20,605 million (approximately $20.6 billion), not $13 billion as claimed by the model. Additionally, Boeing's total backlog is not $440 billion (a figure not present in the original answer), making the 3% calculation invalid. The model incorrectly states Emerson's backlog intangible has a 1-year useful life, while the original answer specifies a 3-year life. (2) Calculations are therefore flawed: using incorrect inputs ($13B instead of $20.6B, $440B total backlog unsupported by evidence, 1-year base life instead of 3 years) leads to an erroneous 3% reduction and a final estimate of 0.97 years. There is no support for proportional scaling of useful life based on backlog percentage changes in the original reasoning. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is poorly executed. The original answer suggests qualitative risk to Emerson’s asset life due to aerospace volatility, not a direct mathematical reduction based on Boeing’s backlog percentage change. The model incorrectly assumes a linear, proportional relationship between backlog dollar reduction and intangible asset life, which is not implied in the ground truth. It fails to recognize that the impact is indirect and risk-based, not formulaic. (4) Due to major quantitative errors, incorrect entity values (EMR asset life, Boeing backlog figures), and flawed logic, the correctness score is low at 2. Quantitative accuracy is 3 due to partial recognition of backlog impacts but wrong numbers. Qualitative accuracy is 3 because the model attempts sector-exposure reasoning but misrepresents the mechanism.

Thus, the 7.5% figure is fabricated or misapplied. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly reports Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) organic growth as approximately 23%, 15%, and 31% across segments, while the ground truth states TMO's overall organic growth was 5% in 2021. These segment-level figures may exist in filings but are not relevant to the question asking for overall organic growth. (2) Completeness: The answer fails to compare DHR’s 23.0% core growth with TMO’s 5% organic growth and instead draws an incorrect conclusion that TMO’s growth exceeded DHR’s. (3) Entity Accuracy: The company ticker TMO is misidentified as Thermo Fisher (correct) but referred to with incorrect metric labels — the question asks for TMO’s organic growth, not segmented breakdowns. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop reasoning is flawed — instead of concluding that DHR had much stronger acquisition-adjusted performance (23% vs 5%), the model incorrectly infers TMO outperformed DHR due to fabricated segment data. (5) Semantic Equivalence: The answer conveys the opposite meaning of the ground truth — it suggests TMO had stronger organic growth than DHR when the truth is DHR’s core growth was 18 percentage points higher. The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right companies and year, but the analysis is based on incorrect data and logic.",

      "question": "What is the difference in the total fair value calculation methodology for RSUs between COST and KO, and how does this affect the timing of compensation expense recognition?",
      "original_answer": "COST calculates the fair value of RSUs as the market value of the common stock on the measurement date less the present value of the expected dividends forgone during the vesting period, and recognizes compensation expense using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. KO calculates the fair value of RSUs as the closing market price per share on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period, and also expenses this value on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. While both companies use similar methodologies, COST emphasizes the achievement of long-service terms for accelerated vesting and recognizes compensation expense upon such achievement, whereas KO forfeits awards upon termination except under specific circumstances. This means COST may recognize expense earlier for long-serving employees, while KO's expense timing is strictly tied to the vesting schedule.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Costco (COST)** – The fair‑value of RSUs is calculated as the closing market price of the stock on the grant (measurement) date **minus the present value of the dividends that are expected to be forgone during the vesting period**. The expense is recorded on a straight‑line basis over the service period (the vesting term), with any accelerated‑vesting portion recognized when the service condition is satisfied.\n\n- **Coca‑Cola (KO)** – KO values RSUs at the **grant‑date market price of the stock with no dividend‑forgone adjustment**. The RSU expense is also recognized on a straight‑line basis over the vesting period (and accelerated‑vesting amounts are recognized when the vesting condition is met).\n\n**Effect on timing:** Both companies spread the expense over the vesting period, so the timing of recognition is the same. However, because Costco reduces the fair value by the present value of expected dividends, the total compensation expense (and thus the amount recognized each period) is lower for Costco than for Coca‑Cola, which uses the full market price.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies regarding KO's fair value calculation methodology. The ground truth states that KO calculates the fair value of RSUs as the closing market price on the grant date *less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period*, which directly contradicts the LLM's claim that KO uses the grant-date market price *with no dividend-forgone adjustment*. This is a critical error in both entity-specific methodology and comparative analysis. (2) While no explicit numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) are provided in either answer, the qualitative description of the calculation methods must be accurate. The LLM incorrectly asserts a key difference (dividend adjustment only for COST), when in fact *both* companies apply the dividend forgone adjustment. This undermines the quantitative logic of expense comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM concludes that expense timing is the same and that only the amount differs, but the ground truth highlights a key difference in *timing* due to COST’s recognition upon achievement of long-service terms (accelerated vesting), while KO forfeits upon termination. The LLM acknowledges accelerated vesting recognition but fails to connect it to COST’s long-service incentives as in the original, and misattributes KO’s policy. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the question structure and attempts a side-by-side comparison. However, due to the core error in KO’s methodology and the resulting incorrect conclusion about expense timing and magnitude, the qualitative and overall correctness scores are low. The answer would be more accurate if it reflected that both firms use dividend-adjusted fair value and that the key timing difference stems from service-based acceleration vs. forfeiture policies, not valuation inputs.",

      "original_answer": "Capital One's interchange fees in 2021 were offset by $6.4 billion in customer reward expenses. These expenses are deducted directly from interchange fees, as interchange fees are collected by acquirers and paid to issuers like Capital One to reimburse them for costs incurred in providing services to account holders. According to Mastercard's description of the four-party payment system, interchange fees play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits across the network, including for issuers who manage account holder relationships and provide services such as rewards programs. This means that the $6.4 billion in rewards expense reflects a portion of the interchange fees Capital One receives, effectively reducing its net interchange revenue while supporting consumer benefits that drive card usage and merchant acceptance.",

This is a critical factual error, as the ground truth explicitly includes the $6.4 billion figure.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies AMD's increase in Property and Equipment, gross from 2023 to 2024 as $599 million, which aligns with the ground truth data. However, it states that CRM's prior-year figure is not disclosed, leading to an inability to compute the combined increase. This contradicts the ground truth, which implies that the necessary data for CRM was available in the source documents and that the combined increase is $676 million. Therefore, the missing CRM year-over-year change is a critical omission. (2) The calculation for AMD is accurate: $3,975M - $3,376M = $599M. If the total combined increase is $676M, then CRM’s increase should be $676M - $599M = $77M. The LLM failed to report this, suggesting either a failure to extract CRM’s 2023 value or an incorrect conclusion about data availability. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly identifying AMD’s change and attempting to locate CRM’s data—but fails in synthesis because it does not access or acknowledge the required CRM prior-year figure, breaking the chain. (4) The correctness score is 4 due to one correct component (AMD) but a major error in incompleteness for CRM, which prevents the correct combined total. Quantitative accuracy is 6 because AMD’s numbers are right, but CRM’s are missing. Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to flawed reasoning about data availability.

While it correctly identifies Mastercard's (MA) 2023 litigation provision as $539 million and MA's 2021 provision as $94 million, it grossly overstates Visa's (V) 2023 litigation provision. The LLM claims Visa recorded $1,346 million ($322M + $1,024M), but the ground truth states Visa's total 2023 provision was $108 million. This results in a combined 2023 provision of $1.885 billion in the LLM answer versus the correct $647 million—a massive overstatement. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: the LLM computes a combined 2023 total of $1.885 billion and claims it is ~20 times MA's 2021 provision, but the correct combined amount is $647 million, which is about 6.88 times larger than $94 million (an increase of $553 million). The LLM’s comparison is based on erroneous inputs.

This satisfies the first part of the question with full quantitative accuracy. (2) For SBUX, the LLM accurately captures the qualitative difference in financial statement treatment: while it does not quantify the excise tax separately, it correctly states that SBUX includes the tax within the 'Repurchase of common stock' line item with a parenthetical note, which aligns with the ground truth's assertion that SBUX provides only a brief, non-quantified disclosure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing BKNG’s quantified, separately recognized liability versus SBUX’s implicit, folded-in treatment across two different 10-K disclosures. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that SBUX does not specify the accounting treatment beyond the line-item inclusion, which slightly reduces qualitative completeness. However, the core contrast in disclosure practices is accurately conveyed. All numbers, entities (BKNG, SBUX, 2023), and financial concepts are correct. Format variations (e.g., $96 million) are acceptable. Thus, the answer is highly accurate with only a slight omission in elaborating SBUX's lack of detailed treatment description.",

      "original_answer": "KO experienced an $1,092 million (8%) increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2023, primarily driven by internal factors such as higher advertising expenses, increased charitable donations, and other employee benefit costs. In contrast, COST's selling, general and administrative expenses are more exposed to external economic factors like inflationary pressures, commodity price volatility (including gasoline and consumables), and tariff impacts, which could affect its cost structure. These differences highlight KO's SG&A changes being more influenced by strategic spending decisions and COST's being more affected by macroeconomic conditions.",

For COST, it correctly emphasizes external factors like inflation, commodity price volatility, tariffs, and foreign exchange, while also including internal labor-related cost drivers such as wages and benefits.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $1,092 million figure is correctly cited, and the 3% foreign currency offset (though not in the original answer, it's an acceptable elaboration if sourced correctly) does not contradict the ground truth.

The synthesis across companies and factors is logical and well-structured.\n\n4) The only reason for not scoring a 10 in qualitative accuracy is that the original answer emphasizes KO’s changes as being driven by 'strategic spending decisions' and contrasts them more clearly with COST’s 'macroeconomic exposure.' The LLM includes slightly more detail on internal labor factors for COST, which, while plausible, slightly shifts focus from the primary contrast in the ground truth.

However, given that the knowledge graph treats this as equivalent (i.e., the 20% is attributed via that market segment), this is semantically acceptable.

According to the ground truth, the combined operating income is $8,373 million, but the LLM calculates $11,796 million, a major discrepancy. The LLM reports MMM's segment operating income as $5,001 million, which does not align with the ground truth implied value (since $8,373M combined minus UNP's $6,795M would imply MMM at ~$1,578M, though exact split isn't provided in ground truth).

AT&T’s increase in broadband ARPU due to the expiration of promotional pricing (described as 'amortizing prior-year promotional discounts') is correctly interpreted. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—no discrepancies. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Meta’s strategic metric evolution (ARPU → ARPP for better user aggregation) with AT&T’s tactical pricing leverage (ARPU increase via promotional roll-offs and plan shifts). The synthesis across companies and strategies is logical and complete. (4) Minor wording differences exist—'amortizing prior-year promotional discounts' is slightly less precise than 'expiration of prior-year promotional pricing'—but the financial implication is equivalent.

      "original_answer": "The competitive and regulatory pressures on interchange fees described by COF could reduce the interchange revenue that card issuers like COF earn, which in turn may lead to tighter collaboration between networks like MA and their issuing and acquiring partners to maintain profitability. MA, which depends on these partners to set competitive program features, may face increased pressure to provide larger incentives to merchants to maintain acceptance and co-branding partnerships, as noted in MA's 10-K. This could materially and adversely affect MA’s profitability, especially if larger merchants continue to negotiate lower interchange rates and demand more concessions, as MA acknowledges in its risk factors. Additionally, if interchange fee caps or litigation outcomes reduce interchange revenues, MA’s issuing partners may have less margin to invest in marketing or co-branding initiatives, further limiting MA’s ability to grow its network acceptance and brand strength.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One notes that regulators and large merchants are pushing to cap or lower interchange fees, which cuts a core source of network revenue and drives merchants to demand cheaper pricing or alternative payment methods. Because Mastercard’s earnings depend on the fees its issuing and acquiring partners collect, those partners will likely press Mastercard for lower network‑fee rates or for larger merchant‑incentive concessions; Mastercard in turn may have to increase incentive payments or price‑concessions to retain large merchants. The combined regulatory squeeze on interchange fees and the need to fund higher merchant incentives therefore threatens Mastercard’s profitability and forces it to absorb cost pressures that it cannot fully control through its issuer‑acquirer relationships.",

(1) There are no numeric values in the question or original answer, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the key entities: Capital One (COF) as the commenter on interchange pressures, Mastercard (MA) as the network dependent on issuing/acquiring partners, and merchants as key stakeholders. It accurately reflects that regulatory and competitive pressures on interchange fees threaten MA’s profitability. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it traces the impact from regulatory pressure → reduced interchange revenue → pressure on issuing/acquiring partners → increased incentive demands from merchants → downward pressure on MA’s profitability and network pricing power. This aligns with the original answer’s logic chain. (4) The LLM emphasizes MA’s need to increase merchant incentives and make concessions, which matches MA’s 10-K risk disclosures. It also correctly notes that MA cannot fully control these cost pressures through its partner relationships. The only minor gap is that the original answer specifically mentions co-branding partnerships and the ripple effect on marketing investments by issuers, which the LLM omits. However, the core message about strained issuer-acquirer collaboration and profitability impact is preserved. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent.

It claims both PFE and UNH had $1 million in aggregate intrinsic value of exercisable shares, resulting in a $0 difference. However, the ground truth states UNH had $3,932 million and PFE had $1 million, resulting in a $3,931 million difference. This is a massive factual error. (2) The LLM incorrectly reports that both companies had the same weighted-average exercise price of $29.81. In reality, UNH had a weighted-average exercise price of $179, while PFE's was $29.81. These numbers are not only wrong but misattributed, suggesting a complete failure in data retrieval or synthesis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The question requires comparing intrinsic values and interpreting how exercise prices relate to stock performance. The LLM fails to recognize that UNH’s much higher intrinsic value stems from its higher stock price relative to exercise price, which is central to the correct explanation. Instead, it falsely equates both companies’ metrics, showing no valid cross-company comparison. (4) The correctness score is 1 due to near-total factual inaccuracy. Quantitative accuracy is 1 because all key numbers (intrinsic values, difference, exercise prices) are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 1 due to incorrect entities, flawed logic, and failure to synthesize.

Pfizer paid $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 for employee termination costs associated with its Realigning our Cost Base Program and $587 million for integration and other costs related to the acquisition of Seagen, totaling $2.09 billion.

According to the ground truth, Eli Lilly paid $3.35 billion for IPR&D and $947.7 million for a manufacturing site, totaling $4.30 billion — not $3.8 billion as stated. The LLM omits the Wisconsin manufacturing site acquisition entirely, which is a major component of Lilly’s 2023 business development spending. For Pfizer, the LLM correctly identifies the $587 million integration cost for Seagen but omits the $1.5 billion employee termination cost under the Realigning our Cost Base Program, which is explicitly part of Pfizer’s 2023 business development outlays. As a result, the LLM’s total of $4.4 billion is substantially lower than the correct combined total of $6.39 billion. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: the LLM underreports both companies’ spending and fails to sum the full amounts. The correct sum is $4.30B (Lilly) + $2.09B (Pfizer) = $6.39B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the LLM correctly infers strategic priorities from spending patterns (Lilly on R&D pipeline, Pfizer on integration), but the analysis is based on incomplete data, weakening the synthesis. It fails to recognize that Pfizer’s $1.5B restructuring cost is a strategic business development expense, not just integration costs. (4) Despite missing key figures and miscalculating the total, the LLM captures the general strategic direction of both firms, earning moderate scores for qualitative accuracy and contextual relevance.

      "original_answer": "BKNG's financial results depend heavily on travel services, which fluctuate with consumer discretionary spending levels. Similarly, SBUX, as a retailer, is also dependent on consumer discretionary spending, making both companies vulnerable to economic downturns.

      "original_answer": "The use of the 10 percent discount factor and first-day-of-the-month average prices reduces the reliability of the standardized measure as an estimate of expected future cash flows for both COP and XOM. COP explicitly states that the standardized measure is not a fair estimate of the present value of cash flows from development and production, while XOM emphasizes that these prescribed assumptions, including the 10 percent discount factor and discrete pricing points, may cause significant variability in cash flow estimates year to year and do not reliably reflect the actual value of proved reserves or future cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies acknowledge that the standardized measure is only a rough proxy for the cash that will actually be generated.  ConocoPhillips notes that the calculation “uses 12‑month average prices … based on the **first‑day‑of‑the‑month** price and a **prescribed 10 % discount factor**” (COP 10‑K p. 158) and that, because those prices are discrete points in time, “the standardized measure … may cause significant variability … and does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected future cash flows” (COP 10‑K p. 134).  Exxon Mobil makes the same point: its discounted‑future‑cash‑flow tables are built on the **first‑day‑of‑month average prices** and a **10 % discount rate** (XOM 10‑K p. 135; see the footnote on p. 159 describing how the net‑change in prices and the discount are applied), and the company states that “the standardized measure … does not provide a reliable estimate of the Corporation’s expected future cash flows” (XOM 10‑K p. 135).

According to the ground truth, the combined total is $42.915 billion, but the LLM reports $95 billion, which is more than double the correct amount. Specifically, the LLM states Microsoft has $33.7 billion remaining, which may be close to accurate, but claims Texas Instruments has $61.5 billion remaining, which is significantly overstated. The actual remaining authority for Texas Instruments must be approximately $9.215 billion ($42.915B - $33.7B) to match the ground truth total, making the LLM's $61.5B figure grossly inaccurate. (2) The calculation of the sum is logically performed (addition of two values), but because the inputs are wrong—especially Texas Instruments’ value—the final sum of $95 billion is incorrect. The dates referenced (June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2024) match the question’s requirements, so the time periods are correctly identified. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model attempts to extract repurchase authority from both companies’ 10-Ks and sum them—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for Texas Instruments. This suggests a failure in sourcing or interpreting the correct value from the Texas Instruments filing. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the model addresses the right companies, metrics, and timeframes, and performs the correct type of synthesis. However, the severe quantitative inaccuracies—especially the overstatement of Texas Instruments’ repurchase capacity—drastically reduce correctness and qualitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "CMCSA amortizes theatrical film costs over 10 years from the initial release, recognizing costs in the same ratio as associated ultimate revenue, which includes all revenue sources within that period. DIS also uses a 10-year window for theatrical films but includes imputed license fees for content used on owned DTC services in its Ultimate Revenues. This means DIS incorporates internal monetization strategies directly into its amortization calculations, while CMCSA focuses on external revenue correlations, leading to different long-term revenue recognition patterns despite similar amortization periods.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast treats a theatrical film as an **individual‑monetized asset** and amortizes its capitalized production cost over the period in which it expects to earn the “ultimate” revenue – generally **up to 10 years** after the film’s initial release, using a revenue‑ratio method. Because the amortization horizon is relatively short and tied to actual box‑office and downstream receipts, most of the cost is expensed in the years when the film’s theatrical and early‑window revenues are realized, giving Comcast a quicker matching of expense to revenue.\n\nDisney, by contrast, **amortizes acquired film libraries on a straight‑line basis over 20 years** from the acquisition date, and the amortization of newly produced content begins at release but is not limited to a 10‑year revenue window. The longer, fixed‑period charge spreads the cost over a much longer span, so Disney’s owned theatrical content contributes to expense (and thus to net revenue) more gradually, smoothing the impact on long‑term revenue recognition.",

The ground truth confirms both CMCSA and DIS use a 10-year amortization period for theatrical films from initial release, with revenue recognition based on ultimate revenue ratios—not straight-line. The 20-year straight-line method applies only to acquired film libraries at DIS, not newly produced theatrical films, which the question specifically addresses. (2) The answer misrepresents DIS’s approach by omitting the key differentiator: DIS includes imputed license fees from its owned DTC platforms in ultimate revenue calculations, directly affecting amortization patterns. This critical point is entirely missing. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the claim that Disney spreads costs over a 'much longer span' due to a 20-year period contradicts the ground truth that both companies use a 10-year window for theatrical films. The multi-hop synthesis fails—despite similar amortization periods, the difference lies in what constitutes 'ultimate revenue,' not duration or method (ratio vs. straight-line). (4) While the answer attempts to compare long-term revenue recognition strategies and mentions revenue-matching principles, it fabricates key details and misses the core distinction (imputed DTC revenue inclusion).

TMO's non-U.S. carryforwards include $419 million that expire between 2025 and 2041, with the remainder having no expiration. This difference in expiration terms implies that TMO has more permanent flexibility with a larger portion of its losses, whereas DHR must strategically utilize the expiring portion before deadlines. This distinction affects long-term tax planning, as TMO may have a more durable tax benefit base, while DHR faces time pressure on certain carryforwards.",

Danaher’s disclosures state that its NOL carryforwards “can be carried forward indefinitely and others can be carried forward to various dates from 2022 through 2041.” Because a portion of each company’s losses will eventually expire, both must time earnings or acquisitions to use the expiring amounts before they lapse, but the indefinite portions give each firm a long‑term tax‑shield that can be applied to future profitability or to offset taxable income from future transactions.",

Individual values are $1.18 billion for TMO (Thermo Fisher) and $0.43 billion for DHR (Danaher), matching the ground truth of $1.18 billion and $427 million respectively; the $0.43 billion is a reasonable rounding of $427 million. 2) Quantitatively, all expiration ranges are correct: TMO has $419 million expiring between 2025 and 2041, remainder indefinite; DHR has some expiring 2022–2041 and others indefinite. The only minor discrepancy is the rounding of DHR’s $427 million to $430 million, which does not affect factual correctness. 3) The reasoning is sound and synthesizes multi-hop information correctly across both companies. It accurately contrasts the strategic implications: both have time-limited portions requiring planning, while indefinite portions offer long-term tax shields. The LLM correctly infers that TMO has a larger permanent benefit base (since $1.18B - $419M = ~$761M indefinite) versus DHR’s smaller expiring portion, though it doesn't explicitly compare the relative durability of the two companies’ tax positions as directly as the original. 4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the combined value and the strategic impact of expiration differences. The slight softening of the comparative strategic implication (e.g., not explicitly stating TMO has 'more permanent flexibility') reduces qualitative precision slightly but does not invalidate the conclusion.

The ground truth states that the combined 2024 production cost for COP and XOM across consolidated operations is $20,996 million ($20.996 billion), but the LLM reports $23.4 billion—overstating by $2.4 billion. Specifically, the LLM assigns $7.9 billion to COP and $15.5 billion to XOM, whereas the correct values from the knowledge graph must sum to $20,996 million (e.g., likely around $5.5 billion and $15.5 billion or similar). Additionally, the LLM reports XOM’s 2023 equity company production cost (excluding taxes) as $1.19 billion, while the ground truth is $1,411 million ($1.411 billion), making the LLM’s figure too low. (2) Calculations are also incorrect: the difference between combined 2024 costs and XOM’s 2023 equity cost should be $20,996M - $1,411M = $19,585M, but the LLM calculates ~$22.2 billion difference based on wrong inputs. The '19-times larger' comparison is also inaccurate due to incorrect base values. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to combine COP and XOM 2024 consolidated costs and compare them to XOM’s 2023 equity cost—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval. Entity identification (COP, XOM, years, metric scope) is correct, and the structure addresses both parts of the question. (4) Despite correct framing and intent, the severe numerical inaccuracies—especially in core financial figures and derived comparisons—warrant a low correctness score.

In 2023, MCD paid $56.1 million in variable rent for company-operated restaurants and $261.4 million for franchised restaurants, directly tying lease costs to sales performance. In contrast, LOW disclosed that variable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices were not significant for any of the periods presented, indicating minimal exposure to sales-linked lease costs. This shows that MCD's lease structure makes it more vulnerable to fluctuations in restaurant sales compared to LOW.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing (BA) faces significant backlog volatility due to its exposure to the Chinese market, where geopolitical tensions, such as ongoing U.S.-China trade disputes and tariffs, could lead to order cancellations or delivery delays for aircraft like the 777X, 737-7, and 737-10. This creates uncertainty in their contractual backlog, which saw an increase in 2023 largely due to growth in BCA and BDS segments. In contrast, Emerson (EMR) treats backlog as a finite-lived intangible asset valued at $310 million with a useful life of 3 years, indicating a more stable and predictable revenue stream associated with backlog. This suggests that EMR is less directly impacted by geopolitical volatility compared to Boeing, whose backlog is more sensitive to external macroeconomic and political factors such as trade restrictions and customer delivery assumptions in China.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson records the value of its order‑backlog as a finite‑life intangible asset (e.g., $310 million with a three‑year life in the AspenTech acquisition and $135 million with a one‑year life in the NI acquisition) that is amortized each year, so the backlog is reflected on the balance sheet as a predictable, depreciating asset. In contrast, Boeing treats backlog only as a contractual liability—its $520 billion 2023 backlog is disclosed as “contractual backlog” that can be reduced or cancelled, especially if deliveries to China are delayed, making Boeing’s earnings more exposed to U.S.–China trade‑related volatility. Consequently, Emerson’s financial results are less directly sensitive to U.S.–China tariff or supply‑chain shocks, whereas Boeing’s large, non‑U.S.‑focused backlog makes it far more vulnerable to such trade‑tension impacts.",

However, the ground truth only mentions the $310 million figure related to backlog and does not reference the $135 million from the NI acquisition or specify that backlog was recorded in both deals—this is an overextension not supported by the original answer. Additionally, the LLM claims Boeing’s 2023 backlog is $520 billion, which is incorrect; the original answer does not provide a dollar value for Boeing’s backlog, so this number is fabricated or misstated (Boeing’s actual reported backlog is in the hundreds of billions, but $520B is not verifiable from the given context). (2) The quantitative inaccuracies—especially the unsupported $520 billion figure and the addition of the $135 million backlog from NI not mentioned in the ground truth—reduce confidence in numerical precision. While $310 million is correct, the inclusion of extra data points without grounding lowers quantitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning and synthesis are strong: the contrast between EMR’s stable, amortized intangible asset treatment and Boeing’s exposure to cancellation risk due to U.S.-China trade tensions is logically sound and matches the multi-hop intent of the question. The conclusion about differential sensitivity to trade tensions is semantically equivalent and well-reasoned.

The difference in growth rates is therefore 10 percentage points (25% - 15%), not 2 percentage points as claimed. The LLM incorrectly states that Danaher’s growth was higher by 2 points, when in fact the gap is much larger and in the opposite direction of what the conclusion implies. (2) Calculations are flawed: the difference between 23% and 25% is indeed ~2 points, but since the inputs are wrong, the result is incorrect. The correct difference is 10 points. Additionally, the LLM misattributes the impact of acquisitions — it claims Cytiva added only ~2% to Danaher’s growth, while the ground truth states that acquisitions/divestitures contributed 7.5% to DHR’s growth and 5% to TMO’s. This is a major quantitative and conceptual error.

This suggests that while Citigroup's current delinquency levels are low, Capital One emphasizes ongoing delinquency monitoring as a central part of its risk management strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Citigroup’s 2024 retail‑banking portfolio showed a very low delinquency ratio – about **0.33 % of loans were past‑due (with the 90‑plus‑day ratio at roughly 0.45 %)**【page_84】.  \nCapital One does not publish a single ratio; instead it treats **delinquency trends (the amount of loans in each delinquency bucket – current, 30‑59, 60‑89, > 90 days) as the primary credit‑quality indicator for its retail‑banking loans**【page_165】.  \n\nThe contrast suggests that Citi relies on a concise, portfolio‑wide delinquency‑rate metric to signal risk, while Capital One emphasizes detailed monitoring of the movement of loans across delinquency stages, reflecting a more granular, trend‑focused risk‑management approach.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Citigroup's 2024 Retail Banking delinquency ratio as 0.33%, matching the ground truth. It adds additional detail (90-plus-day delinquency at 0.45%) not in the original answer but not contradicting it, and supported by the cited page. Capital One's use of delinquency trends as the key credit quality indicator is accurately described, including the breakdown by delinquency buckets, which aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on trend monitoring. (2) All numeric values are correct and properly attributed. The 0.33% figure is accurate, and no calculations were required beyond correct reporting. The extra 0.45% figure is contextually relevant and does not distort the answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two different companies (Citigroup and Capital One), compares their metrics, and draws a logical conclusion about their risk monitoring strategies. It goes slightly beyond the original answer by characterizing Citi’s approach as 'concise, portfolio-wide' and Capital One’s as 'granular, trend-focused,' which is a valid interpretation supported by the data. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly richer detail and equally accurate synthesis. The only minor difference is that the original emphasizes Citigroup's low delinquency level while the LLM focuses on the metric type—both are valid angles. No factual errors; excellent contextual and quantitative accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "Duke Energy (DUK) evaluates the recoverability of regulatory asset balances through inquiries to management regarding changes in regulatory orders, trend analyses of historical balances, and comparisons of recorded balances to independently developed expectations. Additionally, DUK obtains legal counsel analysis for coal ash-related asset retirement obligations. Southern Company Gas (SO), on the other hand, tests the effectiveness of internal controls over regulatory asset recognition, evaluates regulatory filings for intervenor challenges to cost recovery, and conducts completeness and accuracy tests on selected capitalized project costs. Both companies rely on external regulatory orders, intervenor filings, and management representations to assess the probability of recovery, reflecting the high subjectivity in predicting future regulatory outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "Both firms relied on the same high‑level framework—testing management’s controls, reading the commissions’ orders, statutes and intervenor filings, and obtaining management representations about the probability that regulatory‑asset balances will be recovered. Duke’s audit went a step further by probing management‑reported changes, using trend‑analysis and an independently‑developed expectation of the asset balance, and by obtaining internal‑legal letters on coal‑ash retirement‑obligation recoverability; Southern Company Gas focused more on reviewing the substantive regulatory filings, testing a sample of capitalized costs for completeness and accuracy, and evaluating any intervenor challenges to full cost recovery. These procedures underscore the pronounced subjectivity in judging future regulatory decisions for both companies.",

Combined, their net proceeds from debt issuance totaled $33,719 million. Amgen repaid $1,454 million of debt, while Thermo Fisher repaid $5,782 million in the same year.

Repayments: Amgen's $1,454 million is rounded to $1.5 billion (slightly high but acceptable), Thermo Fisher's $5,782 million to $5.8 billion (accurate). Total repayments $7,236 million ≈ $7.2 billion. (2) Calculations are sound: combined issuance (~$33.7B) and repayments (~$7.2B) are correctly summed, and the implied difference of ~$26.5B is accurate. The LLM adds extra insight by quantifying the net excess, which is not in the original but is correct and adds value.

(4) Entity and metric accuracy is perfect: correct companies, correct financial metrics (net proceeds from issuance of debt, debt repayments), and correct year. The only minor issue is the slight over-rounding of Amgen’s repayment ($1.5B vs $1.454B), which does not affect overall correctness.

According to the ground truth, DHR had a -0.5% impact from acquisitions/divestitures and a core sales growth (non-GAAP) of 31.0%, but the LLM claims a -16.5 percentage point impact and a 23.0% core growth, reversing both the adjustment and the resulting organic growth. For TMO (Thermo Fisher), the ground truth states a +3% contribution from acquisitions/divestitures and organic growth of 23%, but the LLM incorrectly breaks this into segments (Environmental & Applied Solutions +1.5%, Diagnostics -0.5%) and estimates overall organic growth in the 'low-20% range', which contradicts the actual 23%. The LLM also misattributes segment-level data not present in the original answer and fabricates a 31% growth in Diagnostics. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the -16.5 vs -0.5, 23.0% vs 31.0%, and +1.5/-0.5 vs +3.0% figures are all incorrect. Calculations and reported effects do not match the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the impact on core sales growth and organic/non-GAAP rates for both companies. It introduces segment-level detail not in the original and draws incorrect conclusions about the relative performance. The combined effect should show an 8 percentage point difference in organic growth (31% vs 23%), but the LLM reverses the leaders and misstates the gap. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the right companies and general topic of acquisition impact and organic growth—but the severe factual and numerical errors undermine correctness. The conclusion that Thermo Fisher had slightly higher organic growth is false (it was lower), and the characterization of Danaher’s acquisition impact as highly negative is incorrect.

The discount rates cited—7.1% for Europe/North America and 10.1% for Latin America/AMEA—are accurately attributed to Mondelez in the original answer, but the LLM incorrectly applies them to Colgate-Palmolive. This is a factual error in entity attribution of the rates, though the rates themselves are correct as used by Mondelez. The ground truth states that Colgate uses high-quality bond yield curves, not the specific WACC figures cited, which the LLM mistakenly assigns to Colgate. (2) All other numeric values—$26 million, the years (2023), and the regions (North America, Europe, Latin America, AMEA)—are correct and properly contextualized. The absence of impairments at Colgate is correctly stated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the LLM synthesizes information across both companies, compares methodologies (discounted cash flow, relief-from-royalty, etc.), and draws a valid conclusion about sector-specific risks—highlighting greater volatility in food brands (Mondelez) versus stability in oral/personal care (Colgate). This aligns with the ground truth’s conclusion about higher sector-specific risks in the food segment. (4) The error in assigning Mondelez’s discount rates to Colgate prevents a perfect score, but the overall factual content, logic, and synthesis are highly accurate. The core insight about sector risk differentiation is preserved and well-articulated.

The ground truth states there was an increase of 3.8 million shares (3.2M from share-based payments and 0.6M from Class B conversions), but the LLM claims a decrease of 22.6 million shares, citing Mastercard as the source. This is incorrect both in direction (decrease vs increase) and magnitude. Additionally, the use of Mastercard data is irrelevant — the original answer does not mention Mastercard, and the context implies a single company’s data across both metrics. (2) The goodwill numbers are correct: $4,884 million in 2018 and $4,920 million in 2019, resulting in a $36 million increase, which matches the ground truth. This part is quantitatively accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM uses data from two different companies (implied: Mastercard for shares, Capital One for goodwill), whereas the original answer appears to refer to the same company’s Class A shares and Commercial Banking goodwill. There is no indication in the ground truth that multiple companies are involved, so synthesizing across unrelated entities invalidates the comparison.

No other numerical values are present, and the year 2024 is correctly referenced. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that Intel’s target could impact operational costs, though it adds the detail that the goal is tied to executive-and-employee bonuses—a nuance not in the original answer. While this bonus linkage is plausible and consistent with corporate practices, it is not confirmed in the ground truth and represents an addition rather than a contradiction. (3) For Texas Instruments, the LLM accurately conveys its regulatory exposure related to energy use, correctly contrasting it with Intel’s voluntary target. It specifies potential financial consequences such as fines, penalties, and remediation costs, which aligns semantically with the original answer’s mention of abatement equipment, process changes, and fees. The reasoning across both companies is sound and constitutes valid multi-hop synthesis. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question: Intel’s cost-impacting sustainability target and TI’s regulatory-driven financial risks. The only minor deviation is the unverified bonus linkage, which does not undermine factual correctness but introduces a detail not in the source.

      "question": "How do the legal and regulatory challenges described in Pfizer's and UnitedHealth Group's 2022 10-K filings differently expose each company to financial damages, and what specific mechanisms in their respective businesses contribute to these risks?",
      "original_answer": "Pfizer faces financial damages primarily through patent-related legal risks, such as third-party challenges to its intellectual property and potential invalidation of patents, which could lead to early generic competition and loss of product exclusivity, especially for high-value branded products. These risks are compounded by ongoing litigation in various jurisdictions and the potential retroactive impact of decisions like the Brazilian Supreme Court's invalidation of Article 40 of Brazil's Patent Law. UnitedHealth Group, on the other hand, is exposed to damages through regulatory audits and investigations, particularly risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits by CMS, which can result in retrospective payment adjustments, fines, or corrective action plans. These exposures stem from its role as a government contractor managing Medicare and Medicaid plans, where accurate health status coding directly affects capitation payments. Both companies face damages, but through distinct mechanisms: Pfizer through intellectual property disputes affecting revenue from pharmaceutical products, and UnitedHealth through regulatory compliance risks tied to government health programs.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer’s legal‑risk profile is dominated by product‑centric disputes – patent‑infringement, antitrust and product‑liability suits and government‑price‑control actions – that can generate large damages, royalty‑payment awards or loss of exclusivity and that are amplified by the company’s reliance on patented drugs, vaccine / treatment approvals and government‑funded pricing/reimbursement mechanisms. In contrast, UnitedHealth’s exposure arises from its payer‑and‑service model: participation in Medicare‑Advantage, Medicaid and other government‑funded plans, its Optum pharmacy‑benefit‑management and health‑service contracts, and state insurance regulations expose it to RADV audits, recoupments, anti‑kickback/false‑claims investigations, capital‑reserve requirements and guaranty‑association assessments that can force fines, payment adjustments or loss of contracts. Thus, Pfizer’s risks translate into direct litigation‑driven damages tied to its intellectual‑property and pricing regime, whereas UnitedHealth’s risks translate into regulatory‑driven financial penalties and cash‑flow hits tied to its government‑contracted insurance and services operations.",

(1) All key factual elements are correct: Pfizer's exposure is tied to patent litigation, loss of exclusivity, and government pricing mechanisms; UnitedHealth's risks stem from RADV audits, government contracts, and regulatory compliance in Medicare/Medicaid and Optum operations. The core mechanisms—intellectual property for Pfizer and regulatory audits for UnitedHealth—are correctly identified. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable; however, the absence of incorrect numbers supports a perfect score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that Pfizer’s risk arises from its product/IP-centric business model, while UnitedHealth’s stems from its role as a government contractor in insurance and health services. The mention of Optum, RADV audits, false claims, and guaranty associations adds contextual depth beyond the original answer without introducing inaccuracies. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the LLM slightly broadens the scope by including antitrust, product liability, and guaranty associations not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth, which, while plausible, are not confirmed in the 2022 10-K filings per the knowledge graph.

Because a net‑credit‑loss amount or ratio for retail banking is not reported, a combined ratio cannot be calculated.  \n\n**Interpretation:** Citigroup’s retail‑banking portfolio shows a very low loss‑rate (0.70 %), indicating modest credit risk.

However, it incorrectly states that Capital One does not disclose a net credit loss ratio for Retail Banking, when the ground truth explicitly states that Capital One reported a 0.00% ratio (i.e., no losses), not that the data is missing. This is a critical factual error. (2) The quantitative accuracy is compromised because the LLM fails to recognize that a 0.00% ratio is equivalent to reporting zero losses, which is a valid and reportable value. The calculation of an average (0.35%) is not attempted due to the misinterpretation, but the ground truth confirms this average is valid and meaningful. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not synthesize the fact that 'no nonperforming loans' translates to a 0.00% net credit loss ratio, which is a key inference required. Instead, it treats missing disclosure as absence of data, when the data is present in the form of a zero value. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses the question framework but draws an incorrect conclusion about data availability and comparability, undermining the core of the multi-hop task. The relative credit risk assessment is therefore incomplete and misleading. While the Citigroup number is correct, the failure to interpret Capital One's zero losses as a reported ratio leads to a significantly incorrect overall conclusion.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key financial figures. According to the ground truth, NVDA's Work in Process (WIP) inventory is $692 million, but the LLM incorrectly states $1,067 million (which is actually TXN's correct WIP value). Conversely, the LLM assigns $964 million to TXN's WIP, which is incorrect—TXN's actual WIP is $1,067 million. This results in a combined WIP of $1,759 million (correct), but the LLM calculates $2,031 million, which is wrong due to swapped and incorrect values. (2) The total inventories are also misstated: the LLM claims NVDA has $1,910 million and TXN $1,955 million, reversing the correct values (NVDA: $2,605 million; TXN: $1,910 million). The difference in total inventories should be $695 million ($2,605 - $1,910), but the LLM computes only $45 million due to incorrect inputs. The final comparison—that combined WIP exceeds the inventory difference by $1,064 million—is completely missed; instead, the LLM claims a $1.99 billion excess, which is based on erroneous calculations. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is present—combining WIP, comparing to inventory difference—but the logic fails due to incorrect data sourcing and calculation errors. Entities (NVDA, TXN, WIP, total inventory) are correctly identified, and the fiscal year (2022) is implied correctly.

      "original_answer": "Amgen faces regulatory-driven pricing pressures stemming from Medicaid rebates, 340B statutory rates, and state-level actions by PDABs in seven U.S. states, as well as international measures such as mandatory price controls, price referencing, and cost-effectiveness assessments in the EU and other markets. These pressures directly affect sales and profitability by limiting pricing flexibility and potentially reducing product usage. In contrast, Thermo Fisher Scientific faces inflation-driven pricing pressures due to elevated inflation rates in the U.S. and other key markets, which increase costs and create downward pressure on gross margins. Additionally, economic instability raises the risk of excess and obsolete inventory, directly impacting inventory management and related financial metrics. The differences in source and impact reflect Amgen's exposure to healthcare-specific regulatory frameworks and Thermo Fisher's sensitivity to macroeconomic conditions affecting broader industrial markets.",
      "llm_answer": "Amgen says its pricing pressure comes mainly from **government‑ and payer‑driven price controls, mandatory rebates and PBM negotiations that force lower list‑prices and “price‑setting” for certain drugs** (Amgen 10‑K p. 18).  The company mitigates the resulting margin squeeze by **maintaining multiple sources and backup inventory of critical raw‑materials and devices**, which it says limits supply‑interruptions and protects gross‑margin performance (Amgen 10‑K p. 20).  \n\nThermo Fisher, by contrast, attributes pricing pressure to **inflationary economic conditions, currency‑exchange effects and broader payer cost‑containment that reduce demand, increase order cancellations and create excess/obsolete inventory**, which it notes can compress product‑price levels and pressure overall profitability (Thermo Fisher 10‑K p. 9‑10).

Thermo Fisher’s inflation-driven pressures, currency effects, and demand reduction are also correctly described. The financial impacts—gross margin pressure and inventory risk—are properly assigned, especially for Thermo Fisher. However, the LLM omits specific details present in the ground truth, such as the role of PDABs in seven U.S. states and international mechanisms like price referencing and cost-effectiveness assessments in the EU, which weakens completeness.

(3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis across both companies’ filings. The contrast between regulatory vs. macroeconomic drivers is well articulated. The mention of Amgen’s mitigation strategy (backup inventory) is accurate but slightly shifts focus from the question’s emphasis on gross margin and inventory risk *as impacts of pricing pressure*—instead framing inventory as a supply chain safeguard, not a risk. This nuances the financial impact discussion.

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly reports LOW's 4.7% decline in comparable-store sales and 11% drop in net sales to $86.4 billion, aligning with the ground truth. It also accurately notes MCD's ~9% increase in global comparable sales. However, the LLM introduces a figure of $25.5 billion in consolidated revenues for MCD, which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth; the original does not specify MCD's total revenue, so this addition introduces unverified data. Additionally, the LLM cites '8.7% in the U.S. and roughly 9% internationally'—specific breakdowns not in the original, which only states a 9.0% global increase. While these may be factually accurate, they go beyond the ground truth and risk overprecision. (2) The calculation of LOW’s prior-year net sales ($97.1 billion) is a reasonable inference from an 11% decline to $86.4 billion, but this number is not in the original and is thus an extrapolation, not a direct fact.

This leads to a stated gap of 10.5 percentage points, which is incorrect—the actual difference in impact is 7.5 percentage points. Furthermore, the LLM claims both companies had 23% organic sales growth, but the ground truth states DHR had 23.0% and TMO had 5.0%, resulting in an 18-percentage-point difference, not 0. These errors completely misrepresent the outcome. (2) Number verification: DHR’s -7.5% impact and 23% organic growth are correct. However, TMO’s acquisition impact is wrong (stated as +3% vs. actual 0%), and TMO’s organic growth is wrong (stated as 23% vs. actual 5.0%).

In MA’s model, the merchant discount rate considers the interchange fee, which is paid by acquirers to issuers. If interchange fees are reduced due to regulatory or market forces, acquirers may adjust the merchant discount rate accordingly to maintain profitability, potentially altering the revenue dynamics for both acquirers and issuers within MA’s network.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s filing notes that interchange fees – the charge issuers receive from the merchants’ banks for each card purchase – are a major source of issuer revenue and are increasingly being pressured by regulators and large merchants, which could force the fees lower. Mastercard’s core‑network model (MA 10‑K pp. 10‑11) is built on a four‑party flow in which the acquirer pays the interchange fee to the issuer and then adds its own costs to arrive at the merchant‑discount rate (MDR) that it charges the merchant. Consequently, any downward pressure on interchange fees that Capital One describes would reduce the cost component that acquirers must cover, allowing them to lower the MDR or shift more of the fee burden onto other network‑service charges, which in turn would affect Mastercard’s settlement exposure and overall fee‑based revenue.",

The ground truth states that P&G's expense was $19.3 billion, but the LLM reports only $1.1 billion, which is off by more than an order of magnitude. This is a major factual error. Target’s value of $251 million is correct. The total combined expense in the original answer is $19.551 billion; due to the incorrect P&G figure, the LLM fails to provide or imply this sum. (2) Number verification: P&G’s $19.3B vs. LLM’s $1.1B — incorrect; Target’s $251M — correct. The LLM cites page references, suggesting source grounding, but the P&G number is still wrong. Calculations are not explicitly shown, but the reconciliation logic is described correctly for both companies. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that both companies include share-based compensation as an add-back in the operating cash flow reconciliation, which shows proper synthesis of the functional role of the expense across filings. However, because one of the two core numbers is severely inaccurate, the overall multi-hop conclusion (total expense and individual contributions) fails. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to one major quantitative error undermining the answer’s reliability despite correct qualitative reasoning and accurate data for Target. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) because of the large discrepancy in P&G’s number. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6) — the explanation of how share-based compensation affects cash flow reconciliation is sound and consistent with the filings.

According to the ground truth, Company C reported growth in Retail Banking loans, while the LLM claims Citigroup (presumably Company C) had a decline from $1.36B to $1.26B (7% drop), which directly contradicts the original answer stating Company C had growth. Similarly, the LLM states Capital One (COF) had an 11% decline, but the ground truth specifies a 7% decrease—thus both direction and magnitude are wrong. (2) The numbers provided in the LLM answer ($1.36B, $1.26B, $1.45B, $1.28B) and resulting percentages are fabricated and do not align with the ground truth, which does not provide exact loan balances but only the directional change and percentage change for COF (7% decrease). The calculation for COF is therefore incorrect (11% vs 7%), and no data supports Citigroup’s numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly infers that a smaller drop indicates stability or growth for Citi, when in fact the ground truth states Company C had actual growth—indicating a fundamentally incorrect synthesis. The conclusion about divergent strategies is partially aligned in concept but based on wrong data, undermining validity. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts to compare two companies’ loan changes and infer strategy, which matches the question’s intent, but the incorrect data and reversed trends severely limit usefulness.

The percentage of RTX's RPO expected to be recognized in the next 12 months is correctly stated as 'about 30%'. It also correctly notes that GE does not disclose a near-term realization percentage, aligning with the original answer. (2) All numeric values are accurate: $125B + $156B = $281B (actual sum is $281.272B, so rounding is appropriate and acceptable). The 30% figure for RTX is exact as per ground truth. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is correctly synthesized across two companies (GE and RTX), their respective RPO values, and the qualitative difference in disclosure practices regarding near-term revenue recognition. The model correctly infers that only RTX provides a percentage, while GE does not.

According to the ground truth, Amgen's restructuring liability *decreased by* $45 million in 2023, meaning the reduction amount is $45M. However, the LLM misinterprets this as the ending balance being $45M, and explicitly states it cannot determine the reduction amount—this is incorrect and contradicts the ground truth. Additionally, Thermo Fisher's total restructuring-related charges are $583 million, not $267 million as stated by the LLM. The $267M figure does not appear in the ground truth and appears to be either fabricated or misread. (2) Number verification: Amgen’s decrease should be $45M (correct in ground truth, misinterpreted in LLM). Thermo Fisher’s total charges are $160M + $46M + $264M + $93M = $583M (correct sum in ground truth); LLM reports only $267M, which is less than half the actual amount and factually wrong. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM attempts to compare the two figures but fails because both numbers are incorrect. It compares Amgen’s ending liability (misinterpreted) to Thermo Fisher’s charges (understated), leading to a flawed conclusion. The correct comparison is a $45M decrease (Amgen) vs. $583M in charges (Thermo Fisher), showing a large difference—this core insight is lost due to inaccuracies.

However, DHR explicitly mentions technology obsolescence rates as a key assumption evaluated by valuation specialists during the audit, suggesting a more quantitatively rigorous approach in that instance, whereas TMO references the metric in a broader context of cash flow projections without specifying exact rates.

The 30% near-term recognition for RTX is accurately reported, and the resulting $46.8 billion implied amount is correct (30% of $156B = $46.8B), though not explicitly stated, the percentage is correctly cited. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar figures and percentages match or are acceptably rounded versions of the ground truth. The sum $68.7B + $156B = $224.7B is accurate and aligns with the $224.738B total (difference due to rounding of GE’s figure). (3) The qualitative reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly notes that GE does not specify a percentage for near-term recognition and provides relevant context about long-term service contracts, which aligns with the ground truth’s implication of delayed revenue recognition. While the ground truth mentions RTX’s uncertainty due to COVID-19, the LLM omits this nuance but still correctly contrasts GE’s lack of disclosure with RTX’s 30% estimate. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both the combined RPO and the comparative near-term recognition. The minor omission of RTX’s pandemic-related uncertainty prevents a perfect 10, but the core multi-hop synthesis across GE and RTX is sound and factually correct.",

This error affects the calculation of the difference in changes between the two companies.

      "question": "How does the 20% asset value limit on TRSs impact both AMT and SPG in terms of their REIT compliance strategies and international operations?",
      "original_answer": "The 20% asset value limit on TRSs restricts both AMT and SPG in how much they can invest in taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are used to conduct non-REIT qualifying activities. For AMT, this limit constrains their ability to expand non-real estate activities and investments in TRSs, particularly those generating income from international operations, which may be subject to withholding taxes and currency controls that further complicate repatriation for REIT distribution requirements. For SPG, the same 20% cap forces them to closely monitor the value of TRS securities to ensure they remain under the threshold, requiring strategic structuring of transactions to maintain REIT compliance and avoid a 100% excise tax on non-arm's-length dealings. Thus, both companies must balance the benefits of using TRSs for operational flexibility against the constraints imposed by the REIT rules tied to TRS ownership.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies treat the 20 % ceiling on the value of securities held in taxable REIT subsidiaries (TRSs) as a hard‑stop that shapes their REIT‑qualification play‑book.\n\n* **American Tower (AMT)** – The filing notes that the Operating Partnership must keep TRS holdings at or below 20 % of total assets; otherwise it would have to liquidate or forego further TRS acquisitions and could trigger the 100 % excise tax on non‑arm‑length TRS transactions. Because the bulk of the cash generated by AMT’s TRSs comes from overseas tower operations, the firm also flags that foreign withholding taxes and currency‑control rules can limit the amount of TRS cash that can be repatriated to satisfy the REIT‑distribution test. Consequently, AMT’s growth strategy for its international tower business is deliberately paced to stay within the 20 % asset cap and to avoid tax‑penalty exposure.\n\n* **Simon Property Group (SPG)** – SPG’s 10‑K repeats the same statutory limit (no more than 20 % of a REIT’s assets may be represented by TRS securities). It says that breaching the limit would force a rapid divestiture or the abandonment of otherwise attractive investments, thereby constraining its ability to expand non‑real‑estate activities through TRSs. SPG also points out that most of the income and cash flow from its TRSs is derived from international operations, so local withholding taxes and currency‑conversion restrictions can impede the flow of TRS earnings needed to meet the 90 % REIT‑distribution requirement. The company therefore monitors TRS values closely and structures any new TRS deals on arm‑length terms to stay compliant.\n\nIn short, the 20 % asset‑value ceiling forces both AMT and SPG to limit the size of their TRS portfolios, to manage or curtail international TRS‑related growth, and to carefully structure TRS transactions to avoid excise‑tax penalties while still generating enough foreign cash to meet REIT distribution obligations.",

The average share price of $425 and the 6.64 million shares are plausible, but the total dollar value is off by an order of magnitude. (2) The calculation of Accenture’s cash decline is correct: $9.0 billion to $5.0 billion is a $4.0 billion decrease.

According to the ground truth, Citigroup's (C) combined 30+ day delinquency rate in 2024 is 0.33%, but the LLM incorrectly calculates it as ≈0.87% by adding Citigroup’s 30-89-day (0.54%) and 90+ day (0.33%) past-due rates, which is a misunderstanding—these are overlapping categories, not additive. The correct combined 30+ day rate for C is explicitly 0.33%, not a sum. For COF, the LLM correctly reports the 30+ day delinquency rate as 6.73%. However, the LLM then adds the two rates (0.87% + 6.73% = ~7.6%), which is a fundamental error—the question asks for the delinquency rates *at both* C and COF, not their sum. The correct interpretation is to report both rates separately, not combine them arithmetically. (2) The nonperforming loan rate at COF is reported as 1.39% by the LLM, but the ground truth states it is 0.99%, making this a direct factual inaccuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model misunderstands the structure of the question—'combined' refers to reporting both entities’ rates, not summing them into a single aggregate.

      "original_answer": "NVDA's international supply chain exposes it to risks such as low manufacturing yields, supplier loss, and product defects, which can negatively impact its gross margin. With 84% of its revenue coming from international sales, disruptions in global operations—like supplier prioritization or production delays—could significantly reduce profitability. In contrast, TXN owns much of its manufacturing capacity, allowing it to spread fixed costs over higher output as factory loadings increase. This was evident in 2021 when TXN achieved a gross margin of 67.5%, partly due to the efficiency of its 300mm production. Therefore, while NVDA's reliance on external foundries and international markets increases vulnerability to cost overruns and quality issues, TXN's internalized manufacturing strategy enhances gross margin stability and scalability.",
      "llm_answer": "NVDA notes that 84 % of its FY‑2022 revenue comes from outside the United States and that its reliance on foreign foundries, assemblers and test houses creates “lack of direct control over product quantity, quality and delivery schedules” and exposes it to “product‑defect, warranty‑repair and supply‑chain‑disruption” costs that could “negatively impact … gross margin” (see NVDA 10‑K p. 25‑26).  \n\nIn contrast, Texas Instruments emphasizes that its “gross margin of 67.5 % reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300‑millimeter production” and that owning much of its capacity lets it spread fixed costs over higher output, supporting a stable, high margin (TXN 10‑K p. 21).  \n\nThus, while NVDA’s internationally‑sourced supply chain and defect risk threaten its margins, TXN’s in‑house, high‑volume 300 mm fab strategy underpins a consistently strong gross‑margin profile.",

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit was $13,746 million in 2023, which was an increase from $9,128 million in 2022, representing a $4,618 million increase. In contrast, UPS's adjusted operating profit decreased by $672 million. Caterpillar's adjusted operating margin improved from 15.4% to 20.5%, a 510 basis point increase, while UPS's adjusted operating margin decreased by 230 basis points to 9.0%. Therefore, Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit was $4,618 million higher than UPS's decrease, and Caterpillar's margin improved by 510 basis points compared to UPS's 230 basis point decline.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numbers. According to the ground truth, Caterpillar's adjusted operating profit increased by $4,618 million, not $12.966 billion or $12.3 billion higher than UPS's decrease. The LLM incorrectly reports Caterpillar's total profit ($12.966B) instead of the year-over-year increase, and then compares it incorrectly as being 'higher' by $12.3B than UPS's $672M decline — this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the question, which asks how much higher Caterpillar's *increase* was compared to UPS's *decrease*. The correct comparison is $4,618M (Caterpillar's increase) vs -$672M (UPS's decrease), so Caterpillar's increase was $4,618M - (-$672M) = $5,290M higher, but the original answer simplifies this to stating Caterpillar's increase was $4,618M and UPS's decrease was $672M — the difference in magnitude is implied. However, the LLM invents a non-existent $12.3B figure. (2) For margins, the LLM correctly states Caterpillar’s margin improved by ≈5.1 percentage points (510 bps) and UPS decreased by 2.3 points (230 bps), which matches the ground truth. However, it then computes a net difference of 7.4 points, which was not asked — the question only asks for the change in Caterpillar's margin relative to UPS's decrease, i.e., +510 bps vs -230 bps, not their arithmetic difference. So while the individual margin changes are correct, the synthesis is misaligned. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, the correct metric (adjusted operating profit and margin), and the direction of change. But it fails to extract the correct value for Caterpillar’s *increase* in profit, using either the total profit or an incorrect delta. This breaks the core quantitative logic. (4) Scores reflect that while the margin data is accurate and the context is relevant, the critical profit comparison is factually wrong due to incorrect data and flawed calculation, severely impacting correctness and quantitative accuracy.

This is off by a factor of over 2,000x. MSFT's customer-related intangibles were $661 million, but the LLM reports $2.99 billion—over 4.5x higher than the truth. These errors completely distort the comparison. (2) The LLM cites MSFT's Activision Blizzard and Nuance acquisitions, claiming $22 billion and $4.37 billion in intangibles, with $2.61 billion customer-related from Nuance. While these figures may reflect actual past acquisitions, the ground truth states MSFT's total fair value of intangible assets acquired was $21,969 million (~$21.97 billion), which likely includes these deals. However, the LLM incorrectly uses historical acquisition data rather than focusing on 'recent acquisition activity' as of August 2024, and misrepresents the current carrying amounts. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM concludes MSFT’s customer-related intangibles are 'roughly twice the size' of ACN’s, when in fact ACN’s are over 3,900x larger according to the ground truth ($2,587,660M vs $661M). This reverses the correct conclusion. (4) The context is partially relevant—both companies and the concept of customer-related intangibles are addressed, and acquisition activity is discussed. However, due to catastrophic numerical errors and incorrect synthesis, the qualitative and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.

      "original_answer": "NVDA's gross margin is negatively impacted by inventory risks and supply chain constraints, such as placing non-cancellable orders with long lead times and paying premiums to secure supply, which could lead to excess inventory charges if demand decreases. In contrast, TXN benefits from owning much of its manufacturing capacity, where increased factory loadings spread fixed costs over more output, thereby increasing gross margin. NVDA's strategy involves higher risk and potential cost volatility, while TXN's model provides more cost control and margin stability.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s 2022 gross margin is vulnerable to its inventory‑risk strategy: the company has been placing long‑lead‑time, non‑cancellable orders and paying premiums to secure wafer capacity, and it relies on third‑party foundries and assemblers.  If demand falls or supply‑chain disruptions persist, those commitments can raise product costs or create excess inventory, which the filing says would “negatively impact … gross margins.” In contrast, Texas Instruments’ margin profile is driven by its largely owned manufacturing base; the 10‑K notes that a “strong foundation of manufacturing… provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain” and that fixed‑cost factories spread costs more efficiently when utilization is high, helping to sustain the 67 %‑plus gross margins reported. Thus, NVIDIA’s external, inventory‑heavy supply chain can compress margins, while TI’s internal, capacity‑leveraged cost structure tends to protect or enhance margins.",

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) Calculations are accurate: $3,173M - $2,722M = $451M (correct), $965M - $963M = $2M decrease (correct), and net change = $451M - (-$2M) = $451M + $2M = $453M? Wait — no: the net change in outflows is $451M increase minus a $2M decrease, meaning overall net increase is $451M - $2M = $449M, which the model correctly reports. However, the phrasing 'Google’s increase was $449 million larger than Comcast’s decrease' is slightly misleading: $451M (increase) minus $2M (decrease) means the increase was larger by $449M, which is mathematically correct (451 - 2 = 449), so the calculation and logic hold. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies and two years, computes changes, compares them, and aggregates net change — all correctly. (4) The only minor issue is the phrasing 'Google’s increase was $449 million larger than Comcast’s decrease', which, while numerically correct (difference between +451 and -2 is 453 in absolute terms, but in comparative magnitude of change, it's 451 - 2 = 449), could be interpreted ambiguously. However, in context, it aligns with the intended meaning of net change. Thus, factual accuracy is excellent, with only slight room for clarification in expression.

The combined total is given as $7.3 billion, which is an acceptable approximation of the exact $7.25 billion sum. The minor discrepancy arises from rounding Microsoft's amount up to $2.8B instead of $2.75B, but this does not materially misrepresent the figure. (2) Calculations: The LLM attempts to justify Microsoft's buyback with a detailed computation (2.44M × $413.75 + 2.23M × $416.85 + 1.96M × $436.58), suggesting internal consistency, though the exact share volumes and prices are not verifiable from the ground truth provided. However, the resulting $2.8B is close enough to $2.75B to be considered approximately accurate. Accenture's $4.5B is exact. The sum $4.5B + $2.8B = $7.3B is mathematically correct based on the inputs, even if slightly overstated due to rounding.

It accurately notes Accenture’s year-long program and Microsoft’s quarterly (Q4) activity, aligning with the ground truth’s emphasis on timing differences. (4) The qualitative interpretation of capital allocation strategies is semantically equivalent: both companies emphasize shareholder returns via buybacks, with differences in timing and pacing.

These figures are properly attributed to the respective companies and time period. (2) All numeric values are accurate—9.2% and 2.73% are correct, and no calculations (e.g., differences or ratios) were required beyond comparison, which is handled appropriately. Format variations are not an issue here as percentages are standard. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that AXP’s high yield reflects its concentrated, high-margin credit card business, while BAC’s lower yield aligns with its diversified banking model. While the ground truth mentions specific asset sizes ($15.0B for AXP loans vs. $535.5B for BAC’s earning assets), the LLM captures the qualitative contrast in business models—concentrated high-yield lending vs. diversified, volume-driven banking—without including those exact dollar figures. This is a minor omission but does not detract from the core insight. (4) The answer is contextually excellent, directly addressing how the yield difference reflects distinct financial strategies. The reasoning is logically structured and grounded in the reported data. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the absence of the specific asset size figures, which were present in the ground truth and would have strengthened completeness. However, the semantic meaning and strategic interpretation are equivalent. Thus, scores are: Correctness 9 (all key facts correct, minor omission), Quantitative Accuracy 10 (numbers perfect), Qualitative Accuracy 9 (strong reasoning, slight lack of granular data), Contextual Relevance 10 (fully on point).",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both amounts are correct, years are accurate, and the sum is properly computed and reasonably rounded. Format variations (e.g., $2.48 billion vs $2.477 billion) are acceptable. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes information across two companies and filings, accurately describing how each treated the expense—Comcast excluded it from Adjusted EBITDA and segment results, while Alphabet recorded it in 'corporate costs, unallocated,' which are not allocated to segments. This aligns with the ground truth's emphasis on differing treatments. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that GOOGL's treatment means the expense 'was included in Corporate costs, unallocated' using the exact phrasing from the original, but it conveys the same meaning by stating it was 'recorded within corporate costs, unallocated' and 'not allocated to any operating segment.' Thus, semantic equivalence is maintained. All parts of the question are addressed: total amount and treatment in segment results.

In the same year the two companies reported total plan‑asset fair values of roughly **$3.66 billion (Danaher) plus $2.53 billion (Thermo Fisher) – about $6.2 billion overall**, so the combined deficit is only a small fraction (≈ 13 %) of the total assets backing the plans.",

The combined funded status deficit is reported as $834 million, but the ground truth is $771 million. The total fair value of plan assets is stated as approximately $6.2 billion, but the correct total is $1.29 billion (calculated from $771M deficit representing 59.7% of assets, implying total assets of ~$1.29B). The percentage comparison is also wrong: LLM states ~13%, but the correct figure is 59.7%. (2) Specific number verification: Danaher’s deficit was $521M and Thermo Fisher’s was $250M in the ground truth data, summing to $771M — so Thermo Fisher’s number is correct, but Danaher’s is overstated by $63M. Asset values are completely incorrect: LLM cites $3.66B (Danaher) and $2.53B (Thermo Fisher), totaling ~$6.2B, which is more than 4x higher than the implied correct total of ~$1.29B. This suggests confusion with total global or U.S. plan assets rather than Non-U.S. Pension Benefits specifically. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize across both companies and performs a correct type of calculation (summing deficits and assets, then computing percentage), so the logical structure is sound. However, it uses incorrect underlying data, likely due to retrieving asset values from different benefit plans or geographic scopes. (4) Scores justified as follows: Correctness is low (3/10) due to major errors in all key quantitative outputs. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2/10) because only one input number (TMO's $250M deficit) is correct. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4/10) — reasoning framework is valid, entities and years are correct, but flawed data undermines synthesis.

This results in a severe factual and calculation error. The entity identification (Accenture and Microsoft) and the metric (share repurchases) are correct, and the answer attempts a relevant comparison, so there is partial contextual relevance.

This leads to an incorrect net change of -$15 million instead of the correct -$20 million. (2) The percentage decrease for MMM is stated as 'about 15%' which aligns with the ground truth (15%), but the dollar amount error undermines the calculation basis. The claim that 'EMR experienced the larger percentage increase' is factually correct in isolation (since MMM had a decrease, not an increase), but the phrasing misleads in the context of the question, which asks which company had a greater percentage *increase* — EMR is the only one with an increase, so technically correct, but the comparison logic is flawed because MMM did not have an increase. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly identifies both companies, the relevant metric (current operating lease liabilities), and the time frame (2023 to 2024), and performs the percentage calculation correctly for EMR. However, the incorrect dollar change for MMM breaks the synthesis. (4) Scores reflect that core facts are partially correct (EMR's numbers, MMM's percentage trend), but major errors in key figures reduce overall correctness.

      "original_answer": "Disney recorded $0.7 billion in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024 related to content assets, among others, which reduces the carrying value of those assets and signals a decline in expected future cash flows, negatively impacting financial position. In contrast, Netflix monetizes content assets as a group rather than at the individual title level and amortizes them over time, with over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset amortized within four years. This group-level monetization approach allows Netflix to spread the cost of content over time and across its subscriber base, aligning amortization with viewing patterns and supporting a more stable cost of revenue structure.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney recorded a non‑cash impairment of its content assets in fiscal 2024 (part of the $0.7 billion impairment charge for retail assets, content assets and equity investments), which lowered the carrying value of those assets on the balance sheet and reduced net income for the year. In contrast, Netflix does not expense content on a title‑by‑title basis; it capitalizes licensed and produced titles, amortizes them as a group over the shorter of the contractual window or ten years (typically on an accelerated schedule), and recognizes revenue from its subscription model rather than from individual titles, only writing the assets down if a group‑level impairment event occurs.",

The figure matches the original answer exactly, and no calculations are required beyond accurate reporting. (2) The LLM correctly contrasts Disney’s impairment with Netflix’s approach: it accurately describes Netflix’s group-level amortization of content assets, capitalization of licensed and produced content, and amortization over the shorter of contractual term or ten years (typically accelerated). While the original answer specifies that over 90% of content is amortized within four years, the LLM mentions a ten-year ceiling and accelerated schedule, which is consistent in spirit but slightly less specific. This is a minor omission, not an error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes Disney’s impairment impact (reduced asset value and net income) with Netflix’s contrasting accounting policy (group amortization, subscription revenue model, impairment only upon group-level triggers). Entities (DIS, NFLX), fiscal year (2024), and financial concepts (impairment, amortization, revenue recognition) are all correctly identified and applied. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses both parts of the question. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slightly less precise detail on Netflix’s amortization timeline (missing the 'over 90% within four years' specificity), but the core reasoning and facts remain correct and semantically equivalent.

There is no evidence Tesla applies Black-Scholes to RSUs—this model is typically used for options, not RSUs. (2) No numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) are present in either answer, so quantitative accuracy cannot be assessed on numbers, but the valuation methods themselves are mischaracterized, which counts as a qualitative and factual error.

These differences suggest that IBM's approach to corporate governance emphasizes detailed transparency around executive pay structures and risk alignment, while Salesforce maintains a more streamlined disclosure framework, relying on Proxy Statement incorporation without specifying individual compensation tables. This contrast in disclosure depth and categorization reveals differing philosophies: IBM's detailed labeling may cater to investor scrutiny and regulatory expectations, whereas Salesforce's approach implies a more consolidated, possibly higher-level governance perspective.",
      "llm_answer": "Salesforce’s 10‑K treats executive pay as a collection of stand‑alone documents – the filing lists each equity‑plan exhibit (e.g., the 2004 ESP, 2013 Equity Incentive Plan, change‑of‑control agreements, RSU forms) in the exhibit index (page 97) and, in Item 11, simply incorporates the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” from its proxy statement (page 95).  It also discloses the CEOs’ Rule 10b5‑1 trading arrangements in Item 9B (page 94), giving investors a very granular view of individual agreements and trading‑plan mechanics.  \n\nIBM, by contrast, aggregates compensation in a series of summary tables (options, RSUs, PSUs, DCEAP shares) and ties the awards to performance‑based plans that are administered by the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee (pages 16‑18, especially the equity‑award table on page 17 and the description of the 2001 Long‑Term Performance Plan on page 18).  The 10‑K therefore emphasizes board oversight, performance‑linked payout and risk‑alignment rather than itemizing each plan document, reflecting a governance model that foregrounds committee control and alignment of executive pay with shareholder risk.",

(1) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in either the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—score 10. (2) The LLM correctly identifies Salesforce’s incorporation by reference of the 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis' from the proxy statement and notes the inclusion of specific equity plans and Rule 10b5-1 arrangements in Item 9B, which adds granularity on trading plans—an accurate detail not in the original but factually valid and contextually enriching. (3) For IBM, the LLM accurately describes the use of summary compensation tables, performance-linked awards (e.g., PSUs, DCEAP), and the role of the Executive Compensation and Management Resources Committee, correctly inferring that IBM emphasizes board oversight and risk alignment. The mention of the 2001 Long-Term Performance Plan and page references (e.g., 16–18) supports detailed disclosure, consistent with the original’s emphasis on granular labeling. (4) The reasoning is sound multi-hop synthesis: it contrasts Salesforce’s document-by-reference model with IBM’s integrated, performance-focused presentation, correctly linking structure to governance philosophy—transparency through aggregation and risk alignment vs. streamlined incorporation. The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly name IBM’s 'Potential Payments Upon Termination' or 'Grants of Plan-Based Awards' tables, but it captures their essence through descriptions of performance-based plans and summary tables. Overall, the answer conveys semantic equivalence with stronger elaboration on governance mechanisms, making it slightly more detailed than the original.

      "original_answer": "The difference in Net Interest Yield between AXP (9.2%) and BAC's Consumer Lending segment (3.66%) in 2023 reflects contrasting financial strategies. AXP focuses on high-yield proprietary card lending, as evidenced by its $15.0 billion in average Card Member loans generating a 9.2% yield, indicating a premium credit business model. In contrast, BAC's Consumer Lending segment, with a much lower 3.66% yield on a significantly larger loan base ($304.561 billion average loans in 2023), suggests a broader, more diversified consumer lending approach with lower per-dollar returns but higher volume. This results in a $7.634 billion effective yield difference ($15.0 billion * 9.2% = $1.38 billion for AXP vs. $304.561 billion * 3.66% = $11.15 billion for BAC, with a $9.77 billion absolute difference in interest income from these segments).",

These omissions reduce quantitative accuracy. (2) While the percentages are correct and properly attributed, the LLM does not perform or mention any calculations, missing a critical multi-hop element that compares not just yield but total interest income implications.

However, the qualitative accuracy is low due to significant factual misrepresentation in the environmental compliance costs identified by Boeing and Union Pacific. The original answer states that Boeing specifically identifies FAA-initiated investigation and quality control compliance costs related to the 737-9 production line as potentially material, with financial impact tied to additional work or stricter clean-up standards. In contrast, the LLM incorrectly frames Boeing’s exposure around general environmental compliance (soil, air, groundwater) under broad environmental laws, which conflates environmental regulation with aviation safety oversight—the latter being the actual context (FAA production line scrutiny, not environmental contamination). This is a critical error in entity and context attribution. For Union Pacific, the original answer emphasizes environmental remediation obligations (investigation, remediation, monitoring) at current and future sites as likely to have a material adverse effect if costs exceed estimates. The LLM shifts focus to greenhouse-gas and diesel-exhaust emissions controls and policy caps, which are not highlighted in the ground truth. While Union Pacific is subject to such regulations generally, the specific material risk cited in the original is remediation liabilities, not emissions caps. Thus, the LLM misidentifies the primary source of material financial impact for both companies. The regulatory context comparison is partially correct—Boeing’s FAA oversight vs. Union Pacific’s multi-level environmental statutes—but the LLM incorrectly characterizes Boeing’s context as environmental rather than production and safety compliance. This reflects a failure in multi-hop reasoning: the model did not correctly synthesize that Boeing’s material compliance cost stems from FAA production-line scrutiny (a safety/quality issue with potential environmental aspects), while Union Pacific’s stems from legacy environmental contamination liabilities. Despite this, the answer is contextually relevant and structured appropriately, addressing both companies and their regulatory environments, hence a moderate contextual relevance score.",

      "original_answer": "Disney amortizes participations and residuals over the applicable product life cycle based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues for content predominantly monetized individually, while for group-monetized content, these costs are expensed in line with the pattern of usage. This reflects Disney's dual strategy of monetizing content either individually (e.g., theatrical films) or as part of a bundle (e.g., DTC subscriptions). Netflix, on the other hand, includes participations and residuals as part of its broader content production and licensing expenses, which are amortized as part of its content asset base, aligning with its primarily subscription-based DTC model. This implies that Disney's expense recognition for participations and residuals varies depending on the monetization model (individual vs. group), while Netflix's is more consistently tied to its streaming delivery and usage patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney treats participations and residuals differently depending on how a title is monetized. For titles that are “individual” (e.g., theatrical releases or sales to third‑party broadcasters) the costs are expensed over the product’s life‑cycle in proportion to the revenue actually earned in each period, while for “group” titles (content primarily used on Disney’s own DTC or linear networks) the costs are recognized in line with the projected usage pattern, often on an accelerated or straight‑line basis. Netflix, by contrast, rolls participations and residuals into its overall content‑asset amortization and spreads that amortization over the estimated useful life of the content – essentially a straight‑line or usage‑aligned schedule that matches the subscription‑revenue stream – producing a more uniform, predictable expense timing.",

However, the ground truth states the *combined* obligation for DHR and TMO is $1,125 million, not each individually. This is a critical error that completely misrepresents the data.

While close, this calculation is still inaccurate. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the combined obligation is overstated by over $1.5 billion, and the payment sum is off by $11 million. These are not minor rounding differences but fundamental data errors.

COST also recognizes membership fee revenue ratably over one year, aligning with WMT's approach. However, COST's recent fee hikes suggest a strategy to boost membership revenue, which could bring its financial performance closer to WMT's scale over time, especially as COST's renewal rates remain high at 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada.",

It states that Walmart reported $4.8 billion in membership fee revenue for FY 2024, but the ground truth specifies $3.8 billion for fiscal 2025. This is a significant error in both amount and fiscal year. Additionally, the LLM does not mention Costco's specific fee increase (from $120 to $130 for Executive membership) or the expected $370 million in additional revenue over two years, with $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025—key details from the original answer. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are critical: the revenue figure for WMT is off by $1 billion, and the fiscal year is incorrect. The LLM also omits all specific numbers related to COST's fee hike impact, which are central to the comparison. While the recognition method (ratable over 12 months) is correctly identified for both companies, the absence of COST's projected revenue uplift undermines the financial reporting implications. (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that both companies defer and ratably recognize membership fees, leading to smoothed revenue recognition and upfront cash flow benefits. This reflects accurate synthesis of accounting treatment. However, it fails to connect COST's recent fee increases to a strategic move to close the revenue gap with WMT, and misses the high renewal rate (92.9%) that supports this strategy.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AXP experienced a reserve release in its Card Member receivables portfolio due to lower delinquencies and a decrease in receivables outstanding, which directly reduced its credit loss provision. Conversely, BAC had a reserve release in its commercial portfolio primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions, which also led to a reduction in its credit loss provision. The directional impact was a decrease in provisions for both companies, but the underlying drivers were distinct: AXP's was delinquency-related, while BAC's was macroeconomic in nature.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express said that the only reserve release it recorded in 2023 came from its Card‑Member receivables – lower delinquency rates and a drop in receivables outstanding allowed a **release that reduced the receivables‑related provision**, even though overall credit‑loss provisions rose because loan‑level reserves were built higher as delinquencies on the loan portfolio increased.  \n\nBank of America, by contrast, attributed its 2023 reserve release to **improved macro‑economic conditions in its commercial portfolio**, which lowered the allowance for credit losses and therefore **pushed its overall credit‑loss provision down (partially offsetting other increases).**",

The quantitative accuracy is high—no specific numbers are provided in either the ground truth or LLM response, so no discrepancies exist in that regard. However, the LLM introduces a significant factual inconsistency by stating that 'overall credit-loss provisions rose' for AXP due to higher loan-level reserves, which contradicts the ground truth that AXP had a net reserve release reducing its provision. The ground truth indicates a straightforward reduction in AXP’s credit loss provision, with no mention of offsetting increases in other reserves. This misrepresents the net effect on AXP’s provision and undermines the qualitative accuracy. For BAC, the LLM correctly identifies the macroeconomic driver and the resulting decrease in the overall provision, though it adds a nuance about 'partially offsetting other increases' that isn't in the ground truth—this is plausible but not confirmed. The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound, correctly distinguishing between AXP’s delinquency-driven release and BAC’s macro-driven release, but the incorrect characterization of AXP’s overall provision trend reduces the correctness score.

      "original_answer": "DIS reported $0.7 billion in non-cash impairment charges in fiscal 2024, which included impairments to content assets due to changes in strategic content curation and asset valuations. In contrast, NFLX did not report specific impairment charges for content assets but instead emphasized a proactive amortization model based on viewing patterns and group-level monetization. This reveals that DIS experienced more direct write-downs of content value during the year, while NFLX manages content valuation risk through accelerated amortization and tax incentive strategies rather than discrete impairment events. The difference highlights DIS's more traditional asset impairment framework versus NFLX's subscription-based, forward-looking amortization approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney reported a non‑cash impairment charge of roughly **$0.7 billion in fiscal 2024 that included write‑downs of its content assets** (the filing notes that the 2024 impairment charges were for “retail assets, content assets, and equity investments”). Netflix’s 2024 Form 10‑K, by contrast, shows **no impairment charge on its content library** – the company states that it did not record any content‑asset impairments for the year.\n\nThe contrast reveals the two firms’ differing valuation philosophies: Disney actively tests individual titles and groups of titles against discounted‑cash‑flow expectations and is willing to write down under‑performing content, reflecting a more granular, rights‑based monetization approach. Netflix treats its library as a single, subscription‑driven asset and, under its accounting policy, does not recognize impairments unless a triggering event occurs, indicating a broader, subscription‑focused valuation that assumes the content will be monetized as a whole.",

These figures match the original answer exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., $0.7 billion = $700 million). (2) The answer is complete: it addresses both companies' impairment charges, explains the difference in accounting treatment, and draws a meaningful contrast in valuation strategies. (3) Entity accuracy is strong—DIS and NFLX are correctly identified, fiscal year 2024 is consistent, and the financial metric (impairment charges) is properly used. (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis: it connects Disney’s impairment testing to its strategic content curation and contrasts it with Netflix’s group-level amortization model based on subscription dynamics. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention NFLX’s 'proactive amortization model based on viewing patterns' or 'tax incentive strategies' from the original, which slightly weakens the depth of the qualitative comparison.

However, the LLM fails to report Oracle's $28 billion in expenses for cloud services and license support operations, incorrectly stating that the information is not available in the provided excerpts. This is a critical omission. (2) The quantitative calculation for Microsoft’s growth is accurate within rounding tolerance, but the failure to include Oracle’s expense figure undermines the comparative analysis required by the question. The ground truth states that Microsoft’s dollar growth exceeds Oracle’s total expenses by $7.8 billion — a key multi-hop comparison that the LLM does not make due to missing Oracle’s data. (3) The reasoning is sound where information is used, but the model fails the multi-hop requirement by not retrieving or acknowledging Oracle’s $28B expense figure, which should have been available in the context per the ground truth. This breaks the synthesis between Microsoft’s growth and Oracle’s expenses.

This long-duration performance obligation contrasts with FDX’s treatment of contract assets, which totaled $623 million net of deferred revenue and are largely short-term in nature, tied to in-transit shipments that convert to cash each quarter due to the immediate delivery requirement for payment entitlement.

Oracle, on the other hand, disclosed that its deferred cloud services revenues are typically recognized ratably or based on customer usage over the contractual periods, which are usually billed in advance. This indicates that Oracle may not immediately recognize the full value of multi-year cloud contracts upfront, unlike Microsoft, which reports recognized cloud revenue growth.

      "question": "Given Walmart International's operation of 5,566 stores globally, including supercenters, and Costco's stated risk of losing market share due to competition from retailers with greater financial resources and technology capabilities, how might Walmart's omni-channel integration and international expansion specifically challenge Costco's ability to maintain its competitive position in global retail markets?",
      "original_answer": "Walmart's operation of 5,566 stores across 18 countries, including formats like supercenters and warehouse clubs, combined with its omni-channel integration (pickup and delivery services in most markets, same-day delivery, and digital platforms like walmart.com.mx and walmart.ca), enhances its global competitive reach. Walmart leverages its global ecosystem and local expertise to offer affordable products and services, while also expanding into digital payments through platforms like PhonePe. This creates a competitive challenge for Costco, which acknowledges the risk of losing market share to retailers with greater financial resources and technology capabilities, such as Walmart. Walmart's broader international footprint, coupled with its investments in digital infrastructure and economies of scale, could allow it to outpace Costco in attracting global customers and members, thereby directly impacting Costco's ability to maintain its competitive position.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart International’s 5,566 stores in 18 countries are tightly linked to a “convenient and seamless omni‑channel experience” that includes same‑day pickup and delivery, marketplace fulfillment and digital‑payment platforms (e.g., PhonePe) 【page_8】.  Because these capabilities let Walmart leverage its massive global supply chain, low‑price EDLP model and technology‑driven services across many markets, they give it the financial and tech resources that Costco’s filing warns could erode its market share when competitors “have greater financial resources and technology capabilities” 【page_14】.  Consequently, Walmart’s worldwide store footprint combined with its integrated online‑offline ecosystem directly pressures Costco’s ability to defend its membership‑warehouse niche and maintain a competitive position in global retail markets.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: Walmart operates 5,566 stores across 18 countries, which matches the original answer. No calculations were required, but the factual numeric content is precise. (2) The LLM correctly identifies Walmart's omni-channel capabilities—same-day pickup and delivery, digital payment platforms like PhonePe—and links them to Walmart's competitive advantages, as stated in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects Walmart's international footprint and technology integration to Costco's disclosed risk (from its filing) of losing market share to competitors with greater financial and technological resources. The citation of 'page_14' for Costco's risk acknowledgment and 'page_8' for Walmart's capabilities suggests proper sourcing from the knowledge base. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses the question by explaining how Walmart’s scale and digital integration challenge Costco’s global position. The only minor shortcoming is a slightly less detailed mention of specific digital platforms (e.g., walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca) compared to the original, but the inclusion of PhonePe and marketplace fulfillment maintains substantial equivalence. Wording differs but semantic meaning and factual content are preserved. Thus, the answer earns a 9/10 for correctness, with full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

      "original_answer": "Microsoft accounts for hardware revenue as a single performance obligation when it is sold together with software licenses that are highly interdependent, recognizing revenue at the point in time when ownership is transferred. In contrast, Oracle reports hardware revenue as a distinct category with a disclosed amount of $3,000 million, suggesting it is treated separately within Oracle’s financial reporting framework. This indicates differing revenue recognition approaches for hardware between the two companies, with Microsoft integrating hardware and software in a single obligation while Oracle accounts for hardware as a standalone offering.",
      "llm_answer": "Microsoft treats a server or other device that must run its operating‑system as a **single performance obligation** with the software license; the hardware and the license are combined and the total consideration is recognized at the point‑in‑time when the product is delivered to the reseller or end‑customer. In contrast, Oracle presents **hardware‑related revenue as its own line‑item/category** (e.g., “hardware” revenue separate from license and cloud services) in its financial statements, rather than bundling it with software. This means Microsoft records the bundled sale as one revenue event, while Oracle reports hardware sales separately from its software and services revenue.",

(1) It correctly states that Microsoft treats hardware and software as a single performance obligation when highly interdependent, recognizing revenue at the point of delivery—this aligns with the original answer. It also accurately contrasts this with Oracle's practice of reporting hardware revenue as a separate line item. (2) There are no numeric inaccuracies; although the LLM does not repeat Oracle's disclosed $3,000 million figure, this omission does not constitute a quantitative error because the question does not explicitly require the specific dollar amount, and the qualitative distinction in reporting categories is preserved. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in revenue recognition policies between Microsoft and Oracle, drawing on their respective financial reporting approaches. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and complete in addressing both parts of the question—how Microsoft accounts for bundled hardware/software and how Oracle differs by separating hardware revenue. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of Oracle’s $3,000 million figure, which slightly reduces completeness but does not affect the overall correctness of the conceptual comparison.

      "original_answer": "Disney's strategic changes in content distribution, such as the reorganization of media and entertainment operations into two segments and the removal of certain content from DTC platforms, have led to impairment charges and uncertainty in the profitability of DTC products. For example, Disney noted that the cost of executing its DTC strategy may continue to grow or be reduced more slowly than anticipated, which could affect content distribution across platforms and the timing of content windows. Meanwhile, Meta's changes to its Feed display algorithms and the promotion of Reels, which monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories, have led to reduced user engagement and financial results. These strategic shifts in both companies reflect different risks: Disney faces risks related to content curation and cost rationalization, while Meta faces risks from product changes that reduce monetization potential and content distribution effectiveness.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Disney (DIS)** – The 2024 10‑K says Disney is “reviewing content, primarily on our DTC services, for alignment with a strategic change in our approach to content curation, resulting in removal of certain content from our platforms and related impairment charges” (p. 22).  By reshaping which movies and series are made available and how they move through the linear‑to‑streaming windows, Disney risks higher acquisition‑ and distribution‑costs, lower subscriber and advertising revenue, and write‑downs of content assets if the new curation does not attract viewers.\n\n- **Meta (META)** – Meta’s filing notes that “from time to time we update our Feed display and ranking algorithms or other product features … these changes have had … the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement … and we also change the size, frequency, or relative prominence of ads … which could reduce the distribution of content of publishers, marketers, and developers” (p. 23).  Such product‑level tweaks to the Feed and ad formats create a risk that third‑party content reaches fewer users, lowering engagement and the advertising revenue that underpins Meta’s results.",

There are no incorrect numbers, dates, or financial figures—this earns a perfect quantitative accuracy score. (2) The answer addresses all parts of the multi-hop question: it identifies strategic changes at both Disney and Meta, links them to risks in content distribution, and provides specific 10-K examples. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly name 'Reels' or directly state that Reels monetizes at a lower rate than Feed and Stories—a detail present in the original answer. However, it captures the essence by noting that product changes reduce user engagement and ad distribution, which implies lower monetization. (3) Entity accuracy is strong: correct companies (DIS, META), correct year (2024 10-K), and correct financial and operational concepts (impairment charges, content curation, algorithm changes). (4) Reasoning is sound and synthesizes risks across both firms, correctly contrasting Disney’s cost and curation risks with Meta’s engagement and monetization risks.

(1) It correctly identifies that ABBV's 2020 effective tax rate was -36% due to business development activities, including tax law changes and restructuring, which generated a large net tax benefit—consistent with the ground truth's mention of a $1.7 billion net tax benefit. While the exact dollar amount ($1.7 billion) is omitted, the qualitative impact (a large, one-time tax benefit leading to a negative tax rate) is correctly conveyed. (2) The quantitative accuracy is high: the -36% tax rate for ABBV in 2020 is correct, and the reference to page 67 supports this. The absence of the $1.7 billion figure is a minor omission but does not invalidate the correctness, as the semantic impact (major tax benefit from business development) is preserved. (3) The contrast with PFE is accurately represented: PFE’s forward-looking guidance on expected benefits from business development is correctly cited from its 2022 filing (page 9), and the non-quantified, prospective nature of the benefits is properly highlighted. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—synthesizing ABBV’s historical tax impact with PFE’s future outlook across different years and filings. The conclusion that ABBV realized a one-time tax advantage while PFE anticipates future benefits is logically and factually sound.

(1) Quantitatively, the discount rates for GE (4.6%) and FDX (3.79%) are accurately reported, and the difference is correctly calculated as 0.81 percentage points (81 bps), which aligns with the ground truth. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the numerical difference and its implication regarding lease financing costs. (3) Entities are correct—GE and FDX (FedEx) are properly identified, and the metric (weighted-average discount rate for operating leases) and year (2024) match the question. (4) The reasoning is sound: the higher discount rate for GE is correctly interpreted as indicating higher financing costs, reflecting greater implied risk or interest costs, which makes lease obligations more expensive—this is a valid qualitative inference consistent with financial principles. The wording differs slightly from the original answer but maintains full semantic equivalence. No errors in multi-hop synthesis: the model correctly compares two companies' lease rates and draws an appropriate conclusion about financing cost implications.",

In contrast, Meta discloses that content costs are part of its cost of revenue, which includes expenses for delivery and distribution of products, but does not specify a dollar amount for content production. Instead, Meta emphasizes revenue recognition tied to advertising impressions and user actions, suggesting that its content-related costs support a platform-based monetization model rather than direct content sales or licensing.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney treats most of its film‑ and TV‑library production and acquisition costs as capitalized assets that are amortized over the expected revenue life of the titles (e.g., $34.4 billion of produced‑and‑licensed content capitalized, with separate amortization schedules for individually‑monetized versus group‑monetized assets). Meta, by contrast, records its video‑ and music‑licensing fees as expense in cost of revenue as soon as the content is made available, noting that the fees are paid based on revenue generated or flat fees and are not capitalized. This contrast shows Disney’s strategy of extracting long‑term, direct‑to‑consumer and licensing value from its content library, while Meta’s strategy is to use content as a short‑term cost of driving ad‑inventory and user engagement.",

(1) Quantitatively, the $34.4 billion capitalized content cost matches the original $34,409 million (rounded), and the distinction between released and unreleased content is implied through the concept of amortization, though the specific breakdown of $18,189M and $2,281M is not mentioned—this is a minor omission. (2) The LLM correctly identifies Disney's capitalization and amortization of content costs versus Meta's expensing of content costs within cost of revenue, which reflects accurate multi-hop reasoning across both companies' 2024 disclosures. (3) Entity accuracy is strong: Disney and Meta are correctly identified, fiscal year-end (implied 2024) is consistent, and financial terms like 'cost of revenue', 'capitalized', and 'amortized' are used appropriately. (4) The reasoning correctly infers that Disney's strategy centers on long-term monetization (via DTC and licensing) from owned content, while Meta uses content to drive engagement and ad revenue, which is semantically equivalent to the ground truth's 'platform-based monetization model'. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit mention of Meta's lack of disclosed dollar amounts for content costs, but the answer still correctly conveys that Meta does not capitalize such costs and treats them as expenses. Overall, the answer is factually sound, contextually relevant, and demonstrates strong qualitative and quantitative accuracy.",

The individual increases are accurate: $39.211B - $32.218B = $6.993B (~$6.99B reported), and $287.597B - $257.141B = $30.456B (~$30.46B reported). The combined increase is $6.993B + $30.456B = $37.449B, which rounds to $37.4B as stated. The ground truth states $37.5B, which is a minor rounding difference—likely due to internal precision not reflected in the final reporting. This does not constitute a material error. (2) All numeric values are correct to within acceptable rounding. Calculations are accurate and clearly shown. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly pulled revenue figures for two companies across two years, computed year-over-year increases, and summed them—exactly what the question required. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only a negligible difference in rounding ($37.4B vs $37.5B). All entities (TMO, UNH, consolidated revenues, 2020–2021) are correctly identified and used.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies, particularly in McDonald's Net P&E and the resulting combined total. The ground truth reports MCD's Net P&E as $24.7206 billion, but the LLM reports $24.241 billion, a difference of ~$480 million. This leads to an incorrect combined Net P&E of $49.440 billion instead of the correct $49.9196 billion. Additionally, the LLM uses HD's total assets as $71.9 billion and MCD's as $53.8 billion, which may be approximations, but the percentage calculations are affected. (2) HD's Net P&E is correctly reported as $25.199 billion (or $25,199 million), matching the ground truth. However, MCD's Net P&E is incorrect: the correct value is $24.7206 billion, not $24.241 billion. The LLM likely used outdated or incorrect data from Dec 31, 2021, while the question asks for fiscal year 2022. McDonald’s fiscal year ends Dec 31, so FY2022 data should be used, not FY2021. The combined total is therefore miscalculated: $25.199B + $24.7206B = $49.9196B vs. LLM's $49.440B. Percentages are approximately close—35% for HD is acceptable (actual 35.06%), but MCD's 45% is slightly off from 45.90%, likely due to incorrect base values. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound: the model identifies both companies, extracts Net P&E, computes the sum, and compares each to total assets. However, it fails in data retrieval for MCD's FY2022 figures, undermining the synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses all parts of the question with appropriate structure and terminology. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct logic and entity identification but penalized for using incorrect fiscal year data for MCD. Quantitative accuracy is low due to material errors in key financial figures and the final sum.

Similarly, FedEx Corporation (FDX) also records GILTI taxes as a period cost, aligning with EMR in terms of immediate recognition of foreign intangible income taxes. This shared treatment reveals a consistent industry approach under the Industrials sector to account for GILTI without relying on deferred tax mechanisms, thereby increasing transparency and aligning with U.S. tax reform expectations post-CARES Act. The immediate expensing of GILTI by both companies results in a direct impact on their annual effective tax rates, with EMR showing volatility due to restructuring benefits and FDX emphasizing future taxable income projections to support deferred tax asset recoverability.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies record the tax on global‑intangible‑low‑taxed income (GILTI) as a current‑period expense rather than deferring it as a temporary difference. At Emerson, the “Foreign‑derived intangible income” line in the income‑tax table (page 69) and the statement that it “has elected to recognize the tax on … GILTI … as a period expense” cause a higher income‑tax expense and a lower effective tax rate for the year, while FedEx’s note on deferred tax assets (page 88) makes the same election, so its tax expense also rises in the period and no deferred GILTI liability is carried forward. The parallel treatment shows that each firm prefers to recognise the foreign‑earnings tax cost immediately, reflecting a conservative, cash‑flow‑oriented approach to managing tax liabilities on low‑taxed overseas income.",

(2) The LLM correctly identifies the accounting treatment for both companies and references specific disclosures (e.g., 'page 69' for EMR, 'page 88' for FDX), which supports its claims, though these page numbers are not in the ground truth and cannot be independently verified from the provided data—this does not detract from factual correctness but introduces minor uncertainty. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that both firms recognize GILTI taxes in the current period, avoid deferral, and thus increase current tax expense—this reflects proper multi-hop understanding across two companies. The conclusion about a 'conservative, cash-flow-oriented approach' is a reasonable interpretation, though slightly more interpretive than the original, which focuses on transparency and alignment with U.S. tax reform.

MS, on the other hand, faces risk related to performance-based fees in the form of unrealized carried interest, which could reverse if fund returns fall below performance targets.

More critically, the LLM claims GE’s equity-method investment increased by $588 million ($4,451M - $3,863M), but this is inconsistent with the ground truth difference of $2,783M, suggesting either the input data or the calculation logic is flawed. If the GE increase were correct, then FedEx’s absolute loss would need to be $3,371M ($2,783M + $588M), which contradicts the $1,080M stated.

The LLM attributes Disney's costs to 'International Theme Parks' ($4.7B) and 'produced-and-licensed-content' ($24.5B), summing to $29.2B — however, this breakdown does not align with the ground truth data, which implies Disney’s total Costs and Expenses must be significantly lower (approximately $5.27B if META’s is $95.097B to reach $100.367B total).

The numbers are accurate and match the ground truth, with acceptable format variation ($2.628 billion = $2,628 million). UnitedHealth Group's 2021 dividend payout is correctly reported as $8.0 billion. (2) The calculation of the decrease ($2,628M - $2,537M = $91M) is accurate. The comparison between UnitedHealth’s $8.0B dividend and Thermo Fisher’s $2,537M obligations is correctly interpreted in magnitude. The claim that the dividend is 'about $5.5 billion larger' is approximately correct ($8,000M - $2,537M = $5,463M), and stating it is 'about three times the size' is a reasonable approximation (8,000 / 2,537 ≈ 3.15). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies (Thermo Fisher and UnitedHealth), two time points (2020 to 2021), and two financial metrics (short-term obligations and dividend payout), then makes a valid comparative analysis. (4) The only minor issue is the use of 'about three times' instead of a more precise 'over three times' or 'approximately 3.15 times', but this is acceptable for qualitative comparison. All entities, years, and metrics are correctly identified. Thus, the answer is factually correct, complete, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high score with only a slight deduction in qualitative accuracy for the approximate phrasing of the ratio.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors. It incorrectly states that Tesla's Services and Other revenue is $8,319 million and GM's is $5,157 million, then claims Tesla exceeds GM by $3.2 billion. However, the ground truth states that GM's revenue is $5,157 million and Tesla's is $8,319 million — but the question asks how much larger GM's revenue is than Tesla's, which contradicts the actual numbers. In reality, Tesla's $8,319M is larger than GM's $5,157M, so GM is not larger at all. The correct difference is Tesla is $3,162 million (≈$3.16B) larger than GM, not the other way around. The LLM flips the comparison, saying 'GM’s absolute... revenue remains... $3 billion smaller' — this is backwards. (2) While the individual numbers ($8,319M for Tesla, $5,157M for GM) are factually correct and the 37% growth is accurate, the calculation of the difference is misapplied in context: $8,319M - $5,157M = $3,162M (correct math), but the LLM incorrectly interprets this as Tesla being larger, while the original answer and question imply GM is larger — which is false. The original answer actually contains a clear contradiction: it says Tesla has $8,319M and GM has $5,157M, then claims GM is larger by $3,371M — which is mathematically impossible. This suggests the original answer has a critical error. However, the LLM answer attempts to follow the logic but ends up contradicting itself: it computes the difference correctly but then says 'GM’s... revenue remains... smaller', which aligns with the numbers but contradicts the original answer’s claim. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM misinterprets the comparative direction. It correctly pulls Tesla's 37% growth and revenue, and GM's revenue, but draws the opposite conclusion about relative size. The question asks 'how much larger is GM's... than Tesla’s', implying GM is larger — but the provided data shows Tesla is larger. This creates a conflict between the numbers and the framing. The LLM should have flagged this inconsistency. (4) Due to the fundamental reversal in the comparison and the propagation of a logically inconsistent conclusion (saying GM is larger when it is not), the correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is partially correct (numbers right, but interpretation wrong), qualitative reasoning is flawed, and contextual relevance is moderate since it addresses the right metrics and companies but draws incorrect implications.",

UNH's total operating lease liability was $4,273 million after subtracting $609 million in imputed interest from total lease payments of $4,882 million.

The LLM uses $5,157 million for GM and $8,319 million for Tesla, but these values do not align with the ground truth data. Tesla's 'Services and other' revenue should be significantly lower than $8,319 million (likely around $3,181 million, given the correct sum), indicating a major data error. However, the percentage increase in Tesla's cost (33%) is correctly reported. (2) The calculation of the percentage increase is accurate: from $5,880M to $7,830M is indeed a ~33% increase ((7,830 - 5,880) / 5,880 ≈ 0.3316). However, the combined revenue sum is wrong due to incorrect input values.

In contrast, Target explicitly states it offers a starting wage of at least $15 per hour for U.S. hourly team members as part of a broader compensation package that includes benefits like healthcare, retirement plans, and education assistance. While Costco's strategy led to measurable SG&A optimization, Target emphasizes a comprehensive benefits-driven labor investment approach alongside its minimum wage floor.",

The ground truth states that Costco's wage increases led to a 17 basis point *decrease* in SG&A as a percentage of net sales due to leveraging sales growth. However, the LLM claims an 8.88% to 9.65% drop, which is a 77-basis-point decline, and attributes it directly to wage increases being 'absorbed'—this contradicts the ground truth both in magnitude and causal interpretation. The actual SG&A improvement was much smaller (17 bps), not 77 bps. Additionally, the LLM fabricates specific dates (March 14, July 4) for wage hikes not present in the original answer. (2) The calculation of a 77-basis-point decline is mathematically correct (9.65% - 8.88% = 0.77%), but the numbers themselves are factually wrong—no support in the ground truth for SG&A being 9.65% in 2021 or 8.88% in 2022. The original answer does not provide absolute SG&A percentages, only the 17 bps improvement. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly infers that strong sales helped absorb wage costs, aligning with the 'leveraging' concept in the ground truth. It also correctly identifies that Target’s $15/hour policy is part of a broader benefits package and that Target does not highlight SG&A optimization from this policy. However, it misrepresents Costco’s outcome by overstating the SG&A improvement and implying a direct cost efficiency from wages, whereas the ground truth emphasizes that higher labor investment coincided with efficiency gains from sales leverage. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both companies, the wage policies, financial impact on SG&A, and comparative labor strategy. But due to major numerical errors and misrepresentation of the magnitude of financial impact, the correctness score is low. The model fails the core multi-hop requirement of accurately synthesizing the true financial effect (17 bps, not 77 bps) despite correct entity identification and reasonable structure.",

      "original_answer": "The Walt Disney Company lists advertising revenues as a significant service revenue stream, indicating its importance to overall income. Alphabet highlights that shifts toward mobile and newer advertising formats have generally lower margins compared to traditional desktop search, and that changes in device mix, geographic reach, and AI-driven user behavior are affecting monetization trends. These dynamics suggest that while both companies benefit from advertising revenues, Alphabet faces margin pressures due to format and device shifts, which could constrain profitability growth. For Disney, if it relies heavily on traditional advertising formats, it may face challenges adapting to these same evolving dynamics, potentially limiting revenue growth unless it successfully transitions to newer, more competitive formats.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney treats advertising as a core service‑revenue line and recognises it when impressions are delivered, with advertising expense falling from $7.2 billion in 2022 to $6.1 billion in 2024. Because its ad spend is already trending lower, any further shifts in format or audience‑device mix that reduce advertisers’ willingness to pay could curb growth, but the decline in expense may help preserve or even improve Disney’s advertising margin if revenue holds steady.  \n\nAlphabet, by contrast, notes that the move toward mobile, video and AI‑driven ad formats and a changing device mix is expanding overall ad volume but “generally… lower than the margins on our advertising revenues” (e.g., lower CPC/CPI and higher partner‑share (“TAC”) rates). Thus, while Google’s ad revenues are likely to keep growing, the evolving formats and device landscape are expected to compress its advertising margins relative to the higher‑margin, more traditional search‑based inventory.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in quantitative data. The claim that Disney's advertising expense fell from $7.2 billion in 2022 to $6.1 billion in 2024 is not supported by the ground truth and introduces specific figures not present in the original answer. The original answer does not mention any advertising expenses or dollar amounts for Disney, so these numbers are fabricated. This severely undermines quantitative accuracy. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies that Alphabet notes lower margins due to shifts toward mobile and new ad formats (e.g., lower CPC/CPI, higher TAC), it adds specific terminology like 'CPC/CPI' and 'TAC' not present in the original, which, while plausible, go beyond the provided information. The core qualitative point—that evolving formats compress Alphabet’s margins—is consistent with the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is logically sound and synthesizes multi-hop information appropriately: it contrasts Disney’s potential margin resilience due to declining ad spend with Alphabet’s margin pressure from format shifts. It correctly infers different implications for profitability versus revenue growth for both companies, aligning with the original’s emphasis on margin pressures for Alphabet and adaptation challenges for Disney. (4) Contextually, the answer is highly relevant, addressing how evolving advertising dynamics impact growth and profitability for both firms. However, the introduction of unverified financial figures for Disney severely compromises factual correctness, warranting a moderate overall score. Semantic equivalence is partially achieved in reasoning but broken by the inclusion of false quantitative data.",

      "original_answer": "The combined carrying amount of foreign currency-denominated notes designated as net investment hedges by AbbVie and Eli Lilly as of December 31, 2024, is $8.44 billion ($3.1 billion from AbbVie and $5.34 billion from Eli Lilly). Both companies report foreign currency translation gains or losses related to these designated notes in accumulated other comprehensive loss, which reduces earnings volatility caused by foreign exchange fluctuations.",
      "llm_answer": "The two companies together have roughly **$5.68 billion** of foreign‑currency‑denominated notes that are designated as net‑investment hedges (AbbVie $5.34 billion + Eli Lilly ≈ $0.34 billion).  \n\nBecause the notes are designated as net‑investment hedges, any foreign‑currency translation gains or losses that arise from changes in the spot exchange rate are **recorded in accumulated other‑comprehensive income (loss)** rather than flowing through the income statement.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative values. It reports a combined carrying amount of $5.68 billion, incorrectly assigning $5.34 billion to AbbVie and $0.34 billion to Eli Lilly, whereas the ground truth states $3.1 billion for AbbVie and $5.34 billion for Eli Lilly, resulting in a correct total of $8.44 billion. The LLM reversed the amounts between the two companies and computed an incorrect sum. (2) The calculation is therefore flawed: $5.34B + $0.34B = $5.68B is mathematically correct but based on incorrect input data, making the total substantially off from the true value of $8.44B. (3) The qualitative reasoning about the accounting treatment is accurate—both companies do report foreign currency translation gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss (or income), which aligns with hedge accounting under ASC 815 for net investment hedges. This part of the multi-hop synthesis is correct and shows understanding of the financial reporting impact. (4) Contextually, the answer addresses both parts of the question—total amount and accounting effect—and uses appropriate terminology, so relevance is high. However, due to the major error in numeric values and misattribution between companies, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.

      "original_answer": "GM's high fixed cost structure means that small changes in vehicle sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on profitability, making them highly exposed to market fluctuations. In contrast, Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments, which commenced between 2024 and 2025 with lease terms up to 20 years, provide a more stable and predictable revenue stream, reducing their short-term exposure to sales volatility. This contrast in financial structures means that GM faces greater financial risk during periods of declining sales, while Tesla's leasing model offers a buffer against immediate market fluctuations through long-term contractual revenue.",
      "llm_answer": "GM’s 2023 filing notes that “our high proportion of fixed costs… may further exacerbate the risks associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicles” and that “because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability”【page_17】【page_19】. In contrast, Tesla reports $1.53 billion of operating‑lease commitments that will generate lease payments over the next 2‑20 years, creating a stream of predictable revenue that is largely independent of vehicle‑sale fluctuations【page_80】. Therefore, GM remains highly vulnerable to market swings in vehicle sales, while Tesla’s lease‑based model dampens its exposure to such volatility.",

(1) All key facts are correct: GM's high fixed cost structure and its impact on profitability volatility are accurately quoted from the 2023 filing, and Tesla's $1.53 billion in operating lease commitments are correctly stated. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the dollar amount ($1.53 billion) matches the original, and no calculations are required beyond correct interpretation. Format is consistent and precise. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information from both GM and Tesla filings, contrasting their financial structures and logically concluding that GM is more exposed to sales volatility while Tesla’s lease model provides stability. The only minor omission is that the original answer specifies the lease commitments commenced between 2024 and 2025 with terms up to 20 years, while the LLM mentions '2-20 years'—slightly less precise on start timing but still captures the long-term nature. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent: the response directly addresses the question about exposure to market fluctuations and clearly explains the implications of each company's financial structure.

      "original_answer": "Costco did not recognize any impairment charges in 2022, indicating that the carrying value of its long-lived assets remained recoverable based on estimated future undiscounted cash flows and fair value assessments using market appraisals. In contrast, Target recognized $87 million in impairment charges in 2021, showing that for certain asset groups, the carrying value exceeded the fair value estimated through similar market appraisal methods. This divergence highlights that while both companies use market appraisals to estimate fair value, the outcomes of their impairment evaluations differ significantly based on the specific performance and expectations of individual assets.",

The entities (Costco, Target), financial metric (impairment charges), and years (2022 for Costco, 2021 for Target) are accurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $87 million figure for Target in 2021 is correctly cited, and the absence of charges for Costco in 2022 is accurately reported. Format variations are acceptable and consistent with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—both companies use market appraisals for fair value estimation, yet reach different outcomes. The LLM correctly infers that the divergence stems from differing conclusions about whether fair value exceeded or was below carrying value, which aligns with the ground truth’s emphasis on asset performance and expectations. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer notes the 2021 charge for Target while implicitly contrasting it with 2022 evaluations; the LLM could have clarified that Target’s charge was in 2021, not 2022, to strengthen the temporal comparison, but this is not incorrect. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing the question about differing outcomes despite similar methodologies.

      "original_answer": "AVGO provides direct disclosure about market for common equity, related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in Item 5 of its 10-K filing, while IBM takes an incorporation-by-reference approach, directing readers to its Proxy Statement for information about security ownership and stockholder matters. This difference in disclosure approaches suggests AVGO offers more immediate transparency about shareholder rights and equity compensation plans within its core 10-K filing, whereas IBM requires stakeholders to reference additional materials for complete information.",
      "llm_answer": "AVGO’s Item 5 actually spells out the makeup of its equity‑based compensation – the filing lists each plan (options, RSUs, PSUs, etc.), the number of shares that could be issued, and the weighted‑average exercise prices (see the detailed table on page 27). In contrast, IBM’s Item 5 does not repeat that information; it simply points readers to its 2021 Annual Report and provides a brief summary of share‑repurchase figures and the number of stockholders, leaving the full equity‑plan details to be found by reference (pages 24‑26). Therefore, AVGO’s disclosure is far more granular and transparent about shareholder rights and equity‑compensation arrangements, whereas IBM relies on incorporation‑by‑reference, offering less immediate detail.",

This matches the original answer’s core claim about AVGO offering greater immediate transparency. (2) There are no numeric inaccuracies—though specific numbers (e.g., share counts, prices) are mentioned contextually, they are not quantitatively central to the comparison, and the reference to 'page 27' for AVGO and 'pages 24–26' for IBM is consistent with typical filing structures.

      "question": "How do the advertising revenue mechanisms of DIS and GOOGL differ, particularly in terms of content delivery platforms and associated revenue generation strategies?",
      "original_answer": "DIS generates advertising revenues primarily through sports content delivery via its ESPN networks and related programming, including live sports events such as the NFL, NBA, and MLB, as well as licensing the ESPN BET trademark to PENN Entertainment. These revenues are tied to traditional television broadcasting and promotional services. In contrast, GOOGL generates advertising revenues predominantly through digital platforms such as Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network properties, leveraging both performance and brand advertising models. Revenues are recognized either when a user engages with performance ads or when brand ads are displayed. This highlights a fundamental difference in advertising revenue mechanisms: DIS relies on live and broadcasted sports content on TV networks, while GOOGL monetizes digital advertising inventory across a range of online platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "Google’s advertising model is built around online properties that it both owns and distributes through third‑party sites.  As the 10‑K explains, Alphabet “generates advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on Google Search and other Google‑owned properties (Gmail, Maps, Play, etc.), YouTube properties, and Google Network properties” and sells that inventory through platforms such as Google Ads, Google Ad Manager and Display & Video 360.  Revenue is recognized either on a performance basis (when a user clicks or otherwise engages) or on a brand‑impression basis (when the ad is shown) and, for network‑partner ads, Alphabet may act as principal (gross reporting) or agent (net reporting) 【page_58】.  \n\nDisney’s advertising revenue, by contrast, is tied to linear‑TV and direct‑to‑consumer streaming channels.  The filing notes that “advertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct‑to‑Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels,” and that the Sports segment “earns advertising … revenues from providing promotional services and licensing” its ESPN‑BET trademark 【page_9】【page_10】.  Disney therefore sells commercial time on its broadcast/cable networks (e.g., ESPN, Disney‑ABC) and on its streaming services (e.g., ESPN+, Disney+ bundles), with pricing driven by audience ratings, subscription bundles and sponsorship arrangements rather than per‑click or per‑impression metrics.  \n\nIn short, Google monetizes digital search, video and third‑party web inventory through programmatic, click‑ or view‑based pricing, while Disney monetizes advertising on television and streaming platforms through traditional ad‑time sales, sponsorships and seasonally‑adjusted rates linked to viewership.",

      "original_answer": "The availability of financing directly affects both Emerson Electric's (EMR) ability to innovate in decarbonization technologies and FedEx's (FDX) capital investment plans. EMR notes that the adoption of new technologies like battery storage and hydrogen use cases will depend in part on the availability of financing for such projects. This implies that if financing becomes constrained or more expensive, EMR may struggle to develop or deploy these technologies, which are critical to responding to market trends like decarbonization. Similarly, FDX emphasizes that the amount and timing of its capital investments — which include aircraft, vehicles, and technology — depend on the availability of satisfactory financing. For example, FDX had $4.1 billion available under its 2022 repurchase program and issued $970 million in Pass-Through Certificates to fund corporate purposes. If financing availability tightens, FDX may delay or reduce investments in fleet expansion or technology upgrades. Thus, a decline in financing availability would create a dual impact: slowing EMR’s innovation in climate-related technologies and constraining FDX’s capital expenditures, both of which are essential to their strategic positioning in capital- and technology-intensive industries.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns closely with the ground truth. (1) All key facts are correct: Emerson Electric (EMR) links its decarbonization innovation to financing availability, citing specific risks from loss of capital-market access (EMR 10-K pp. 12, 14), and FedEx (FDX) ties its capital investment plans to financing conditions, noting its capital-intensive nature and reliance on financing for a $6.8 billion cap-ex program (FDX 10-K pp. 62–66). The LLM correctly references EMR’s and FDX’s respective dependencies on financing without misrepresenting the context. (2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent: the $6.8 billion cap-ex figure is correctly cited (matches ground truth implication, though ground truth does not explicitly state this number, it is consistent with FDX’s disclosed investments). The LLM does not misstate any dollar amounts (e.g., does not incorrectly include the $4.1B repurchase program or $970M Pass-Through Certificates as cap-ex funding sources, but still accurately captures FDX’s financing reliance). These omissions do not detract from correctness, as the core cap-ex figure and financing dependency are properly conveyed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes EMR’s innovation constraints and FDX’s investment timing under financing pressures across two companies and filings, correctly identifying the strategic implications for both. (4) Semantic equivalence is strong—while the LLM adds specific page citations and slightly more detailed phrasing, the meaning fully matches the original answer. The only minor limitation is the absence of explicit mention of FDX’s $4.1B repurchase program and $970M issuance, which are part of the ground truth context but not essential to the core argument. Thus, the answer earns a 9 for correctness and qualitative accuracy due to near-perfect synthesis and factual precision, with full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance.",

According to the ground truth, BKNG received $107 million in dividends in 2023 and $3,087 million in 2022. However, the LLM incorrectly reports Booking.com's dividend income as $1.020 billion (i.e., $1,020 million) in 2023 and $0.219 billion ($219 million) in 2022. These figures are both quantitatively and directionally wrong—especially the 2022 figure, which is off by over $2.8 billion. Additionally, the LLM conflates 'interest and dividend income' with 'dividends from subsidiaries,' which is not equivalent and introduces metric inaccuracy. (2) Calculations are therefore incorrect: LLM reports a combined total of $2.82 billion in 2023 (BKNG $1.02B + GM $1.8B), but correct total is $1.907 billion ($0.107B + $1.8B). For 2022, LLM reports $1.92 billion ($0.219B + $1.7B), but correct total is $4.787 billion ($3.087B + $1.7B). The LLM concludes there was an increase of $0.9 billion, while the ground truth shows a decrease of $2.88 billion—a complete reversal due to erroneous inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—LLM attempts to aggregate across companies and years—but fails due to incorrect data sourcing and misinterpretation of financial line items. It uses 'interest and dividend income' instead of isolating subsidiary dividends, breaking the chain of accurate synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, years, and intent of comparison. However, factual and quantitative errors severely undermine correctness. Minor note: 'Booking.com' is used instead of 'BKNG,' though this is semantically acceptable. Overall, major errors in core financial data and resulting calculations justify a low correctness score despite structurally addressing the question.",

The cash used in investing activities for EMR ($5.3 billion) and FDX ($6.8 billion) match the ground truth values of $5,334 million and $6,816 million when rounded to one decimal place in billions. The combined total is correctly reported as approximately $12.2 billion, which aligns with the exact sum of $12,150 million. (2) Minor rounding is acceptable: $5.3 billion = $5,300 million (vs. $5,334M) and $6.8 billion = $6,800 million (vs. $6,816M) are standard approximations. The $12.2 billion total is a reasonable rounding of $12,150 million. The LLM correctly identifies EMR’s $5.7 billion in business purchases (vs. $5,702 million) and FDX’s $6.8 billion in capex (vs. $6,763 million), again within acceptable rounding. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (EMR and FDX) for the same year (2022), computes the total, and contrasts their capital allocation strategies—acquisitions for EMR vs. capital expenditures for FDX—based on component-level details. (4) The qualitative analysis accurately reflects the strategic implications: EMR’s focus on acquisitions and FDX’s on internal asset investment are correctly inferred. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the precise offsetting items like 'net of cash acquired' mentioned in the ground truth, but the inclusion of divestitures and interest proceeds adds detail not strictly required.

      "original_answer": "Intel has historically faced significant delays in achieving expected manufacturing yields for its 10nm and 7nm process technologies, which led to missed customer product design windows, increased product costs, and allowed competitors like TSMC-based firms to gain a competitive edge in performance and energy efficiency. These yield issues have directly impacted Intel’s gross margin due to higher per-unit costs and underutilized capacity. NVIDIA, on the other hand, faces risks from its reliance on third-party foundries, where failure to achieve high manufacturing yields—either due to issues in product design or the foundry's proprietary process technology—can similarly increase costs and reduce product availability. Both companies face shared implications: lower manufacturing yields lead to higher product costs, reduced gross margins, and potential loss of market share due to delayed or uncompetitive product offerings.",

However, the LLM reports $13.3 billion, which is over three times the correct amount. This figure appears to include accrued dividends, but the original question and ground truth specify 'redemption value... based on liquidation preference alone,' so including dividends is incorrect. (2) The calculation is therefore fundamentally flawed. There is no support in the ground truth for a $13.3B figure, and the LLM provides no breakdown to verify its math. (3) On qualitative aspects, the LLM correctly identifies that both GS and Visa preferred stocks have priority over common stock in liquidation, satisfying part of the comparison. It also correctly notes that Visa’s filing describes a preference in asset distribution but does not specify a dollar amount—this is accurate and relevant.

      "original_answer": "ABBV experienced a lower effective tax rate in 2024, partially due to acquisition costs related to business development activities, indicating that strategic acquisitions influenced its tax position. Meanwhile, LLY spent $3.35 billion on IPR&D (primarily related to the acquisition of Morphic) and $947.7 million on a manufacturing site in Wisconsin, showing a significant allocation of capital toward innovation and manufacturing expansion. Comparing the two, ABBV's business development activities influenced its tax efficiency, while LLY's spending reflects a focus on expanding R&D capabilities and production infrastructure, suggesting different strategic emphases despite both engaging in business development activities.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s 2024 filing shows that acquisition‑related items added only modest amounts to its tax picture – a $13.4 million “acquisition‑costs” line in the tax‑expense reconciliation and an $82 million increase in tax positions tied to acquisitions (see pages 96 and 98). In contrast, Eli Lilly disclosed that it spent roughly $3.35 billion on acquired in‑process R&D and $947.7 million on a manufacturing‑site purchase in 2024 (page 51). The disparity indicates that Lilly is pursuing a far more aggressive growth strategy through large‑scale acquisitions, while AbbVie’s business‑development focus is comparatively modest, relying more on organic growth and smaller‑scale deals.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer includes accurate dollar amounts for LLY's spending ($3.35 billion on IPR&D and $947.7 million on a manufacturing site), which match the ground truth. However, the ABBV tax-related figures ($13.4 million and $82 million) are not present in the original answer and appear to be from the actual 10-K but were not part of the ground truth knowledge graph response. Since the evaluation is based on matching the ground truth (not external data), these specific numbers introduce factual divergence. (2) Quantitatively, the LLY figures are correct and properly formatted; the ABBV numbers, while potentially accurate in reality, are not in the original answer and thus represent a mismatch in the evaluation context. There are no calculation errors, but the comparison hinges on data not referenced in the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is partially flawed: the original answer emphasizes that ABBV’s tax rate was lowered due to acquisition costs (without specifying dollar amounts), indicating strategic use of acquisitions for tax efficiency, while LLY focuses on capital allocation to R&D and manufacturing. The LLM instead infers that ABBV has a 'modest' business development strategy based on small tax impacts, which misinterprets tax disclosures as proxies for deal size. This reflects a logical error—acquisition-related tax effects being small does not imply small deals; it may reflect jurisdictional or structuring differences. The multi-hop synthesis fails to align with the intended strategic comparison: tax impact vs. capital deployment. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both companies and their 2024 activities, but the qualitative misinterpretation of ABBV’s strategy based on tax line items reduces accuracy. The conclusion that LLY is more aggressive is plausible but not directly supported by the ground truth, which frames the contrast as different strategic emphases (tax efficiency vs. innovation/expansion), not magnitude of spending. Thus, correctness is partially compromised despite numerical precision on LLY.",

      "original_answer": "Costco's merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales increased from 89.2% in 2021 to 89.5% in 2022, contributing to a decline in its gross margin percentage from 11.13% to 10.48%. In contrast, Target reported that higher merchandise costs were a factor negatively impacting its gross margin percentage in 2021, even though it maintained a much higher gross margin at 28.3%. This shows that while both companies faced pressure from merchandise cost increases, Costco experienced a direct decline in gross margin percentage, whereas Target was able to offset some of the cost pressures through other factors like digital fulfillment efficiencies and favorable category mix.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco’s merchandise costs rose from 170,684 million on 192,052 million net sales in 2021 (≈ 88.9 % of net sales) to 199,382 million on 222,730 million net sales in 2022 (≈ 89.5 % of net sales), a **increase of about 0.6 percentage point** (≈ 60 basis points).  \n\nIn contrast, Target’s gross‑margin rate for 2021 was **28.3 %**, a level that was noted as being negatively affected by higher merchandise costs.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies that Costco's merchandise costs as a percentage of net sales increased from approximately 88.9% in 2021 to 89.5% in 2022, resulting in a 0.6 percentage point increase. However, the ground truth states the 2021 figure was 89.2%, not 88.9%, which introduces a minor but notable error in the baseline percentage. The LLM’s calculation of 170,684 / 192,052 ≈ 88.9% is mathematically correct based on the input numbers, but those input numbers (while plausible) do not align with the ground truth data from the knowledge graph, which underpins the original answer. The 2022 figure of 89.5% matches the ground truth and is correctly calculated from the provided inputs. (2) The LLM correctly reports Target’s 2021 gross margin percentage as 28.3%, which matches the ground truth. However, it does not fully explain the contrast in trends—specifically, that Target maintained a high gross margin despite cost pressures due to offsetting factors like digital fulfillment and category mix—information present in the original answer. This limits the depth of the comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model connects Costco’s cost trend and Target’s margin correctly across entities and years, but the use of slightly inaccurate base figures for Costco undermines quantitative precision. (4) The correctness score is 7 because core facts (direction of trend, 2022 percentage, Target’s margin) are accurate, but the incorrect 2021 percentage and missing explanatory contrast reduce full accuracy. Quantitative accuracy is 7 due to the discrepancy in the 2021 percentage derivation. Qualitative accuracy is 8 because reasoning is logical and entities/years are correct. Contextual relevance is 10 as all parts of the question are addressed with relevant data.",

      "question": "What is the approximate range of future content licensing obligations Netflix expects to incur over the next three years, and how does this compare to Comcast's Studios segment's typical future revenue visibility from existing licensing agreements, which is expressed as a time-based portion of annual revenue?",
      "original_answer": "Netflix expects to incur between $1 billion and $4 billion in future content licensing obligations over the next three years, primarily after the first twelve months. This compares to Comcast's Studios segment, which typically has future revenue visibility from existing licensing agreements equal to approximately one-half year to one year of annual Studios content licensing revenue. Thus, while Netflix's obligations are forward-looking and not yet fixed, they represent a significant multi-year financial commitment that is expected to be recognized over time, similar to Comcast’s revenue recognition pattern from licensing content over a 1–2 year horizon.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix says that the unknown‑future‑title licensing commitments it expects to incur over the next three years are roughly **$1 billion to $4 billion**. In contrast, Comcast’s Studios segment notes that the future revenue it can see from existing licensing contracts is **about one‑half to one year of the segment’s annual content‑licensing revenue**, rather than a dollar‑amount range.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies Netflix's future content licensing obligations as $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, matching the ground truth in both range and time frame. It also accurately states that Comcast’s Studios segment has future revenue visibility from existing licensing agreements equal to about one-half to one year of annual content-licensing revenue. These figures are semantically equivalent to the original answer, with no factual discrepancies. (2) All numeric values are correct: the $1B–$4B range for Netflix and the 0.5–1 year revenue visibility for Comcast are precisely reported. No calculations are required, and the dollar amounts and time-based portions align with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different companies (Netflix and Comcast) and two different financial perspectives (obligations vs. revenue visibility) is correctly synthesized and contrasted. The LLM captures the key comparison: Netflix’s forward-looking obligations versus Comcast’s revenue visibility, both framed over multi-year horizons. (4) The only minor limitation is that the LLM omits a brief contextual note present in the original about these obligations being 'primarily after the first twelve months' and the similarity in recognition timing (Netflix’s expense vs. Comcast’s revenue over 1–2 years). While this adds nuance, it does not affect the core factual accuracy. Thus, the answer is highly accurate, complete, and contextually appropriate, warranting a 9/10 for correctness and qualitative accuracy, with full marks for quantitative and contextual performance.",

According to the ground truth, Eli Lilly's net acquired IPR&D is $897.7 million and AbbVie's is $1.3 billion. However, the LLM incorrectly reports AbbVie as $898 million and Eli Lilly as $1.2 billion — swapping and misstating both figures.

The correct sum is $897.7 million + $1,300 million = $2,197.7 million ($2.1977 billion), which should be reported as approximately $2.2 billion. The LLM’s final total is off by nearly $100 million. (3) While the multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to retrieve data from both 10-Ks and sum them — the entity-to-value mapping is reversed and numerically inaccurate, indicating a failure in correct data retrieval or synthesis.

      "original_answer": "LOW's Sales Return Reserve decreased from $234 million in 2022 to $191 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction in its estimated obligation for customer returns. Tesla, on the other hand, recognizes a Sales Return Reserve based on historical experience and expected future market values when offering resale value guarantees, indicating a proactive financial obligation tied to vehicle buyback programs. This reveals that while both companies account for potential returns, Tesla's reserve is tied to structured buyback guarantees, whereas LOW's reflects a declining historical trend.",
      "llm_answer": "Lowe’s balance sheet shows a $234 million sales‑return reserve at year‑end 2023 (down from the prior‑year level, indicating a reduction in the amount set aside for expected customer returns). In contrast, Tesla’s 10‑K states that the liability for its resale‑value‑guarantee program was “immaterial” as of December 31, 2023, meaning it does not record a material reserve for those returns. Thus, Lowe’s retains a sizable, measurable obligation for product returns, whereas Tesla’s exposure to return‑related payments is essentially negligible.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors. It states that Lowe’s had a $234 million sales-return reserve at year-end 2023, but the ground truth indicates that the reserve decreased from $234 million in 2022 to $191 million in 2023. Thus, the LLM incorrectly assigns the 2022 value to 2023, reversing the trend. Additionally, the LLM claims Tesla’s liability was 'immaterial' and that it does not record a material reserve, but the original answer states Tesla *does* recognize a Sales Return Reserve based on resale value guarantees using historical experience and expected future market values—there is no mention of immateriality in the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the key dollar amounts are misattributed to the wrong years, and Tesla’s reserve status is misrepresented. The decrease from $234M to $191M (a $43M reduction) is a critical fact omitted and inverted. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the comparison between LOW’s declining reserve and Tesla’s structured buyback-related reserve is lost because the LLM incorrectly concludes Tesla has negligible exposure, contradicting the original answer’s point about Tesla proactively recognizing obligations. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the response addresses customer return obligations and compares the two companies, but due to factual inaccuracies, the conclusion is misleading.

      "original_answer": "To evaluate the segment cost of sales reporting transparency and cost components of MDLZ and PEP, we begin with MDLZ's 2024 10-K filing, which explicitly reports segment cost of sales for Latin America at $3,230 million and North America at $6,491 million. These figures represent the direct costs associated with production and distribution in those regions. In contrast, PEP's 10-K provides a more granular definition of segment cost of sales, explicitly listing components such as raw materials, direct labor, plant overhead, purchasing and receiving costs, production planning, inspection costs, and raw materials handling facilities. PEP also clarifies that these costs exclude the impact of comparability items, which are managed centrally and reported in corporate unallocated expenses. By comparing these disclosures, it becomes evident that while MDLZ offers precise dollar amounts per region, PEP provides a more detailed breakdown of cost components, enhancing operational transparency. This contrast suggests that PEP's approach offers deeper insight into the structure of production costs, while MDLZ's reporting emphasizes geographic cost allocation.",

(1) All key facts are correct: MDLZ reports $3,230 million and $6,491 million for Latin America and North America segment cost of sales, respectively, in 2024, and these are presented as aggregate figures without component breakdown. PEP is correctly described as providing a detailed definition of cost of sales, including raw materials, direct labor, plant overhead, purchasing and receiving costs, etc., with segment-level reporting. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both dollar amounts and their attribution to the correct regions and companies are correct; no calculations were required, but the values match exactly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing MDLZ’s lump-sum reporting to PEP’s component-level transparency demonstrates synthesis across two different 10-K filings.

      "original_answer": "EMR generated only $17 million from divestitures in 2022 and had no divestiture proceeds by 2024, indicating a significant reduction in the use of divestitures as a source of liquidity. In contrast, RTX explicitly identifies 'investments in and divestitures of businesses' as a principal factor in liquidity management, showing a strategic emphasis on divestitures to fund operating, investing, and financing activities.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors in key financial figures, particularly for Amgen. According to the ground truth, Amgen's allowance for doubtful accounts was $32 million in 2021 and $28 million in 2023 — a net decrease of $4 million. However, the LLM incorrectly reports Amgen’s allowance as $1,115 million in 2021 and $1,133 million in 2023 — an increase of $18 million — which is off by over a billion dollars. This error invalidates all downstream calculations. Additionally, the combined net change is reported as a $54 million decrease, but the correct total net change is a $69 million decrease (ABT: -72M + AMGN: -4M = -76M? Wait — original answer says combined decrease of $69M, which implies possible typo in original; but ABT -72M and AMGN -4M would sum to -76M. However, original answer explicitly states 'combined... decrease of $69 million', so there may be internal inconsistency in ground truth. Still, LLM’s $54M is not close to either interpretation). (2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: ABT numbers are correct (313M to 241M, -72M), but AMGN numbers are catastrophically wrong. The LLM also misreports charge-offs and provisions: for example, claiming Amgen had $30M and $35M additions in 2021–2022 contradicts the ground truth that AMGN made minimal additions (e.g., $6M in 2023) and no write-offs in 2023. There is no support for multi-year $30M+ additions. (3) Reasoning structure is sound — the LLM attempts to explain patterns via additions vs. deductions — but the logic is based on fabricated data. It correctly infers that net change depends on provisions vs. write-offs, but applies it to incorrect underlying data. Multi-hop synthesis is attempted but fails due to incorrect data retrieval.

      "original_answer": "The $571 million in 2028 operating lease payments reported by LOW indicates the company is primarily a lessee, leasing assets such as real estate or equipment to support its operations. In contrast, TSLA's $197 million in 2028 operating lease receivables suggests it is primarily a lessor in this context, leasing out assets—likely manufacturing or logistics equipment. This contrast reflects fundamentally different asset utilization strategies: LOW is deploying capital by leasing assets to support its retail and operational footprint, while TSLA is generating revenue by leasing out assets it owns, potentially as part of its broader capital efficiency and asset-light initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "Low (​Lowe’s) reports a $571 million operating‑lease payment due in fiscal 2028, reflecting the company’s strategy of using leased real‑estate, equipment and other assets to run its retail network and therefore incurring large future cash outflows. Tesla, by contrast, shows $197 million of operating‑lease receivables for 2028, indicating that it is the lessor of vehicle and solar‑system leases and expects cash inflows from customers, an asset‑light model that monetizes owned assets rather than using them in‑house. These opposite positions—Low’s sizable lease obligations versus Tesla’s sizable lease receivables—highlight their divergent approaches to asset utilization. 【page_57】 【page_80】",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—both dollar amounts are correct, and no calculations are required beyond correct interpretation of inflows vs. outflows. Format variations (e.g., $571 million vs $571M) are acceptable and handled appropriately. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly infers that LOW’s payments indicate a lessee position (leasing in assets like real estate), while TSLA’s receivables indicate a lessor position (leasing out assets, such as vehicles or solar systems), reflecting contrasting asset utilization strategies. The conclusion about LOW deploying capital via leasing versus TSLA monetizing owned assets aligns with the ground truth. The only minor shortcoming is the specific mention of 'vehicle and solar-system leases' for Tesla, which, while plausible, adds detail not confirmed in the original answer and slightly extends beyond the provided context.

According to the ground truth, COF reports $3,504 million in >90 days delinquent credit card loans and $484 million in >90 days delinquent consumer banking loans, totaling $3,988 million from COF. However, the LLM states $3.718 billion ($3,718 million) for credit card and $0.561 billion ($561 million) for consumer banking, which are incorrect. The LLM's combined total of $4.279 billion from COF (plus AIG's $42 million) leads to a final total of $4.321 billion, which is materially higher than the correct total of $3,891 million. These numeric discrepancies are substantial and undermine the answer's reliability. (2) Calculations: The LLM incorrectly sums its own figures—$3.718B + $0.561B + $0.042B = $4.321B—but even this arithmetic is flawed because the inputs are wrong. The correct sum from the ground truth is $42M + $3,504M + $484M = $3,891M, which the LLM fails to match. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: While the LLM attempts to synthesize data from AIG and COF and draws a qualitative comparison about relative risk exposure—which aligns with the intent of the question—the reasoning is based on incorrect data. The conclusion that AIG’s exposure is modest compared to COF’s is consistent with the ground truth, but the magnitude of COF’s exposure is overstated. (4) Entity identification is correct: AIG and COF are properly identified, and the relevant portfolios (commercial real estate, credit card, consumer banking) are addressed. The answer is contextually relevant and structured appropriately, but the severe quantitative errors drastically reduce correctness. Minor formatting variations like $3,504M vs $3.504B are acceptable, but the actual values must match; here, they do not.

The ground truth reports $608 million for Lowe’s, so there is a $5 million discrepancy in the liability figure. This minor numerical difference likely stems from rounding or present-value calculation variations but does not significantly alter the interpretation. All other entities (TSLA, LOW, 2027), metrics (operating lease receivables vs. liabilities), and roles (lessor vs. lessee) are accurately identified.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is high: Tesla’s $227 million matches exactly. Lowe’s $603M vs. ground truth $608M is off by <1%, which is minor and may reflect updated discounting assumptions. The comparison of roles based on these figures remains valid. No calculations (e.g., difference of $381M) are explicitly stated, but the qualitative contrast is correctly emphasized.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes that Tesla, as a lessor, generates receivables from leasing vehicles and solar systems, while Lowe’s, as a lessee, incurs liabilities for store equipment and operations. This reflects accurate understanding of lease accounting and business models across the two companies.\n\n4) The answer conveys the same core insight as the original: Tesla earns lease income, Lowe’s bears lease costs—highlighting contrasting financial strategies.

The calculation is accurate and correctly formatted using different but equivalent units (billion vs million). 2) All numeric values match the ground truth when adjusted for unit format: $16.9 billion = $16,900 million (slight rounding from $16,930M is acceptable), $0.492 billion = $492 million, and the difference of $16.4 billion = $16,400 million (close to exact $16,438M; minor rounding is reasonable). 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes lease liability data for two different companies, computes the difference, and draws a logical conclusion about the scale of leasing strategies. 4) The qualitative interpretation is strong—correctly attributing FedEx’s larger leasing footprint to assets like aircraft and facilities, and contrasting it with Emerson’s modest leasing—though slightly less detailed than the ground truth regarding Emerson’s potential focus on shorter-term or less capital-intensive assets.

The impact of operating working capital on Emerson is correctly stated as a $515 million reduction, matching the ground truth exactly. (2) All numbers are factually correct within reasonable rounding conventions—$2.9 billion and $9.8 billion are standard approximations of $2,922M and $9,832M. The difference of $6.9 billion is consistent with the actual $6,910M difference. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly compares cash from operating activities across two companies (EMR vs FDX) and separately reports the working capital impact for Emerson, synthesizing information appropriately.

While it correctly reports AIG's $42 million in commercial-mortgage loans over 90 days delinquent, it incorrectly cites Capital One (COF) as having $288 million in commercial-banking loans (>90 days delinquent), which includes multifamily and industrial loans. However, the ground truth states COF reported $107 million in >90 days delinquent commercial and multifamily real estate loans, not $288 million. The LLM appears to have misidentified or misextracted the figure from COF's filing, possibly confusing total delinquent loans with commercial real estate-specific delinquencies. (2) The calculation is therefore incorrect: $42M + $288M = $330M is wrong; the correct sum is $42M + $107M = $149M. The LLM's final combined value of $330 million is more than double the true value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the model failed to accurately extract the relevant metric for COF. It should have isolated commercial and multifamily real estate delinquencies, but instead used a broader or incorrect category. Additionally, the ticker COF refers to Capital One, so entity identification is correct, but metric extraction is not. (4) Due to major quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies—especially the incorrect dollar amount for COF and the resulting miscalculation—the correctness score is low at 2.

      "original_answer": "Disney faces significant challenges in managing churn rates on its DTC platforms, particularly in response to price increases and economic downturns, which can reduce consumer willingness to pay for streaming services. In contrast, AT&T has successfully reduced churn by bundling services, with subscribers purchasing two or more services experiencing significantly lower churn than single-service subscribers. This comparison reveals that the streaming industry faces more price sensitivity and subscriber volatility due to a crowded market and economic pressures, whereas the telecom industry benefits from integrated service offerings that enhance customer retention. The competitive dynamics differ in that Disney must balance price increases with subscriber retention amid rising competition and economic uncertainty, while AT&T leverages its 5G network and bundled plans to maintain subscriber loyalty in a more mature, saturated market.",

While it correctly states KO's $1,319 million operating income decline, it incorrectly reports MDLZ's segment operating income growth as $90 million (4.6%), whereas the ground truth specifies only $3 million growth. This error directly impacts the final net dollar difference calculation. The LLM computes a difference of $1,409 million ($1,319M – $90M), but the correct net difference is $1,322 million ($1,319M decline vs. $3M growth), as stated in the original answer. (2) Number verification: KO’s $1,319M decline is accurate and matches the ground truth. However, MDLZ’s segment operating income increase is wrong — the LLM cites $90M growth from page 53, but this appears to be total segment operating income change before isolating the specific impact of SG&A and currency; the ground truth clarifies that after those headwinds, growth was only $3M. The final calculation is therefore invalid due to incorrect inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both companies, relevant expense factors (SG&A, currency), and attempts to compare outcomes. However, it fails to correctly synthesize the net outcome for MDLZ in the context of the question, which asks specifically about the impact of SG&A and currency on segment operating income growth — not overall growth. The model uses total growth without adjusting for countervailing factors mentioned in the ground truth (net pricing, cost controls). (4) Scores reflect that core facts for KO are correct (supporting partial credit), but MDLZ data and the final comparative calculation are significantly off, undermining the quantitative and qualitative accuracy.

This part of the answer is factually correct. (2) However, the key tax benefit contributing to Intel's lower rate is incorrect. The ground truth states that the restructuring of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries reduced the rate by 3.4 percentage points, while the LLM claims it was 'non-US income taxed at different rates' with a 5.9 percentage point reduction. This is a significant factual discrepancy—both in the nature of the benefit and the magnitude of its impact. The cited page 90, lines 4–7, likely refers to a different component of the tax rate reconciliation, not the largest contributor. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly synthesizes tax rates from different parts of the filings and computes the difference accurately. However, it fails in correctly identifying and attributing the primary tax benefit, indicating a misinterpretation of the source document. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question and cites relevant sections. Scores reflect partial correctness: quantitative accuracy is moderate due to correct rates and difference but wrong benefit magnitude; qualitative accuracy suffers due to misattribution of the key tax driver.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase's Return on Common Equity (ROE) was 17%, significantly higher than AIG's ROE of 8.6%. This difference is primarily due to JPM's much higher net income of $49,552 million compared to AIG's net income of $3,614 million, as well as JPM's substantially larger average common shareholders' equity of $300,474 million versus AIG's $41,930 million. The ROE calculation (Net Income / Average Common Shareholders' Equity) highlights how JPM’s higher profitability relative to its equity base results in a stronger ROE performance.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 JPMorgan Chase generated a ROE of **≈ 17 %**, about **8.4 percentage points higher** than AIG’s ROE of **8.6 %**.  The gap stems from JPMorgan’s much larger and more profitable earnings base – net income of **$49.6 billion** on roughly **$300 billion** of common equity (≈ 16.5 % ROE) – versus AIG’s modest **$3.6 billion** net income on an average common‑shareholders’ equity of **$41.9 billion** (8.6 % ROE).

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the ROE values for both companies—JPMorgan Chase at approximately 17% and AIG at 8.6%—with the difference of 8.4 percentage points, which is accurate (17 - 8.6 = 8.4). The net income figures are presented as $49.6 billion and $3.6 billion, which are rounded versions of the exact ground truth values ($49,552 million and $3,614 million); this is acceptable under format variation. Similarly, average common shareholders' equity is reported as ~$300 billion and $41.9 billion, closely matching the precise figures of $300,474 million and $41,930 million. (2) The ROE calculation is implied correctly: $49.6B / $300B ≈ 16.5%, which the model acknowledges, though it still reports the official ROE as 17%, indicating awareness of the exact figure despite rounding inputs. This minor discrepancy does not undermine factual accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing two companies’ financial metrics across net income and equity bases to explain ROE differences—and the synthesis between the entities (AIG vs. JPMorgan) and metrics (net income, equity, ROE) is logically coherent. (4) The answer addresses all parts of the question: the ROE comparison and the contributing financial factors (net income and equity levels). The mention of 'stronger earnings growth and higher profit margin' adds interpretive context not explicitly in the ground truth but reasonably inferred; however, this slight extrapolation doesn’t introduce error. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and semantically equivalent to the original answer, warranting a high score with only minor rounding-related imprecision preventing a perfect 10.",

      "original_answer": "GD's ROIC declined from 14.0% in 2019 to 11.9% in 2021, indicating a downward trend in the efficiency of its capital investments over this period. In contrast, UNP emphasizes that ROIC is used as a key performance metric for evaluating long-term capital investments and is specifically incorporated into the determination of equity compensation for executives. This suggests UNP places increasing strategic importance on ROIC as a performance incentive, even as GD's ROIC has decreased over the same timeframe.",

The only minor discrepancy is the mention of 11.8% in 2020, which is not contradicted by the original answer (which only states 2019 and 2021 values), so this level of detail is acceptable and plausible based on available data. (2) All numbers are accurate: 14.0% in 2019 and 11.9% in 2021 are correctly reported. The intermediate 2020 figure of 11.8% is not present in the original answer, but since it does not conflict with the overall downward trend and is numerically consistent, it does not constitute a factual error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts GD's declining ROIC performance with UNP's strategic use of ROIC in executive compensation, synthesizing information across two companies and linking financial performance to governance practices. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, conveying the same core insight — that while GD's ROIC has decreased, UNP has elevated ROIC as a key performance and compensation metric. Wording differs slightly but meaning is preserved. No critical information is missing, and the logic supports the conclusion.

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola reported a $1,319 million decrease in operating income in 2024, with higher SG&A expenses cited as a primary driver of the decline. This was compounded by other factors such as commodity costs, other operating charges, and foreign exchange impacts. In contrast, Mondelez listed higher SG&A expenses as one of several cost pressures, including costs from the Simplify to Grow Program, remeasurement losses, manufacturing costs, and an intangible asset impairment charge from 2023. While both companies experienced SG&A increases, Coca-Cola specifically emphasized SG&A as a key contributor to declining operating income, whereas for Mondelez it was part of a broader set of cost challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024 Coca‑Cola’s SG&A bill rose about $610 million (≈4 %) – mainly from higher advertising spend, stock‑based compensation and other operating costs – and, together with higher commodity costs and other charges, pushed consolidated operating income down 12 % and trimmed the company’s operating margin to 21.2 % versus 24.7 % a year earlier.  \n\nMondelez also saw SG&A increase (higher advertising and consumer‑promotion spend, ERP‑implementation costs, intangible‑asset impairments and other selling‑general‑administrative items), but those pressures were more than offset by stronger net‑pricing, lower manufacturing costs and favorable volume/mix, so segment operating income rose 19 % and operating margin improved despite the higher SG&A.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in quantitative details. The ground truth states that Coca-Cola experienced a $1,319 million decrease in operating income due to higher SG&A and other factors, but the LLM claims a $610 million increase in SG&A expenses (≈4%) and a 12% drop in operating income with margin falling from 24.7% to 21.2%. These figures are not supported by the original answer and introduce specific numbers (e.g., 4%, $610M, 12%, 21.2%, 24.7%) that do not appear in or cannot be derived from the ground truth. Similarly, the LLM states Mondelez’s segment operating income rose 19% and operating margin improved due to offsetting factors, but the original answer does not mention any positive outcome or margin improvement—only that SG&A was one of several cost pressures among broader challenges including prior-year impairment charges and restructuring costs. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: no dollar amount for SG&A increase is given for Mondelez in the ground truth, yet the LLM implies one; Coca-Cola’s $1,319M operating income decline is misrepresented as a $610M SG&A rise without confirming causality or magnitude. Calculations like '≈4%' or '12% decline' and margin changes are unsupported. (3) The reasoning partially captures the qualitative contrast—Coca-Cola emphasized SG&A as a primary driver while Mondelez listed it among multiple cost pressures—but goes beyond the data by asserting that Mondelez’s SG&A increases were 'more than offset' by pricing and cost efficiencies, which is not stated or implied in the original answer. The original does not confirm whether Mondelez’s operating performance improved or declined overall. (4) Despite these issues, the LLM correctly identifies both companies, the year (2024), and the relevance of SG&A expenses and related cost items (e.g., advertising, ERP implementation, impairments), showing contextual understanding.

This exposes Apple to foreign exchange risk that could directly compress gross margins unless mitigated through pricing adjustments or hedging strategies. In contrast, Intel includes gross margin projections as part of its forward-looking statements, indicating that it actively manages and guides expectations around gross margins through strategic initiatives, manufacturing expansion, and internal/external production planning. While Apple focuses on hedging and risk management to counter external currency pressures, Intel emphasizes proactive business and manufacturing strategies to influence gross margin outcomes directly. Together, these approaches highlight how two technology companies address gross margin stability through different lenses: Apple by mitigating external financial risks and Intel by shaping internal operational and strategic levers.",

For Verizon, the LLM correctly reports $20.0 billion and 5.3%, which matches the ground truth ($20,002 million / $380,255 million ≈ 5.3%).

The claimed 0.8 percentage point difference is incorrect — the actual difference is about 3.2 percentage points (8.5% - 5.3%).

      "original_answer": "Apple faces a direct negative impact on gross margins due to foreign exchange risk, as a stronger U.S. dollar reduces its net sales and gross margins when expressed in USD. In contrast, Intel expects gross margins to be impacted by strategic investments in manufacturing capacity and process technology under its IDM 2.0 strategy, forecasting non-GAAP gross margins between 51% and 53% over the next several years. While Apple's financial planning must account for FX volatility through hedging instruments and pricing adjustments, Intel's planning focuses on absorbing upfront costs of long-term strategic investments that are expected to drive future revenue growth and margin improvement. This contrast highlights differing financial risk profiles: Apple managing external market volatility versus Intel managing internal strategic investment impacts.",

      "original_answer": "AIG adjusts its Return on Common Equity (ROCE) by excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, as well as other fair value fluctuations, to reflect what it considers a more stable measure of underlying profitability. In contrast, JPM reports a Return on Common Equity (ROE) of 17% for 2023 without explicitly adjusting for such unrealized gains and losses, implying that its ROE may be more sensitive to market value changes. Therefore, AIG’s adjusted ROCE may appear more stable compared to JPM’s ROE, which includes the effects of market volatility on its financial performance.",

JPMorgan’s 2023 ROE/ROTCE is presented as a standard GAAP ratio (the table shows “Return on common equity (‘ROE’)” 【page_48】) and does not make a comparable exclusion of AFS‑security fair‑value changes.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly captures the core distinction between AIG and JPMorgan Chase in how they treat unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities in their ROCE/ROE calculations. It accurately states that AIG adjusts its return measure by excluding these items, while JPM reports a standard GAAP-based ROE without such adjustments. The key qualitative point—that this leads to a lack of direct comparability due to AIG's 'cleaned-up' measure versus JPM's inclusion of market-driven volatility—is fully correct and aligns with the ground truth. (2) There are no specific numerical values (e.g., ROCE percentages) cited in either answer that require verification; both mention JPM’s ROE contextually but do not assign a specific percentage in the LLM answer. However, the ground truth includes JPM’s 17% ROE for 2023, which the LLM omits. This is a minor omission but does not distort the reasoning or conclusion. All other references (e.g., page numbers, treatment of OCI, Fortitude Re) are consistent with accurate sourcing and entity identification. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across two companies (AIG and JPM), identifies differing accounting treatments (adjusted vs. GAAP ROE), links this to the impact on comparability, and explains the implications of including or excluding volatile fair value changes. The logic chain is complete and valid. (4) The LLM answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in substance, though slightly less explicit about JPM’s reported ROE value. Wording differences (e.g., 'adjusted return on common equity' vs. 'ROCE') are acceptable and reflect synonymous usage. The inclusion of page references adds precision.

AIG noted that fixed index annuities have surrender charge periods generally in the five-to-ten-year range, and older contracts with higher minimum interest rates contributed to better-than-expected persistency. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase reported a $15.1 billion noninterest revenue, which included higher commissions on annuity sales in its Banking & Wealth Management segment, driven by the impact of First Republic and strong market levels. This indicates that both companies benefited from the rising rate environment, with AIG experiencing increased annuity sales despite higher surrender risks, and JPM seeing higher annuity-related fee income.",
      "llm_answer": "- **AIG:** The 2023 rise in interest rates made fixed and fixed‑index annuities more attractive, giving AIG a “strong tail‑wind” for new sales, but the same higher rates also spurred a noticeable rise in policy surrenders (especially as contracts moved out of their surrender‑charge periods).【page_59】\n\n- **JPMorgan Chase:** In its 2023 results, JPMorgan said that “higher commissions on annuity sales” were one of the drivers of a 2 % increase in non‑interest revenue, lifting that line of business year‑over‑year.【page_71】\n\nThus, while AIG experienced both higher annuity sales and higher surrender activity due to the rate environment, JPMorgan’s disclosed impact was limited to an uptick in annuity‑related commissions that contributed modestly to overall non‑interest revenue growth.",

It correctly references persistency dynamics and the tailwind effect. However, it omits specific details from the ground truth such as the five-to-ten-year surrender charge range and the role of older contracts with higher minimum interest rates in supporting persistency. It also does not mention AIG’s partnership with Blackstone, a key driver cited in the original answer. For JPMorgan, the LLM correctly identifies higher annuity commissions as a contributor to noninterest revenue growth but lacks the specific dollar figure ($15.1 billion) and the context that this included the impact of First Republic and strong market levels. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially compromised: while no incorrect numbers are stated, the LLM fails to report the $15.1 billion noninterest revenue figure, which is a key quantitative benchmark in the ground truth. The 2% increase in non-interest revenue is mentioned but not tied to a specific dollar amount or clearly contextualized within the broader revenue drivers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—linking rising rates to annuity sales and surrenders at AIG, and separately to commission income at JPMorgan—but the synthesis is less complete than the original answer, missing the explicit comparison that both firms benefited, albeit in different forms (sales volume vs. fee income).

It incorrectly states that both ABT and MDT reported $1,735 million in Neuromodulation revenue in 2022, which is false. According to the ground truth, the combined revenue is $2,516 million, implying different individual contributions (ABT: ~$781 million, MDT: ~$1,735 million). The LLM doubles MDT's figure instead of using correct ABT data. The combined total is therefore wrong: $3.47 billion (LLM) vs $2.516 billion (truth). The comparison to MDT's Neuroscience segment ($8.78 billion) is numerically close but the difference is misrepresented: LLM says combined Neuromodulation is $5.3 billion less, but the correct difference is $6.268 billion (or $2.268 billion less as per original phrasing — though this appears contradictory, the original answer states the combined ABT+MDT Neuromodulation revenue is $2,268 million *less* than MDT’s Neuroscience revenue, which would imply $8,784M - $2,516M = $6,268M difference — there is an inconsistency in the original answer’s wording). However, the LLM’s calculation of the difference is based on incorrect inputs. (2) Number verification: MDT’s Neuroscience revenue of $8.78 billion is accurate (matches $8,784 million). But ABT’s Neuromodulation revenue is not $1,735 million — that is MDT’s figure. The correct ABT value must be $781 million to reach the $2,516 million total. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failure: The model fails to correctly identify and synthesize ABT’s actual Neuromodulation revenue, instead copying MDT’s number. This breaks the multi-hop logic required to aggregate across two companies. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to core numerical and entity-level errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because key figures and the final comparison are incorrect. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the model recognizes the need to sum and compare, and gets MDT’s segment revenue right.

It states that McDonald’s (MCD) has an operating lease right-of-use asset of $9.3 billion ($9,286 million), which actually corresponds to Starbucks’ (SBUX) correct value in the ground truth. Conversely, it assigns $11.7 billion ($11,724 million) to SBUX, which is incorrect—this figure does not match either company’s true value and misattributes MCD’s actual value (which is $11,319 million). The combined value is stated as $21.0 billion (~$21,000 million), which is close but not accurate compared to the correct sum of $20,605.2 million. (2) Calculation verification: MCD ground truth = $11,319M, SBUX = $9,286.2M; sum = $20,605.2M.

      "question": "How does the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar against the Argentine peso on KO's operating income compare to its effect on MDLZ's net revenue, based on their respective 2024 financial disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "KO reported that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates unfavorably impacted its consolidated operating income by 11%, with the Argentine peso being one of the currencies contributing to this decline. MDLZ, on the other hand, reported that unfavorable currency translation decreased its net revenues by $1,096 million, with the Argentinean peso cited as a primary contributor. While KO quantifies the impact as a 11% decrease in operating income, MDLZ provides a direct dollar amount of $1,096 million lost due to currency effects, which includes the peso’s weakness against the stronger U.S. dollar.",
      "llm_answer": "In Coca‑Cola’s 2024 filing, a stronger U.S. dollar versus the Argentine peso (and other currencies) cut operating income by **about $190 million**. In Mondelēz’s 2024 filing, the same dollar‑strength effect lowered net revenues by **roughly $1.1 billion** (≈$1,096 million). Thus, the currency impact on MDLZ’s revenue was far larger—about six times the hit to KO’s operating income.",

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key quantitative figures. The ground truth states that KO reported an 11% unfavorable impact on operating income due to foreign exchange fluctuations (with the Argentine peso as one contributor), but the LLM incorrectly converts this into a specific dollar amount of $190 million, which is not present in the original answer or supported by the provided data. Similarly, while MDLZ's $1,096 million (≈$1.1 billion) reduction in net revenue due to currency translation is accurately reported, the LLM draws a direct comparison between KO's percentage impact and MDLZ's dollar impact, creating a misleading quantitative conclusion. (2) The calculation of 'six times' greater impact on MDLZ vs KO is based on an unsupported dollar estimate for KO ($190M), making the comparison invalid. The original answer does not provide any dollar impact for KO, only a percentage (11%), so the $190M figure appears to be fabricated or inferred without basis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in identifying both companies and the role of the Argentine peso in currency impacts, and it correctly notes that MDLZ reports in dollar terms while KO reports in percentage terms. However, the model fails to preserve this distinction and instead creates a false equivalency through unsourced dollar estimates, undermining the reasoning. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core question about comparative currency impacts and correctly identifies both companies, the relevant financial metrics, and the direction of the effect. However, the introduction of an unverified dollar figure for KO severely compromises factual accuracy, warranting a low correctness and quantitative accuracy score despite otherwise appropriate structure and intent.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in both the current operating lease liabilities and total lease obligations for both companies. According to the ground truth, NFLX's current operating lease liability is $383.3 million, but the LLM reports $1,040 million—over double the correct amount. Similarly, NFLX's total operating lease liabilities are $2,430.1 million, but the LLM states $9,006 million, which is more than triple the correct value. This leads to an incorrect percentage (11.5% vs. correct 15.8%). For VZ, the current liability is correctly reported as $4,266 million (or $4.266 billion), but the total lease obligations are wrong: the LLM states $24,268 million (~$24.3B), while the ground truth is $44.7B (sum of $24.7B and $20.0B from different lease components). Thus, the calculated percentage of 17.6% is close but based on incomplete data, as the correct total includes two components not reflected in the LLM answer. (2) The combined current liability is incorrectly calculated as $5,306 million due to the erroneous NFLX current liability figure. The correct sum is $383.3M + $4,266M = $4,649.3M. The LLM’s result is off by over $650 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly identify or synthesize the correct total lease obligations for either company, especially missing that VZ's total combines two distinct liability amounts. It also fails to accurately extract NFLX's figures, suggesting confusion between different financial line items or years. (4) Despite these major errors, the answer is contextually relevant—addressing the right companies, metric, and date, and performing the correct type of calculation (current portion as % of total, and sum of current liabilities). However, due to severe quantitative inaccuracies, the correctness score is low. Minor formatting variations like $4.3B vs $4,266M are acceptable, but the values themselves must be accurate, which they are not.",

Accenture returned $6.6 billion through share purchases of $4.1 billion and dividends of $2.5 billion, while Microsoft returned $12.4 billion in the fourth quarter alone through share repurchases and dividends.

The combined total of $19 billion is accurate (6.6 + 12.4 = 19.0), with only a minor rounding from $19.0 billion to $19 billion, which is acceptable under semantic equivalence. (2) All numbers match the ground truth exactly; calculations are correct and formats are consistent (e.g., $6.6 billion vs $6.6B). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies (Accenture and Microsoft) for the same fiscal year (2022), computes the total, and interprets the strategic implications. The characterization of Accenture’s balanced approach and Microsoft’s aggressive returns aligns with the original answer. The only minor gap is that the original specifies Microsoft’s $12.4 billion was returned in the fourth quarter alone, which the LLM omits—this contextual timing detail is relevant to capital allocation timing strategy but does not invalidate the overall interpretation.

This is a significant deviation from the correct value. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely lacking: the individual EPS figures for AIG and American Express are both wrong, and the sum of $28.08 is incorrect.

Even Netflix’s federal tax provision of $441M (from $854M - $413M) does not align with the required total.

The correct sum is $1,655.9 million + $2,837 million = $4,492.9 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—LLM attempts to extract values from both companies and sum them—but fails due to a critical error in interpreting MSFT's reported value. It likely misread 'millions' as 'thousands' or omitted three zeros. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, correct fiscal periods, and correct metric. However, the quantitative inaccuracy is severe enough to make the answer misleading. Correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low due to the magnitude of the numerical error, which fundamentally changes the result.",

The ground truth explicitly states that AT&T's amount is indeterminate, but the LLM assumes the entire balance will be reclassified, which is unsupported. (2) The calculation of a combined $1.888 billion is mathematically correct ($731M + $1,157M), but it is conceptually flawed because it treats AT&T’s total OCI balance as a 12-month reclassification amount, which is not disclosed. This leads to a significant overstatement of the expected financial impact.

For Medtronic, the most significant non-GAAP adjustments contributing to this rate included amortization of intangible assets (15.0%), restructuring and associated costs (21.5%), and certain tax adjustments, net (-910 million). For Pfizer, the effective tax rate for non-GAAP Adjusted income was 9.0% in 2023, significantly influenced by restructuring and acquisition-related items totaling $1.2 billion, including $785 million of integration costs, $190 million of transaction costs, and $125 million of employee termination-related charges.",

However, there are significant inaccuracies in the dollar amounts cited for non-GAAP adjustments. The LLM states Medtronic's amortization of intangible assets was $255 million, but the ground truth does not provide a dollar value for this item—only a tax impact percentage (15.0%). Similarly, the LLM incorrectly reports 'certain tax adjustments, net' as a $910 million 'tax-benefit charge,' while the ground truth specifies it as -$910 million (indicating an expense), and this figure is correctly presented as a tax adjustment, not a pre-tax item. For Pfizer, the LLM aggregates restructuring and acquisition-related items to approximately $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, but the ground truth specifies total restructuring and acquisition-related items as $1.2 billion, broken into $785M integration costs, $190M transaction costs, and $125M employee termination charges—totaling exactly $1.1 billion, not $1.9B or $2.2B. These quantitative discrepancies are material. (2) The calculation of the tax rate difference (13.8% - 9.0% = 4.8%) is correct. However, the LLM misrepresents the scale and composition of adjustment amounts, particularly for Pfizer, where it inflates the total by nearly double. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound in structure: the model correctly attributes the divergence in tax rates to differing non-GAAP adjustments and links pre-tax adjustments to their effect on the effective tax rate. It correctly identifies amortization and tax adjustments for Medtronic and acquisition/restructuring costs for Pfizer as key drivers. However, it fails to specify that Medtronic’s restructuring and associated costs had a 21.5% tax impact, which is a major omission. (4) The contextual relevance is excellent—the answer directly addresses both parts of the question and attempts a comparative analysis. Due to the correct tax rates and difference, but significant errors in financial figures and missing key percentage impacts, the correctness score is 7, with lower quantitative accuracy pulling down the overall score.",

      "original_answer": "McDonald's incorporates occupancy costs primarily through its lessee role in a significant real estate portfolio, where it often owns the building but leases the land. These occupancy costs, such as property taxes, insurance, and site maintenance, are generally paid by franchisees for franchised locations, which make up the majority of McDonald's restaurants. This indicates a strategy where the financial burden of occupancy costs is largely shifted to franchisees, allowing McDonald's to maintain a more asset-light model. In contrast, Starbucks directly incorporates occupancy costs into its store operating expenses for company-operated locations, reflecting a more direct financial responsibility for these costs. This reveals that McDonald's leverages its franchise model to outsource occupancy-related financial obligations, while Starbucks assumes these costs as part of its operational expenditures, highlighting a more vertically integrated approach to property management.",
      "llm_answer": "McDonald’s records occupancy‑related items (property taxes, insurance and site‑maintenance) as part of the lease‑right‑of‑use asset and lease liability for the relatively few company‑owned restaurants; for the overwhelming majority of franchised restaurants those occupancy costs are shifted to the franchisee under the franchise agreement and therefore do not appear on McDonald’s balance sheet. Starbucks, by contrast, rolls occupancy costs into its operating‑expense line items (store‑operating expenses and general‑and‑administrative expenses) and treats them as period costs rather than capitalizing them in a lease asset. This shows that McDonald’s uses a lease‑capitalization model for its own sites while off‑loading lease‑related costs to franchisees, whereas Starbucks absorbs occupancy costs as ongoing expenses, reflecting a more expense‑focused approach to managing its leased properties.",

(2) The LLM accurately states that Starbucks includes occupancy costs in operating expenses (store operating and G&A), treating them as period costs rather than capitalizing them—consistent with the ground truth's description of Starbucks assuming direct financial responsibility. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts McDonald's asset-light, franchise-driven approach with Starbucks' vertically integrated, expense-absorbing model. (4) Minor difference: the LLM emphasizes accounting treatment (right-of-use assets, lease liabilities, period costs) more than the original, which focuses on strategic implications.

      "original_answer": "Emerson (EMR) experienced potential net earnings impacts due to its use of derivatives, particularly when hedges were not fully effective at offsetting changes in underlying hedged items, such as foreign currency exposures and commodity-based manufacturing costs. This lack of perfect offsetting could directly affect earnings volatility. In contrast, FedEx (FDX) reported net earnings allocable to common shares of $3,819 million in fiscal 2022, which reflects the outcome of its overall risk exposure and earnings management strategies, including those that may have influenced earnings per share. The difference in financial outcomes highlights how EMR's derivative-related earnings volatility contrasts with FDX's reported net earnings, which were influenced by both operational performance and share dilution effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s 2022 filing shows that the company actively uses foreign‑exchange forwards and options, interest‑rate swaps and commodity‑price swaps to hedge the currency, rate and copper/aluminum price risks inherent in its global manufacturing and sales operations; the hedges are accounted for as cash‑flow or fair‑value hedges so that most gains or losses are deferred in equity and only recognized when the underlying transaction affects earnings. In contrast, FedEx’s 2022 results report a sharp decline in net earnings to $3.8 billion (down from $5.2 billion in 2021) and a fall in basic EPS to $14.54, indicating that its exposure to market‑ and volume‑related pressures translated into lower profitability despite its own risk‑management programs. Thus, Emerson’s hedging strategy insulated its earnings from specific financial‑market fluctuations, whereas FedEx’s earnings performance reflected broader operational exposure that was not offset by comparable hedging outcomes.",

It also correctly states FedEx's net earnings as $3.8 billion (close to the ground truth $3,819 million), though it adds a comparison to 2021 earnings ($5.2 billion) and EPS figures ($14.54) not present in the original answer, which may be accurate but are extraneous and unverified in the context of the provided ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, $3.8 billion is an acceptable rounding of $3,819 million, so this is accurate. However, the inclusion of 2021 earnings and EPS data introduces unsupported specifics not in the ground truth, slightly reducing quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly contrasts Emerson’s earnings insulation via hedging with FedEx’s earnings decline, implying different risk management outcomes. However, the ground truth does not mention a 'sharp decline' or compare across years, nor does it state that FedEx’s risk management failed—only that net earnings reflect overall exposure and share dilution.

The LLM incorrectly concludes the calculation cannot be performed due to missing data, which contradicts the provided ground truth. (2) The quantitative values used by the LLM for Walmart are inaccurate: it reports Walmart’s retail square footage as 1,053 thousand sq ft, but the correct figure from the knowledge graph must be approximately 153.8 million sq ft (since $642.637 billion / 153.8 million ≈ $418.40/sq ft). The LLM’s calculation of ~$610/sq ft is therefore wrong due to a severe unit error (likely mistaking million for thousand). Similarly, the LLM does not attempt Target’s revenue per square foot, missing that the ground truth computes it as $466.15 using Target’s revenue and 245,939 thousand sq ft (i.e., 245.939 million sq ft).

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) The LLM adds value by calculating percentages (~0.1% for MDT, ~0.5–0.6% for PFE), which are accurate: 4 / 3,493 ≈ 0.11% and 179 / 32,278 ≈ 0.55%. These calculations are correct and enhance clarity. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly interprets that the line item is negligible for MDT and slightly more noticeable for PFE, aligning with the ground truth's characterization of 'minimal impact' vs. 'minor but more impactful role'. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly downplays the relative difference in significance by calling both 'very small' and 'under 1%', which is factually correct but slightly less nuanced than the original answer’s emphasis on PFE’s component being 'more noticeable' despite still being small. However, the core insight is preserved. All entities (MDT, PFE, fiscal year 2023, correct metric names) are accurate. The answer fully addresses both parts of the question: numerical comparison and interpretation of relative significance. Semantic equivalence is strong, with added precision via percentages. Thus, quantitative accuracy is perfect, qualitative reasoning is excellent with slight room for deeper nuance, and contextual relevance is complete.",

      "original_answer": "McDonald's reported a 2% increase in consolidated revenues to $25.9 billion in 2024, emphasizing growth in constant currencies and the impact of restructuring charges and international market performance. In contrast, Starbucks' 10-K detailed its revenue recognition policy, specifying that consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations, discounts, returns, allowances, and sales incentives such as coupon redemptions and rebates. While McDonald's focused on the quantitative growth and external factors affecting its revenue, Starbucks emphasized the methodological and accounting aspects of revenue recognition, including how it accounts for transactions with licensees and internal adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "McDonald’s 2024 filing reports consolidated revenues simply as the sum of company‑operated restaurant sales plus franchise‑related fees, noting that sales at franchised restaurants are **not** recorded as revenue and that the top‑line grew 2% to $25.9 billion. Starbucks, by contrast, spells out a detailed revenue‑recognition policy: consolidated revenues are shown net of inter‑company eliminations and discounts, with company‑operated store sales recognized at the point‑of‑sale, licensed‑store sales recognized on shipment, and certain items (e.g., stored‑value cards and loyalty Stars) recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: McDonald's 2% revenue growth to $25.9 billion in 2024 is accurately reported. No numerical discrepancies exist, and formatting is consistent. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that McDonald's does not record franchised restaurant sales as revenue and explains its revenue composition (company-operated sales + franchise fees), which matches the underlying accounting approach. (3) For Starbucks, the answer captures the core of its revenue recognition policy: presentation net of intercompany eliminations, discounts, and timing of recognition for different revenue streams (point-of-sale, shipment for licensed stores, deferred revenue for stored-value cards and loyalty). While the original answer mentions returns, allowances, and sales incentives (e.g., coupon redemptions), the LLM covers 'discounts' and implies similar adjustments through deferred revenue treatment of coupons and loyalty, which is semantically close. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly contrasting McDonald's focus on growth metrics and external factors with Starbucks' emphasis on accounting methodology. The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'returns, allowances, or sales incentives' by name as part of Starbucks' net revenue presentation, slightly reducing completeness. However, the inclusion of deferred revenue for coupons and loyalty captures the economic effect. Overall, the answer is factually correct, contextually relevant, and synthesizes across both 10-Ks effectively.",

      "original_answer": "Emerson Electric (EMR) reported an expected life of 5.1 years for its stock options in 2022, while FedEx (FDX) estimated the expected life based on actual exercise history and noted that options have a maximum term of 10 years. Since FDX examines actual exercise behavior to determine expected life and uses a period equal to that expected life for calculating volatility, a longer expected life (up to 10 years) would lead to a longer historical period being used for volatility estimation. In contrast, EMR’s shorter expected life of 5.1 years would result in a shorter historical period being used for volatility, potentially leading to different volatility inputs in their financial models and, consequently, different option valuations.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson’s 2022 stock‑option data show an average remaining life of only 2.2 years (page 73), whereas FedEx’s Black‑Scholes inputs use an expected life of 6.4 years (page 98). The shorter life at Emerson suggests its options are being exercised or will expire much sooner than FedEx’s, indicating a more accelerated exercise pattern, while FedEx’s options remain outstanding for a longer horizon. Because each company bases the volatility input on the option’s expected life, Emerson will calculate volatility over a relatively brief historical window (≈2 years), whereas FedEx will use a longer window (≈6 years), leading to different volatility estimates in their financial‑model valuations.",

According to the ground truth, Emerson Electric (EMR) reported an expected life of 5.1 years for its stock options in 2022, but the LLM incorrectly states it as 2.2 years, citing 'page 73'—a detail not present in the verified knowledge base. Similarly, the LLM claims FedEx (FDX) used an expected life of 6.4 years (citing 'page 98'), whereas the ground truth states that FDX does not report a specific expected life number but instead bases it on actual exercise history with a maximum term of 10 years. These numerical errors severely undermine the answer’s validity. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are critical: both 2.2 and 6.4 years are incorrect and unsupported by the ground truth. The correct values are 5.1 years for EMR and a range up to 10 years for FDX based on exercise behavior. Calculations or comparisons based on these wrong numbers (e.g., volatility estimation periods of ≈2 vs ≈6 years) are therefore invalid. (3) The reasoning structure is partially sound—linking expected life to the length of the historical period used for volatility estimation is conceptually correct and aligns with financial modeling practices. The multi-hop logic (expected life → volatility period → valuation impact) is appropriate, but it is applied to incorrect data, weakening the qualitative accuracy. (4) Contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses the core question about exercise behavior and its impact on volatility modeling, using the correct companies and general framework.

This affects its ability to maintain service quality and execute omnichannel strategies, as noted in its 2024 10-K filing. Nike, on the other hand, is exposed to wage rate fluctuations and labor standards in international markets where its contract manufacturers operate. These external wage pressures influence Nike's manufacturing and sourcing costs, as well as its ability to maintain production timelines and cost controls. While both companies face wage-related challenges, Lowe's labor issues are internal and operational, directly affecting its U.S. retail strategy, whereas Nike's are external and supply chain-based, affecting product availability and cost of goods sold. The two companies must strategize differently—Lowe's through workforce development and retention, Nike through supplier management and sourcing diversification.",
      "llm_answer": "Lowe’s notes that a tight U.S. labor market and rising minimum‑wage, benefit and turnover costs are “upward pressure on associate wages and employer‑provided benefits,” which can erode its margins and limit the resources it can devote to omnichannel, technology and store‑level initiatives unless it can attract and retain skilled workers (see LOW 10‑K p.12). Nike, by contrast, says that most of its footwear and apparel is made abroad and that its contract manufacturers are “subject to wage rates and other labor standards … regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured,” so unexpected wage hikes overseas increase product‑costs and force the company to adjust sourcing, pricing and global‑supply‑chain strategies rather than domestic store‑labor costs (see NKE 10‑K p.22).",

In contrast, American Express continues to recognize interest income on loans held for sale until they are sold, as reflected in its calculation of net interest yield on average Card Member loans.

(1) The LLM correctly identifies that American Express (AXP) continues to recognize interest income on loans held for sale until they are sold, which matches the original answer and is supported by AXP's disclosure about including such loans in average Card Member loans and recognizing interest income. This reflects accurate entity and policy identification. (2) Regarding AIG, the LLM states that AIG had no loans classified as 'held-for-sale' in 2024, which is a factual detail not present in the original answer. While this may explain why AIG does not accrue interest on such loans (because there are none), it shifts the reasoning from a policy difference on impaired loans to a classification difference. The original answer focuses on AIG’s policy of not accruing interest on impaired loans held for sale *if* they exist, emphasizing the impairment-based non-accrual policy, whereas the LLM interprets the absence of such loans as the reason for no accrual. This changes the nature of the comparison slightly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—comparing accounting policies across two companies using their 2024 disclosures—but the synthesis leans on an additional fact (no HFS loans at AIG) that reframes rather than directly contrasts the policies as the ground truth does.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. While it correctly identifies Union Pacific's 2021 reclassification as $723 million, it incorrectly states Lockheed Martin's amount as $1.796 billion (should be $1,787 million), which is a minor discrepancy. However, the critical error is in the prior-year (2020) data: the LLM claims Union Pacific reclassified $0.233 billion positively, when in fact it was -$233 million (a negative amount). This flips the entire comparison. The LLM also incorrectly states the 2020 combined total as 'about $2.0 billion', when it was actually $677 million. This leads to a completely wrong conclusion that 2021 was only $0.5 billion higher, when in reality it was $1,834 million higher. (2) Calculations are severely flawed: the LLM computes 2020 total as $1.796B + $0.233B = ~$2.0B, but correct total is $440M + (-$233M) = $207M (not $677M as per ground truth—note: ground truth states $677M combined for 2020, which appears to be a discrepancy itself, but based on provided ground truth, LLM must match it). However, even using the ground truth’s $677M for 2020, the LLM’s $2.0B is wildly off. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly synthesize data across both companies and years, especially missing the negative reclassification by UNP in 2020, which is crucial for accurate comparison. (4) Scores justified: correctness is low (3/10) due to major numerical and directional errors; quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) due to incorrect values and sums; qualitative accuracy is low (3/10) due to flawed logic and synthesis; contextual relevance is high (8/10) as the structure and intent align with the question, and entities (LMT, UNP, AOCI, defined benefit plans, 2021/2020) are correctly identified.",

However, it incorrectly states that Nike's digital sales declined by 5% (citing a 5% drop with a note about an 8% drop in a later segment), whereas the ground truth clearly states an 8% decline in digital sales for NKE in fiscal 2024. This is a significant factual error. The resulting performance difference of 58 basis points (50 bps positive vs 8% negative) is not calculated or mentioned in the LLM answer, which fails to quantify the comparative digital sales performance difference as required by the question. (2) The quantitative accuracy is compromised due to the incorrect 5% figure instead of 8%. While 50 basis points for LOW is correct, the misrepresentation of NKE’s digital decline undermines the core comparison. The answer also does not convert the 8% decline into basis points (800 bps) or compute the 580 basis point difference (50 bps - (-800 bps) = 850 bps net difference — though the ground truth simplifies this to 58 bps, which may reflect a different interpretation or typo in the original answer; however, the LLM does not attempt any such calculation). (3) The reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly contrasts positive digital impact at LOW with negative at NKE and links digital performance to comparable sales. However, it fails to synthesize the full multi-hop comparison — specifically, the quantitative difference in digital sales performance between the two companies — which is central to the question. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, time period, and metric (digital impact on comparable sales). The structure and intent align well with the question, but the factual inaccuracy on NKE’s digital decline and omission of the final comparative metric reduce correctness.

TGT operated 245,939 million square feet as of February 3, 2024, while WMT reported 699 million square feet as of January 31, 2024. This large disparity indicates that WMT maintains a significantly larger retail footprint, but TGT has increased its retail square feet slightly from 244,584 million to 245,939 million, whereas WMT has reduced its retail square feet from 702 million in the prior year to 699 million, suggesting contrasting strategies in store expansion or contraction.",

Additionally, the difference is stated as 'roughly 800 million sq ft', but the correct difference is only about 453 million sq ft (245,939 million - 699 million), though the original answer appears to have a unit error (likely meant 245.9 million and 699 million, not 'million' for both in the hundreds of thousands). The LLM also misrepresents Target’s square footage: it says 245,939 thousand sq ft (i.e., ~246 million), which matches the ground truth, but then inconsistently uses units. (2) The calculation of the difference is incorrect due to the erroneous Walmart figure. The LLM’s use of '1,053 thousand sq ft' implies 1.053 million, not 1.05 billion—this suggests a fundamental unit confusion. (3) The reasoning about contrasting strategies (Walmart expanding, Target growing modestly) is partially sound, but contradicts the ground truth: the ground truth states Walmart *reduced* from 702 million to 699 million (contraction), while the LLM claims Walmart is in 'ongoing large-scale expansion', which is factually wrong. Target’s slight increase is correctly noted.

This is explicitly stated in Disney's 10-K, which notes that declines in traditional forms of distribution have led to higher costs being allocated to DTC offerings. Meanwhile, Meta's advertising business is affected by changes in feed display and ranking algorithms that reduce time spent and user engagement, which in turn lowers advertising effectiveness and revenue. The 10-K explicitly states that these algorithmic changes have reduced, and may continue to reduce, the distribution of content by publishers and marketers, lowering their incentive to invest in Meta's platform. Both companies report that these content distribution challenges directly affect their financial performance: Disney through increased costs and reduced profitability in its DTC segment, and Meta through lower ad targeting capabilities and reduced engagement metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Disney (2023 10‑K – page 20):**  The filing says that the industry‑wide decline in “traditional forms of distribution” (e.g., broadcast‑cable and home‑entertainment sales) raises the cost of the content that must be allocated to its Direct‑to‑Consumer (DTC) services and, because Disney forgoes revenue from those legacy channels, “declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings.”  The mechanism is therefore a cost‑plus‑revenue shift – higher content‑cost burden on DTC combined with lost legacy‑distribution revenue – which the filing links directly to lower DTC profitability and ongoing streaming losses.\n\n- **Meta (2023 10‑K – pages 23‑24 and 21):**  Meta explains that changes to its data‑privacy tools and platform‑distribution rules (e.g., the Off‑Facebook Activity tool, browser‑cookie restrictions, and iOS/Android updates) “reduce our ability to effectively target ads” and “limit our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users,” which “has… adversely affected… our advertising business.”  The mechanism is an explicit reduction in ad‑targeting and measurement capability that translates into weaker ad performance and lower advertising revenue, thereby hurting Meta’s advertising profitability.",

(1) It correctly identifies the key mechanisms from both Disney's and Meta's 2023 10-K filings that link content distribution challenges to financial performance. For Disney, it accurately describes how declines in traditional distribution increase the cost of content allocable to DTC offerings, negatively impacting profitability—this matches the original answer verbatim in substance and cites the correct mechanism (cost allocation and lost legacy revenue). For Meta, it correctly identifies that changes in data privacy tools and platform rules (e.g., iOS updates, cookie restrictions) reduce ad targeting effectiveness, which harms advertising revenue and profitability. (2) There are no numerical values in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a traditional sense, but all factual assertions (e.g., page numbers, policy names) are consistent and correctly referenced. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two different companies, business models (DTC vs. advertising), and causal chains (content cost allocation and ad targeting degradation), correctly linking each to financial outcomes. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer emphasizes privacy and tracking changes (e.g., iOS updates) more than algorithmic feed changes (e.g., ranking algorithms reducing content distribution), which were explicitly highlighted in the ground truth. While Meta’s reduced content distribution due to algorithmic changes is implied in broader platform rules, the LLM slightly shifts focus to privacy tools rather than feed-ranking mechanisms. However, both factors are present in Meta’s 10-K and contribute to reduced ad effectiveness, so this is a nuance rather than a factual error.

This reverses the conclusion in the original answer. (2) Numeric values are accurate—$0.9 billion and $924.7 million are correctly reported, and the conversion to $0.925 billion is acceptable as an approximation. However, the comparative calculation is flawed: $924.7 million is not larger than $900 million; thus, the direction of the difference is incorrect.

      "original_answer": "The difference in pension expense treatment under FAS and CAS standards leads to a divergence in cost recognition patterns between financial reporting and government contract pricing. LMT reports a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million in 2021, which reflects the difference between CAS expenses (used in pricing contracts) and FAS service costs (used in GAAP financial reporting). RTX explains that CAS pension expense includes service cost and amortization of demographic or economic variances, and is only recognized for unfunded plans, whereas FAS pension expense includes service cost and is generally recognized for all plans. This implies that both companies must reconcile these differences to recover pension costs through U.S. government contracts, with RTX noting that changes in plan funding status can directly affect CAS expense and thus the FAS/CAS operating adjustment.",

The adjustment is the “gap” between the FAS‑measured pension service cost and the CAS‑measured pension cost – CAS only records expense for under‑funded plans and therefore usually exceeds the FAS service‑cost component, creating a favorable adjustment.  Because both companies recover CAS‑allowed pension costs through U.S.‑government contract pricing, the larger adjustment at Lockheed Martin indicates a greater portion of its pension expense is deemed allowable and recoverable under CAS, while Raytheon’s smaller adjustment shows a comparatively lower recoverable pension cost under its government contracts.",

It also correctly notes that both companies recover CAS-allowed costs through U.S. government contracts, and draws a reasonable implication about cost recovery mechanisms. However, there are key quantitative inaccuracies: the RTX 2021 adjustment is stated as -$1.80 billion, but the ground truth does not provide RTX's exact 2021 figure, so this number is unsupported and potentially incorrect. The LMT 2021 figure of -$1.96 billion is accurate (matches $1,960 million), but the LLM rounds it to ≈$2 billion without clarifying the direction (negative adjustment), which may mislead. The RTX 2020 figure of -$1.11 billion is not in the ground truth and cannot be verified, suggesting fabrication or error. (2) The ground truth emphasizes that CAS includes service cost plus amortization of variances and is only for unfunded plans, while FAS includes service cost for all plans—this is partially captured, but the LLM omits the amortization of demographic/economic variances, a key component. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is generally sound: it connects pension accounting differences to the operating adjustment and infers implications for cost recovery.

      "original_answer": "Coca-Cola (KO) experienced structural refranchising activities in Asia Pacific during 2024, including the refranchising of bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023, and in territories in India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines in early 2024. These refranchisings were included as structural changes in the analysis of net operating revenues and impacted the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments. KO distinguishes between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume, noting that structural changes typically do not affect consolidated unit case volume, which reflects all sales of Company beverage products regardless of ownership interest in the bottling partner. In contrast, Altria (MO) incorporates volume growth rates as a key assumption in determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the NJOY transaction, particularly for future growth opportunities in the e-vapor category. MO used an income approach with Level 3 fair value inputs, including discounted cash flow analyses based on volume growth projections and operating margins, and amortizes these intangible assets over approximately 18 years. This reflects a forward-looking financial valuation approach, whereas KO’s use of volume growth is operational and tied to current structural changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Coca‑Cola’s 2024 refranchising of bottling operations in India, Bangladesh and the Philippines was treated as a “structural change” that was reflected in the unit‑case‑volume metrics – it drove a 23 % decline in Bottling‑Investments volume (the segment that only counts consolidated bottlers) while the overall Asia‑Pacific system still posted a modest 1 % unit‑case‑volume increase. In contrast, Altria does not adjust any reported volume metric; instead, it builds its own projected volume‑growth rates for the e‑vapor business into the discounted‑cash‑flow models used to value the intangible assets (goodwill and other intangibles) acquired in the NJOY transaction. Thus, Coca‑Cola’s refranchising directly alters the volume numbers it reports, whereas Altria’s volume assumptions are an internal input to the valuation of acquired intangibles.",

However, there are significant quantitative inaccuracies that undermine the correctness score. The claim that Coca-Cola's refranchising drove a '23% decline in Bottling-Investments volume' and a '1% unit-case-volume increase' in Asia-Pacific is not supported by the original answer, which does not provide any specific percentage impacts on volume. These figures are fabricated or misattributed, failing the quantitative accuracy check. Additionally, the original answer notes that structural changes like refranchising do *not* affect consolidated unit case volume, which contradicts the LLM's assertion that such changes 'directly alter the volume numbers it reports'—this misrepresents KO's methodology. The LLM also omits key details such as the Vietnam refranchising in January 2023 and the distinction between concentrate sales volume and unit case volume. On the Altria side, the answer correctly identifies that MO uses volume growth projections in DCF models for valuing NJOY intangibles and amortizes over ~18 years (implied in original), though the LLM does not mention the Level 3 fair value inputs or income approach explicitly. The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking KO’s structural changes to reporting metrics and contrasting with MO’s valuation approach—but flawed in execution due to incorrect numerical claims and mischaracterization of KO’s volume reporting.

      "original_answer": "Disney faces potential monetary fines from FCC violations related to its television broadcasting operations, which include the licensing of stations that must be renewed every up to eight years. Non-renewal or revocation of these licenses due to violations could result in significant financial penalties and operational disruptions. Meta, on the other hand, is subject to substantial monetary remedies from non-compliance with its FTC consent order and other global privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. The FTC has already initiated proceedings seeking significant modifications to the consent order, including restrictions on data usage and potential board changes, which could lead to costly compliance adjustments and monetary penalties. While both companies face exposure to regulatory fines, Meta's liabilities appear broader and more complex due to the global nature of its regulatory obligations and the potential for sweeping operational changes.",

A violation can trigger regulatory actions such as fines (the FCC cites penalties of > $400 k per indecent utterance), limits on license renewal or even loss of a license, but the risk is confined to the relatively small number of stations and the specific broadcast rules. By contrast, Meta’s regulatory liabilities stem from its FTC consent order and a host of global privacy and competition regimes; the company faces “substantial monetary fines,” possible injunctive relief and costly operational changes that could run into hundreds of millions (or more) of dollars, making Meta’s potential financial exposure far larger than Disney’s FCC‑related risk.",

General Motors' forfeited units had a weighted-average grant date fair value of $36.55 per unit, while Lowe's forfeited units had an average grant-date fair value of $205.94 per unit.

The slight rounding in the LLM's presentation (e.g., $98 million vs $98.685 million) is acceptable under semantic equivalence and common reporting practices. The total combined value is approximately $108.7 million in the LLM answer versus $109.393 million in the original, a minor difference due to rounding, not error. (2) Calculations are accurate: 2.7 million × $36.55 = $98.685 million (correctly rounded to $98 million); 52,000 × $205.94 = $10,708,880 ≈ $10.7 million. All per-unit grant date fair values ($36.55 for GM, $205.94 for Lowe's) are exactly correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is correctly synthesized across two companies (GM and Lowe's), their respective 2023 fiscal year data, and the interpretation connects the difference in grant date fair values to equity compensation strategies.

It accurately reports the FAS/CAS operating adjustments for both LMT ($1.96 billion = $1,960 million) and RTX ($1.80 billion = $1,796 million, rounded appropriately). The segment operating profits ($7.38 billion vs $7,379 million and $6.05 billion vs $6,050 million) are correctly stated with acceptable rounding. The consolidated operating profits are correctly reported: $9.12 billion for LMT (matches $9,123 million, minor rounding) and $4.96 billion for RTX (matches $4,958 million, rounded to nearest $10M). (2) Calculations are implied correctly: for LMT, $7.38B + $1.96B = $9.34B before other adjustments — but the answer correctly reflects the final consolidated figure after all reconciliations, consistent with the ground truth. For RTX, the answer correctly notes that the adjustment is added but other corporate expenses and acquisition adjustments reduce the total, resulting in a lower consolidated profit than the sum of segment and FAS/CAS adjustment. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two companies (LMT and RTX), correctly identifies the mechanism (FAS vs CAS pension cost differences), and explains how the adjustment flows into consolidated operating profit. It adds contextual insight — that CAS costs are higher, making the adjustment favorable — which enhances the explanation beyond the ground truth. (4) Minor rounding differences do not affect factual correctness. The answer is complete, addressing both the quantitative impact and the mechanism. Scores reflect high accuracy with a small deduction in quantitative accuracy due to rounding of RTX's adjustment from $1,796M to $1.80B (slightly high) and consolidated profit from $4,958M to $4.96B, but these are within acceptable reporting norms.",

The obligations data for KO is correct: a reduction from $1,421 million to $1,330 million, resulting in a $91 million reduction. However, the LLM makes a critical error in interpreting MO's obligation change: it states MO had a $9 million increase (from $119M to $128M), which is correct numerically, but then concludes that KO had the larger net reduction. While technically true that only KO had a reduction, the original answer clarifies that MO had a net *increase*, so the phrase 'larger net reduction' implies a comparison of reduction magnitudes. Since MO did not reduce obligations at all, saying KO had the 'larger' reduction is misleading but not factually wrong—KO is the only one with a reduction. (2) All numbers are quantitatively accurate: $5,105M, $563M, difference ~$4.54B (matches $4,542M), KO's $91M reduction correct, MO's $9M increase correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model pulls data for both companies across invoice confirmations and obligation changes. However, the qualitative interpretation of 'larger net reduction' could be sharper—MO increased obligations, so it didn’t reduce at all; thus, KO is the sole reducer, not just the 'larger' one. (4) Scores justified: correctness 8 due to accurate data but slightly imprecise comparative conclusion; quantitative accuracy 9 (only minor rounding to $4.54B acceptable); qualitative accuracy 8 due to correct synthesis but suboptimal logic framing; contextual relevance 10 as all information directly addresses the question parts.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is completely incorrect in both numbers and direction of change. According to the ground truth, AVGO's deferred tax liabilities increased from $5,030M to $5,117M (an $87M increase), not from -$1,141M to -$1,112M as claimed. CSCO's balance decreased from $3,106M to $3,101M (a $5M decrease), not from -$134M to -$55M as stated. The LLM reports a combined increase of $108M, while the correct combined change is $87M - $5M = $82M net increase — but critically, the ground truth states the combined increase is $0M due to data reconciliation in the knowledge graph, implying either no net change or offsetting movements. However, the LLM’s numbers are not only wrong but appear to misread negative values as positive increases, suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding. (2) The cited figures for AVGO and CSCO are entirely inconsistent with the ground truth: -$1,141M and -$1,112M for AVGO do not match the true values of $5,030M and $5,117M; similarly, CSCO’s reported -$134M and -$55M are wildly off from $3,106M and $3,101M. Calculations based on these wrong numbers ($29M and $79M increases) are therefore invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not correctly extract or synthesize data for either company across years. It misrepresented both the magnitude and sign of the balances, possibly confusing deferred tax assets/liabilities or misreading footnotes. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero — the model attempted to address the right metric (ending balance of deferred tax liabilities) for the correct companies and years — hence a minimal score of 3 for relevance. However, due to catastrophic failures in quantitative and qualitative accuracy, the correctness score is 1: the answer is effectively wrong in all material aspects.",

      "original_answer": "Gilead Sciences (GILD) faces civil monetary penalties due to potential non-compliance with FDA regulations, particularly in manufacturing and post-approval requirements, which could lead to product recalls, suspension of approvals, and reputational damage. These penalties are tied to operational risks such as product quality failures and remediation costs. In contrast, Eli Lilly (LLY) faces civil monetary penalties stemming from non-compliance with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly its new manufacturer discount program under Medicare Part D, which begins in 2025. The IRA-mandated penalties could significantly affect LLY’s revenue, especially for products like Jardiance, which is subject to a 66% discount under the government price-setting mechanism starting in 2026. While both companies face civil monetary penalties, GILD’s exposure is rooted in regulatory compliance and product safety, whereas LLY’s is tied to legislative reforms impacting pricing and reimbursement, with direct financial consequences from mandated discounts and rebate obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead’s 10‑K notes that any failure to meet FDA‑imposed requirements – such as cGMP, safety‑reporting, post‑approval study or promotional‑practice rules – could trigger “significant civil monetary penalties, fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls or even criminal prosecutions.” Because those penalties arise from core compliance with the agency that governs drug approval and manufacturing, they add a broad regulatory‑risk overlay that could material‑ly increase Gilead’s litigation‑related costs and erode cash flow if a violation occurs.  \n\nEli Lilly’s filing, by contrast, ties civil monetary penalties specifically to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and related pricing‑rebate statutes – for example, the IRA’s Medicare‑price‑setting and Part B/Part D rebate provisions that impose penalties on manufacturers that do not comply with the new discount and reporting rules. Those penalties therefore sharpen Lilly’s financial‑risk profile around price‑setting, reimbursement and 340B compliance, creating a direct, potentially large‑scale cash‑outlay risk that is distinct from the more general FDA‑compliance exposure faced by Gilead.",

(1) It correctly identifies that Gilead Sciences (GILD) faces civil monetary penalties related to FDA compliance risks—specifically cGMP, safety reporting, post-approval studies, and promotional practices—leading to potential fines, product recalls, and approval suspensions. This matches the original answer’s emphasis on manufacturing and post-approval regulatory risks. (2) For Eli Lilly (LLY), the LLM correctly ties civil monetary penalties to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), particularly its Medicare Part D pricing and rebate provisions, which is consistent with the ground truth. It accurately notes that these penalties affect financial risk through mandated discounts and reporting obligations, though it does not explicitly mention the 66% discount on Jardiance starting in 2026—a specific detail present in the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information across two companies, different regulatory frameworks (FDA vs. IRA), and distinct risk profiles (regulatory/compliance vs. financial/pricing), correctly contrasting their nature and impact. (4) All entities (GILD, LLY, FDA, IRA, Medicare Part D/B) are correctly identified, and no incorrect dates or numbers are introduced. While the LLM omits the specific 66% discount and Jardiance example, it captures the core legislative mechanism and financial implications. Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no numerical claims are made that contradict or misstate the truth. Wording differs but meaning is semantically equivalent.

The ground truth states a $1,100 million ($1.1 billion) increase, but the LLM claims an increase from $27,450 million to $33,203 million, which is a $5,753 million (~$5.8 billion) increase—this is incorrect and contradicts the verified data. This major quantitative discrepancy severely impacts correctness. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is mathematically correct ($33,203M - $27,450M = $5,753M), but the underlying numbers do not align with the ground truth, suggesting the model used incorrect input data. The actual increase of $1,100 million must be derived from accurate fiscal year 2021 and 2022 figures, which the model failed to report.

      "original_answer": "GE's Renewable Energy segment saw a positive revenue mix effect, particularly from increased demand in Onshore Wind projects in the U.S. and a significant $2 gigawatt HVDC systems agreement in Grid Solutions, which contributed to a $5.7 billion (22%) increase in segment revenues.

      "llm_answer": "GE’s Renewable‑Energy mix turned more favorable in 2023 – Onshore‑Wind equipment sales in North America and higher Grid‑Solutions equipment‑and‑services revenue lifted the segment’s top line by $2.1 billion (a 16 % rise) and trimmed the segment loss by about $0.8 billion (a 36 % improvement, moving the margin from –17.3 % to –9.5 %). In contrast, Union Pacific saw a deteriorating traffic mix: fewer food‑ and refrigerated‑bulk shipments and a shift to lower‑margin short‑haul rock in the Bulk segment (revenue down 2 %) and a negative mix in Industrial (flat revenue but lower‑margin mix), which helped pull total freight revenue down 3 % to $22.6 billion for the year.",

The ground truth states that GE's Renewable Energy segment revenue increased by $5.7 billion (22%), but the LLM claims only a $2.1 billion (16%) increase, which is materially lower and incorrect. Additionally, the LLM introduces specific margin improvements (from –17.3% to –9.5%) and a segment loss reduction of $0.8 billion (36% improvement), which are not present in the original answer and appear to be fabricated or hallucinated. For Union Pacific, the original answer does not specify a 3% decline in total freight revenue or a final revenue figure of $22.6 billion—these numbers are absent from the ground truth, making them unsupported additions. The negative mix effects in Bulk (shift to short-haul rock) and Industrial (fewer food/refrigerated shipments) are correctly identified and contextually relevant. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the $5.7B vs $2.1B revenue increase for GE is a major discrepancy; the 22% vs 16% growth misrepresents performance; the $22.6B freight revenue and 3% decline for Union Pacific are not in the original and cannot be verified. The $2 gigawatt HVDC agreement mentioned in the original is entirely omitted. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly contrasts GE’s positive mix with Union Pacific’s negative mix and identifies relevant business drivers. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the correct financial impacts, especially the magnitude of GE’s revenue growth and the absence of specific UP revenue declines in the source.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Broadcom's revenue from contracts with customers under ASC 606 for fiscal year 2022 was $22,164 million, but the LLM reports $33,203 million, which appears to be Broadcom's total revenue rather than just revenue from contracts with customers as defined under ASC 606. Similarly, Cisco's total product and service revenue is reported as $23,264 million in the ground truth (for the period ending July 30, 2022), but the LLM incorrectly states $31,539 million, which exceeds Cisco's actual total revenue for that period. (2) The calculations are based on incorrect inputs: $33,203M + $31,539M = $64,742M is mathematically correct, but both source numbers are wrong, making the final sum incorrect. The correct sum is $22,164M + $23,264M = $45,428M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—combining revenue figures from two companies for the same fiscal period under ASC 606 alignment—but fails due to incorrect data extraction from the source documents. The model misidentifies the relevant revenue line items, likely confusing total revenue with revenue from contracts with customers. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies, time frame, and reporting standard (ASC 606), but the use of incorrect financial figures severely undermines factual accuracy. Due to major quantitative and qualitative errors, the correctness score is very low.",

      "question": "How does the uncertainty in estimating future costs under long-term service agreements at GE and personal injury liabilities at UNP affect their respective financial statement disclosures, and what specific accounting standards or practices do they reference in managing these uncertainties?",
      "original_answer": "GE manages uncertainty in estimating future costs for long-term service agreements under ASC 606, using the percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs relative to total estimated costs. This involves significant judgment in estimating future utilization, overhaul timing, and cost changes, with audit procedures including retrospective reviews and specialist evaluations. GE also follows ASU 2018-12 (LDTI) for future policy benefits, which requires current assumptions on long-duration contracts, including $26,832 million in long-term care liabilities. UNP, on the other hand, accounts for personal injury liabilities under FELA, recording accruals at the low end of a probable range when outcomes are uncertain, with a disclosed range of $383 million to $494 million. Both companies emphasize the need for extensive judgment, sensitivity analysis, and audit involvement to address the financial reporting implications of these uncertain future costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Both companies disclose that the biggest source of judgment‑related uncertainty is the estimate of future costs. General Electric notes that revenue from its Power‑segment long‑term service contracts is recognized on a percentage‑of‑completion basis (i.e., the ASC 606/GAAP “cost‑to‑complete” method) and that management must estimate customer utilization, timing and amount of future maintenance, outage and material costs; the filing therefore contains extensive narrative of the assumptions, the related audit‑risk assessment and references to the PCAOB audit standards that govern the evaluation of those estimates. Union Pacific, by contrast, discloses a range of possible settlement amounts for its personal‑injury (FELA) claims and records an accrual at the low end of that range because no single amount is more probable, a treatment that follows the GAAP contingency guidance in ASC 450 (Contingencies) and the related practice of estimating and accruing liabilities based on the best‑estimate range.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the core information from the ground truth with strong semantic equivalence. (1) All factual elements are correct: GE uses percentage-of-completion under ASC 606 for long-term service agreements, involving judgment on future costs, utilization, and maintenance timing; UNP accounts for personal injury liabilities under FELA and accrues at the low end of a probable range per ASC 450. These accounting standards (ASC 606, ASC 450) are correctly identified. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—while the LLM does not include the specific $26,832 million long-term care liability figure or the $383M–$494M range mentioned in the ground truth, these omissions do not distort the meaning or correctness of the response; the absence is a minor completeness gap, not an error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer correctly distinguishes between GE’s revenue recognition uncertainty and UNP’s contingent liability treatment, synthesizing different standards and disclosures across two companies. (4) The LLM references audit risk, PCAOB standards, and management assumptions, adding contextual depth consistent with the original. The only minor shortcoming is the omission of ASU 2018-12 and the specific numerical ranges, which are part of GE’s and UNP’s disclosures in the ground truth. However, the core accounting practices, standards, and reasoning are accurately represented.

The derivative liabilities for NFLX under 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' are reported as $140,089 thousand, which may be correct, but Meta's 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' are stated as $2,168 million ($2,168,000 thousand), which is vastly inflated. The ground truth combined total is $142,257 thousand, implying that Meta's actual value must be around $2,168 thousand — not million. The LLM incorrectly interpreted Meta's figure as $2,168 million instead of $2,168 thousand, leading to a grossly inflated sum. (2) The calculation $140,089 + $2,168,000 = $2,308,089 thousand is mathematically correct but based on a fundamentally wrong input. The correct total should be approximately $140,089 + $2,168 = $142,257 thousand. This misinterpretation of units (thousands vs. millions) invalidates the quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: while the model identifies the correct line items and companies, it misreads the scale of Meta’s liability, indicating a failure in contextual understanding of financial statement units typically reported in thousands. (4) Due to the severe numerical inaccuracy stemming from unit confusion, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.

      "original_answer": "Gilead Sciences capitalized and treated acquired IPR&D projects as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which led to a significant $800 million impairment charge in 2019 when the value of projects related to the treatment of indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma declined due to changes in market opportunities. In contrast, Abbott Laboratories generally expensed IPR&D costs as incurred unless the project had an alternative future use. This reveals that Gilead took on more financial risk by capitalizing IPR&D, exposing it to potential impairment charges, whereas Abbott's approach resulted in more immediate expense recognition and lower long-term asset exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead’s 2019 filing shows that it had capitalized acquired IPR&D projects and, when the expected market opportunity for a lymphoma program fell, recorded an **$800 million impairment charge** to write the assets down to fair value. By contrast, Abbott’s accounting policy states that **initial IPR&D costs are expensed as incurred unless the project has an alternative future use**, and only IPR&D acquired in a business combination is capitalized as an indefinite‑life intangible that is tested for impairment each quarter. The difference indicates that Gilead is willing to capitalize early‑stage research and absorb large write‑downs if prospects change, while Abbott takes a more conservative, expense‑as‑incurred approach to limit balance‑sheet exposure to early‑stage R&D risk.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers and dates are correct: the $800 million impairment charge by Gilead Sciences in 2019 is accurately reported, and there are no calculation errors. (2) Entity accuracy is strong: both Gilead Sciences and Abbott Laboratories are correctly identified, along with the relevant accounting treatments and time frame (2019). (3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes multi-hop information: it contrasts Gilead’s capitalization and subsequent impairment of IPR&D with Abbott’s general policy of expensing IPR&D unless there is an alternative future use, noting that only acquired IPR&D in business combinations is capitalized by Abbott. This reflects a nuanced understanding of differing accounting policies. (4) The answer captures the core strategic implication: Gilead assumes greater financial risk by capitalizing early-stage projects, leading to potential large impairments, while Abbott’s approach limits balance-sheet exposure through conservative expensing. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM slightly expands on Abbott’s policy by mentioning quarterly impairment testing, which, while plausible, is not present in the ground truth and not explicitly required for the comparison. However, this does not detract from the overall correctness. Semantic equivalence is maintained, and the answer fully addresses the contrast and its strategic implications.",

This is a major error in both the lower bound and the average. Bank of America (BAC) values are mostly correct: 5% to 97% range and ~25% average align with the original answer.

This discrepancy of $1 billion affects quantitative accuracy. All other numbers are correct: Amazon's operating income ($68.6B), McDonald's operating income ($11.7B), McDonald's operating margin (45%), and Amazon's growth rate is approximately correct (86% vs. actual 85%, calculated from $36.9B in 2023 to $68.6B in 2024). The 86% is a reasonable rounding but slightly overstates the precise 85.07% growth. 2) The combined income should be $79.3B, not $80.3B — this is a clear arithmetic error. The growth rate is correctly derived from year-over-year change, though rounded up. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies' financials, computes growth, and compares margin to growth rate.

      "original_answer": "Apple explicitly quantifies its right-of-use (ROU) assets in its 2022 financial statements, reporting $10,417 million for operating leases and $952 million for finance leases, totaling $11,369 million. In contrast, while AMD discloses its policy to record ROU assets and lease liabilities for both operating and finance leases, it does not provide specific dollar amounts for its ROU assets in the provided excerpt. This reveals that Apple offers greater quantitative transparency regarding its lease obligations, whereas AMD's disclosure is primarily qualitative and policy-focused. The difference highlights varying levels of detail in lease accounting disclosures between the two companies, which could impact investor understanding of their balance sheet strength and lease-related risks.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s 2022 filing breaks out its right‑of‑use assets and lease liabilities in detail: operating‑lease ROU assets of $10.4 billion are shown in “Other non‑current assets” and finance‑lease ROU assets of $0.95 billion are included in property‑plant‑equipment, with separate current and non‑current lease‑liability tables, maturity schedules, cash vs. non‑cash activity and discount‑rate assumptions. AMD’s 2022 filing merely states that operating and finance leases are recorded as ROU assets and liabilities, notes that it does not recognize short‑term leases and that finance leases are immaterial, but provides no dollar amounts or maturity breakdowns.

The absence of specific ROU asset figures for AMD is correctly noted. (2) The answer correctly identifies that Apple provides detailed disclosures including maturity schedules, cash flow breakdowns, and discount rate assumptions, which supports the claim of granular transparency. (3) For AMD, the LLM accurately reflects that while policy-level disclosure is present—such as non-recognition of short-term leases and immateriality of finance leases—no quantitative data on ROU assets or liabilities is provided. (4) The reasoning is sound and synthesizes multi-hop information: it contrasts Apple’s detailed, quantitative approach with AMD’s high-level, qualitative disclosure, correctly concluding that Apple offers greater transparency. (5) The only minor limitation is that the LLM does not explicitly state the total ROU asset amount ($11,369 million) as the original answer does, though this can be inferred from the components.

However, it incorrectly applies the same regulatory minimum (18.0%) to both firms. The ground truth specifies that BAC's required ratio is 21.5%, not 18.0%. Therefore, the LLM's calculation of BAC exceeding the minimum by 'about 11 pp' (29.0% - 18.0%) is incorrect; the correct excess is 7.5 percentage points (29.0% - 21.5%). This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The calculation for MS exceeding the regulatory minimum is correct: 55.0% - 18.0% = 37.0 pp. The difference between the two firms' TLAC ratios (55.0% - 29.0% = 26.0 pp) is correctly computed but not directly asked in the question — it's extra. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the model identifies both firms' metrics, time periods, and compares them to a regulatory floor. However, it fails to recognize that regulatory minimums differ by institution, leading to an incorrect assessment of BAC's compliance margin. This undermines the accuracy of the comparative conclusion about which firm exceeds its minimum by a larger margin — although the final conclusion (MS exceeds by a larger margin) is correct, it is based on flawed reasoning for BAC.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains minor inaccuracies in the reported Level 3 pension investments for CVS and the resulting calculations. The ground truth states CVS has $290 million in Level 3 assets, while the LLM reports $277 million, a discrepancy of $13 million. This affects the difference calculation: the correct difference is $410 million ($700M - $290M), but the LLM calculates $423 million ($700M - $277M), which is incorrect due to the initial error. (2) Total pension investments are reported accurately: $4.351 billion for CVS (matches $4,352M approximately) and $19.364 billion for MRK (consistent with ground truth). Percentages are close but slightly off due to incorrect inputs: LLM reports 6.4% for CVS (correct calculation using $277M / $4,351M ≈ 6.37%) vs. ground truth 6.66% ($290M / $4,352M), and 3.6% for MRK (LLM) vs. 4% (ground truth). The MRK percentage should be $700M / $17.5B ≈ 4%, suggesting the ground truth uses a lower total than LLM’s $19.364B—this introduces ambiguity, but since the original answer implies MRK’s total is ~$17.5B ($700M / 0.04), the LLM may have used an incorrect total. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts Level 3 values, computes differences, and expresses them as percentages of total pension investments. However, the use of incorrect base numbers reduces quantitative accuracy. (4) Despite numerical discrepancies, the LLM conveys the correct direction and relative scale: MRK has more Level 3 assets than CVS, and they represent a small percentage of total pension funds.

In contrast, RTX excludes the FAS/CAS operating adjustment when reporting organic changes in operating profit for year-over-year comparability, treating it as a non-recurring, non-operational item to provide transparency into the underlying performance of the business.

This aligns with the ground truth's core reasoning and entity-specific practices.\n\nHowever, the LLM answer fails on quantitative accuracy. The original answer specifies that in 2021, the FAS/CAS adjustment increased LMT’s consolidated operating profit by $1,960 million, moving it from $7,379 million (business segment total) to $9,123 million. The LLM answer omits all these figures and does not mention the year 2021 at all, despite the question referencing 2022 financial reporting. While the treatment may persist into 2022, the ground truth data is explicitly tied to 2021, and the absence of any numbers constitutes a significant omission in a question asking about financial reporting impact.\n\nAdditionally, the LLM implies that LMT 'removes' the adjustment from segments to make them comparable—this is correct—but then says it shows it under 'Unallocated items' as a reconciling item, which is consistent with the ground truth. However, the ground truth emphasizes that this inclusion *directly affects* consolidated operating profit, a point the LLM downplays, potentially understating LMT’s incorporation of the adjustment into its headline profit figure.\n\nRTX’s treatment is accurately described: excluding FAS/CAS from organic operating profit for comparability, alongside other non-recurring items. The multi-hop reasoning—comparing two companies’ accounting treatments for the same item in the context of profit comparability—is sound and well-synthesized.\n\nIn summary: the reasoning and entity identification are strong, and the answer is contextually relevant, but the lack of specific financial figures and incorrect temporal framing (no mention of 2021 data) reduces factual completeness and numerical accuracy.",

Netflix spent $439.538 million on similar purchases, which is significantly lower and indicates a lesser emphasis on physical infrastructure.

According to the ground truth, Meta spent $37.26 billion and Netflix spent $439.538 million in 2024 on property and equipment, resulting in a combined total of $37.70 billion. However, the LLM incorrectly states that Meta spent $13.8 billion and Netflix spent $37.3 billion—reversing the scale of investment and attributing Meta’s actual spending to Netflix. This leads to an incorrect combined total of $51.1 billion instead of $37.70 billion. (2) The calculation errors are severe: not only are the inputs wrong, but the sum of $13.8B + $37.3B = $51.1B is mathematically correct, but based on false premises. The actual sum ($37.26B + $0.439538B) is approximately $37.70B, which the model fails to compute correctly due to incorrect inputs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The model misattributes the large infrastructure spending to Netflix, which contradicts the ground truth that Meta is the heavy investor in physical infrastructure (data centers, AI), while Netflix focuses more on content than property and equipment. The explanation of strategy is therefore inverted: it claims Netflix’s 'much larger outlay' is for infrastructure, when in fact Netflix spends far less than Meta on such items. (4) Due to these critical inaccuracies in numbers, entities, and logical inference, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low.

This, in turn, may result in higher utilization of medical services and increased claims costs for health insurers like CVS. However, CVS has stated in its 10-K that it faces limitations in detecting, forecasting, and pricing for medical cost trends, especially during periods of significant volatility in utilization and costs. The ACA and other regulations further restrict CVS's ability to adjust pricing based on these increased costs.

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) It correctly identifies Merck's supply constraints for ProQuad and Gardasil, including the pause in shipments to China, and notes declining global demand—consistent with the 3% sales decline in China mentioned in the original answer. While the exact percentage (3%) is not cited, the directional trend is correct and no incorrect numbers are introduced. (2) All entities—Merck, CVS, ProQuad, Gardasil, Varivax (additional but not incorrect), and the Health Care Benefits segment—are accurately referenced. The time context (2024 filing) is plausible and consistent with the knowledge graph. (3) The reasoning correctly traces the chain: supply constraints + lower demand → utilization volatility → challenges in forecasting medical costs → pricing limitations due to regulation (specifically referencing ACA-like constraints via 'legislation limits such pricing') → impact on CVS’s ability to adjust premiums in time. This reflects sound multi-hop synthesis across Merck’s operational issues and CVS’s financial risk management constraints. (4) The LLM emphasizes CVS’s inability to price for projected cost increases, directly quoting the 10-K language, which matches the original answer’s core point. The only minor omission is not explicitly stating the public health consequence (e.g., increased disease incidence), which is part of the causal chain in the ground truth. However, the focus on cost volatility and claims experience captures the financial impact adequately for the Health Care Benefits segment. Wording differs but semantic meaning is equivalent. No calculation errors. Format variations are acceptable. Overall, this is a strong, factually correct response with only a slight gap in completeness regarding disease incidence implications.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of long-term lease liabilities for Amazon and McDonald's in 2024 is $91,335 million. Amazon reports long-term lease liabilities of $78,277 million, while McDonald's reports $13,058 million in long-term lease liabilities. This indicates that Amazon carries a significantly larger burden of long-term lease obligations compared to McDonald's, reflecting a more asset-intensive and lease-dependent capital structure.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon reported $78,277 million of long‑term lease liabilities for 2024, and McDonald’s reported $12,888 million for the same year. Combined, the two companies carry about $91,165 million (≈ $91.2 billion) in long‑term lease obligations. This shows that lease financing makes up a far larger share of Amazon’s capital structure—reflecting its extensive fulfillment‑center and data‑center footprint—whereas McDonald’s relies on a comparatively modest amount of long‑term lease debt relative to its overall financing mix.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct in structure and reasoning but contains a significant numerical inaccuracy in McDonald's long-term lease liabilities. The ground truth reports $13,058 million for McDonald's, while the LLM states $12,888 million—a difference of $170 million. This error propagates to the combined total: the correct sum is $91,335 million, but the LLM calculates $91,165 million, underestimating by $170 million. While the format variation (e.g., $91.2 billion) is acceptable, the underlying numbers must be accurate. (2) Quantitative verification: Amazon’s figure ($78,277 million) is correct; McDonald’s is incorrect ($12,888M vs. $13,058M); combined total should be $78,277 + $13,058 = $91,335M, not $91,165M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly identifies both companies, the relevant metric (long-term lease liabilities), and synthesizes them into a combined total. The qualitative interpretation about Amazon’s asset-intensive, lease-dependent model versus McDonald’s more modest reliance is logically consistent with the data and reflects accurate understanding of capital structure implications. (4) Correctness score is 7 because core facts are mostly right (Amazon’s number, general comparison, conceptual interpretation), but the incorrect McDonald’s value and resulting miscalculation prevent a higher score. Quantitative accuracy is penalized more (6) due to the materiality of the $170M error. Qualitative accuracy is high (8) as reasoning and entity identification are correct.

It reports GD's net pension-related expense as $72 million ($87M charge - $15M credit), but the ground truth indicates the correct combined impact of GD's settlement/curtailment/other expense is not $72M. More critically, the LLM states GE's Sjunde A P-Fonden lawsuit settlement cost was $363 million, whereas the ground truth is $276 million. The final combined total in the LLM answer is $435 million, which is incorrect; the correct total is $348 million. (2) Calculation verification: even if the inputs were correct, the LLM’s arithmetic (e.g., $87M - (-$15M) = $72M) is mathematically sound, but the inputs themselves are factually wrong. The actual values from the knowledge graph are GD: $72M (coincidentally the same net number but for different components) and GE: $276M, summing to $348M. However, the LLM’s attribution of GE’s cost as $363M is a major error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: the model correctly identifies that it must extract and sum two distinct expenses from two companies (GD and GE) related to settlements in 2024, showing appropriate synthesis across entities and filings. This demonstrates sound qualitative reasoning structure. (4) Justification for scores: correctness is low (4/10) due to major numerical errors in key figures and final sum; quantitative accuracy is 4 due to incorrect dollar amounts despite proper format handling; qualitative accuracy is 5 because the reasoning framework is correct but based on wrong data; contextual relevance is 9 as the response directly addresses the question’s intent and structure.",

These incorrect inputs lead to a significantly inflated combined total of $21,952 million instead of the correct $11,928 million. The intersegment revenue figure for CMCSA ($8,383 million) is correctly cited. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are mathematically correct based on its erroneous inputs (9,255 + 12,697 = 21,952), but the comparison to intersegment revenue is therefore misleading. The correct sum ($11,928 million) is about $3.5 billion higher than CMCSA's intersegment revenue, not $13.6 billion higher. The '2.6 times' multiplier is incorrect due to the flawed base numbers. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM attempts to combine revenue from two companies and compare to a third metric from one of them—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for both primary revenue figures. This suggests a failure in entity-metric alignment (e.g., misidentifying which revenue line item corresponds to 'Business Services Connectivity' for CMCSA).

      "original_answer": "The 33% decline in Merck's 2024 U.S. sales of Januvia and Janumet, driven by lower pricing, competitive pressures, and Medicaid rebate changes, affects CVS's Health Care Benefits segment by potentially reducing pharmacy benefit management (PBM) service demand and increasing medical cost trends. CVS notes that adverse economic conditions, including changes in drug utilization and provider behavior, can increase its costs and limit its ability to manage medical cost trends. Lower drug utilization due to reduced prescribing of Merck's diabetes medications could decrease PBM revenue for CVS while simultaneously shifting more cost burden to medical claims if alternative treatments are more expensive, thereby increasing medical costs for CVS and straining its ability to manage benefit costs and maintain profitability.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key metrics. According to the ground truth, CL's Total Company Organic Sales Growth was 7.0%, not 8.5% as stated; PG's was correctly reported at 4.0%. The difference is therefore 3.0 percentage points, not 4.5 as claimed. Additionally, CL's Foreign Exchange impact was -4.5%, not -1.0% as stated. PG's FX impact of +2.0% is correct. (2) Calculation verification: The difference between 8.5% and 4.0% is indeed 4.5 percentage points, but since the input figures are incorrect (especially CL's growth), the result is wrong. The correct difference is 7.0% - 4.0% = 3.0 percentage points. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to compare organic sales growth and FX impacts across CL and PG, and it structures the answer appropriately. However, it fails in synthesizing the correct data from the underlying sources, likely due to incorrect retrieval or outdated information (e.g., using 2023 for CL and 2024 for PG, which may reflect mismatched fiscal periods). (4) Justification: The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses appropriate terminology. Qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct reasoning structure but flawed entity-metric alignment. Quantitative accuracy is low due to major errors in two of the three core numbers (CL's growth and FX impact). Correctness score is 4 due to partial correctness on PG's data and FX direction, but major errors on CL's figures and the final comparison.",

      "original_answer": "As of December 31, 2023, SCHW reported a Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) of 8.5% under its CSC entity, while WFC, as a large BHC subject to enhanced prudential requirements including SLR, must maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0%. The 5.5 percentage point difference suggests that SCHW's capital position relative to its total leverage exposure is significantly stronger than the regulatory minimum, indicating a more conservative capital management strategy or better alignment with FRB expectations for resiliency and loss-absorbing capacity under the Dodd-Frank Act and SLR rules.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a significant factual error regarding WFC's Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR). The ground truth states that WFC must maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0% under enhanced prudential requirements, but does not report WFC's actual SLR as 6–7%. The LLM incorrectly asserts that WFC reported an SLR of 'roughly 6–7%' based on its 10-K, which contradicts the ground truth that only specifies the 3.0% minimum requirement and does not provide WFC’s actual SLR. This misrepresentation of WFC’s actual SLR undermines the quantitative accuracy. Additionally, the difference between SCHW’s 8.5% and WFC’s implied 6.5% average (6–7%) is about 2 percentage points, but the original answer highlights a 5.5 percentage point difference from the 3.0% minimum, which the LLM fails to emphasize correctly. (2) The date (December 31, 2023) and SCHW’s SLR of 8.5% are correct and properly cited. However, the WFC SLR value is not supported by the ground truth and appears to be an external assumption or misreading. The minimum SLR of 3.0% is correctly noted. Calculations involving the difference between the two firms’ ratios are flawed due to the incorrect attribution of WFC’s actual SLR. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing capital positions under enhanced prudential standards—but fails because it compares SCHW’s actual ratio to an inaccurately reported WFC ratio instead of contrasting SCHW’s 8.5% with the 3.0% regulatory minimum as required. The original answer emphasizes that the 5.5-point difference reflects strength relative to the floor, not relative to WFC’s own ratio. The LLM misframes the analysis by implying a direct comparison between two reported SLRs rather than one reported ratio versus a regulatory minimum. (4) Despite the incorrect WFC SLR value, the answer remains contextually relevant by addressing regulatory capital positions and interpreting buffers above the minimum. The reasoning structure is logical but built on faulty data. Hence, correctness is scored at 5 due to major quantitative inaccuracy, qualitative reasoning is moderate (6), quantitative accuracy low (4), and contextual relevance high (8) as the framework of analysis aligns with the question’s intent.",

(1) The question asks specifically for 'Business Revenue'—a defined segment metric—for Comcast and Verizon in 2023 and a comparison to prior-year figures. Instead, the LLM used total consolidated revenue for both companies, which is a completely different and much broader metric. This misidentification of the financial metric invalidates the entire response. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers cited—$121.572 billion for Comcast and $133.974 billion for Verizon—are total revenues, not Business Revenue. The ground truth specifies Comcast's Business Services Connectivity revenue as $22 million and Verizon's Business revenue as $13,372 million in 2023. The LLM's figures are off by orders of magnitude (e.g., $133.974 billion vs. $13.372 billion for Verizon's business segment). The combined total in the LLM answer ($255.546 billion) is therefore grossly inaccurate compared to the correct total of $13,394 million ($13.394 billion). (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model did not isolate the correct business segment revenue for either company, did not sum the correct 2023 and 2022 segment figures, and drew an incorrect conclusion about a decrease when the correct answer shows a $528 million increase. (4) Contextual relevance is low because, despite structured formatting and accurate-looking citations, the answer addresses a different question entirely. The model misunderstood the scope of 'Business Revenue' as segment-specific income and instead reported enterprise-wide totals, making the response misleading and factually wrong.

      "original_answer": "A decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory for both Apple and AMD, leading to financial risks such as write-downs, increased production costs, and unutilized purchase commitments. Apple orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments, with manufacturing purchase obligations covering forecasted requirements for up to 150 days. If demand decreases, Apple risks forecasting incorrectly and producing excess components or products, which could lead to inventory write-downs and unutilized purchase commitments. Similarly, AMD has prepayment arrangements with certain vendors, and a decrease in customer demand could result in excess inventory and increased production costs. AMD's reliance on long-term purchase commitments and prepayment arrangements makes it particularly vulnerable to financial strain if demand decreases and inventory cannot be utilized. Together, these dynamics show how both companies' financial positions could be adversely impacted by a shared risk of excess inventory stemming from mismatched supply and demand.",
      "llm_answer": "A slowdown in consumer demand would leave Apple with more components and finished‑goods than it can sell, forcing it to write down or impair inventory, absorb cancellation‑fee reserves and risk the recoverability of the pre‑payments it has made for long‑term supply contracts (see Apple 10‑K p. 12‑13). Similarly, AMD’s wafer‑purchase agreement with GlobalFoundries obligates it to buy a set volume of wafers and pre‑pay for them; if demand falls short of those targets, AMD would carry excess wafer inventory, incur higher per‑unit costs and may have to pay the “difference” penalty, which would compress its gross margin and cash flow (see AMD 10‑K p. 23‑24).  In both cases, a demand decline translates into inventory‑related write‑downs or penalties that erode profitability and strain liquidity.",

The mention of Apple's long-term supply contracts and pre-payments, as well as AMD's wafer-purchase agreement with GlobalFoundries and potential 'difference' penalty, are consistent with the risks described in their 10-Ks. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, days) in either the original or LLM answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised; the LLM correctly avoids fabricating numbers.

(4) Semantic equivalence is strong—while the LLM uses more granular terminology (e.g., 'cancellation-fee reserves', 'recoverability of pre-payments'), the core message matches: falling demand leads to excess inventory, write-downs, and financial pressure for both firms.

      "question": "How does the difference in contract mix between General Dynamics' defense segments and Lockheed Martin's contract structure influence their respective operating earnings and margin volatility?",
      "original_answer": "General Dynamics notes that operating earnings and margin volatility in its defense segments are driven by changes in volume, performance, and contract mix, particularly emphasizing that contract mix refers to the proportion of higher- versus lower-margin work, which can vary based on contract type (e.g., fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable) and type of work (e.g., development vs. production). Lockheed Martin, on the other hand, explicitly states that it operates under both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, with the latter including cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee structures. These cost-reimbursable contracts introduce variability in fees based on performance assessments or cost targets, directly affecting earnings and margins. Therefore, while both companies experience margin volatility due to contract mix, Lockheed Martin's detailed exposure to performance-based fees in its cost-reimbursable contracts introduces an additional layer of earnings sensitivity compared to General Dynamics' broader categorization of contract type and work stage impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics notes that its defense‑segment earnings and margins are “driven by changes in volume, performance or **contract mix**,” where mix means the proportion of higher‑margin versus lower‑margin work (e.g., fixed‑price versus cost‑reimbursable, early‑production versus mature‑program contracts) and that shifts in that mix can cause earnings and margin to swing 【page_33】. Lockheed Martin, by contrast, emphasizes that its revenue comes from a blend of **fixed‑price** and **cost‑reimbursable** contracts (including award‑fee and incentive‑fee arrangements) and that the fixed‑price portion can generate “more or less profit…or a loss” while cost‑reimbursable contracts provide a fee that cushions profit variability 【page_56】. Thus, GD’s more variable contract‑mix exposure makes its operating earnings and margins more volatile, whereas LMT’s mixed fixed‑price/cost‑reimbursable structure tends to smooth earnings and reduce margin volatility.",

However, the LLM draws an incorrect comparative conclusion: it states that GD's contract mix leads to *more* volatility and that LMT's structure *reduces* margin volatility due to fee cushioning. This contradicts the original answer, which emphasizes that LMT’s exposure to performance-based fees (e.g., cost-plus-award-fee) introduces an *additional layer* of earnings sensitivity and volatility compared to GD. Thus, the qualitative reasoning is flawed in the comparative assessment, reversing the intended implication about relative volatility. While all entities and contract types are correctly named and contextual relevance is high, the misinterpretation of the direction of volatility impact undermines the correctness.

The ground truth states that CMCSA's Business Services Connectivity revenue in 2023 was $22 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $9.3 billion—off by over 400 times. VZ's Business segment revenue decrease of $950 million is correctly stated. (2) The calculation is therefore completely wrong: the LLM computes $9.3 billion - $950 million = $8.3 billion, whereas the correct calculation is $22 million - (-$950 million) = $972 million. The negative sign on the decrease (indicating a decline) must be accounted for in the comparison, which the LLM fails to do in both input values and logic. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the model misidentifies a key metric (CMCSA revenue) and does not correctly interpret that the question compares a positive revenue figure to a negative change (decrease), requiring addition of absolute values. (4) Due to severe quantitative inaccuracy and incorrect reasoning, the correctness score is 1. Quantitative accuracy is 1 (almost entirely wrong numbers). Qualitative accuracy is 2 (correctly identifies entities VZ and CMCSA and the general concept of comparing revenues, but misapplies logic).

      "original_answer": "GILD's net product sales are directly impacted by rebate payment obligations to Medicaid agencies and discounts to 340B covered entities, which significantly reduce the effective price of its products despite any list price increases. This dynamic limits the financial benefit GILD receives from price adjustments. In contrast, JNJ faces legal risks tied to rebate payments and contractual relationships, particularly in relation to its HIV products PREZISTA and INTELENCE, where it is involved in litigation alleging anti-kickback violations and off-label promotion under the False Claims Act. These legal challenges could result in financial penalties or settlements, highlighting a different type of financial exposure compared to GILD’s more direct revenue limitations from rebates.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead notes that a “significant portion” of its sales are subject to mandatory rebates and discounts – such as Medicaid‑agency rebates and 340B‑entity discounts in the United States and similar rebate obligations in the European Union – which lower the net price it receives and therefore limit the effect of any list‑price increases on its net product sales. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson’s HIV portfolio (PREZISTA and INTELENCE) is facing legal exposure: a 2016 qui‑tam complaint alleges off‑label promotion and anti‑kickback violations tied to rebate‑type arrangements, and the company has been subpoenaed for information on rebate payments and PBM contracts, creating potential False‑Claims Act liability and other penalties rather than a straightforward reduction in net sales.",

(2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or ground truth that require verification; the mention of a '2016 qui-tam complaint' in the LLM answer is consistent with known public litigation timelines and does not contradict the original answer, which avoids specifying a year. While the original does not mention '2016' or 'subpoenaed', these details are contextually appropriate and plausibly derived from the knowledge graph, adding specificity without introducing error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes GILD’s revenue-limiting rebate obligations with JNJ’s legal exposure from similar mechanisms, drawing a clear qualitative contrast between direct financial reduction (GILD) vs. contingent legal/penalty risk (JNJ). (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to the introduction of slightly more specific litigation details (e.g., 2016, subpoena) not present in the ground truth, but these do not undermine correctness.

In contrast, Lowe’s defines ROIC as rolling 12-month lease-adjusted NOPAT divided by the average of current and prior year ending debt and shareholders' deficit. These differing methodologies—specifically GM’s inclusion of automotive-specific liabilities and use of EBIT-adjusted versus Lowe’s use of lease-adjusted NOPAT and debt metrics—make direct comparisons of ROIC between the two companies challenging, as they reflect distinct capital structures and operational focuses.",
      "llm_answer": "**Definition differences** – General Motors’ ROIC‑adjusted is EBIT‑adjusted (net income before interest and taxes, after the company’s non‑core adjustments) divided by an “average net‑asset” base that starts with equity and is then adjusted for automotive debt, interest liabilities, finance‑lease obligations, pension/OPEB liabilities and income‑tax assets. Lowe’s defines ROIC as lease‑adjusted net operating profit after tax (NOPAT – i.e., operating profit after tax with lease‑interest added back) divided by the simple average of the year‑end debt plus shareholders’ deficit (total capital).\n\n**Effect on comparability** – Because GM’s metric excludes interest expense and uses a capital base that is essentially equity‑plus‑adjusted automotive debt, while Lowe’s metric adds back lease‑interest to earnings and uses total debt‑plus‑equity, the two ROIC numbers are calculated on different profit and capital bases. Consequently, the ROIC figures are not directly comparable across the two companies; differences in treatment of interest, lease adjustments and the composition of the denominator can materially distort any head‑to‑head comparison.",

Additionally, the individual payments by COST and MDLZ are wrong: the LLM claims COST paid $274 million and MDLZ $228 million, which contradicts the ground truth that states these values are the actual correct individual amounts — however, their sum should be $502 million only if those numbers were correct, but the ground truth says the total is $46 million, implying the individual values in the LLM answer are fabricated or misattributed. (2) The calculation of the sum ($274M + $228M = $502M) is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect input numbers, so the result is invalid.

However, the individual breakdown is wrong: the LLM assigns $5.63 billion to Schwab and $5.72 billion to Morgan Stanley, but the ground truth does not provide exact splits, so we cannot verify these. More critically, the growth rates are completely swapped: the LLM states Morgan Stanley grew by 20% and Schwab by 8%, while the truth is Morgan Stanley grew by 8% and Schwab by 20.2%. This reverses the comparison. (2) The calculation of the combined total is approximately correct ($11.3B vs $11.343B), but the growth rate comparison is erroneous. The LLM claims Morgan Stanley’s growth was 12 percentage points higher, but in reality, Schwab’s growth (20.2%) was 12.2 percentage points higher than Morgan Stanley’s (8%).

      "original_answer": "General Dynamics recognizes revenue on long-term government contracts using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs at completion, which directly ties revenue fluctuations to changes in cost estimates and production volume. This method means that changes in estimated costs without corresponding changes in contract value impact profitability. Lockheed Martin, under cost-reimbursable contracts, is reimbursed for allowable costs plus a fee, with profitability capped by a ceiling amount and influenced by performance assessments or cost incentives. Therefore, while General Dynamics' profitability is sensitive to cost estimation accuracy and contract maturity, Lockheed Martin's earnings depend on cost control and performance-based incentives within a fixed funding limit.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics treats its defense contracts the same way it treats most long‑term government work – it records revenue on a cost‑to‑cost (percentage‑of‑completion) basis and then adjusts operating earnings whenever the estimated total contract cost or the estimated transaction price changes. Those “performance” adjustments (and the mix of fixed‑price versus cost‑reimbursable work) drive the reported profitability of each defense segment.  \n\nLockheed Martin’s cost‑reimbursable contracts also use a cost‑to‑cost measure to recognize revenue, but the company isolates a “profit‑booking rate” that is revised as technical, schedule or cost risks are retired; the estimated consideration can exceed the award amount and any loss is booked immediately, so operating earnings reflect the booked profit margin (plus any contract‑asset or liability adjustments) rather than just the accumulated costs.",

(1) The LLM correctly identifies that General Dynamics uses a cost-to-cost (percentage-of-completion) method, tying revenue and earnings to changes in cost estimates and contract value, which matches the original answer's emphasis on cost estimation accuracy and production volume affecting profitability. It also correctly notes that changes in estimated costs or transaction prices affect operating earnings. (2) For Lockheed Martin, the LLM accurately states that cost-reimbursable contracts use cost-to-cost revenue recognition but adds a 'profit-booking rate' influenced by risk retirement and performance, which aligns with the ground truth's description of profitability being capped and influenced by performance assessments and incentives. The mention that estimated consideration can exceed award amount and losses are booked immediately adds nuance consistent with SEC filing practices. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in contract types (fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable), links them to revenue recognition policies, and explains how each affects earnings and profitability—core to the question. (4) Minor omission: the LLM does not explicitly mention the 'ceiling amount' or 'fixed funding limit' as a constraint on Lockheed Martin’s profitability, which is a key point in the original answer. Also, while it discusses profit-booking rates, it doesn't fully emphasize that Lockheed’s fee is performance-based within a capped structure, slightly weakening the qualitative accuracy.

      "llm_answer": "**Gilead (GILD)** – When a milestone payment is part of the contingent‑consideration in a business‑combination, Gilead records the liability at fair value on the acquisition date and re‑measures it each period. The increase or decrease in fair‑value is charged to **research‑and‑development expense** on the consolidated statement of income until the related product receives marketing approval (and, for asset‑type acquisitions, milestone payments are simply expensed as incurred).  \n\n**Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)** – Milestone payments made under R&D collaboration agreements are treated as ordinary **R&D expense** when paid (pre‑regulatory approval); if the payment is made after regulatory approval it is capitalized as an intangible and amortized.

This matches the core principle in the original answer that Gilead expenses such payments immediately, impacting the income statement upfront. (2) For JNJ, the LLM correctly states that milestone payments in R&D collaborations are expensed when paid if pre-approval, and capitalized if post-approval—exactly as in the ground truth. It adds nuance by noting capitalization leads to amortization, which is consistent and enhances clarity. (3) The income statement impact comparison is sound: Gilead faces immediate and potentially volatile R&D charges due to fair-value remeasurement (especially in business combinations), while JNJ has a one-time expense or deferred cost via amortization, resulting in less volatility.

However, the original answer incorrectly states that MDLZ had a 'larger year-over-year decrease,' but in fact MDLZ had an increase. The LLM correctly identifies that COST had a $155M decrease and MDLZ had a $14M increase, and thus correctly concludes that COST had the larger decrease. This contradicts the ground truth, which contains a factual error: it claims MDLZ had a decrease of $14M when in fact it increased. Therefore, the LLM answer is actually factually correct in its analysis, while the original answer is wrong on this point. (2) All numbers and calculations are accurate: $136M + $139M = $275M; $291M - $136M = $155M decrease; $139M - $125M = $14M increase. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two companies across two years, computes changes, and makes a valid comparison. (4) Despite the original answer being incorrect on the directional change for MDLZ, the LLM answer is quantitatively and qualitatively more accurate. However, since the evaluation must be based on alignment with the provided 'ground truth' (even if flawed), the correctness score is reduced due to the disagreement on the comparative change, even though the LLM is right. This creates a conflict between factual accuracy and alignment with the expected answer. Given that the task is to evaluate against the original answer, not real-world truth, the LLM is marked down for contradicting the ground truth on the decrease/increase point, even though it is correct.

However, the combined total is wrong due to the ADBE error: LLM reports $4.65 billion instead of the correct $975 million. (2) Calculation accuracy: While the LLM correctly adds $271M + $346M = $617M for QCOM, it incorrectly calculates ADBE’s value as ~$4.035B (citing $3,702M + $333M), which does not align with the ground truth of $358M. This suggests confusion with other line items or misinterpretation of the data. The final sum of $4.65B is therefore invalid. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that it must combine values from ADBE and QCOM, and it references the correct fiscal year (2022). However, the synthesis fails due to the incorrect ADBE value. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major numerical inaccuracies despite partial success on QCOM. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because only QCOM numbers are correct. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the model understands the structure and entities involved. Contextual relevance is high (8/10) because the response directly addresses the question's intent and format.",

According to the ground truth, the combined total is $9,773 million, but the LLM reports $11.34 billion (i.e., $11,340 million), which is off by over $1.5 billion. The LLM assigns Morgan Stanley $5,627 million and Schwab $5,716 million, but these individual figures are not consistent with the ground truth total, suggesting both inputs are likely incorrect. (2) The growth rate for Morgan Stanley (~8%) aligns with the ground truth (8%), which is accurate. However, the LLM calculates Schwab’s growth as ~20% based on a rise from $4.76 billion to $5.72 billion, whereas the ground truth states 18.6%. While this is a relatively small error in percentage terms, it compounds the inaccuracy of the base figures. More critically, the LLM’s reported 2024 fee value for Schwab ($5.72 billion) is higher than the ground truth total for both companies combined, indicating a major data error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to sum fees and compare growth rates—but it fails due to incorrect underlying data. The synthesis across companies is structurally correct, but the faulty inputs invalidate the conclusions.

It adds specific dollar figures ($40.7B to $79.6B), which are not in the original answer but are factually accurate based on Pfizer's 10-K filings and support the 95% growth claim (a ~95.6% increase). However, the LLM introduces '2021 flat sales' and 'modest change in 2022' for Amgen, which are not present in the ground truth and lack specific quantitative backing—this introduces unsupported detail. (2) The 95% growth figure is correct and matches the original answer. The U.S. (39%) and international (156%) growth breakdowns are missing from the LLM answer, which is a minor omission. The dollar amounts cited are accurate and correctly imply the 95% growth, so no calculation errors. However, the LLM does not specify that the 95% is worldwide growth, though it can be inferred. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly contrasts Pfizer’s diversified, high-growth strategy with Amgen’s single-segment focus. It accurately reflects Amgen’s single-segment structure (human therapeutics) and draws a valid strategic comparison. The inference about Amgen’s 'steadier, lower-growth results' goes slightly beyond the ground truth, which does not characterize Amgen’s growth trajectory as low—only that it has a focused model. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: performance comparison and strategic implications. The core facts are correct, but the added Amgen performance claims without specific support reduce quantitative accuracy slightly.

This discrepancy arises because the LLM uses incorrect values: it reports Charles Schwab’s >5-year loans as $27,781 million (sum of $1,309M + $26,472M), which is correct based on the cited numbers, but Morgan Stanley’s after-5-year loans are reported as $66,529 million ($1,106M + $65,423M), whereas the correct value in the ground truth implies a different sum or data source. The ground truth combined total is $89,944M, meaning the LLM overstates the combined total by approximately $4.4 billion. (2) The total residential real estate exposure for Morgan Stanley is correctly cited as $66,641 million, matching the ground truth. However, the difference between the combined after-5-year loans and MS’s total exposure is stated as ‘about $27.7 billion larger’ ($27,700 million), while the correct difference is $23,303 million.

Otherwise, reasoning and entity identification (HON, RTX, 2021, correct metrics) are accurate.\n\nOverall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and fully addresses the question with only a slight imprecision in contextual framing of RTX's expenses.",

The ground truth states the combined total is $24,595 million ($24.595 billion), but the LLM reports approximately $30.6 billion, which is off by over $6 billion. Additionally, the LLM claims DIS's Programming and Production Costs increased by 0.5% from 2021 to 2022, while the ground truth states there was a 1% decrease. These errors directly contradict the correct figures. (2) For quantitative accuracy: the individual values used by the LLM (e.g., ~$15.3 billion for both CMCSA 2021 and DIS 2022) are incorrect. The correct value for CMCSA 2021 is approximately $9.275 billion and for DIS 2022 is approximately $15.32 billion (summing to $24.595 billion). The LLM incorrectly inflates CMCSA's cost. Furthermore, DIS's cost decreased from $15.48 billion in 2021 to $15.32 billion in 2022 (a ~1% decrease), not an increase. The LLM’s calculation of a 0.5% rise is therefore wrong. (3) For qualitative accuracy: the model identifies the correct companies (CMCSA, DIS), metrics (Programming and Production Costs), and years (2021, 2022), showing proper entity recognition and multi-hop intent. However, it fails to retrieve or synthesize the correct underlying data, leading to flawed conclusions. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the structure and framing of the answer match the question’s requirements—addressing both the sum and the percentage change—but the severe numerical inaccuracies drastically reduce correctness.

      "original_answer": "Costco projects a $370 million increase in membership revenue over the next two fiscal years, with $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025, primarily in the latter half of the year. This increase stems from membership fee hikes and higher penetration of Executive Members. Meanwhile, Mondelez notes significant cost inflation pressures, including rising raw material (particularly cocoa) and labor costs, which have continued to increase. Both companies address cost pressures through pricing strategies—Costco via membership fees and Mondelez through product pricing adjustments. The additional revenue Costco anticipates could help offset inflationary pressures, supporting its membership-driven profitability model. In contrast, Mondelez may need to rely more heavily on pricing actions and cost-saving initiatives to maintain profitability. These differing strategies reflect their business models and exposure to cost inflation, shaping how each company approaches profitability in a challenging cost environment.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco plans to offset the inflation‑driven rise in wages and other operating costs (which pushed SG&A up six basis points in 2024) by leaning on a $370 million boost in membership‑fee revenue over the next two fiscal years (page 27) and by using the higher‑margin ancillary businesses that already lifted its gross‑margin percentage (page 28). In contrast, Mondelēz, which is feeling “significantly higher … raw‑material (especially cocoa) and labor costs” (page 37) and expects to continue adjusting prices to protect margins (page 35), is focusing on pricing actions, sourcing/hedging programs and productivity initiatives to preserve profitability despite cost‑inflation pressure (page 38).",

(1) Quantitatively, all key figures are correct: the $370 million increase in Costco's membership revenue over two fiscal years is accurately reported, and while the original answer specifies $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025, the LLM does not contradict this—it simply omits the breakdown. This omission is minor and does not affect factual correctness. The mention of SG&A increasing by six basis points in 2024 is an additional detail not in the ground truth but does not conflict with it and may come from the filing; thus, it doesn't reduce accuracy. (2) Entity accuracy is strong: both Costco and Mondelez (correctly spelled Mondelēz in LLM version) are properly identified, with correct references to raw material (cocoa) and labor costs. Fiscal context is appropriately framed. (3) Reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis: the LLM correctly contrasts Costco’s reliance on membership revenue and high-margin ancillary businesses with Mondelez’s use of pricing actions, hedging, and productivity initiatives. It accurately links each company's strategy to its business model and inflation exposure. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing how each company’s financial dynamics influence profitability strategies under cost inflation. The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit mention that Costco’s membership fee increase and Executive Member penetration are the drivers of the $370M gain—this detail is in the ground truth but omitted in the LLM response.

      "original_answer": "Apple's effective tax rate in 2023 was 14.7%, while Intel's effective tax rate was -3.2%, indicating a stark contrast in their tax positions. Intel's negative effective tax rate was primarily driven by significant tax credits and adjustments such as research and development tax credits (-11.4%), non-US income taxed at different rates (-13.4%), and foreign derived intangible income benefit (-9.7%), which collectively reduced their tax burden. In contrast, Apple's effective tax rate, although lower than the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, was positively influenced by fewer such adjustments, resulting in a more conventional effective tax rate. This comparison highlights how different business structures, global operations, and tax incentives can lead to divergent effective tax outcomes even under the same statutory rate.",

Most critically, it reports Intel's 2023 effective tax rate as -119.8%, which is grossly inaccurate compared to the ground truth of -3.2%. This is a major deviation that fundamentally misrepresents Intel's tax position. Additionally, the LLM claims Apple's rate increased from 16.2% in 2022, but this prior-year figure is not in the ground truth and cannot be verified as correct. The $10.2 billion state-aid charge is also not mentioned in the original answer and appears to be fabricated or misattributed. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies Apple's 2023 effective tax rate as 14.7%, which matches the ground truth, the rest of the numerical data is either incorrect or unsupported. The magnitude of the error in Intel’s rate (-119.8% vs -3.2%) severely undermines quantitative accuracy. The original answer specifies exact contributions from tax credits (e.g., R&D at -11.4%, non-U.S. income at -13.4%, FDII at -9.7%), none of which are quantified in the LLM response, missing key precision. (3) Qualitatively, the LLM demonstrates correct reasoning in identifying relevant tax factors such as R&D credits, foreign-derived intangible income, non-U.S. income, and share-based compensation. It correctly frames Intel’s negative rate as resulting from net tax benefits and contrasts it with Apple’s more conventional tax position. However, it fails to accurately synthesize the multi-hop data—especially the magnitude and specific impact of adjustments—leading to an incorrect overall conclusion about the scale of the difference. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses the core question about contrasting tax positions due to credits and adjustments.

The ground truth specifies only the Valneva agreement ($35 million) as relevant to development milestones, but the LLM includes multiple unrelated collaborations (Beam, Arvinas, Myovant), which are not part of the question's scope. This leads to a gross overestimation of PFE's commitment at $1.685 billion instead of the correct $35 million. The combined total is therefore wrong: $3.285 billion vs. the correct $1.635 billion. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: AMGN's $1.6 billion is correct, but PFE's $35 million is buried among irrelevant figures. The sum is miscalculated due to inclusion of extraneous data. Only the AMGN number and the Valneva sub-item are accurate; all others are factually incorrect in context. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails—the question asks for specific commitments tied to development milestones in each company’s respective agreements, implying only the most directly relevant agreement per company. The LLM misinterprets this as requiring aggregation across all possible development-related milestones for PFE, showing flawed entity-event mapping.

      "llm_answer": "Home Depot’s comparable‑average ticket slipped from $90.36 a year earlier to $90.07 – a $0.29 decline, or roughly a 0.3 % drop – so the bulk of its 4.7 % comparable‑sales decline came from fewer customer transactions, with only a minimal hit to revenue per transaction.  \n\nLowe’s’ comparable‑average ticket fell from $103.64 to $103.51 – a $0.13 decline, about a 0.1 % decrease – indicating that its comparable‑sales trend was also driven mainly by transaction volume, with a modest $0.13‑per‑transaction reduction in revenue.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the direction and approximate magnitude of the comparable average ticket changes for both HD and LOW, with HD decreasing by 0.3% (from $90.36 to $90.07) and LOW by 0.1%. These values match the ground truth numerically and directionally. However, the LLM introduces a specific figure for LOW’s fiscal 2022 average ticket ($103.64) and 2023 value ($103.51), which are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified against the provided ground truth. This addition, while consistent in percentage change, introduces unverified data, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation of the percentage drop for HD is correct: ($0.29 / $90.36) ≈ 0.3%. For LOW, ($0.13 / $103.64) ≈ 0.125%, which rounds to 0.1%, so the percentage is acceptable. However, since the original answer does not provide LOW’s actual ticket values, their inclusion represents an unsupported extrapolation. (3) The reasoning correctly attributes the majority of sales decline to transaction volume rather than ticket size for both companies, aligning with the ground truth’s emphasis on HD’s larger sales decline being driven by fewer transactions. However, the LLM omits the key contextual point from the original answer that LOW’s minimal ticket decline occurred against a backdrop of a significant 4.6% drop in customer transactions, which is critical for understanding the differing sales dynamics. This missing context weakens the multi-hop synthesis. (4) Despite the omission and the introduction of unverified dollar amounts for LOW, the core facts about the direction and impact of average ticket changes are accurate, and the overall interpretation of revenue dynamics is reasonable. Hence, correctness is scored at 7 for minor factual overreach and missing context, with high marks for relevance and mostly sound reasoning.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical calculation error in summing Lockheed Martin's cumulative FAS/CAS operating adjustment. It incorrectly calculates the total as $5,885 million instead of the correct $5,405 million (from $2,049M + $1,876M + $1,960M). This error propagates to the final comparison, where the LLM states the difference is 'about $5.2 billion', or $5,200 million, whereas the correct difference is $4,715 million. While the individual yearly values for LMT are correctly cited ($2,049M, $1,876M, $1,960M), and RTX's merger-attributed increase of $690 million is accurately reported, the incorrect sum undermines the conclusion. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are significant: the sum is off by $480 million, and the final difference is off by $485 million. These are not minor rounding issues but fundamental arithmetic errors. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—multi-hop synthesis is attempted by pulling LMT's three-year data and comparing it to RTX's merger-related 2021 increase—and the entities (LMT, RTX, FAS/CAS operating adjustment, Raytheon Merger) and years (2019–2021) are correctly identified. The logic of comparing cumulative LMT adjustment to RTX's single-year merger impact aligns with the question. (4) Despite correct sourcing and entity identification, the severe calculation error in the sum and final difference reduces the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores.

      "original_answer": "Costco expenses repair and maintenance costs when incurred and does not disclose specific amounts, indicating a focus on immediate recognition of costs related to asset readiness and upkeep. Coca-Cola also expenses repair and maintenance costs when incurred but provides more detailed context around asset management, including depreciation ranges for buildings and equipment, and explicitly states that costs not extending economic life are expensed. This implies that while both companies follow similar accounting principles, Coca-Cola’s more granular reporting reflects a structured approach to asset lifecycle management, whereas Costco’s approach suggests a streamlined operational focus on expensing without detailed disclosure.",

(1) Both Costco and Coca-Cola expense repair and maintenance costs when incurred, which is correctly stated; no specific dollar amounts are disclosed by either company in the knowledge base, so the absence of numbers is appropriate and accurately reflected. (2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect—no incorrect figures or miscalculations are present, and no numeric data was misrepresented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that both companies expense rather than capitalize these costs but differ in financial statement presentation—Costco in SG&A, Coca-Cola in cost of goods sold (COGS), which reflects their operational models. This distinction is not explicitly stated in the original answer but is a valid inference supported by context (Coca-Cola’s manufacturing focus implies maintenance is part of production cost). (4) The implication drawn about asset management strategies—Costco’s streamlined operational focus vs. Coca-Cola’s asset-intensive, manufacturing-oriented approach—is logically consistent with the original answer’s conclusion about Coca-Cola’s more structured asset lifecycle reporting and Costco’s minimal disclosure. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not mention Coca-Cola’s disclosure of depreciation ranges or explicit policy on economic life extension, which adds granularity in the original answer.

According to the ground truth, AXP (American Express) reported 112 thousand Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDR) loan accounts in 2021, but the LLM incorrectly states it as 2 thousand. Similarly, PYPL (PayPal) reported 3 thousand loan accounts, which the LLM correctly identifies. However, the LLM incorrectly frames PayPal's accounts as 'classified as TDRs,' which is not supported by the original answer and misrepresents the metric. (2) The difference calculation is wrong: the LLM computes 3k - 2k = 1k, but the correct difference is 112k - 3k = 109k, and the ground truth explicitly states the difference is 104 thousand (likely due to specific data source nuances, but 109k vs 1k is still drastically off). Even accepting the ground truth’s stated 104k, the LLM’s 1k is completely inaccurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly retrieve AXP’s TDR account number, misidentifies the nature of PYPL’s loan accounts, and performs an incorrect comparison. It also reverses the direction of the difference, claiming PayPal exceeds AXP, when AXP has vastly more TDR accounts. (4) Due to severe factual errors in numbers, entities, and logic, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. The qualitative accuracy is also extremely low due to flawed reasoning and entity conflation.

According to the ground truth, TSLA reported net deferred tax assets of $9,882 million (approx. $9.9 billion is acceptable), but HD reported a net deferred tax asset of $(230) million (i.e., a liability), not $3.6 billion. Additionally, HD had no valuation allowance mentioned, whereas the LLM incorrectly states a $67 million allowance. The difference in net deferred tax assets is therefore $10,112 million, not $6.3 billion. (2) The calculation of the difference is incorrect due to wrong inputs: $9.9B - $3.6B = $6.3B is mathematically correct but based on false data. The correct difference is $9,882M - (-$230M) = $10,112M. (3) The reasoning about tax strategies is partially plausible but misaligned with facts. The LLM claims Tesla released a $6.5B valuation allowance, which is not supported in the ground truth; the truth states TSLA applied an $892M allowance (not a release). The characterization of HD’s strategy as conservative due to a 'modest allowance' is incorrect because HD has no valuation allowance at all. (4) Scores are low due to severe quantitative inaccuracies and flawed multi-hop synthesis.

However, it incorrectly states that Coca-Cola generated 27% of its 2024 revenue from the Asia Pacific region, whereas the ground truth specifies 21.5%. This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The calculation for Colgate’s combined workforce (33% + 30% = 63%) is correct. But the comparison is flawed due to the incorrect Coca-Cola revenue figure. The LLM claims Colgate’s workforce concentration is 'more than twice' Coca-Cola’s revenue share, but with the correct numbers (63% vs 21.5%), the ratio is nearly three times, as stated in the original answer. The erroneous 27% leads to an inaccurate comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—LLM identifies the need to combine Colgate’s regional workforce data and compare it to Coca-Cola’s regional revenue—but the synthesis fails due to reliance on incorrect data for Coca-Cola.

      "original_answer": "American Express recognizes discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs and typically enters into fixed-period contracts with large merchants that range from three to seven years, often with auto-renewal features. In contrast, PayPal recognizes transaction revenue at the point of service and does not disclose entering into long-term fixed contracts with large merchants. Instead, PayPal notes that large merchants generally pay lower rates with higher transaction volumes, implying a more volume-driven and less contractually bound relationship. These differences suggest that American Express relies on longer-term contractual commitments from large merchants, while PayPal’s model appears more transactional and volume-based.",
      "llm_answer": "American Express ties its large‑merchant accounts to fixed‑period contracts—typically 3 to 7 years and often with auto‑renewal provisions—and records the merchant‑discount fee as discount revenue at the moment the Card Member transaction is settled. PayPal’s merchant relationships are not bound by multi‑year agreements; merchants are charged on a per‑transaction basis and the related revenue is recognized when the transaction fee is earned (i.e., at settlement), with no stipulated contract duration.",

(1) Quantitatively, all key facts are correct: American Express's contract duration of 3 to 7 years with auto-renewal is accurately stated, and the timing of revenue recognition at transaction settlement (i.e., when the Card Member transaction occurs) is correctly described. PayPal’s per-transaction revenue recognition at settlement (point of service) is also correctly noted. (2) There are no numerical or date inaccuracies. Format variations (e.g., 'at the moment the transaction is settled' vs 'at the time the transaction occurs') are semantically equivalent. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly contrasting Amex’s fixed, long-term contracts with PayPal’s transactional, non-disclosed long-term agreement model. The LLM omits PayPal’s volume-based pricing detail (lower rates for higher volumes), which is present in the original answer and adds nuance about the economic structure. This is a minor omission affecting completeness but not the core correctness. (4) Entity accuracy is perfect: both companies are correctly identified, and the financial terms (discount revenue, transaction revenue, revenue recognition timing) are used appropriately. Contextual relevance is full, as the response directly addresses both parts of the question: revenue recognition timing and contract duration.

In contrast, Emerson Electric showed customer advances of $(897) million in 2023, representing a liability position where the company had collected customer payments in advance but had not yet fulfilled the associated obligations. These contrasting figures reflect different working capital management approaches or contractual terms with their customers, with Caterpillar maintaining a larger advance payment position while Emerson operated with a net customer prepayment liability.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar reported $1.9 billion of customer advances on its 2023 balance sheet (a current liability)【page_61】, indicating that a relatively large amount of sales is funded by customers paying ahead of delivery—typical of its equipment‑sale and financing contracts. Emerson Electric’s 2023 contract‑liability balance for customer advances was about $0.9 billion【page_48】, which stems mainly from the timing of billings versus revenue on long‑term, multi‑performance‑obligation projects, so the advance balance is smaller and reflects a billing‑schedule effect rather than large pre‑payments.",

      "qualitative_accuracy": 6,
      "contextual_relevance": 8,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It states Emerson Electric’s customer advances as $0.9 billion, but the ground truth reports a negative value of $(897) million, indicating a liability due to unfulfilled obligations, not a positive advance balance. The LLM incorrectly interprets this as a $0.9 billion positive contract liability, reversing the sign and misrepresenting the financial position. Caterpillar’s figure is approximately correct ($1.9B vs $1,929M), though rounded down. (2) Number verification: Caterpillar’s $1,929 million ≈ $1.93 billion, so $1.9 billion is acceptably close (minor rounding). However, Emerson’s $(897) million is a negative liability (i.e., deferred revenue or unearned income), which the LLM misstates as a positive $0.9 billion, turning a liability into an asset-like interpretation—this is a critical error. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model attempts to explain differing dynamics in payment arrangements—Caterpillar’s advance payments in equipment sales vs Emerson’s billing timing on long-term projects. However, because it misreads Emerson’s negative advance as a positive, the comparative analysis is flawed. The original answer highlights a contrast between Caterpillar’s large positive advances and Emerson’s net liability; the LLM fails to capture this key dynamic. (4) Contextual relevance is strong—the answer addresses customer payment arrangements and ties them to business models. Qualitative accuracy is moderate because reasoning is logical but based on incorrect data. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the sign and magnitude error on Emerson’s figure. Correctness score is 5 due to one major factual error undermining the comparative insight, despite correct framing and partial data accuracy.",

      "original_answer": "Merck recognized $4.0 billion in upfront payments as immediate R&D expenses in 2023 due to the nature of its pharmaceutical collaboration agreements, where such payments do not result in additional intellectual property rights and are tied to ongoing clinical studies that are highly likely to continue. This reflects a business model centered on drug development partnerships where upfront costs are expensed as incurred. In contrast, CVS defers and amortizes upfront payments received from vendors over the life of the contract based on sales volume or on a straight-line basis, depending on whether the payments are linked to purchase commitments. This reflects CVS's business model as a pharmacy services and retail provider with ongoing vendor relationships tied directly to product sales volume. The difference in accounting approaches highlights how Merck's payments are tied to development risk and innovation, while CVS's payments are tied to stable, volume-based supply chain agreements.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck’s $4 billion upfront payment to Daiichi Sankyo is a development‑funding outflow that gives Merck only a modest royalty and no additional intellectual‑property rights; because the money is tied to ongoing clinical programs that are expected to continue, Merck records the entire amount as a research‑and‑development expense in the period it is paid. In contrast, CVS receives upfront payments from drug manufacturers that are linked to purchase‑commitment contracts; those payments are recorded as a deferred liability and amortized over the life of the contract (or on a straight‑line basis when not volume‑linked), matching the cost of the drugs to the periods in which they are sold—reflecting CVS’s business model as a retailer/distributor rather than a drug developer.",

(2) The answer correctly identifies Merck's recognition of the upfront payment as an immediate R&D expense due to lack of additional IP rights and the ongoing nature of clinical programs—consistent with the ground truth. It also accurately contrasts this with CVS's treatment of upfront payments as deferred liabilities amortized over contract terms, either based on volume or straight-line. (3) The reasoning correctly synthesizes the difference in business models: Merck as a drug developer bearing development risk versus CVS as a distributor/retailer with volume-based vendor contracts. The mention of Daiichi Sankyo, while adding specificity not in the original, does not contradict the ground truth and may reflect real-world context, but was not required for correctness—hence no penalty.

While the ground truth does not specify Tesla's exact liability amount, the LLM's inclusion of $672 million current and $3.671 billion long-term liabilities adds detail not contradicted by the original answer. The mention of page numbers (42, 78) suggests source fidelity, though not required. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the key accounting difference: HD capitalizes all operating leases (consistent with ASC 842), while Tesla uses the practical expedient to exclude short-term leases (<12 months) from the balance sheet. This is a critical multi-hop insight that directly addresses the question. (3) The reasoning is sound—by noting that HD fully capitalizes lease obligations (increasing both assets and liabilities) while Tesla omits short-term leases, the LLM correctly infers that Tesla’s balance sheet presents a smaller lease liability, affecting comparability. (4) The only minor limitation is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the impact on total liabilities ($75,486 million for HD) or directly state that this affects financial leverage ratios and cross-company comparability—details present in the original answer.

      "original_answer": "Apple's gross margins are negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations because a stronger U.S. dollar reduces the dollar value of its foreign currency-denominated sales, especially when it chooses not to raise international pricing. This directly affects its gross margins. Intel, on the other hand, manages gross margin volatility through its inventory valuation methodology, which involves forecasting demand and writing off excess or obsolete inventory when demand forecasts exceed actual demand. This impacts gross margins by adjusting the cost of goods sold based on inventory write-offs and manufacturing output decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple notes that most of its exposure to foreign‑exchange moves comes from non‑U.S.‑dollar sales, component costs and operating expenses.  A weaker foreign currency reduces the U.S.‑dollar value of those sales and can force the company either to raise international prices (which may curb demand) or to absorb the loss, both of which can compress the gross‑margin percentage; a stronger foreign currency can raise component costs or limit pricing benefits, also pressuring margins.\n\nIntel values inventory at the lower of cost or net‑realizable value and adjusts the valuation each quarter for excess‑capacity charges, obsolete or excess stock, and demand‑forecast changes.  Because write‑downs or capacity‑charge allocations are reflected in cost of sales, this methodology lets Intel move inventory costs in or out of gross margin as market conditions shift, providing a tool to smooth or manage gross‑margin volatility.",

These values are therefore quantitatively incorrect. (2) The calculation itself (adding $95M + $1,243M = $1,338M) is mathematically correct, but the input figures are wrong, leading to an incorrect final total. The ground truth implies that the sum of both companies' payments should be $683 million, meaning at least one (likely both) of the individual figures provided by the LLM is inaccurate.

In contrast, FedEx's 2024 report does not provide specific dollar amounts but notes that lower volumes contributed to reductions in purchased transportation costs, indicating a more qualitative, volume-driven narrative.

The ground truth states that FedEx's 2024 report does *not* provide specific dollar amounts for purchased transportation costs, but the LLM claims FedEx reported a figure of $20.9 billion (‑4% to $20.9 bn, 23.9% of revenue), which contradicts the original answer and is unsupported by the provided truth. This is a major quantitative error. Additionally, UPS's figures are correctly cited as $3.33 billion (U.S.) and $3.77 billion (International), matching the ground truth ($3,333 million and $3,773 million), so those numbers are accurate with acceptable formatting variation. (2) The calculation of percentages (e.g., 23.9% of revenue) and the claim of a -4% change are not present or verifiable in the original answer and appear to be fabricated or misattributed, further undermining quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that it attempts to contrast UPS’s granular disclosure with FedEx’s narrative focus, but it inverts the interpretation: the original answer suggests UPS is more transparent and segmented, while FedEx uses qualitative volume-based explanations. The LLM incorrectly frames FedEx as more transparent due to alleged specific figures and initiatives like DRIVE, while portraying UPS as 'static'—this misrepresents the core contrast. The original answer does not mention DRIVE or any FedEx cost-saving programs, so this is an unsupported addition. (4) Despite the incorrect data, the LLM stays contextually relevant by addressing the question about cost management approaches in a volume-sensitive market and attempting a comparative analysis.

The difference between these amounts is $3.388 billion. This contrast indicates that Disney was in a net collateral receipt position, reflecting inflows from its hedging activities, whereas Verizon was in a net collateral payment position, reflecting outflows related to its derivative contracts.",

However, the LLM fails to specify the exact amount of Disney's collateral receipts ($4.1 billion), instead referring only to 'net collateral receipts' without quantifying them. This omission affects quantitative accuracy. The difference of $3.388 billion is therefore missing from the LLM answer, and no calculation is provided. (2) The $712 million figure for Verizon is correctly cited. Disney’s $4.1 billion receipt is not mentioned numerically, making it impossible to verify the difference. While 'net collateral receipts' is a correct characterization, the lack of the specific dollar amount reduces precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly infers that Disney was in a positive net collateral position and Verizon in a negative one, indicating correct synthesis of directional positions. However, the absence of Disney’s specific receipt amount weakens the comparative analysis requested in the question. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the contrast in net collateral positions and uses appropriate financial terminology.

      "original_answer": "Tesla manages its customer receivables through Variable Interest Entity (VIE) arrangements, where it consolidates the financial position and results of operations of these VIEs into its financial statements. Tesla's VIE agreements grant it the power to manage and make decisions affecting the operation of these entities, including managing customer receivables, while fund investors have more protective rights. In contrast, Home Depot addresses credit risk related to its customer receivables through a valuation allowance, which was explicitly stated as not being material to its consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022. This indicates that Tesla assumes more direct control and operational involvement in receivables management through third-party arrangements, while Home Depot relies on internal reserves to mitigate credit risk, suggesting a more self-contained and conservative risk management framework.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla isolates the credit‑risk exposure on its solar‑energy sales by placing the related customer contracts and receivables in variable‑interest entities (VIEs). As the 2023 filing explains, Tesla “consolidates…the financial position…of these VIEs” and the fund investors “have no recourse to our general credit,” meaning the VIE structure shields the company from direct loss on those receivables【page_91】.  \n\nHome Depot, by contrast, carries its customer receivables directly on its balance sheet, noting only that “the valuation allowance related to these receivables was not material” and providing no special entity‑level protection【page_47】.  \n\nThus, Tesla’s use of VIEs reflects a risk‑management framework that off‑loads credit risk to separate entities, while Home Depot relies on traditional credit‑extension practices and a modest allowance, indicating a simpler, internal approach to credit risk.",

      "original_answer": "Colgate-Palmolive disclosed that the estimated fair value of its long-term debt was $7,433 million as of December 31, 2024, while the carrying value was higher at $7,941 million, indicating a discount in the market valuation of its debt. Coca-Cola, on the other hand, reported a significantly higher fair value of long-term debt at $38,052 million as of the same date. Coca-Cola’s disclosure also included context about the use of interest rate swaps to manage fair value exposure due to changes in benchmark interest rates, which directly affects the valuation of its debt. Additionally, Coca-Cola extinguished $485 million of long-term debt in 2024, resulting in a $22 million gain, suggesting active debt portfolio management. In contrast, Colgate-Palmolive’s disclosure focused solely on valuation methodology without mentioning active debt restructuring or hedging activities. These differences indicate that while both companies report fair value for long-term debt, Coca-Cola’s disclosures suggest a more dynamic debt management strategy involving interest rate hedging and proactive debt retirement, whereas Colgate-Palmolive’s approach appears more static in terms of valuation and reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "Colgate‑Palmolive’s 10‑K shows that the only fair‑value impact it reports on its long‑term debt is a **$‑785 million adjustment in 2024 (and $‑972 million in 2023)** that “represents the changes in fair values due to changes in benchmark interest rates.”  The footnote explains that the **average‑rate figures are already adjusted for the effect of the company’s interest‑rate‑swap and cross‑currency‑swap agreements**, and it notes a single early‑retirement event – the extinguishment of **$485 million of debt** that produced a modest **$22 million gain**.\n\nCoca‑Cola’s 10‑K, by contrast, discloses a **much larger fair‑value adjustment on its long‑term debt (approximately $‑1.2 billion in 2024)** and explicitly attributes that adjustment to the **valuation of its portfolio of interest‑rate‑swap contracts that are used to convert a substantial portion of its floating‑rate borrowings to fixed‑rate exposure**.  In addition, Coca‑Cola reports that it **retired $1.3 billion of debt early in 2024**, recognizing a **gain of roughly $45 million**.\n\nThe differing disclosures therefore reflect two distinct debt‑management approaches: Colgate‑Palmolive uses swaps mainly to smooth the reported weighted‑average rate and makes only occasional, small‑scale early retirements, indicating a relatively passive “maintain‑the‑profile” strategy; Coca‑Cola relies more heavily on swaps to actively reshape its rate mix and regularly extinguishes debt early when market conditions allow, showing a more aggressive, cost‑optimization strategy.",

(1) Quantitative Accuracy: The LLM incorrectly states that Colgate-Palmolive reported a '$-785 million adjustment' in 2024 due to changes in benchmark interest rates. The ground truth does not mention any such adjustment for Colgate-Palmolive; instead, it reports the fair value ($7,433M) and carrying value ($7,941M) of long-term debt, implying a $508M difference (discount), not $785M. Similarly, the claim of a '$-972 million' adjustment in 2023 has no support in the original answer. The LLM also incorrectly attributes a $485M debt extinguishment and $22M gain to Colgate-Palmolive, when these figures belong to Coca-Cola in the ground truth. Conversely, the LLM assigns a $1.3B early retirement with a $45M gain to Coca-Cola, but the original answer specifies only $485M retired with a $22M gain. The claimed $-1.2B fair-value adjustment for Coca-Cola is not mentioned in the original answer, which only provides fair value ($38,052M) and carrying value implicitly through context. (2) Completeness: While the LLM attempts to compare both companies’ use of interest rate swaps and early extinguishment, it misattributes key facts and omits the core data points (fair and carrying values) for both firms. (3) Entity Accuracy: The companies are correctly identified, and the year (2024) is accurate, but financial metrics are wrongly assigned. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop synthesis is flawed because the LLM draws conclusions based on fabricated or swapped numbers. For example, concluding that Colgate uses swaps to 'smooth average rates' is unsupported by the original answer, which explicitly states Colgate did not disclose any hedging activities. The characterization of Coca-Cola’s strategy as more aggressive is plausible, but based on incorrect data. (5) Semantic Equivalence: The overall narrative structure mirrors the original, but the factual foundation is unsound.

      "original_answer": "The difference in the 2024 healthcare cost trend rate assumption between DIS and VZ impacts their respective financial obligations related to postretirement medical plans by influencing the estimated future benefit payments and liabilities. VZ assumes a 2024 healthcare cost trend rate of 8.80%, which is significantly higher than the 4.50% rate to which it will gradually decline after 2034. This high initial assumption increases VZ’s projected healthcare costs and long-term liabilities. Meanwhile, DIS acknowledges that assumptions like the healthcare cost trend rate significantly affect reported net periodic benefit costs and benefit obligations, though it does not specify its own rate. However, DIS also estimates $36 million in expected Medicare subsidy receipts, which directly reduces its net future benefit payments. Therefore, while both companies are impacted by healthcare cost trend assumptions, VZ’s higher assumed rate increases its financial burden, whereas DIS benefits from subsidies that offset some of its obligations.",

This inversion of companies and rates is a critical error. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: the percentages are misattributed to the wrong companies. The ground truth states VZ = 8.80%, declining after 2034, and DIS does not disclose its rate but expects $36M in Medicare subsidies. The LLM answer fabricates a 7.00% rate for VZ and incorrectly assigns 8.80% to DIS. No mention is made of DIS’s $36M subsidy, a key offsetting factor. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the impact of trend rates and subsidies across the two companies. It incorrectly concludes that DIS has higher obligations due to a higher assumed rate, when in fact DIS benefits from subsidies and does not disclose its rate, while VZ’s higher rate increases its liability. The causal logic is applied to incorrect data.

      "llm_answer": "**Coca‑Cola (KO)** – As of 31 Dec 2021 the company had non‑vested performance‑share‑unit (PSU) awards that were granted with a three‑year performance period and, in 2021, an additional “emerging‑stronger” two‑year award. The awards are measured against three equally‑weighted operating metrics – net operating revenues, earnings‑per‑share and free cash flow – and include a relative total‑shareholder‑return (TSR) modifier that can increase or decrease the final share count. The weighted‑average grant‑date fair value of the PSU awards was roughly $47–$51 per unit (e.g., $47.04 for 2021 grants, $50.90 for the non‑vested balance on 31 Dec 2021)【page_99】, and the company disclosed target, threshold and maximum award levels for each performance period【page_99】.\n\n**PepsiCo (PEP)** – PepsiCo’s long‑term equity awards are called Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that settle in shares and accrue dividend equivalents. The PSUs are tied to the company’s total‑shareholder‑return relative to a peer group (the primary performance condition) and can vary between a minimum threshold, target and maximum award. The weighted‑average grant‑date fair value of the RSU/PSU awards was about $132 per unit in 2021, with 2,636 k units granted and roughly 5.9 M units outstanding at year‑end【page_92】; the outstanding PSU awards at target were $45 M with a maximum potential of $92 M【page_90】.\n\n**What this reveals** – Coca‑Cola’s PSU structure emphasizes a blend of operational results (revenues, EPS, cash flow) plus a TSR modifier, showing a compensation philosophy that rewards executives for both business‑performance drivers and shareholder returns, while also adding shorter‑term “emerging‑stronger” awards for agility. PepsiCo, by contrast, leans more heavily on a pure TSR‑relative metric and assigns a much higher fair‑value per unit, indicating a strategy that aligns executive pay primarily with shareholder‑wealth creation and uses larger‑valued PSU awards to drive that alignment.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer provides extensive detail on both KO and PEP's PSU structures, but it fails to address the key differentiating fact from the ground truth — that as of December 2021, KO had approximately 1,725,000 nonvested PSUs at the threshold level, while PEP reported zero threshold-level awards. This is the central quantitative and strategic distinction in the original answer, yet the LLM does not mention PEP's zero threshold awards or KO's explicit threshold-level outstanding units. Instead, it vaguely states that both companies have threshold, target, and maximum levels, which contradicts the ground truth for PEP. (2) Several numbers are presented (e.g., $47–$51 per unit for KO, $132 per unit for PEP, 2,636k granted, 5.9M outstanding), but these are not directly comparable to the ground truth because the original answer focuses on threshold-level outstanding awards (1.725M for KO, 0 for PEP), which the LLM omits entirely. The LLM’s inclusion of $45M at target and $92M maximum for PEP is contextually relevant but does not compensate for missing the threshold-zero fact. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the LLM correctly identifies different performance metrics (operational vs. TSR) and draws strategic inferences — but it fails the core synthesis: comparing the existence (or absence) of threshold-level awards as a signal of compensation philosophy. This undermines the conclusion about PEP being more performance-contingent. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer discusses PSU structures, performance conditions, and executive pay alignment. However, the absence of the key threshold data and the incorrect implication that PEP has a threshold level award structure (when it had zero at threshold) results in a major factual and strategic misrepresentation. Thus, while the answer is detailed and relevant, it is not factually accurate on the critical differentiator, warranting a low correctness score.",

This 56/44 split is fabricated and not supported by the source data. PepsiCo's 40% figure is correctly reported. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised because the key numeric claim about Coca-Cola (44%) is false. There is no evidence in the ground truth for any specific split, let alone 56/44. The only valid number in the response is PepsiCo’s ~40%, which matches the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model invents data for Coca-Cola instead of acknowledging the absence of a precise figure.

(4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right companies and segments and attempts a comparison, but the core factual error undermines the entire response.

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. The ground truth states the combined increase was $715 million, but the LLM calculates $670 million. This stems from incorrect base figures: the LLM claims JNJ's increase was ~$247 million (from $6.9B to $7.14B), but the original answer does not provide 2022 data, only stating 2023 sales of $7.1B and a 3.6% increase. The LLM's derived $247M increase implies a 3.6% growth from $6.9B, which is mathematically plausible, but the original answer reports $7.1B (not $7.14B), suggesting a smaller increase. For MDT, the LLM estimates a $425M increase (5% of ~$8.535B base), but the original answer states MDT’s 2023 sales were $8,959 million (i.e., $8.959B), so a 5% YoY increase implies a 2022 base of ~$8.532B — the LLM’s calculation is numerically consistent here. However, the sum of $247M + $425M = $672M still does not match the correct total of $715M. 2) The LLM introduces CONCERTA growth (22%) and declines in antipsychotics, which are not mentioned in the original answer — this is extraneous and unsupported detail. The original only cites SPRAVATO and physician/patient demand as drivers for JNJ. 3) The qualitative reasoning about MDT’s neuromodulation and specialty devices aligns well with the original answer’s emphasis on neuromodulation technologies. 4) Despite incorrect numbers and some fabricated details, the LLM correctly identifies both companies, the right year (2023), the general direction and drivers of growth, and attempts proper multi-hop synthesis. However, the core quantitative error in the total combined increase — the primary metric asked — reduces confidence significantly. Minor formatting variations (e.g., $8.96B vs $8,959 million) are acceptable, but the $45M discrepancy in the total growth is not negligible.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. According to the ground truth, the combined total is $1.407595 trillion (1,407.595 billion), but the LLM reports $1,418.4 billion, which is off by ~10.8 billion. More critically, the LLM incorrectly attributes $18.4 billion in deposits to MetLife (MET), summing three figures ($8,115M + $7,595M + $2,734M) that do not represent MET's total 2023 deposits in the knowledge graph. The ground truth implies MET's deposits are only $7.595 billion (from $7,595 million), not $18.444 billion. Wells Fargo's deposits are approximated as $1.4 trillion, which is close to the actual $1.4 trillion component in the sum but lacks precision. (2) The calculation for MetLife is fundamentally wrong—there is no evidence in the ground truth that MET has multiple deposit lines summing to $18.4B; rather, the correct MET deposit figure appears to be $7.595 billion. The LLM invented a multi-component structure for MET deposits not supported by the data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: the model should have retrieved MET's 2023 deposits ($7.595B) and WFC's 2023 deposits ($1,400B) and summed them to 1,407.595B. Instead, it fabricated a sum for MET using incorrect line items. (4) Despite the severe quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right companies, time frame, and metric (deposits), and attempts the correct operation (summing). Hence, contextual relevance is high, but correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to incorrect data and flawed arithmetic reasoning.",

However, the combined sales total is incorrect: the LLM calculates $7,140M + $8,959M = $16,099M, while the ground truth is $16,546M. This discrepancy of $447M suggests either incorrect input figures or a calculation error. The individual sales figures cited by the LLM ($7,140M for JNJ and $8,959M for MDT) do not sum to the correct total, indicating at least one of these inputs is inaccurate. (2) Calculation verification: $7,140 + $8,959 = $16,099 — math is correct, but the inputs are likely wrong since they don't align with the ground truth total. The correct total per original answer is $16,546M, so the LLM's total is off by nearly $450M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound — the model correctly identifies both companies, extracts Neuroscience sales and growth rates from respective sources, and compares them appropriately. The logic and structure for synthesizing across entities are valid.

However, it fails to convert KO's share count into a dollar value using the grant date fair value of $47.04 per share, which is necessary to compute the actual difference in unvested share-based compensation. The ground truth calculates KO's total as $175.182 million (9,759,000 × $47.04), but the LLM leaves KO's value in shares, making direct comparison impossible. (2) While the individual inputs are mostly accurate (KO's ~9.76M shares vs. 9,759,000; PEP's $92M), the critical calculation — the $83M difference — is missing entirely. The LLM does not perform or report the subtraction of $92M from $175.182M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is incomplete: the model retrieves relevant data points from both 10-Ks but fails to synthesize them into a financial comparison. It incorrectly treats KO’s award as purely share-based without converting to dollar terms, despite the question asking for a difference in award levels, which implies a common (dollar) unit.

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors, particularly in the calculation of combined Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). The Accenture OCI value is reported as $188,359 thousand (i.e., $188.359 million), which is correct, but Texas Instruments' OCI is stated as $65 million—this is incorrect. The ground truth specifies TXN's OCI as $65 (not million), meaning $65 thousand or $0.065 million. The LLM incorrectly treats it as $65 million, leading to a grossly inflated combined OCI of $253 million instead of the correct $189,024 (or ~$0.189 million). This error propagates into the comparison with Net Income, where the LLM claims OCI is 'about 2% of one percent' (~0.02%), but the correct figure is approximately 0.25% as per the original answer. (2) Net Income values are mostly accurate: Accenture’s $7,419,197 thousand (~$7.42 billion) and Texas Instruments’ $4,799 million are correct. However, the combined Net Income is correctly approximated at ~$12.22 billion. The core mistake lies in the OCI sum: correct values are $188,359 (ACN) + $65 (TXN) = $189,024, not $253 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model identifies both companies, the correct metric (OCI, net of tax), and Net Income for 2024, and attempts a comparative analysis. However, due to the misinterpretation of TXN's OCI unit (confusing dollars with millions), the synthesis fails quantitatively. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses all parts of the question, uses proper financial terminology, and attempts meaningful comparison. Despite correct reasoning flow and entity identification, the critical numerical error in TXN's OCI value severely undermines factual accuracy, warranting a low correctness and quantitative accuracy score.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing's financial exposure is highly sensitive to changes in gross margins, where a 1% change in margin could result in a $330 million impact on operating earnings due to its reliance on firm orders and complex estimation process for program profitability. Raytheon, with a $78 billion defense backlog as of December 31, 2023, also depends on firm orders to drive future revenue and operational planning. A decline in firm orders would reduce Raytheon’s future revenue visibility and could impact its ability to manage long-term contracts efficiently, while Boeing would face direct earnings volatility due to its margin sensitivity and program cost structures. Together, both companies face significant financial risk if firm orders decrease, though the mechanisms differ—Boeing through margin volatility and Raytheon through reduced backlog conversion.",

Number formats match or are acceptably varied ($330 million, $78 billion). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—both figures are correctly cited from the knowledge base, and no calculations are required beyond what is stated.

According to the ground truth, the difference in total committed payments between ACN and TXN is $1,953 million. However, the LLM calculates a difference of only $201 million ($1,200M - $999M), which is off by over $1.75 billion. This indicates a major quantitative error. (2) The individual values cited—$999 million for Accenture (ACN) and $1,200 million for Texas Instruments (TXN)—are both incorrect based on the ground truth data. Since the correct difference is $1,953 million, it implies that either one or both of the source values are wrong. For example, if ACN were $999M, TXN would need to be ~$2,952M to yield a $1,953M difference, which is not the case in the LLM’s response. Thus, both the inputs and the calculation are flawed. (3) While the LLM demonstrates an understanding of the multi-hop nature of the question—comparing future lease obligations from two separate 10-K filings—the reasoning fails due to reliance on incorrect data. The model correctly identifies the relevant metric (total committed lease payments) and attempts to compute the difference, but the synthesis is based on inaccurate figures.

In contrast, UPS specifically excludes five distinct categories: goodwill and asset impairment charges, a one-time compensation payment to supervisors, a regulatory matter expense, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal expense, and defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses. This reveals that UPS takes a more detailed and itemized approach to its adjusted measures, isolating specific events and expenses to better reflect ongoing operational performance, whereas MMM's approach appears more general and less prescriptive in its exclusions.",
      "llm_answer": "3M’s adjusted (non‑GAAP) measures are stripped of “special items” – chiefly the costs of significant litigation, the gains or losses from PFAS‑related product sales, divestiture‑related gains, losses and restructuring charges, and a pension‑risk‑transfer expense – because the company views these as non‑recurring, non‑operational influences on earnings. UPS’s adjusted measures, by contrast, exclude a set of one‑time accounting and regulatory items – goodwill and asset‑impairment charges, a one‑time labor‑agreement payment, a regulatory‑settlement expense, a multi‑employer pension‑plan withdrawal charge, and the volatility from defined‑benefit pension and post‑retirement plan gains and losses – to focus on the underlying operating performance of its logistics business (e.g., cost‑per‑piece). The difference shows that 3M concentrates on removing litigation, environmental‑product and divestiture effects to gauge pure profitability, while UPS concentrates on eliminating accounting impairments and regulatory/legal settlements to assess the efficiency of its core operating model.",

However, there are key discrepancies in the specifics of MMM's exclusions. The ground truth states that MMM uses the general term 'special items' without specifying exact categories, indicating a broad, generalized approach. In contrast, the LLM answer lists specific exclusions for MMM—litigation costs, PFAS-related gains/losses, divestiture gains/losses, restructuring charges, and pension-risk-transfer expenses—which are not mentioned in the ground truth and represent a more detailed characterization than supported. This over-specifies MMM’s approach, contradicting the original answer’s emphasis on MMM’s lack of detailed disclosure. UPS’s exclusions are accurately described and match the ground truth both in content and specificity. The interpretation of what the differences reveal—that MMM focuses on litigation and divestitures while UPS targets accounting and regulatory items to assess operational efficiency—is reasonable and semantically aligned with the ground truth’s conclusion. There are no numerical values in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable but assumed perfect. The answer is fully contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the multi-part question: (1) how exclusions differ, and (2) what this reveals about performance evaluation.

      "original_answer": "The combined Trade Accounts Payable for Danaher and Merck as of December 31, 2024, is $5,832 million. Danaher's Trade Accounts Payable is $1,753 million, and Merck's is $4,079 million. Danaher's total current assets are $9,497 million, and Merck's are $38,782 million. The combined Trade Accounts Payable represents approximately 12.1% of their combined total current assets ($5,832 / $48,279).",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 balance sheets show Danaher with trade accounts payable of **$1,753 million** and Merck with **$4,079 million**, giving a **combined total of $5,832 million**.  Danaher’s current assets were $9,497 million and Merck’s were $38,782 million, so the combined trade‑payable balance represents roughly **12 % of the two companies’ combined current assets of $48,279 million** (and is lower than each firm’s individual current‑asset total).",

(1) All numeric values are accurate: Danaher's Trade Accounts Payable ($1,753 million), Merck's ($4,079 million), combined total ($5,832 million), Danaher's current assets ($9,497 million), Merck's ($38,782 million), and combined current assets ($48,279 million) are all correctly reported. The percentage calculation (5,832 / 48,279 ≈ 12.1%) is accurately rounded to 'roughly 12%'—a reasonable approximation. (2) The calculations are correct: 1,753 + 4,079 = 5,832; 9,497 + 38,782 = 48,279; and 5,832 / 48,279 ≈ 12.08% ≈ 12%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies and synthesizes data from two companies (Danaher and Merck), extracts the correct financial metrics (Trade Accounts Payable and Total Current Assets), computes the combined totals, and performs a comparative analysis. (4) The answer addresses all parts of the question: it provides the combined payable amount, individual components, and compares the liability to combined current assets. Wording differs slightly (e.g., 'lower than each firm’s individual current-asset total'), but this adds contextual insight without distorting facts. All entities (DHR, MRK), metrics, and the date (December 31, 2024) are correct. Semantic equivalence is maintained throughout.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of self-insurance liabilities for Amazon and Lowe's as of their respective fiscal years ended in 2024, and what does this reveal about their relative risk exposure in the Consumer Discretionary sector?",
      "original_answer": "The combined total of self-insurance liabilities for Amazon and Lowe's as of their respective fiscal years ended in 2024 is $8.932 billion. Amazon reported $8.5 billion in self-insurance liabilities, while Lowe's reported $432 million. This significant disparity reveals that Amazon assumes a much larger self-insured risk exposure compared to Lowe's, which may reflect Amazon's broader operational scale, more complex global logistics network, and higher employee base, all of which contribute to greater potential liabilities that the company retains rather than insuring through third-party providers.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon reported total self‑insurance liabilities (current + non‑current) of **$8.5 billion** for the fiscal year ended February 2 2024 (see Amazon 10‑K, Note 5, “Self‑insurance liabilities” – $8.5 B). Lowe’s reported total self‑insurance liabilities of **$1.2 billion** for the fiscal year ended January 31 2024 (see Lowe’s 10‑K, Note 5, “Self‑insurance liabilities” – $1.2 B).  \n\n**Combined total:** **≈ $9.7 billion**.  \n\nThis indicates that, within the Consumer Discretionary sector, Amazon carries a markedly larger self‑insurance exposure than Lowe’s, reflecting a higher concentration of risk related to workers’ compensation, product liability and other self‑insured claims.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in the quantitative values. While Amazon's self-insurance liabilities are correctly reported at $8.5 billion, Lowe's is incorrectly stated as $1.2 billion instead of the correct $432 million from the ground truth. This leads to an incorrect combined total of approximately $9.7 billion instead of the correct $8.932 billion. The error in Lowe's liability is substantial—over 2.7 times the actual amount—indicating a critical failure in data retrieval or synthesis. (2) Calculations: The sum of $8.5B + $1.2B = $9.7B is mathematically correct, but based on incorrect input data. The correct sum should be $8.5B + $0.432B = $8.932B. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies the need to extract self-insurance liabilities from both companies and combine them, showing appropriate structural reasoning. However, the failure to retrieve the correct value for Lowe's breaks the integrity of the synthesis. The qualitative interpretation about Amazon having higher risk exposure is directionally correct and contextually reasonable, but the comparison is weakened by the inflated figure for Lowe’s. (4) Scoring justification: Correctness is scored at 4 due to one correct major figure (Amazon) and one major error (Lowe’s), leading to an incorrect total and misleading magnitude in the comparison. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to the significant error in Lowe’s liability amount. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (5) because the reasoning framework and sector comparison are sound, but based on flawed data. Contextual relevance is high (8) as the response addresses all parts of the question, cites appropriate notes and filings, and provides meaningful interpretation within the sector.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing received $1.7 billion in tax refunds under the CARES Act in 2021, significantly improving its liquidity. In contrast, Union Pacific had a net tax payment of $12 million to taxing authorities in 2021. The difference in their tax-related cash flows was $1,712 million, with Boeing benefiting substantially from the tax provision while Union Pacific experienced a smaller outflow.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s 2021 liquidity was boosted by the CARES‑Act loss‑carryback, which produced **about $1.7 billion of tax refunds** that flowed into cash in 2021【page_71】.  \nUnion Pacific, by contrast, recorded **approximately $1.8 billion of current tax expense** (the cash it paid to tax authorities) for 2021【page_74】.  \n\nThus, Boeing’s tax‑related cash flow was a **$1.7 billion inflow**, while Union Pacific’s was a **$1.8 billion outflow**, creating a net difference of roughly **$3.5 billion** in favor of Boeing.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Boeing's $1.7 billion in tax refunds from the CARES Act in 2021, which aligns with the ground truth and positively impacted its liquidity. However, it incorrectly states Union Pacific's net tax payment as $1.8 billion, whereas the ground truth specifies a net tax payment of only $12 million. This is a significant factual error. (2) The calculation of the difference in tax-related cash flows is therefore incorrect: the LLM computes a $3.5 billion difference ($1.7B inflow + $1.8B outflow), but the correct difference is $1,712 million ($1.7B - (-$12M) = $1,712M). The LLM’s use of $1.8 billion for Union Pacific appears to conflate current tax expense with actual cash payments, which is not supported by the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—Boeing’s inflow and Union Pacific’s outflow are correctly framed as opposing cash flow impacts—but the synthesis fails due to the incorrect data point for Union Pacific. The model does connect the two companies’ tax cash flows and attempts a comparison, but the erroneous magnitude undermines the conclusion. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses all parts of the question: impact on liquidity, comparison of tax cash flows, and resulting difference. However, due to the major quantitative inaccuracy in Union Pacific’s tax payment and the resulting flawed difference calculation, the overall correctness score is limited to 4. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because the reasoning structure is logical but based on incorrect data. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the large discrepancy in Union Pacific’s reported tax payment.",

      "original_answer": "PEP reported that in 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club, represented approximately 13% of its consolidated net revenue, with this revenue generated across all divisions, including concentrate sales to independent bottlers used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. Sam's Club, as a segment of Walmart, receives the majority of its non-fuel merchandise through 28 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically across the U.S., along with some shared Walmart U.S. distribution facilities. This robust and strategically placed distribution infrastructure enables Sam's Club to efficiently receive and stock merchandise, including PEP's products, at scale. As a result, this infrastructure supports Walmart's ability to serve as a major customer for PEP, facilitating the consistent flow of products necessary to sustain PEP's significant revenue dependency on this customer relationship.",

(1) Quantitative accuracy: The 13% revenue dependency figure and the 28 dedicated distribution facilities are correctly cited, with proper context of 2021 and PEP's 10-K as the source. No calculation errors. (2) Entity accuracy: Correctly identifies PEP (PepsiCo), Walmart Inc., Sam’s Club, and their relationship.

(4) Completeness: Addresses both the 13% revenue dependency and how the distribution network supports it. Only minor omission is that the original answer notes some shared Walmart U.S. facilities and that revenue includes concentrate sales to bottlers who sell to Walmart—this additional nuance is missing but does not undermine the core correctness.

The ground truth total is $33,548, but the LLM reports $14 million ($1M + $13M), which is off by several orders of magnitude. Both individual contributions cited—$1 million for ACN and $13 million for TXN—are incorrect. The actual participant contributions must have been significantly lower (likely in the thousands, not millions) to sum to $33,548. (2) Number/calculation verification: The addition of $1M + $13M = $14M is mathematically correct, but the inputs are wildly inaccurate. $14 million is over 400 times larger than the correct total of $33,548. This indicates a fundamental error in data extraction from the source tables, likely misreading units (e.g., treating thousands as millions or failing to parse exact figures). (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The model correctly identifies the two required components—participant contributions for ACN's non-U.S. pension plans and TXN's U.S. retiree health care plans—and attempts to sum them. This shows proper identification of entities and metrics, fulfilling the multi-hop structure. However, the reasoning collapses due to incorrect data retrieval. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is scored 1 due to complete factual inaccuracy in numbers despite correct structure. Quantitative accuracy is 1 because the values and result are extremely wrong. Qualitative accuracy is 2 because the model understands the required entities and logic but fails in execution.

The individual components are accurate and match the ground truth. However, the final combined total is stated as 'approximately $4.39 billion', which equals $4,390 million, but the correct sum of $405 million + $3,986 million is $4,391 million — still consistent when rounded. The major error is that the ground truth states the combined obligation is $4,773 million, which contradicts the component math. Upon verification, $405 + $3,986 = $4,391 million, not $4,773 million. Therefore, the original answer appears to contain a factual error. The LLM answer performs correct calculations based on accurate component values, but the ground truth's final total is incorrect. Despite this, the LLM reports $4.39 billion (i.e., $4,390 million), which is a properly rounded version of $4,391 million. Thus, the LLM answer is quantitatively more accurate than the provided ground truth. However, since the evaluation must be based on alignment with the original answer (ground truth), and the LLM does not arrive at $4,773 million, it is marked down.

      "question": "Considering the different hedging strategies described by Netflix and Google, how do the impacts of their respective hedging gains of $124 million and $211 million in 2024 compare relative to their international revenue exposures, and what does this suggest about their foreign exchange risk management approaches?",
      "original_answer": "In 2024, Netflix reported hedging gains of $124 million, which were included in 'Streaming revenues' and primarily related to foreign exchange hedges on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing/production costs denominated in non-U.S. currencies. Google reported hedging gains of $211 million as part of its total revenues of $350,018 million, reflecting gains from its foreign exchange risk management activities. Netflix's hedging directly impacts both revenue and cost of revenues depending on the nature of the hedged item, while Google's hedging gains appear as a separate line item before being incorporated into total revenues. Given that Netflix's international revenue (excluding the U.S. and Canada) accounted for the majority of its streaming revenue, the $124 million gain suggests a more targeted approach to managing revenue volatility from foreign exchange movements. Google's larger hedging gains relative to Netflix, despite having a much larger revenue base, may indicate a more extensive or aggressive hedging program to manage its global exposure across multiple business lines.",
      "llm_answer": "Google reported a $211 million hedging gain in 2024, which is only about 0.06 % of its $350 billion total revenue and covers roughly half of its revenue that is earned outside the United States (≈51 % international). Netflix’s $124 million hedging gain represents roughly 0.4 % of its ~ $31 billion streaming‑revenue base, where the overwhelming majority of members are outside the United States and Canada. Thus, the hedging gain is proportionally much larger for Netflix, suggesting it relies more heavily on FX hedges to protect its international earnings, whereas Google’s much smaller relative gain indicates a more modest, lower‑impact hedging program relative to its larger, more diversified revenue mix.",

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly states Google's $211 million hedging gain and $350 billion total revenue (approximated as $350B, matching the original $350,018 million), and Netflix's $124 million gain against ~$31 billion streaming revenue. The proportional calculations are sound: 0.06% ($211M / $350B) and ~0.4% ($124M / $31B) are accurate estimates. (2) The LLM correctly identifies that Netflix’s international revenue constitutes the 'overwhelming majority' of its streaming base, consistent with the ground truth stating international (ex-U.S. and Canada) revenue is the majority. (3) The reasoning correctly infers that Netflix’s larger relative hedging gain suggests a more intensive reliance on FX hedges to protect earnings, while Google’s smaller proportional gain implies a more modest or diversified approach—this is a valid interpretation supported by the original answer’s suggestion of Google having a 'more extensive or aggressive hedging program' but across a much larger, diversified base. (4) Minor point: the original notes Google’s hedging gains are reported as a separate line item before total revenues, while Netflix’s are embedded in 'Streaming revenues'—this nuance in accounting treatment is missing in the LLM answer, slightly reducing completeness.

These values are off by more than an order of magnitude. The resulting combined exposure is therefore also incorrect: $15.289 billion vs. the correct $1.2 billion. (2) The calculations themselves (adding $13,651M + $1,638M = $15,289M) are mathematically correct, but since the input figures are wrong, the result is invalid. The ground truth sum of $700M + $500M = $1.2B is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM correctly identified that it must extract exposure figures from both AIG and Schwab’s 10-Ks and sum them—but the data extraction failed. This suggests either hallucination or reliance on incorrect source data.

While it correctly identifies Danaher and Merck and their 2023 corporate separation activities, the individual amounts reported—$145 million for Danaher and $115 million for Merck—are not aligned with the ground truth total of $154 million. The sum of the LLM's figures ($260 million) is nearly double the correct total. (2) Quantitative accuracy is poor: the ground truth indicates the combined investment banking fees were $154 million, but the LLM reports $260 million, a substantial miscalculation. Even if the question asked for a sum of all separation-related costs (not just investment banking fees), the LLM's total still exceeds the verified total, suggesting incorrect sourcing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—identifying both companies’ separation events and pulling figures from their 10-Ks—but fails in accurate synthesis. The model appears to conflate total separation-related costs with investment banking fees specifically, and does not reflect any proration or extraction of only the investment banking component as implied by the ground truth. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, events, and document types (10-K filings), and attempts the correct calculation. However, due to major numerical and categorical inaccuracies (mixing total separation costs with investment banking fees), the correctness score is low.

      "original_answer": "PEP's 2021 consolidated net revenue included approximately 13% from sales to Walmart and its affiliates, including Sam's Club. This dependency is significant because Walmart organizes its operations into three reportable segments, one of which is Sam's Club, indicating that a portion of PEP's revenue is tied to Walmart’s warehouse membership club business in the U.S. This shows a direct financial link between PEP and the Sam's Club segment within Walmart’s broader corporate structure.",

      "original_answer": "Cisco accounts for variability in its cooperative marketing programs by estimating expected usage of these programs, applying either the expected value or most likely estimate method, and updates these estimates at each reporting period as actual utilization becomes available. This directly impacts their revenue recognition, as deviations from these estimates could adversely affect revenue. Intel, on the other hand, participates in cooperative advertising and marketing programs that partially reimburse customers for marketing activities, and these expenses are accounted for as part of their operating expenditures. While Intel does not explicitly quantify the variability impact, these programs are subject to defined criteria and influence marketing spend forecasting and brand investment returns.",
      "llm_answer": "**Cisco** – In its revenue‑recognition policy Cisco treats the rebates, cooperative‑marketing and other incentive credits that it offers distributors and channel partners as *variable consideration*.  At each reporting period it estimates the amount of credits that will actually be earned – using historical experience and a “most‑likely” or expected‑value approach – and records revenue net of that estimate, updating the estimate as actual utilization becomes known.  The company warns that a material deviation between the estimate and the actual credits would reduce the amount of revenue reported in the period.\n\n**Intel** – Intel’s cooperative‑advertising and marketing programs are accounted for by estimating, at contract inception, the amount it expects to reimburse customers for qualifying marketing activities; that estimate is recorded as a reduction of gross revenue (or as a marketing expense) when the related product is shipped.  Consequently, the size of the estimate directly affects Intel’s reported net revenue and expense line items – a higher estimated reimbursement lowers net revenue, while a lower estimate raises it.",

(1) On Cisco: The LLM correctly identifies that Cisco treats cooperative marketing incentives as variable consideration, uses either the expected value or most likely amount method, updates estimates each period, and recognizes revenue net of these estimates. It also correctly notes that deviations from estimates can reduce reported revenue—this matches the original answer in both fact and implication. (2) On Intel: The LLM states that Intel records estimated reimbursements as a reduction of gross revenue or as a marketing expense upon shipment. However, the original answer clarifies that these are accounted for as operating expenditures and does not support the claim that they are recorded as a reduction of revenue. Instead, Intel treats them as expenses, not as a contra-revenue item. This is a meaningful but not fundamental error in financial reporting treatment. (3) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no numerical claims are made, so no errors exist. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between Cisco’s revenue-centric approach and Intel’s expense-centric approach, synthesizing appropriate implications for financial statements.

(2) All numbers match the ground truth exactly, with only formatting differences (e.g., 'thousands' annotation and billion approximations). The claim that the combined cost is '$17.96 billion lower' than NFLX revenue is also correct: $39,000,966k - $21,043,945k = $17,957,021k ≈ $17.96 billion.

All numeric values match the ground truth exactly. (2) Calculations are correct: the $388 million decrease is accurate (3,927 - 3,539 = 388), and the sum of Schwab entities (11,782 + 13 = 11,795) is correct. However, the LLM states the combined Schwab goodwill is 'roughly thirty times larger than AIG’s goodwill reduction'—this is a misstatement. The comparison should be to AIG’s ending goodwill ($3,539M), not the reduction ($388M). While the ground truth correctly compares Schwab’s total to AIG’s year-end goodwill (3.3x), the LLM incorrectly compares it to the decrease amount, which distorts the comparison.

Similarly, McDonald's profitability is affected by rising commodity costs for ingredients like beef, chicken, and pork, which are subject to volatility due to climate conditions, global demand, and regulatory factors. These increased costs cannot be fully mitigated through hedging, directly affecting restaurant profitability. Both companies face financial risks from commodity cost fluctuations, though the specific materials and mitigation strategies differ based on their industries.",
      "llm_answer": "Elevated commodity prices are forcing the two companies to react in very different ways. General Motors notes that “commodity costs are reflecting greater variability and are expected to remain elevated” and that, because EV‑critical minerals are in short supply, it is expanding its **strategic‑sourcing programme – investing in raw‑material suppliers, signing multi‑year off‑take agreements and holding higher inventories of lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, rare‑earths, etc.** to lock‑in supply for its electric‑vehicle transition (GM 10‑K p. 8). By contrast, McDonald’s warns that “increases in commodity costs… could have an adverse impact on our profitability” because the cost of food, paper, fuel, utilities and other supplies directly squeezes restaurant margins, and the company can only partially offset the risk through limited hedging (McDonald’s 10‑K p. 33).",

(1) All key factual elements are correct: GM's strategy involves long-term sourcing agreements and inventory buildup for EV-critical minerals (lithium, cobalt, nickel, etc.), and McDonald's faces margin pressure from commodity cost increases in food and supplies. The answer correctly cites both companies' 10-K filings (GM p.8, McDonald’s p.33), which matches the source context. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or ground truth requiring calculation; the LLM does not introduce any incorrect figures, so quantitative accuracy is perfect.

The LLM correctly differentiates between GM’s supply-securing strategy and McDonald’s limited hedging ability. (4) The answer is contextually relevant and fully addresses both parts of the question: GM’s raw material sourcing strategy and McDonald’s profitability exposure. The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention external factors like government policies or climate conditions affecting commodity volatility (noted in the ground truth), slightly reducing qualitative completeness.

In contrast, Procter & Gamble disclosed that foreign exchange had a 2% positive impact on their total company Net Sales Growth in fiscal year 2022.

The reconciliation table lists a separate “Foreign‑exchange impact” column for the total company, but the excerpt does not provide a numeric value, meaning the 5 percent growth **includes an unspecified foreign‑exchange effect**.  \n\nThus, Costco’s international sales growth was driven entirely by underlying business performance with a neutral FX effect, whereas P&G’s overall sales growth of 5 percent reflects a net‑sales figure that does incorporate an (unquantified) foreign‑exchange impact.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It claims that Costco's 'Other International' segment had 10% net sales growth and that foreign exchange had 'no impact' because comparable sales excluding FX effects were also 10%. However, the original answer (ground truth) states that Costco did not provide a specific percentage impact from foreign exchange—only that FX affected the conversion of international results into USD. There is no mention in the ground truth of a 10% growth figure or a zero FX impact, so this is an incorrect inference. For Procter & Gamble, the LLM incorrectly states that the foreign exchange impact was 'unspecified', when in fact the ground truth explicitly says P&G reported a 2% positive impact on net sales growth from FX in FY2022. This is a direct contradiction of a key fact. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the 10% figure for Costco and the claim of 'no impact' are unsupported by the ground truth; the 5% total sales growth for P&G is plausible but not confirmed in the original answer, and the critical 2% FX impact is omitted and replaced with 'unspecified', which is false. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model infers a conclusion (zero FX impact for Costco) not supported by the source, and fails to report the actual disclosed FX impact for P&G, instead asserting it was not quantified. This breaks the synthesis required across both companies. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the right companies and topic (FX impact on net sales), and attempts a comparison, but due to factual errors, the conclusion is misleading. The core of the question—how FX impact differed—is misrepresented because the LLM incorrectly claims Costco had no FX impact and P&G's was unquantified, when in reality P&G quantified a positive 2% impact and Costco provided no percentage at all.",

      "question": "How does the difference in inventory valuation practices related to excess and obsolete inventory between Cisco (CSCO) and Intel (INTC) reflect contrasting approaches to managing inventory risk given their respective supply chain commitments and audit considerations?",
      "original_answer": "Cisco (CSCO) records a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments in excess of future demand forecasts, aligning with its valuation of excess and obsolete inventory. This suggests a proactive financial recognition of inventory risk stemming from fixed supplier agreements. In contrast, Intel (INTC) emphasizes judgment and sensitivity analyses in its inventory valuation, particularly for excess and obsolete inventory, due to factors like dynamic pricing, customer forecasts, and limited historical data for new product launches. Intel’s audit process involves extensive testing of demand forecasts and pricing assumptions, indicating a more analytical and forward-looking approach to inventory risk. The $11.1 billion net inventory figure for Intel further underscores the scale and complexity of its inventory management challenges compared to Cisco’s more commitment-driven risk exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco explicitly ties its excess‑and‑obsolete inventory accounting to its supply‑chain contracts. It records a liability for “firm, non‑cancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future‑demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory” (see Cisco MD&A, pages 49‑51), and it has been building higher inventory levels to hedge against the industry‑wide supply‑chain constraints it describes.  \n\nIntel, by contrast, follows the traditional FIFO/NRV method and estimates excess‑and‑obsolete reserves through management judgment at each reporting date, with auditors emphasizing the difficulty of that judgment and performing extensive testing of the underlying assumptions (Intel Audit Report, page 74). Thus Cisco’s practice embeds its long‑term, non‑cancelable supplier commitments directly in the inventory‑risk measurement, whereas Intel relies on periodic, audit‑scrutinized estimates that treat excess/obsolete risk as a valuation judgment rather than a contractual liability.",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—there are no numerical claims in the LLM answer that conflict with the ground truth. The ground truth mentions Intel’s $11.1 billion net inventory, which the LLM omits, but since the LLM does not make any numerical claims (correct or incorrect), this is a minor completeness gap rather than an inaccuracy.

(4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, directly addressing the comparative inventory risk management approaches in light of supply chain and audit factors.

AIG’s action was tied to a restructuring event involving a formerly consolidated subsidiary with a full allowance for credit losses, indicating a reactive and potentially high-risk situation.

      "original_answer": "A 10% across-the-board reduction in U.S. defense appropriations would directly impact both General Dynamics and Raytheon Technologies due to their heavy reliance on federal funding. For General Dynamics, which reported that 70% of its 2021 revenue came from the U.S. government, such a reduction could lead to program cuts, delays, or terminations, especially for multi-year contracts that depend on annual appropriations. This would disrupt revenue timing and potentially reduce contract values. Raytheon, with its exposure to fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts, would face compounded risk because under FPI contracts, cost overruns beyond a negotiated ceiling are not recoverable. A reduction in appropriations could force RTX to absorb more costs without corresponding revenue increases, especially on complex development contracts where cost overruns are common. Both companies could see reduced profitability and liquidity challenges if they are unable to offset lost revenue or manage cost-sharing pressures under FPI and OTA contracts.",

      "original_answer": "ABBV faces significant complexity in estimating $14,304 million in sales rebate accruals, particularly for Medicaid, Medicare, and managed care programs, due to variability in payment timing influenced by rebate contracts, legislative changes, and payer-specific lag times. This creates financial risk tied to the accuracy of accrual estimates and potential cash outflows. In contrast, DHR's operating cash flows are directly affected by the timing of collections and payments, as seen in the $497 million in operating cash flows generated from working capital changes in 2024. The difference highlights ABBV's challenge in forecasting liabilities due to external regulatory and contractual factors, versus DHR's operational challenge in managing internal cash conversion cycles. Together, both companies demonstrate how payment timing influences financial reporting and liquidity, albeit through different mechanisms and financial metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s cash‑management issue centers on the **timing of rebate payments from government and third‑party payers**.  Because Medicaid, Medicare and managed‑care rebates are paid on a lagged schedule, AbbVie must estimate a large accrual ( $14.3 billion at year‑end ) to reflect the expected future outflows, making the timing of those payments a key accounting‑estimate challenge rather than an immediate cash impact.  \n\nDanaher’s cash‑flow challenge is the **timing of its own collections and payments** in the working‑capital cycle; the cash generated from operating activities ( $6.7 billion in 2024 ) rises or falls with how quickly it can collect receivables, move inventory and settle payables, so payment timing directly drives operating cash flow volatility rather than a rebate‑accrual estimate.",

The qualitative reasoning is sound and aligns with the ground truth: ABBV faces external, regulatory-driven timing lags affecting liability estimates, while DHR deals with internal operational cash conversion cycles. This reflects strong conceptual and contextual understanding.\n\n2) However, there are key quantitative inaccuracies: The LLM states ABBV's sales rebate accrual as '$14.3 billion', which is close to the correct $14,304 million and acceptable in rounded form. But it incorrectly reports DHR's operating cash flows as '$6.7 billion in 2024', whereas the ground truth specifies '$497 million in operating cash flows generated from working capital changes in 2024'. This is a major error—the $6.7 billion figure likely refers to total operating cash flow, not the working capital component directly tied to payment timing, which is the focus of the question. The LLM conflates total operating cash flow with the working capital change impact, misrepresenting the metric central to the analysis.\n\n3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially correct: it connects ABBV’s rebate timing to accrual estimation and DHR’s payment timing to cash flow, but fails to precisely isolate the working capital change component for DHR as the driver, which is essential for accurate comparison. The synthesis is conceptually valid but quantitatively imprecise.\n\n4) Justification: The correctness score is 7 due to accurate conceptual framing but significant quantitative error in DHR's figure and mischaracterization of the cash flow metric.

      "question": "How does the indefinite environmental indemnification obligation from Boeing's sale of its BCA facilities impact the potential future liabilities of both Boeing and Union Pacific, given their respective environmental liability disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "Boeing's indefinite indemnification for environmental conditions related to its BCA facilities in Wichita, Tulsa, and McAlester exposes it to uncertain future liabilities, as it cannot estimate the number or magnitude of potential claims. Union Pacific, while not directly responsible for Boeing's indemnifications, faces its own environmental liabilities tied to remediation and monitoring costs, which are also uncertain due to regulatory changes and third-party financial viability. Therefore, while Boeing could face indirect liability through its indemnification obligations, Union Pacific’s liability could increase if environmental conditions at these locations require more extensive remediation, especially if other responsible parties are unable to contribute.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s sale of its BCA facilities created an **indefinite‑period indemnification** that obligates Boeing to reimburse the buyers for any pre‑closing environmental clean‑up costs; because the number and size of any future claims cannot be estimated, Boeing records no liability for the indemnity today and only includes any amounts that become probable in its environmental‑liability note. Union Pacific’s environmental‑liability disclosure similarly acknowledges that it has “indemnification arrangements” with unlimited possible exposure that cannot be reasonably quantified, and it states it does not expect material payments. Thus, the Boeing indemnity adds a contingent, un‑recorded future environmental obligation for Boeing, while Union Pacific’s own disclosures already reflect a comparable, but also un‑quantified, exposure that it believes will not be material.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is factually accurate in its core claims and aligns well with the ground truth, though it omits some contextual nuance. (1) Quantitatively, there are no numbers, dates, or financial figures in either answer to verify—both rely on qualitative disclosures about unquantifiable liabilities—so the quantitative accuracy is not compromised. The LLM correctly states that Boeing does not record a liability due to inability to estimate claims, which matches the original. (2) The LLM accurately identifies both Boeing’s and Union Pacific’s unquantified, indefinite indemnification exposures and correctly notes that neither company expects material payments, reflecting their disclosures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects Boeing’s indemnification from the BCA sale to its contingent liability and parallels Union Pacific’s own unlimited exposure. However, the LLM answer slightly misses the synthesis point in the original answer that Union Pacific’s liability could increase if other responsible parties (e.g., Boeing or others) fail to contribute—this forward-looking interdependence is downplayed. (4) While the LLM captures the main idea—both have unrecorded, uncertain liabilities—the original answer provides a clearer causal link between Boeing’s indemnity and potential indirect liability for Union Pacific in worst-case remediation scenarios. The LLM treats the two companies’ exposures as parallel rather than interrelated, which slightly weakens the qualitative accuracy. Still, the answer is contextually relevant and factually correct overall, warranting a high but not perfect score.",

It claims Intel's effective tax rate was -119.8% and Cisco's was 15.6%, making Intel's rate 135 percentage points lower. However, the ground truth states that Intel's rate was 15.6% *lower* than Cisco's—not that Cisco's rate was 15.6%. This misrepresents both the magnitude and direction of the comparison. There is no support for a negative tax rate of -119.8% in the ground truth, which would imply an enormous tax benefit far beyond what is described. (2) The calculation is fundamentally incorrect: claiming a 135-point difference based on -119.8% vs 15.6% is mathematically valid *if* those numbers were correct, but they contradict the original answer, which clearly states the *difference* was 15.6 percentage points. The LLM inverted the meaning. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies R&D tax credits as a key driver of Intel's tax benefit and accurately describes their function (providing a benefit based on R&D spending independent of pre-tax income), this qualitative insight does not compensate for the severe quantitative error. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses both parts of the question and cites plausible mechanisms, but the numerical foundation is so flawed that the overall correctness is very low.

However, it introduces a new figure—LMT's net funded status of $6.2 billion unfunded liability—which is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth. This figure appears to be fabricated or misattributed. (2) For FDX, the LLM states a $1.6 billion deficit, but the ground truth reports a $487 million underfunded status. This is a significant numerical error—over three times the actual amount—severely impacting quantitative accuracy. (3) The reasoning structure is sound: the model attempts a multi-hop comparison between LMT’s change in discount rate and its effect on funded status versus FDX’s funded status. However, the comparison is based on incorrect absolute values, undermining the conclusion that FDX’s deficit is 'substantially smaller'—while directionally correct (since $487M < $1.6B), the actual comparison should have been that FDX had a smaller underfunded amount than LMT’s liability increase, but the LLM reverses the logic by overstating FDX’s deficit. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses both companies, the correct year (2023), and the right pension metrics. However, due to major quantitative inaccuracies in reported funded status figures—especially the unsupported $6.2B for LMT and inflated $1.6B for FDX—the overall correctness score is limited to 4.

      "original_answer": "Nike explicitly includes inventory costs as a primary component of its cost of sales, alongside warehousing costs, third-party royalties, foreign currency hedge gains and losses, and product design costs. This indicates that inventory directly influences Nike's cost of sales and profitability. In contrast, Tesla does not explicitly mention inventory costs as a distinct component of its cost of sales. Instead, Tesla emphasizes design and engineering capabilities, modular manufacturing approaches, and integration of technologies to optimize cost characteristics. Tesla's focus is on reducing manufacturing complexity, such as through direct integration of batteries with vehicle body structures, to improve manufacturability, weight, range, and cost efficiency. Thus, Nike emphasizes inventory as a direct cost driver, while Tesla highlights design and manufacturing optimization as key contributors to cost efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "Nike says that “cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs,” and those inventory costs are the product cost it purchases from suppliers plus inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees; it even sometimes ships products directly from a supplier to the customer and records the cost on a specific‑identification basis. Tesla, by contrast, does not break out inventory costs in its cost‑of‑sales discussion – it frames cost of sales around manufacturing, depreciation and other production expenses and notes that its vertically‑integrated, in‑house manufacturing and direct‑to‑consumer sales model lets it control inventory internally rather than relying on external supplier‑borne costs. Thus Nike’s description reflects a wholesale‑distribution model with many third‑party suppliers and ship‑from‑supplier practices, while Tesla’s description reflects its integrated production and direct‑sale approach that absorbs inventory costs within its manufacturing operations.",

The contrast between Nike’s supplier-dependent model and Tesla’s vertically integrated, in-house manufacturing is correctly drawn. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answers requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a traditional sense, but all factual assertions (e.g., direct shipping from suppliers, in-house production) are consistent with known disclosures—thus scored as 10. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes differences in cost-of-sales composition and links them to distinct business models (Nike’s third-party reliance vs. Tesla’s integration). The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer highlights Tesla’s design and engineering optimizations (e.g., battery integration) more explicitly, which the LLM touches on indirectly via 'vertically integrated manufacturing' but could have emphasized more.

      "original_answer": "Both Cisco and Oracle increased their inventory balances in response to global supply chain constraints, which heightened their risks of excess and obsolete inventory. Cisco's product gross margin decreased by 2.1 percentage points, primarily due to increased costs from freight, expedite fees, and higher component and commodity costs. These cost pressures were partially offset by favorable pricing actions taken during fiscal 2022. Oracle also faced increased production costs due to supply chain shortages, which it could not always pass on to customers, further increasing its inventory-related risks. Both companies explicitly linked their increased inventory commitments to efforts to secure supply amid ongoing global disruptions.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of loans accruing interest that were contractually less than 90 days past due for both Bank of America and Charles Schwab at December 31, 2024, is $212 million. This is calculated by summing the $110 million in accruing interest loans from Bank of America and the $102 million in accruing interest loans from Charles Schwab.",
      "llm_answer": "The 10‑K disclosures show that, as of December 31 2024, the amount of loans that were still accruing interest (i.e., contracts < 90 days past‑due) was:\n\n* **Bank of America:** Current $9,555 million + 30‑59 days $4,114 million + 60‑89 days $1,462 million = **$15,031 million**【page_116】  \n* **Charles Schwab:** Current $45,150 million + 30‑59 days $45 million + 60‑89 days $6 million = **$45,201 million**【page_88】\n\n**Combined total:** $15,031 million + $45,201 million = **$60,232 million** (approximately **$60.2 billion**).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is completely incorrect in both numbers and reasoning. The ground truth states that the combined total is $212 million, with $110 million from Bank of America and $102 million from Charles Schwab. However, the LLM reports $15,031 million for Bank of America and $45,201 million for Charles Schwab, which sum to $60,232 million—over 280 times larger than the correct amount. These figures appear to be total loan categories (current + 30–59 days + 60–89 days), but they are not the specific 'loans accruing interest that were contractually less than 90 days past due' as defined in the ground truth. (2) The calculations are arithmetically correct (e.g., $9,555M + $4,114M + $1,462M = $15,031M), but the inputs are wrong—these are not the disclosed amounts from the knowledge graph. The correct values should be $110M and $102M, not billions. (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed: instead of retrieving the specific disclosed amounts of accruing interest loans <90 days past due, the model misinterpreted the data, likely pulling total consumer loan categories from different sections of 10-Ks, possibly confusing loan portfolios with interest-accruing subsets. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer cites page numbers and structures the response well, but the core data is entirely mismatched. The model did not align with the ground truth data source, suggesting a failure in information retrieval or synthesis. Thus, the correctness and quantitative accuracy are severely compromised, warranting a score of 1.",

      "original_answer": "The 2024 expected long-term rate of return on assets for FDX's U.S. pension plans is 6.50%, while the 2023 expected long-term rate of return on assets for LMT's qualified defined benefit pension plans is also 6.50%, resulting in no difference between the two. However, FDX's 2023 expected long-term rate of return on assets for international pension plans is significantly lower at 2.26%. Thus, while FDX and LMT maintain the same expected long-term rate of return on U.S./qualified pension assets, FDX's international pension plans have a much lower expected return compared to its domestic plans and to LMT's plans.",

It also correctly states FDX's 2023 international pension plan expected return as 2.26%. However, there is a critical error in the comparative statement: the LLM says the 0 percentage point difference is '2.26 percentage points lower than' FDX's international rate of 2.26%, which is mathematically and logically incorrect. Zero is not 2.26 percentage points lower than 2.26; rather, it is 2.26 percentage points higher. This reverses the intended comparison. (2) All individual numbers are accurate and correctly attributed to the right companies, plans, and years. Calculations of the difference (6.50% - 6.50% = 0) are correct, but the subsequent comparison to the international rate is flawed.

      "question": "How did the increase in fuel prices from 2020 to 2021 affect both Union Pacific Railroad's operating expenses and Boeing's commercial aircraft demand, considering their respective sensitivities to fuel price fluctuations?",
      "original_answer": "Union Pacific Railroad's fuel expenses increased by $668 million in 2021 due to a rise in locomotive diesel fuel prices from $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon, driven primarily by higher fuel prices excluding volume changes. Meanwhile, Boeing noted that fuel prices are a key factor influencing demand for commercial aircraft, as airlines are cost-sensitive and fuel is a major operating expense. Higher fuel prices could lead airlines to delay or cancel aircraft orders, reducing Boeing's revenues and cash flows. Therefore, the fuel price increase directly raised Union Pacific's operating costs and could indirectly reduce Boeing's commercial airplane sales and profitability through airline cost pressures.",
      "llm_answer": "The jump in diesel‑fuel cost – from about $1.50 /gal in 2020 to $2.23 /gal in 2021 – added roughly $668 million to Union Pacific’s fuel bill, lifting total operating expenses by $767 million year‑over‑year (fuel expense rose 56 % to $2.0 billion)【page_38】. In Boeing’s case, the filing notes that commercial‑aircraft demand is “further influenced … fuel prices,” meaning higher fuel costs erode airline profitability and tend to suppress orders for new jets【page_13】.

It also correctly notes that fuel expense rose 56% to $2.0 billion, which aligns with the magnitude of the increase and is consistent with the source. For Boeing, the answer correctly captures the qualitative impact: higher fuel prices reduce airline profitability and tend to suppress demand for new aircraft, which is consistent with the original answer’s claim that airlines may delay or cancel orders. (2) All numeric values—$668 million, $1.50 to $2.23 per gallon, 56% increase, $2.0 billion total fuel expense—are factually accurate and consistent with the knowledge graph. The additional detail of a $767 million year-over-year increase in total operating expenses is not in the ground truth but does not contradict it and may reflect broader context from the filing (e.g., fuel plus related costs); this is a minor addition but not an error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links rising fuel prices to higher operating costs for Union Pacific (direct impact) and to reduced aircraft demand for Boeing via airline cost sensitivity (indirect impact). This synthesis across two companies and mechanisms is accurate and well-executed. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the LLM slightly expands on the Union Pacific cost impact with a $767 million operating expense increase, which, while plausible, is not in the ground truth and introduces a figure not requested or verified.

Cisco's EMEA revenue growth rate is accurately reported as ≈6%, and Oracle's as ≈1%, both aligning with the original answer. The slight variation in wording ('about 26.6%' and 'about 28%') is acceptable and reflects the actual disclosures, where Oracle only reports geographic revenue for cloud-and-license, not total revenue. (2) All numeric values are correct within acceptable rounding and formatting variations. The sum of 26.6% and 28% is 54.6%, and the LLM's '54-55%' is semantically equivalent. Growth rates (6% and 1%) are precisely matched. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two companies, identifies the correct fiscal year (2022), and compares growth rates to assess relative performance. It appropriately notes Oracle's constant-currency growth (5%), which is additional context not in the ground truth but factually accurate and not misleading. (4) The conclusion that Cisco outperformed Oracle in EMEA is logically supported by the growth differential, and the LLM adds reasonable interpretation (market share gain vs. weaker performance) without overreaching. The only minor limitation is the slight ambiguity in Oracle's revenue base (cloud-and-license vs. total), but the model acknowledges this limitation transparently.

It incorrectly states that Disney's programming and production costs *fell* by $1.25 billion from 2023 to 2024, when in fact they *increased* by $610 million (from $12,373M to $12,983M). It also falsely claims Disney's 2024 total programming and production costs were $4.135 billion, which is less than half the actual $12,983 million (over $12.9 billion). These errors completely invalidate the quantitative analysis. (2) The CMCSA tax incentive reduction of $652 million is correctly stated. However, the LLM then compares this to a fabricated $1.248 billion decrease in Disney's costs, leading to a nonsensical 15.8% comparison. The correct comparison is that CMCSA's $652M reduction is 106.9% of Disney's $610M *increase* in costs. The LLM's calculation of 30% and 15.8% are based on incorrect inputs and do not address the actual question. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model must correctly extract CMCSA's cost reduction, compute Disney's year-over-year change in programming costs, and express the former as a percentage of the latter. The LLM fails at the second and third steps due to incorrect data. (4) While the question is addressed in structure and CMCSA's number is correct, the widespread factual inaccuracies in Disney's financials and the resulting miscalculations severely undermine the answer's validity.

      "original_answer": "Oracle reported $3,183 million in hardware revenue out of total revenues of $42,440 million in 2022, meaning hardware represented 7% of total revenue. In contrast, Cisco did not report hardware revenue separately but instead disclosed revenue by geographic segments, managing its business primarily on a geographic basis without breaking out hardware as a distinct category. This reflects a structural difference in how the two companies report their financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "In Oracle’s 2022 fiscal year, the hardware business generated $3.2 billion, which was about 7 percent of the company’s total revenue. By contrast, Cisco does not present a single “hardware” line‑item; its 10‑K breaks revenue out by product‑category segments such as Secure Agile Networks, Internet for the Future, Collaboration, End‑to‑End Security, Optimized Application Experiences, and Other Products, rather than reporting a distinct hardware percentage.",

      "qualitative_accuracy": 9,
      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly states that Oracle's hardware revenue was $3.2 billion (rounded from $3,183 million) and represented about 7% of total revenue in 2022, which aligns with the ground truth calculation ($3,183M / $42,440M ≈ 7.5%, rounded to 7%). The percentage is acceptably close and commonly reported as such in financial summaries. (2) All numeric values are accurate within acceptable rounding conventions: $3.2 billion is a standard approximation of $3,183 million, and 7% is a correct rounded figure. (3) The LLM accurately contrasts Oracle’s segment reporting with Cisco’s, noting that Cisco does not report a separate hardware line item. It correctly identifies that Cisco reports by product categories such as Secure Agile Networks, Internet for the Future, etc., which reflects the structural difference in reporting. However, the original answer emphasizes Cisco’s use of *geographic* segments as the primary basis for management reporting, while the LLM focuses on product categories. This is a minor omission—Cisco does report product-category revenue, but manages the business on a geographic basis, which is a nuance not fully captured. (4) Despite this slight gap in qualitative emphasis, the core multi-hop reasoning—comparing Oracle’s hardware percentage to Cisco’s lack of a distinct hardware segment—is sound and factually grounded. The answer is contextually relevant, complete for practical interpretation, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth with only minor abstraction differences. Thus, high scores across all dimensions, with a 9 on correctness due to near-perfect accuracy.",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) debt to interest rate changes contrast with the credit risk concerns highlighted by General Electric (GE) regarding short-term rates, and what does this imply about their respective exposures to macroeconomic volatility?",
      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) states that a 10% change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of its outstanding debt of $18.7 billion at December 31, 2023, indicating low sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. In contrast, General Electric (GE) explicitly lists changes in short-term interest rates as a risk factor that could materially affect its business operations, financial results, and liquidity. GE also notes that downgrades in its credit ratings could significantly impact its funding profile and costs. This contrast implies that GE is more exposed to macroeconomic volatility related to interest rates, particularly due to its credit profile and sensitivity to short-term rate movements, whereas LMT has a more stable debt structure that is less affected by such changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin says that a 10 % move in market interest rates would **materially affect the fair‑value of its outstanding debt**, indicating that its financing costs are highly sensitive to interest‑rate swings. General Electric, on the other hand, notes that a 10 % change in rates would **not have a material impact on the fair‑value of its debt**, but it flags **credit‑rating and funding‑cost risks if short‑term rates rise**, showing that its exposure is more about the ability to obtain cheap short‑term credit than about the market value of its debt. Consequently, Lockheed Martin is more directly vulnerable to macro‑economic interest‑rate volatility, whereas GE’s risk is tied to credit‑quality concerns that could be triggered by rising short‑term rates.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer reverses the key facts from the ground truth. It incorrectly states that Lockheed Martin (LMT) would be materially affected by a 10% change in interest rates, when the original answer clearly states that such a change would *not* have a material impact on LMT's debt fair value. Conversely, it falsely claims that General Electric (GE) says a 10% rate change would *not* have a material impact, when in fact GE highlights sensitivity to short-term rates and credit risk as material concerns. These inversions fundamentally undermine the answer's factual correctness. (2) While no specific dollar amounts or dates are misstated (e.g., LMT's $18.7B debt and year-end 2023 are not mentioned in the LLM answer, so no error there), the core quantitative claim — the direction of sensitivity to a 10% rate change — is reversed for both companies, leading to severe quantitative inaccuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed because the LLM misattributes risk profiles: it concludes LMT is more vulnerable to rate volatility, when the truth is that GE is more exposed due to its credit risk and short-term funding sensitivity. The synthesis between the two companies' disclosures is therefore incorrect. (4) Despite the factual errors, the answer is contextually relevant — it addresses the right companies, the right topic (interest rate sensitivity vs. credit risk), and attempts a comparative analysis. However, due to the reversal of key facts, the conclusion is diametrically opposed to the ground truth, warranting a very low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "Disney's Entertainment segment incurs programming and production costs that include amortization of capitalized production costs, licensed programming rights, subscriber-based fees for Hulu Live programming, live news production costs, participations and residuals, and intercompany fees for sports programming on ABC and Disney+. In contrast, the Sports segment's programming and production costs primarily involve amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs for live sports programming. These costs are central to both segments but reflect different content focuses—general entertainment versus live sports. Meanwhile, Comcast's 2024 10-K shows that it also reports a dedicated 'Programming and Production Costs' line item in its financial disclosures (Note 4), indicating that both companies treat these costs as a significant, segmented component of their operations. However, while Disney breaks down its costs by intercompany licensing and streaming platform fees, Comcast does not provide the same level of granular detail in the provided excerpt, suggesting a potentially different approach to internal cost allocation or reporting transparency.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney separates programming‑ and production‑related expenses between its two content segments. The Entertainment segment records the bulk of its costs as “programming and production costs” (including amortization of capitalized production costs, fees for licensed programming, live‑news production and, notably, fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and sports content on Disney+), while the Sports segment’s programming and production costs are limited to amortization of licensed sports rights and the production of live‑sports and other sports‑related programming. In contrast, Comcast’s 10‑K does not break out programming and production costs by segment; such costs are pooled within its broader content‑operations expenses and are not shown as inter‑segment allocations.",

Comcast’s 10-K (2024) shows a 'Programming and Production Costs' line item (Note 4), but it does not break these down by segment or show inter-segment allocations, which matches the LLM's claim that such costs are pooled in broader content operations. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or calculations in the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a numerical sense—scored as 10 by default due to absence of errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across Disney’s segments and contrasts them with Comcast’s reporting structure, drawing a valid inference about transparency and cost allocation differences. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that Comcast *does* report a dedicated 'Programming and Production Costs' line item (though it implies pooling), slightly reducing qualitative completeness.

While GM provides a detailed breakdown of its ROIC-adjusted methodology, HD refers to a separate 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' section for full definition and reconciliation.",
      "llm_answer": "GM calls its metric **“ROIC‑adjusted.”** It is calculated as **EBIT‑adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by “ROIC‑adjusted average net assets,”** where the asset base is the average equity balance **plus average automotive debt and interest liabilities** but **excludes finance‑lease liabilities, automotive net pension/OPEB liabilities and automotive net income‑tax assets**. The EBIT‑adjusted figure also strips out automotive interest income and expense, income‑tax expense and a list of one‑time items (recall costs, restructuring charges, tax recoveries, etc.).\n\nHome Depot reports a **non‑GAAP ROIC** (44.7 % in FY 2021) but the filing excerpt does not spell out a detailed definition; it simply states the figure and refers to a “Non‑GAAP Financial Measures” section. Thus, unlike GM, HD’s disclosed methodology does not specify the adjustments to NOPAT or the components excluded from the invested‑capital denominator.",

This is a minor omission but does not constitute a factual error since the LLM does not deny the 40.8% figure—just doesn't repeat it. All other components are non-numeric. (2) The definition of GM’s ROIC-adjusted is accurately described: EBIT-adjusted over trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets. The LLM correctly identifies that the asset base includes average equity plus average automotive debt and interest liabilities, and excludes finance lease liabilities, automotive net pension/OPEB liabilities, and automotive net income-tax assets—matching the original answer.

(2) Quantitatively, all numbers and the subtraction are correct; the format variation in expressing the difference as 'lower' instead of 'higher' does not affect factual accuracy but slightly alters framing. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model retrieves data from two different companies (Boeing and Union Pacific) for the same year (2022) and correctly computes the comparative difference. It even clarifies the direction of the difference ('lower', not 'higher'), which shows correct interpretation. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, though it emphasizes that Boeing's price is lower rather than stating how much higher Union Pacific's is—this is a minor framing difference but does not reduce accuracy. The core facts, numbers, and logic are fully aligned with the ground truth, warranting a high correctness score of 9 (not 10 because the question asks 'how much higher' at Boeing, and the answer correctly notes it is actually lower, but could have directly answered the comparative magnitude as positive $44.18 higher at Union Pacific to match the question’s structure).",

(1) Quantitative Accuracy: The combined cost of revenue is correctly calculated as $68.2 billion (Adobe: $2.354B + Microsoft: $65.863B = $68.217B), which rounds appropriately to $68.2 billion. Adobe's services and other cost of revenue is $503 million out of $2,354 million, yielding ~21.4%, reported as 'about 21%'—a reasonable approximation. Microsoft's service and other cost of revenue is $48,059 million out of $65,863 million, which equals ~73.2%, reported as 'roughly 73%'—also acceptable. Minor rounding is permissible under semantic equivalence. (2) Completeness: The answer addresses both parts of the question—combined total cost of revenue and the comparative proportion of service and other cost of revenue for both companies in 2023. (3) Entity Accuracy: Correct companies (Adobe/ADBE, Microsoft/MSFT), correct year (2023), and correct financial metric (cost of revenue, including breakdowns). (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop synthesis across two companies and their respective filings is sound. Calculations are shown and logically derived. The qualitative comparison at the end adds context without overreaching. (5) Semantic Equivalence: All core facts align with the ground truth; only minor rounding in percentages and formatting differences in units (billion vs million) are present, which are acceptable.

These pressures are expected to significantly impact BMY's business and results of operations. In contrast, Merck discloses that it uses non-GAAP EPS to enhance investor understanding of its performance, internally for planning and forecasting, and as a component in employee compensation. Merck excludes items like acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs, and investment income/losses to better assess underlying business trends.

In contrast, Tesla concluded that it is more likely than not that its U.S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets are realizable based on recent taxable income and expected future taxable earnings, leading to the release of $6.54 billion in valuation allowance. This shows that Tesla has a more favorable outlook on future taxable earnings, directly impacting its tax expense and asset valuation differently than Nike’s approach.",

This contradicts the original answer and misrepresents Emerson's short-term borrowing position. Additionally, the LLM introduces data not present in the ground truth—such as Emerson’s $3.5 billion unused credit facility and Honeywell’s $13.8 billion in proceeds from issuance—making the response appear more detailed but factually divergent. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: while Honeywell’s $4,273 million ($4.3 billion) is correctly reported, Emerson’s $0 is misrepresented as $532 million total short-term borrowings. The use of current maturities of long-term debt as a proxy for short-term borrowings is misleading in this context, as the original answer distinguishes commercial paper and short-term borrowings specifically. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in drawing a contrast between aggressive and conservative liquidity strategies, but the multi-hop synthesis is flawed because it relies on incorrect data for Emerson. The conclusion about Emerson’s conservative approach is directionally consistent, but it is based on incorrect inputs.

However, the LLM claims BAC's increase was only $346 million and JPM's was $11.032 billion, concluding that JPM's increase exceeded BAC's by $10.7 billion — the opposite of the truth. (2) The dollar amounts are severely inaccurate: BAC’s actual 2022 and 2023 figures (from knowledge graph) imply an increase of $965 million, but LLM reports $346 million; for JPM, the increase is reported as $11.032 billion instead of the correct $614 million. These are not minor discrepancies but massive errors in scale (e.g., reporting $11 billion vs $0.6 billion). (3) The multi-hop reasoning failed completely: the model did not correctly retrieve or synthesize the correct noninterest expense figures for either bank, leading to flawed comparisons. It incorrectly identified the direction of the difference (JPM > BAC vs. BAC > JPM).

      "original_answer": "AbbVie reported 185 million shares authorized for issuance under its equity compensation plans, while UnitedHealth Group disclosed 120 million shares authorized under its plans. This comparison reveals that AbbVie has a larger pool of authorized shares for equity compensation, which may suggest differing approaches to employee incentives and long-term retention strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "- **AbbVie:** Its equity‑compensation plans had 18,219,985 shares already issuable on exercise and 62,004,889 shares still available, for a total of **≈80.2 million shares** authorized for issuance as of December 31 2023【page_106】.  \n\n- **UnitedHealth Group:** Its 2020 Stock Incentive Plan (and ESPP) had 21 million shares issuable on exercise and 70 million shares remaining available, for a total of **≈91 million shares** authorized for issuance as of December 31 2023【page_72】.  \n\nThus, UnitedHealth Group’s plans authorize roughly 10 million more shares than AbbVie’s.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the total shares authorized for both companies. According to the ground truth, AbbVie reported 185 million shares authorized, while the LLM incorrectly calculates ≈80.2 million by summing only issuable and available shares (18,219,985 + 62,004,889 = 80,224,874), which does not represent total authorized shares. Similarly, UnitedHealth Group’s correct authorized total is 120 million, but the LLM reports ≈91 million (21M + 70M), again misrepresenting the total. These totals are not equivalent to authorized shares unless explicitly stated, and the LLM fails to recognize that 'authorized' includes previously issued, currently available, and reserved shares across all plans. (2) Calculations are mathematically correct (80.2M and 91M totals), but they are based on a misinterpretation of the data—adding 'issuable on exercise' and 'available' does not yield total authorized shares unless confirmed by the filing. The ground truth indicates higher totals (185M vs 120M), so the LLM reverses the comparison, incorrectly stating UnitedHealth has more authorized shares. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—comparing equity compensation strategies across two firms—but fails at the critical step of correctly identifying the metric 'total shares authorized.' The model uses proxy figures without confirming they constitute the full authorized pool, leading to incorrect synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the response addresses the question structure and cites appropriate pages. However, due to major quantitative and qualitative errors in core facts and interpretation, the correctness score is low. Minor formatting variations are acceptable, but here the numbers are factually wrong and lead to an incorrect conclusion.",

However, it incorrectly states that The Coca-Cola Company did not report any vested and released shares in 2023, directly contradicting the ground truth that 865,000 shares were vested and released by Coca-Cola. This omission leads to an incorrect total of 8,020,708 shares instead of the correct 8,885,708. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct—Colgate’s number is accurate, but Coca-Cola’s 865,000 shares are entirely missing, and the sum is therefore wrong. The calculation of the total is not performed correctly due to missing data.

      "question": "How does the treatment and impact of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment differ between LMT and RTX in their 2021 financial reporting, and what specific amounts illustrate these differences?",
      "original_answer": "In 2021, LMT reported a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million as part of its unallocated items, directly contributing to its consolidated operating profit of $9,123 million. This adjustment was a significant component of LMT's unallocated net total of $1,744 million. In contrast, RTX's FAS/CAS operating adjustment was embedded in its pension and PRB expense treatment, where the adjustment reconciled CAS expense (used for U.S. government contract pricing) with FAS service cost under GAAP. RTX noted that the FAS/CAS adjustment resulted in consolidated pension expense equal to the FAS service cost, though no specific dollar amount was provided for 2021. The difference lies in LMT explicitly quantifying the adjustment as a standalone unallocated item, while RTX integrated it within broader pension cost reporting without isolating its dollar impact.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Lockheed Martin (LMT)** reports the FAS/CAS operating adjustment as a “unallocated” item that adds to consolidated operating profit. In 2021 the adjustment was **$1,960 million**, up only modestly from $1,876 million in 2020 (an increase of about $84 million)【page_46】.  \n\n- **Raytheon Technologies (RTX)** treats the adjustment as the net difference between its FAS service‑cost expense and CAS pension cost, shown in the pension‑expense schedule. In 2021 the adjustment was **$1,796 million**, a jump of $690 million from $1,106 million in 2020, driven mainly by a $741 million rise in CAS expense after the Raytheon merger【page_51】.  \n\nThus, LMT’s adjustment is smaller and changed only slightly, while RTX’s adjustment is larger and increased sharply in 2021.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LMT portion of the answer is correct—Lockheed Martin did report a FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $1,960 million as a standalone unallocated item in 2021, consistent with the ground truth. However, the RTX portion is factually incorrect: the ground truth explicitly states that RTX did *not* disclose a specific dollar amount for its 2021 FAS/CAS adjustment. The LLM answer incorrectly asserts that RTX’s adjustment was $1,796 million, which directly contradicts the original answer. This number appears to be fabricated or misattributed, possibly from a different year or document. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: while LMT’s $1,960 million is correct, RTX’s $1,796 million is not supported by the ground truth, which states 'no specific dollar amount was provided for 2021.' The comparison of year-over-year changes ($84M increase for LMT, $690M for RTX) and the claim about merger-driven CAS expense increases are unsupported and introduce false precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing how two companies treat FAS/CAS adjustments—but fails in execution because it invents data for RTX. The model incorrectly assumes RTX quantified the adjustment similarly to LMT, when in fact RTX embedded it without isolation. This reflects a failure in synthesizing the key qualitative difference: explicit vs. implicit reporting. (4) Contextual relevance is fair—the answer addresses the right companies, topic, and reporting practices—but the inclusion of false quantitative data undermines the entire response. The conclusion that RTX’s adjustment 'increased sharply' is unsupported. Correctness score is low due to major factual error in RTX amount; qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct framing of LMT and general structure; quantitative accuracy is very low due to incorrect dollar figures and spurious calculations.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of Netflix's and Verizon's contractual content-related obligations beyond the next 12 months, and how does this compare to their respective total obligations due in the same period?",
      "original_answer": "Netflix's content-related obligations beyond the next 12 months total $11.824 billion, while Verizon's content-related unconditional purchase obligations due beyond the next 12 months total $10.5 billion (from its $16.7 billion total, with $6.2 billion due in the next 12 months). Combined, their content-related obligations beyond the next 12 months total $22.324 billion. In comparison, Netflix's total obligations beyond the next 12 months amount to $31.425 billion, and Verizon's total obligations beyond the next 12 months (calculated as total obligations minus those due in the next 12 months) amount to $44.5 billion (from operating leases, finance leases, leaseback arrangements, and unconditional purchase obligations).",
      "llm_answer": "- **Combined content‑related obligations beyond the next 12 months**  \n  * Netflix: $11.8 billion (content obligations > 12 months)  \n  * Verizon: ≈ $10.5 billion (the portion of its $16.7 billion “unconditional purchase obligations” that falls beyond 12 months, which is primarily for content, equipment and services)  \n\n  **Total combined** ≈ **$22.3 billion**.\n\n- **How this compares with each company’s total obligations due in the next 12 months**  \n  * Netflix’s total obligations (all categories) due in the next 12 months are $14.4 billion.  \n  * Verizon’s total obligations due in the next 12 months amount to roughly $35.0 billion (long‑term debt $21.7 bn + operating lease $5.0 bn + finance lease $0.95 bn + cell‑tower leaseback $0.45 bn + unconditional purchases $6.2 bn + other long‑term liabilities $0.73 bn).  \n\nThus, the two companies together have about $22.3 billion of content‑related commitments beyond the next year, which is larger than Netflix’s total 12‑month obligations ($14.4 bn) but considerably smaller than Verizon’s 12‑month total obligations ($35 bn).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains several correct elements but also significant inaccuracies. It correctly identifies Netflix's content-related obligations beyond 12 months as $11.8 billion (close to the ground truth $11.824B) and Verizon's content-related portion of unconditional purchase obligations beyond 12 months as $10.5B, which matches the ground truth. The combined total is approximately correct at $22.3B vs. $22.324B. However, the LLM misinterprets the comparison requested: the question asks how the combined content-related obligations beyond 12 months compare to each company’s total obligations *beyond* the next 12 months, not *due in* the next 12 months. Instead, the LLM compares the $22.3B to Netflix’s and Verizon’s obligations *due in the next 12 months* ($14.4B and $35.0B), which is a fundamental error in reasoning and misalignment with the original question. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: Netflix’s total obligations beyond 12 months are $31.425B (not provided), and Verizon’s are $44.5B beyond 12 months (also not provided). The LLM provides obligations *due in* the next 12 months instead, which are not the same. While the $6.2B for Verizon’s unconditional purchases due in 12 months is consistent with ground truth, the sum of $35.0B in near-term obligations includes categories like long-term debt and leases, but this was not requested. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model correctly extracts content obligations beyond 12 months for both companies and sums them, but fails the second hop—comparing to total obligations *beyond* 12 months—by flipping the time horizon. This undermines the core logic. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer discusses the right companies, obligations, and timeframes, just with a critical directional error in the comparison. Wording and structure are clear and organized. Final scores reflect partial correctness on numbers but major error in interpretation of the comparison period.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the $523 million transfer of surplus international pension plan assets by KO in 2024, matching the ground truth in both amount and context. The mention of PMI’s (Philip Morris International) accounting policy aligns with the required multi-hop reasoning, as the question asks how PM would account for gains or losses. The answer correctly states that gains or losses would be recorded in 'other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred taxes,' which matches the ground truth. (2) The quantitative accuracy is perfect: $523 million is correctly reported, and no calculations are required beyond accurate reporting. Format variations (e.g., 'million' vs 'M') are acceptable and do not affect correctness. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper synthesis across entities: KO's asset transfer is correctly attributed, and PM's accounting policy is appropriately applied to the scenario. The addition of the 'corridor approach' is consistent with PM's actual accounting policy for actuarial gains and losses and adds contextual detail not in the ground truth but does not contradict it—this is a minor enhancement rather than an error. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant and addresses both sub-questions: the amount transferred by KO and how PM would account for gains/losses. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the original answer does not mention the 'corridor approach,' so while the added detail is accurate, it slightly extends beyond the scope of the provided ground truth without being incorrect.

COF's interest expense on interest-bearing deposits increased by $6,583 million between 2022 and 2023.

However, the calculation of COF's interest expense increase is incorrect. The LLM states that COF's interest expense rose from $1.579 billion in 2022 to $6.954 billion in 2023, implying an increase of $5.375 billion (~$5.4 billion). But according to the ground truth, the actual increase was $6,583 million ($6.583 billion), which suggests the LLM used incorrect base figures. This results in a significant quantitative error in the second part of the answer. (2) The numbers for MS are accurate with acceptable formatting variation ($81.9 billion = $81,909 million). However, COF's 2022 and 2023 interest expense values do not align with the knowledge graph, and the resulting difference ($5.4B vs $6.583B) is materially off. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model attempts to compare MS's deposits with COF's change in interest expense — but because it uses incorrect source data for COF, the synthesis fails. The entity mapping is mostly correct (MS = Morgan Stanley, COF = Capital One), but the financial metric extraction for COF is flawed.

In contrast, VZ recognizes rent expense for short-term operating leases on a straight-line basis as well, but classifies the expense in either Cost of services or Selling, general and administrative expense based on the use of the facility or equipment. This means that while both companies follow a similar straight-line recognition method, the presentation on the income statement differs depending on the nature and use of the leased asset, which could impact how analysts assess their operating performance and cost structures.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix reports short‑term operating‑lease costs as a separate line in its lease‑cost table (“Short‑term lease cost”) and, because leases of ≤ 12 months are off‑balance‑sheet, it expenses them on a straight‑line basis over the lease term. Verizon, by contrast, does not break out a short‑term‑lease line; it simply states that rent expense for all operating leases—including those ≤ 12 months—is recognized on a straight‑line basis and included in Cost of Services or SG&A. Thus, Netflix’s income‑statement presentation makes the short‑term lease expense visible as its own amount, whereas Verizon’s presentation folds that expense into broader operating‑expense categories.",

It also accurately notes that VZ recognizes rent expense for short-term leases on a straight-line basis and allocates it to Cost of Services or SG&A based on use. (2) There are no numeric values in the question or answer requiring calculation, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable beyond correct representation of timeframes (e.g., '≤12 months'), which are accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes differences in income statement presentation between NFLX and VZ, identifying that NFLX separates short-term lease cost while VZ embeds it in broader expense categories. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention that both companies use straight-line recognition *despite* the different presentations, which slightly weakens the comparative insight. However, it does imply this by stating both use straight-line.

(4) Reasoning: The multi-hop synthesis is flawed—the LLM incorrectly infers that Oracle’s adjustment is a benefit and that NVIDIA has no adjustment, leading to a completely reversed interpretation.

However, the LLM states this combined amount is 'larger than Netflix’s entire asset base'—this is incorrect. Netflix’s total assets are $53,630.4 million, and $75.5 billion exceeds that, but the ground truth does not make this comparison; instead, it provides the percentage of total assets each company’s current liabilities represent (14.1% for Netflix, 16.8% for Verizon).

(2) All individual numbers are accurate and correctly formatted (e.g., $10.8 billion = $10,755.4 million). The sum is correct. However, the qualitative interpretation misrepresents the relationship: saying the combined liabilities are larger than Netflix’s assets is factually true but misleading in context, as the question asks how the combined liabilities compare to *each* company’s total assets—not as a single sum versus individual assets. The correct interpretation per ground truth is the proportional burden (14.1% and 16.8%), which the LLM omits.

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Boeing's total net actuarial loss in 2021 was $19,031 million ($19.031 billion), not $17.9 billion as stated. Union Pacific's loss was $813 million ($0.813 billion), which the LLM approximates reasonably well as $0.8 billion. The calculated difference in the LLM answer is ≈$17.1 billion, but the correct disparity is $19,031M - $813M = $18,218 million ($18.218 billion), making the LLM's calculation off by over $1.1 billion. 2) The quantitative inaccuracies undermine the correctness of the core comparison. While the answer correctly identifies that actuarial losses flow into Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL), it omits key details from the ground truth: Boeing recognized $17,725 million in AOCL for 2021, and Union Pacific’s total (including amortization) was $954 million. These specific figures are missing, reducing completeness. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model correctly links actuarial losses to AOCL and compares two companies’ losses—but fails to accurately synthesize the exact figures from the knowledge graph. The mechanism of impact (direct contribution to AOCL) is correctly described, showing understanding of financial reporting concepts. 4) Despite wording flexibility being allowed, the magnitude of the numerical errors—especially the $1.1+ billion miscalculation in the difference—warrants a moderate correctness score. The answer is not completely wrong, as it captures the direction and general scale of the disparity and the correct financial mechanism, but the factual precision is insufficient for a high score.",

It accurately references the Beauty segment and the enhanced transparency this will provide. The use of Target's 2024 net sales in Beauty ($13.2 billion) aligns with the ground truth value of $13,173 million (rounded appropriately to $13.2 billion), demonstrating correct quantitative handling. (2) All numbers and dates are accurate: fiscal years 2025 and 2026 are correctly cited; the $13.2 billion figure is a valid rounding of $13,173 million. No calculations were required, but the comparison in significance is logically supported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—linking P&G’s upcoming disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 to the market importance of the Beauty category as shown by Target’s sales data. The synthesis across companies (P&G and Target) and standards (FASB ASU) is appropriate and adds contextual relevance. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM omits specific mention of the subcategories within P&G’s Beauty segment (Hair Care and Skin and Personal Care) and does not explicitly state that the new disclosures will allow stakeholders to assess P&G’s performance relative to the broader market—a nuance present in the original answer.

The difference of $533 million ($7,434M - $6,901M) is correctly implied.

While it correctly identifies Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) and the focus on 2023 broadband revenue, the numbers are incorrect. Ground truth states CMCSA's domestic broadband revenue as $25,489 million ($25.489B), which the LLM approximates reasonably as $25.5B (acceptable rounding). However, T's broadband revenue is reported as $9,669 million ($9.669B) in ground truth, but LLM states $10.5B — a material overstatement of ~$831 million. This leads to an incorrect combined total: LLM reports $35.9B vs. correct $35,158 million ($35.158B), and an incorrect difference: LLM reports $15.0B vs. correct $15,820 million ($15.82B). (2) Calculations are flawed. The LLM incorrectly computes the percentage contribution of broadband revenue to total revenue. Ground truth: CMCSA broadband is $25,489M / $121,572M = ~21%, T is $9,669M / $120,741M = ~8%. LLM incorrectly states both are ~12-13%, using wrong broadband figures and incorrect total revenues (e.g., AT&T total revenue as $122.4B vs. true $120.741B). These errors invalidate the comparative analysis. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially present — the model attempts to combine revenue, compute differences, and compare to total revenue — but due to incorrect base data and flawed calculations, the synthesis fails. (4) Contextual relevance is high: the structure addresses all parts of the question (combined revenue, difference, sector contribution), and entities (CMCSA, T, broadband, total revenue) are correctly identified. However, quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine correctness. Minor formatting variations (billion vs. million) are acceptable, but magnitude and calculation errors are not.

In contrast, Union Pacific capitalizes material costs as part of its property investments, with $2.9 billion in capital investments during 2021, where material costs are evaluated based on whether they meet criteria for extending asset life or improving efficiency. These differing treatments reflect distinct financial impacts: Boeing faces potential future losses tied to cost overruns, while Union Pacific increases long-term asset value through selective capitalization of material costs.",

      "original_answer": "Boeing recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $891 million on the 777X program in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to higher costs from the new IAM 751 labor agreement. Lockheed Martin recognized $1.31 billion in additional reach-forward losses in the fourth quarter for a classified contract in its MFC business segment, driven by the increased likelihood that all fixed-price options under the contract would be exercised. Together, these fourth-quarter reach-forward losses totaled $2.201 billion, with labor agreements and contractual cost structures directly influencing the financial outcomes for both companies.",

Boeing’s loss was driven mainly by higher labor costs and production disruptions tied to the new IAM 751 union agreement and related labor instability. Lockheed Martin’s loss stems from contractual factors – the likelihood that all options in its MFC program will be exercised – and the resulting higher engineering‑integration labor and cost overruns associated with those expanded contract scopes.",

All numeric values match the original answer, including correct company tickers (Boeing/BA, LMT), time period (Q4 2024), and financial figures. (2) Calculations are accurate: $891 million + $1.31 billion = $2.201 billion, and the LLM's 'roughly $2.20 billion' is a reasonable rounding. No calculation errors. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes information across both companies and attributes Boeing’s loss to labor factors (new IAM 751 agreement) and Lockheed Martin’s to contractual factors (exercise of fixed-price options in MFC segment). The LLM adds slightly more detail (e.g., 'engineering-integration labor and cost overruns') that is plausible but not explicitly in the ground truth; however, this does not contradict it and aligns with the contractual scope expansion. (4) The only minor deviation is that the original answer explicitly names the 777X program and specifies the classified nature of Lockheed’s contract, which the LLM omits. While not critical to the core question, these details enhance precision. Despite this, the LLM captures the essential causal factors and quantitative outcomes accurately.

      "original_answer": "CMCSA's video revenue decreased in both 2022 and 2023, primarily due to declines in the overall number of residential video customers. This downward trend reflects ongoing challenges in the traditional video services market. In contrast, AT&T reported $2,257 million in video revenue in 2021 but no longer reports a separate video segment by 2023, indicating a strategic shift away from this business line. While CMCSA continues to experience revenue declines in video services, AT&T's discontinuation of video segment reporting suggests a more definitive exit from or integration of its video offerings into other business units.",

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly states CMCSA's video revenue decline from $30.5 billion in 2022 to $28.8 billion in 2023, a $1.7 billion (5.6%) drop, which is consistent with known data. While the original answer does not include these exact dollar figures, the knowledge graph confirms their accuracy. The LLM rounds AT&T's $2,257 million to $2.3 billion, which is acceptable (within rounding norms). (2) The calculation of the percentage decline (~5.6%) is correct: (30.5 - 28.8) / 30.5 ≈ 5.57%. (3) Entity accuracy is strong: CMCSA and AT&T are correctly identified, with accurate years (2021 for AT&T’s last report, 2022–2023 for CMCSA). The key point that AT&T discontinued video segment reporting post-2021 is accurately conveyed. (4) Reasoning is sound: the LLM contrasts CMCSA’s ongoing but declining video revenue reporting with AT&T’s strategic exit via discontinuation of segment disclosure, effectively synthesizing multi-hop information across companies and time periods. (5) The LLM adds precise quantitative detail not in the original answer (specific revenue numbers for CMCSA), enhancing completeness without introducing error. The only minor shortcoming is not explicitly stating the reason for CMCSA’s decline (e.g., customer losses), which is mentioned in the ground truth, but this does not detract significantly from the overall correctness.

      "original_answer": "An investor would assess that Amazon's explicitly disclosed exposure to foreign exchange risk—resulting in a $2.3 billion fair value decline under a 10% adverse movement—provides a concrete estimate of FX sensitivity for foreign-denominated assets. Tesla, while not quantifying its FX exposure directly, holds available-for-sale marketable securities that are also subject to fair value adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. If Tesla's marketable securities included significant foreign-denominated holdings similar to Amazon’s foreign funds, an investor would infer that Tesla could also face material fair value declines under a similar FX shock. This would negatively impact Tesla’s equity valuation through accumulated other comprehensive income, just as Amazon experiences, thereby creating parallel valuation risks for both companies under sustained foreign exchange volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon says that a 10 % adverse foreign‑exchange move would cut the fair value of its $22.7 billion of foreign‑denominated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by **$2.3 billion**, a loss that is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)” – a component of stockholders’ equity【page_32】.  \nTesla’s marketable securities are all classified as **available‑for‑sale**, so any unrealised gain or loss – such as one that would arise from a similar foreign‑currency decline – is also posted to accumulated other comprehensive income rather than to net income【page_64】.  \n\nTherefore, an investor would view the combined exposure as a potential **$4.6 billion reduction in equity** (‑$2.3 billion for each company) that would lower book‑value per share but would not directly hit earnings; the impact would be reflected in the OCI line of the equity section for both firms.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer contains a significant quantitative error: it assumes Tesla would face an identical $2.3 billion fair value decline under a 10% FX shock, leading to a combined $4.6 billion equity reduction. However, the original answer (ground truth) does not state or imply that Tesla has the same magnitude of exposure as Amazon. Tesla’s available-for-sale securities are subject to FX-related fair value changes through OCI, but no dollar amount is provided or can be inferred for Tesla’s exposure. Therefore, the $4.6 billion figure and the assumption of equal impact are unsupported and incorrect. 2) While Amazon’s $2.3 billion decline is correctly cited (matching the ground truth), Tesla’s exposure is not quantified in the filings, so doubling Amazon’s number is a flawed calculation. The LLM invents a parallel exposure level without evidence. 3) The reasoning about accounting treatment is sound: both companies record unrealized FX impacts on available-for-sale securities in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), which affects equity but not net income. This reflects accurate multi-hop synthesis across Amazon and Tesla’s financial disclosures. 4) The answer is contextually relevant and addresses the core question about combined FX impact on equity valuations, correctly identifying the OCI mechanism.

The ground truth weighted average is 2.06%, but the LLM reports approximately 3.3%, which is a significant deviation. The LLM incorrectly states that P&G's Beauty segment grew by 1% and Target's by 5.1%, which are not supported by the ground truth data. Additionally, the total net sales figures used—$80B for P&G and $106.6B for Target—are inaccurate or misaligned with the actual reported figures in the knowledge graph. (2) The calculation itself, while conceptually following a weighted average approach, is based on wrong inputs. Using the LLM's numbers: (80 * 1% + 106.6 * 5.1%) / (80 + 106.6) ≈ (0.8 + 5.4366) / 186.6 ≈ 6.2366 / 186.6 ≈ 3.34%, which matches their reported 3.3%, but since the inputs are incorrect, the output is invalid. The correct inputs per the knowledge graph must yield 2.06% when properly weighted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—combining segment growth rates using total net sales as weights—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval or synthesis. The model does recognize that a weighted average based on total net sales is required, showing understanding of the methodological step. (4) Scores are low on correctness and quantitative accuracy due to fundamental errors in financial data and the final percentage. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the reasoning framework is appropriate.

      "original_answer": "In 2024, Boeing recognized a total of $3,099 million in reach-forward losses for the MQ-25 and T-7A Red Hawk programs, primarily due to production cost overruns and higher-than-anticipated supplier costs. Specifically, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the MQ-25 program by $339 million in the first quarter, $217 million in the third quarter, and $122 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Boeing increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770 million in 2024, driven by higher estimated supplier costs, supplier negotiations, and increased costs to complete flight testing. Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin recognized $1.41 billion in reach-forward losses in 2024 for a classified contract under its MFC business segment, following the recognition of an additional $1.31 billion in losses in the fourth quarter due to the increased likelihood of all fixed-price options being exercised.

The LLM includes programs not mentioned in the ground truth—VC-25B ($379M) and KC-46A ($2,002M)—which are not part of the original answer and inflate Boeing's total. The correct Boeing reach-forward losses are $678M (MQ-25: $339M + $217M + $122M) + $1,770M (T-7A) = $2,448M, but the ground truth states $3,099M, suggesting additional unmentioned adjustments; however, the LLM’s inclusion of unrelated programs is unsupported. Lockheed Martin’s loss is reported as $825M, but the ground truth states $1.41B (with $1.31B added in Q4), making the LLM’s figure substantially incorrect. The combined total is $5.65B in the LLM vs. $4.509B in the original—over $1.1B too high. (2) Calculations: While the LLM correctly sums the quarterly MQ-25 increases ($339M + $217M + $122M = $678M), it adds unsupported programs. The KC-46A sum ($128M + $391M + $661M + $822M = $2,002M) is accurate arithmetically but irrelevant as KC-46A is not cited in the ground truth for 2024 reach-forward losses. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize program-level data and attribute causes, but fails by introducing non-existent programs and misreporting totals. It correctly identifies supplier costs and production issues as drivers for Boeing and cost overruns for Lockheed, aligning qualitatively with the original. (4) Entity and context accuracy: The companies (Boeing, LMT) and some programs (MQ-25, T-7A) are correct, but the inclusion of VC-25B and KC-46A is erroneous.

This significant difference suggests that CMCSA's Connectivity & Platforms segment operates under a much higher price point, potentially due to the nature of its bundled services (e.g., internet, TV, and phone), whereas Netflix's streaming service has a lower, subscription-based pricing model.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast’s Connectivity & Platforms segment earned about **$129.43 per customer each month in 2023**, whereas Netflix’s average monthly revenue per paying member was roughly **$11.64 in 2023**. The gap of roughly **$118 per month** indicates that Comcast’s model—selling bundled broadband, wireless and other platform services—commands a far higher per‑customer price than Netflix’s pure‑subscription streaming model, which relies on a low‑price, high‑volume pricing strategy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key numerical values. The ground truth states Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership in 2023 was $16.28, but the LLM incorrectly reports it as $11.64, a substantial deviation. This leads to an incorrect difference calculation: the LLM computes a gap of ~$118, whereas the correct difference is $129.43 - $16.28 = $113.15. The CMCSA figure ($129.43) is accurate. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low due to the wrong Netflix revenue figure and resulting miscalculation of the difference. Even though the format allows variation, the numbers themselves are factually incorrect. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound—the LLM correctly identifies that CMCSA’s bundled services (Connectivity & Platforms) justify a higher price point compared to Netflix’s low-cost subscription model. This reflects valid multi-hop reasoning about business models. However, the flawed numbers undermine the conclusion's precision. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and addresses both parts of the question: the numerical difference and the implication about pricing models. The explanation of pricing strategies is reasonable and aligns with industry understanding, despite being based on incorrect data. Thus, while reasoning and structure are strong, the factual foundation is flawed, leading to a low correctness score primarily due to quantitative inaccuracy.",

This discrepancy affects the final calculation. (2) The calculation itself is mathematically correct: $8,278M - $1,492M = $6,786M, but because the input value for Tesla is wrong, the result deviates from the correct difference of $6,810M. The correct difference should be $8,278M - $1,468M = $6,810M.

MA defines GDV as the sum of purchase volume and cash volume (e.g., cash disbursements, balance transfers, and convenience checks). Since COF’s increase is specifically in 'purchase volume,' it maps directly to the portion of GDV that excludes cash volume, meaning the rise in COF's purchase volume contributes proportionally to the growth in MA's GDV, particularly on a local currency and U.S. dollar-converted basis.",

(2) Quantitatively, the LLM provides specific figures: $605.7 billion in purchase volume for 2023 and a 6% year-over-year increase. While these numbers are not in the original answer, they are consistent with plausible data from Capital One’s 10-K and do not contradict the ground truth; the original answer does not specify exact numbers, so their inclusion enhances detail without introducing error.

Additionally, the LLM computes the combined average as $71.14, which is the simple arithmetic mean of $130.57 and $11.70, but this contradicts the ground truth method that results in $147.77—suggesting the true calculation may be a weighted average or based on aggregate totals, not a simple average. The LLM fails to reflect that methodology. (2) Number verification: CMCSA’s $130.57 is correct, but Netflix’s value is wrong ($11.70 vs. $17.20), and the combined average is severely off ($71.14 vs. $147.77). These are not minor discrepancies but represent over 30% deviation.

This is a major quantitative error: $7.679B - $7.902B = -$0.223B, but the ground truth states the combined change is -$7,232 million, which equals -$7.232 billion — a discrepancy of over $7 billion. This suggests either a data error or miscalculation in the knowledge base or model reasoning. (2) Individual company changes are numerically accurate: ABT increase from $5.723B to $13.402B is indeed +$7.679B; UNH decrease from $23.144B to $15.242B is -$7.902B.

The ground truth states ADBE's Aggregate Fair Value of outstanding equity awards is $3,591 million, but the LLM reports $3.85 billion ($3,850 million), which is $259 million too high. This error stems from incorrectly breaking down the value into performance shares ($256M) and RSUs ($3.59B), which does not align with the ground truth data. Additionally, while QCOM's derivative fair value of $30 million is correct, the final difference is miscalculated: the LLM states approximately $3.82 billion, whereas the correct difference is $3,561 million ($3.591B - $30M). The correct calculation should be $3,591M - $30M = $3,561M, not $3,850M - $30M = $3,820M.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the carrying amount for COF in 2023 as $6,108 million, which matches the ground truth exactly. However, for MA's contribution to OCI from cumulative basis adjustments, the LLM states a pre-tax change of $6 million resulting in a net-of-tax effect of $5 million, while the ground truth directly states the net-of-tax contribution is $5 million. The final reported number ($5 million after tax) is correct, but the inclusion of an unverified pre-tax figure ($6 million) introduces a minor inaccuracy not present in the source. (2) Quantitatively, the key number ($5 million net effect) is accurate and properly attributed to MA in 2023, and COF's carrying amount is exactly correct. The extra pre-tax detail, while plausible, is not confirmed in the ground truth and slightly deviates from the requested metric (net change in OCI, which is post-tax). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—correctly linking MA to OCI changes and COF to carrying amounts in the same year. Entities and years are accurately identified. (4) Scores reflect high accuracy with a small deduction in quantitative and overall correctness due to the introduction of an unsupported pre-tax value, though the core answer remains factually aligned with the ground truth.",

      "original_answer": "The combined total of the reach-forward losses recorded by Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) in 2024 is $4,099 million. Boeing recorded $2,608 million in the third quarter and an additional $891 million in the fourth quarter related to the 777X program, primarily due to production delays, labor agreements, and supply chain issues. Lockheed Martin recognized $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program within its MFC business segment, driven by cost overruns and fixed-price contract risks. These disclosures highlight differing causes: Boeing's losses stem from production and labor challenges, while Lockheed's are tied to the inherent risks of fixed-price contracts on complex classified development programs.",
      "llm_answer": "The two companies reported roughly $4.9 billion of reach‑forward losses for 2024 – about $3.5 billion at Boeing (the $2,608 million loss recorded in Q3 2024 plus an additional $891 million in Q4 2024 on the 777X program) and about $1.41 billion at Lockheed Martin (the $100 million loss recognized when the first option was deemed probable plus $1.31 billion for the additional options on the MFC/F‑35 program)【page_39】【page_65】.  \n\nBoeing’s disclosure ties the loss to production‑rate slow‑downs, higher labor and supplier costs and certification‑related schedule delays for the 777X, whereas Lockheed Martin’s loss is attributed to higher‑than‑expected engineering and integration costs and the likelihood that multiple contract options will be exercised on its MFC (F‑35) program.",

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. The combined total is stated as roughly $4.9 billion, but the correct total from the ground truth is $4,099 million ($4.099 billion). Boeing's total reach-forward loss is correctly calculated as $2,608M + $891M = $3,499M ($3.499B), but the LLM incorrectly states this as $3.5B (minor rounding is acceptable, but contributes to overall inaccuracy). Lockheed Martin's loss is stated as $1.41 billion, but the ground truth is $1.4 billion. More critically, the LLM misattributes the $1.41B to the 'MFC/F-35 program' and breaks it into $100M + $1.31B, which contradicts the ground truth: LMT's $1.4B loss was on a *classified program* within MFC, not the F-35, and no such two-part disclosure is accurate. (2) Calculations: Boeing's sum ($2,608M + $891M = $3,499M) is correct, but LMT's $1.41B is both numerically and contextually wrong. The combined total should be $3,499M + $1,400M = $4,899M ($4.899B), but the ground truth states $4,099M — a $800M discrepancy. This suggests a fundamental error in either data retrieval or arithmetic. The LLM says 'roughly $4.9B', but the correct total is $4.099B — a material difference. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model identifies both companies, their respective losses, and attempts to explain causes. However, it fails on entity accuracy — attributing LMT’s loss to the F-35 program instead of a classified program — which breaks the multi-hop chain. The causes for Boeing are accurately described (production slowdowns, labor, supplier costs, certification delays). For LMT, the answer cites 'higher-than-expected engineering and integration costs' — plausible but not aligned with the ground truth’s emphasis on 'fixed-price contract risks' and cost overruns on a classified development program. (4) The contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses both parts of the question (total losses and causes). However, due to major quantitative errors and misidentification of LMT’s program, the correctness score is limited to 5. The qualitative accuracy is moderate because reasoning structure is sound but based on incorrect data. Quantitative accuracy is low due to incorrect totals and fabricated breakdowns.",

The ground truth confirms BMY reported $57 million in current liabilities and $524 million in noncurrent liabilities for 2023, which the LLM failed to identify, likely due to not accessing or interpreting the correct data. This omission leads to a major factual error. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly reports Danaher’s figures ($58 million current, not $57 — minor error; $544 million noncurrent), but incorrectly states Danaher’s current liability as $57 million (should be $58 million). More critically, it only reports Danaher’s data, missing BMY’s entirely, leading to a combined current liability of $57 million instead of the correct $115 million, and $544 million noncurrent instead of $1,068 million. These are severe calculation and completeness failures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question requires aggregating pension liabilities across two companies and comparing current vs noncurrent totals. The LLM fails to retrieve BMY’s data, breaking the synthesis chain. It incorrectly concludes only Danaher’s data is available, showing a failure in information retrieval or interpretation. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate — the structure and intent to compare current vs noncurrent liabilities are sound, and Danaher’s data is mostly correct. However, the failure to include BMY’s data — which the ground truth confirms exists — undermines the entire response. The comparison of Danaher’s noncurrent to current (9.5x) is reasonable but irrelevant to the multi-company scope of the question.

(1) All numbers are accurate: Altria's 2024 marketing accrued liabilities are correctly stated as $688 million (vs. $716 million in 2023), and Philip Morris International's as $1,015 million (vs. $862 million in 2023). The combined totals of $1,703 million in 2024 and $1,578 million in 2023 are correctly calculated. The increase of $125 million is accurate. (2) Calculations: $688M + $1,015M = $1,703M; $716M + $862M = $1,578M; difference = $125M — all correct. While the LLM does not explicitly state the percentage increase (7.9%), it conveys the essential quantitative change ('increase of roughly $125 million'), which aligns with the core of the question asking for a comparison. The omission of the percentage is minor and does not detract from the correctness, as the absolute increase is the primary quantitative comparison. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data from two companies across two years, identifies the correct metric (marketing accrued liabilities), and performs cross-entity summation and year-over-year comparison.

      "original_answer": "For MDLZ, favorable volume/mix was a key contributor to the 14.7% organic net revenue growth, alongside higher net pricing. This favorable volume/mix was driven by performance in AMEA, Latin America, and Europe, which saw improved product mix and volume gains, while North America remained flat. In comparison, PM reported an 8.6% increase in net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions, which was also attributed to favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, partially offset by lower cigarette volume. Thus, while both companies benefited from favorable volume/mix, MDLZ experienced broader regional volume and mix improvements, whereas PM's gains were more product-specific, centered on HTUs.",
      "llm_answer": "MDL Z’s 2023 organic net‑revenue rose 14.7%; of that increase, the “favourable volume/mix” factor contributed about **1.3 percentage‑points** (see the Vol/Mix line in the MDLZ table). In contrast, Philip Morris International’s net‑revenue grew **8.6%** when currency effects and acquisitions are stripped out, a rise that the company attributes to a **favourable pricing variance and favourable volume/mix**, chiefly higher heated‑tobacco volume. Thus, while both firms cite volume/mix as a positive driver, MDLZ’s overall organic growth was higher (14.7% vs 8.6%) and its volume/mix effect is quantified at roughly 1.3 pp, whereas PM’s growth reflects a combined pricing‑and‑mix effect that yields an 8.6% increase.",

This figure is not in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided information, making it factually unsupported. The original answer does not quantify the exact contribution of volume/mix, only that it was a 'key contributor' alongside pricing. This is a significant quantitative inaccuracy. (2) The 14.7% organic net revenue growth for MDLZ and 8.6% net revenue growth for PM (excluding currency and acquisitions) are correctly stated and match the ground truth.

(3) The reasoning correctly identifies that both companies benefited from favorable volume/mix and pricing, and contrasts MDLZ’s broad regional improvements with PM’s product-specific gains in HTUs. This synthesis aligns with the original answer’s qualitative comparison, showing sound multi-hop reasoning across companies and drivers. (4) While the contextual relevance is high—addressing both companies, growth rates, and drivers—and the qualitative structure is strong, the introduction of an unverified numerical figure undermines factual correctness.

The difference between these values is 1.38%. These distinct rates reflect differing financial assumptions in their stock option valuation models, with MET using a broader range (0.08% - 2.48%) that accounts for more variability in the risk-free rate, whereas V applied a single-point estimate (1.1%) for its 2022 calculations.",

This is a significant numerical discrepancy that affects the core of the question. Google's figures ($4 million decrease in retained earnings and $34 million decrease in total equity) are correctly reported.

It also correctly states BMY's 2023 after-tax loss of $115 million. However, it introduces a fact not in the ground truth — that BMY had a $145 million gain in 2022 — and calculates a year-over-year decrease of $260 million, which was not asked for and is not supported by the original answer.

      "question": "Given the different performance drivers in their 2024 results, how did MDLZ's unfavorable volume/mix in key product categories contrast with PM's revenue growth driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume, and what was the net impact on each company's operating income?",
      "original_answer": "MDLZ experienced an unfavorable volume/mix of 2.4 percentage points in 2024, driven by volume declines in chocolate, candy, cheese & grocery, and refreshment beverages, particularly in Mexico and Argentina. This negatively impacted net revenues and partially offset the benefits from higher net pricing, contributing to only a 0.6% increase in segment operating income ($3 million). In contrast, PM saw a favorable volume/mix, mainly driven by higher heated tobacco unit (HTU) volume, which contributed to an 8.6% increase in net revenues (excluding currency and acquisitions) and a 25.1% increase in operating income (excluding currency and acquisitions). While MDLZ's operating income growth was nearly flat due to unfavorable volume trends, PM's operating income grew significantly, driven by strong HTU performance and favorable pricing.",
      "llm_answer": "Mondelez’s 2024 results were weighed down by an unfavorable volume‑mix in its core snack categories – chocolate, biscuits & baked snacks, refreshment drinks, candy and gum fell in volume – which limited revenue growth, yet the company still managed a modest rise in operating profit, with segment operating income up about $90 million (≈ 4½ %). In contrast, Philip Morris’ revenue growth was driven by higher heated‑tobacco unit volume, and that volume‑led lift translated into a much stronger earnings boost – operating income rose roughly 12½ % (about $ … million, 12.4 % on an ex‑currency basis).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in key quantitative metrics. According to the ground truth, MDLZ's segment operating income increased by only 0.6% ($3 million), but the LLM claims a $90 million increase (approximately 4.5%), which is vastly overstated. Similarly, PM's operating income growth is reported as 'roughly 12.5%' and '12.4% on an ex-currency basis' in the LLM answer, whereas the ground truth states a 25.1% increase (excluding currency and acquisitions), making the LLM's figure less than half the correct value. The LLM also fails to quantify MDLZ's unfavorable volume/mix impact as -2.4 percentage points, instead vaguely describing it as 'unfavorable.' While it correctly identifies heated tobacco unit (HTU) volume as a driver for PM, it omits that this drove an 8.6% increase in net revenues (ex-currency and acquisitions). (2) Number verification: MDLZ operating income change: LLM says ~$90M (~4.5%), truth is $3M (0.6%) — major error. PM operating income: LLM says ~12.5%, truth is 25.1% — severe underreporting. MDLZ volume/mix impact: missing the -2.4 pp figure entirely. PM revenue growth: omits 8.6% figure. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM attempts to contrast MDLZ and PM but fails to synthesize the correct financial impacts. It recognizes that MDLZ faced volume declines in key categories and that PM benefited from HTU volume, which is correct qualitatively, but the net impact assessment is flawed due to incorrect financial figures. (4) Correctness score is 4 due to partial entity and directional accuracy but major quantitative errors. Quantitative accuracy is 3 due to multiple incorrect percentages and dollar amounts. Qualitative accuracy is 5 because the reasoning structure and entity identification (product categories, HTU) are mostly correct, but synthesis is weak. Contextual relevance is 8 because the answer addresses the right companies, time frame, and comparative structure, even if details are wrong.",

      "question": "What is the combined total of Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue and Qualcomm's fiscal 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, and how does the recognition method of Adobe's subscription revenue contrast with the financial reporting implications of Qualcomm's deferred tax asset valuation?",
      "original_answer": "Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue totaled $11.3 billion, while Qualcomm reported a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of $1.2 billion for the same period. Adobe recognizes subscription revenue ratably over the term of customer agreements or based on usage for certain offerings, which provides a more predictable and recurring revenue stream. In contrast, Qualcomm's valuation allowance reflects uncertainty in realizing future tax benefits, which directly impacts its deferred tax asset carrying value and overall financial position. Together, these metrics illustrate contrasting financial reporting approaches: one focused on stable, forward-looking revenue recognition and the other on conservative asset valuation due to market or operational uncertainties.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe reported **$18.284 billion** of subscription revenue for fiscal 2023. Qualcomm’s 2023 filing does not disclose a separate amount for a valuation allowance on deferred‑tax assets in the pages provided, so the allowance is effectively **$0** for the purpose of this calculation. The combined total is therefore **$18.284 billion**.\n\nAdobe’s subscription revenue is **recognized ratably over the contract term** (or on a usage basis when performance‑based), spreading the revenue evenly across the period the service is delivered. In contrast, Qualcomm’s **valuation allowance on deferred tax assets reduces the amount of future tax benefits that can be recognized**, directly impacting the company’s tax expense and earnings rather than being spread over time.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual errors. According to the ground truth, Adobe's fiscal 2023 subscription revenue is $11.3 billion, but the LLM reports $18.284 billion, which is incorrect. Additionally, the ground truth confirms Qualcomm's 2023 valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as $1.2 billion, but the LLM incorrectly states it is $0 due to non-disclosure, which contradicts the verified data. The combined total should be $12.5 billion ($11.3B + $1.2B), but the LLM calculates $18.284 billion based on erroneous inputs. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: both key figures are wrong, and the sum is therefore incorrect. Even allowing for format variation, the numbers do not match any plausible interpretation of the ground truth. (3) The qualitative reasoning about revenue recognition (ratable recognition) and the financial impact of valuation allowances is partially sound—Adobe’s ratable recognition and Qualcomm’s reduction of deferred tax asset value are conceptually described correctly. However, the failure to correctly identify and synthesize the two core financial figures from the respective companies breaks the multi-hop logic required. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the structure of the question (quantitative sum and qualitative contrast), but the incorrect data undermines the entire response.

      "question": "How do the disclosures in the financial statements of Disney and Google reveal different operational dependencies on advertising revenues, based on their respective breakdowns of revenue sources and operating activities?",
      "original_answer": "Disney discloses that advertising revenues are a significant component of its service revenues, alongside affiliate fees, subscription fees, and other revenue streams tied to media networks and entertainment offerings. This indicates that advertising plays a key but not dominant role in its service-based revenue model. In contrast, Google explicitly states that advertising revenues from Google Search, Network properties, and YouTube ads are its largest source of cash provided by operations, highlighting a much more central and foundational role of advertising in Google’s financial structure. Therefore, while both companies rely on advertising revenues, Disney integrates it as one of several major revenue streams, whereas Google positions it as the core driver of its operating cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney’s filing lists advertising only among a broad set of “service revenues” – alongside affiliate fees, DTC‑streaming subscriptions, theme‑park admissions, licensing and merchandise – and its cash‑flow discussion does not single out ads as the main source of operating cash. In contrast, Alphabet’s filing states that “our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & other properties, Google Network properties, and YouTube ads,” and the operating‑income table shows Google Services (which is driven largely by ad sales) accounting for the bulk of earnings. Thus Disney’s results reflect a diversified operating model with advertising a modest piece, whereas Google’s results reveal a heavy operational dependence on advertising revenue.",

(1) It correctly identifies that Disney reports advertising as part of a broader category of service revenues, alongside affiliate fees, DTC subscriptions, theme park admissions, licensing, and merchandise, which matches the original answer’s emphasis on advertising being significant but not dominant. It also accurately contrasts this with Google (Alphabet), which explicitly identifies advertising revenues from Google Search, Network properties, and YouTube as its largest source of cash from operations. (2) There are no numerical figures in the question or answers requiring verification, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable in a traditional sense—but the absence of incorrect numbers and correct use of financial terminology (e.g., 'cash provided by operations', 'operating income') supports a full score. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes disclosure practices from both companies’ financial statements, compares their revenue breakdowns, and draws a valid conclusion about differing operational dependencies on advertising. The mention of Alphabet’s operating-income table showing Google Services as the bulk of earnings adds contextual detail not in the original but consistent with it. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the slight expansion on Disney’s revenue streams (e.g., explicitly naming theme parks and merchandise) which, while accurate, are not emphasized in the original answer’s focus on service revenues. However, this does not detract from correctness. Overall, the answer is semantically equivalent, contextually relevant, and factually precise.",

      "question": "How do the differences in how Danaher and Pfizer treat acquisition-related items in their financial reporting affect their respective non-GAAP core sales and earnings metrics?",
      "original_answer": "Danaher excludes acquisition-related items from its core sales metric to provide a clearer view of underlying business trends, while Pfizer reports acquisition-related items as a reconciling item that reduces earnings. This means that Danaher's core sales growth reflects only organic performance, whereas Pfizer's earnings are adjusted downward by acquisition-related costs, impacting its reported profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher’s non‑GAAP “core‑sales” metric **excludes** any revenue generated by businesses that were acquired during the year – the company reports the contribution of acquisitions separately ( +2.0 % to total sales in 2024) and then shows a 1.5 % decline in core sales after stripping those acquisition‑related revenues out (see Danaher MD&A, “Core sales” definition and table, p. 40).  \n\nPfizer, by contrast, **includes** acquisition‑related costs in its earnings reconciliation.  In the “Reconciling items” table, acquisition‑related items are shown as a $1.9 billion deduction from Biopharma earnings (p. 106), and the footnote explains that these items cover transaction, integration and restructuring expenses tied to acquisitions.  Because they are subtracted rather than excluded, Pfizer’s non‑GAAP earnings (and the “core‑sales”‑adjusted earnings it presents) are reduced by those acquisition‑related charges.  \n\nThus, Danaher’s approach removes acquisition revenue from the core‑sales figure, making the decline appear larger, while Pfizer’s approach nets acquisition‑related expenses against earnings, lowering its non‑GAAP earnings metric.",

The core comparison—Danaher removing acquisition revenue from sales, Pfizer subtracting acquisition costs from earnings—is factually sound and semantically equivalent to the original answer. (2) Quantitatively, the LLM introduces specific figures not in the original answer: Danaher’s +2.0% acquisition contribution and 1.5% core sales decline in 2024, and Pfizer’s $1.9 billion deduction. While these numbers are plausible and contextually appropriate (and may come from actual filings), they are not present in the ground truth, which makes their inclusion a minor over-specification rather than an error. However, since the question does not ask for specific numbers and the ground truth contains none, introducing them is not incorrect but adds detail beyond the source. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes how each company treats acquisition-related items in non-GAAP reporting, draws a valid contrast in methodology, and explains the impact on their respective metrics.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD reported no anti-dilutive securities excluded from diluted weighted-average common shares, while LOW excluded 0.3 million shares in the same period. This difference reveals that LOW had a measurable number of anti-dilutive securities that could have potentially reduced earnings per share if exercised or converted, whereas HD had no such securities affecting its diluted EPS calculation. The presence of anti-dilutive shares in LOW’s calculation suggests a more complex capital structure with potential future dilution risk compared to HD, which had a simpler or more stable share structure.",

(2) Quantitatively, the numbers are correct: '0.3 million' for LOW and '0' (implied by dash) for HD are consistent with the original answer. No calculations were required, but the comparison is accurately presented. (3) The reasoning is largely sound: the LLM correctly explains that anti-dilutive securities are excluded because they would increase EPS, which aligns with accounting principles (anti-dilutive instruments are excluded from diluted EPS as they inflate EPS rather than dilute it). However, the original answer goes a step further by interpreting the structural implication — that LOW’s capital structure is more complex with potential future dilution risk — which the LLM omits. This minor gap in depth prevents a perfect qualitative score. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the difference in treatment and its implication on EPS.

Specifically, Danaher deems acquisition-related transaction costs significant if they exceed the typical range, especially for larger acquisitions. In contrast, Pfizer excludes acquisition-related items such as transaction, integration, restructuring charges, and additional depreciation costs because they are unique to each transaction and represent costs incurred to restructure and integrate businesses post-acquisition. Pfizer also notes that these integration costs may span several years and are often tied to external approvals. This reveals that while both companies exclude acquisition-related items to provide clearer operational performance insights, Danaher focuses on the variability and comparability issues, whereas Pfizer emphasizes the unique, one-time nature of these costs and their long-term integration timelines.",

The point about integration costs spanning years and being tied to external approvals is implied in the LLM’s reference to integration timelines but not explicitly stated—this is a minor omission. (3) The LLM correctly synthesizes the multi-hop comparison: Danaher takes a purer organic view by isolating acquisitions entirely, while Pfizer includes acquisition results but removes non-recurring integration costs, reflecting a more integrated approach. (4) No numeric values are in dispute; both companies’ rationales are represented with semantically equivalent and factually correct language. The only reason for not scoring a 10 is the slight lack of detail on Pfizer’s note about external approvals and multi-year integration timelines. Overall, the answer is factually sound, contextually relevant, and demonstrates strong qualitative reasoning.",

The combined total of $17.0 billion (rounded from $17.029 billion) matches the ground truth. McDonald's 30% increase is accurate. Nike's increase is correctly calculated as approximately 27% (from $5.841B to $7.429B: (7.429 / 5.841) ≈ 1.272, so 27.2%), which the LLM rounds to 'about 27%', a reasonable approximation. The percentage point difference is correctly identified as 2.8. (2) Minor rounding in the final total ($17.0B vs $17.029B) and Nike's growth rate (27% vs 27.2%) does not affect the overall correctness—these are acceptable approximations. The sum $9.6B + $7.429B = $17.029B is precise; reporting $17.0B is a typical rounding. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies two companies (MCD and NKE), two different fiscal years (2023 for MCD, fiscal 2024 for NKE), retrieves correct 'Cash Provided by Operations' figures, computes year-over-year growth rates, and compares the two. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question. The only minor deviation is the slight rounding of Nike’s growth rate and the total, which justifies a 9 instead of a 10 in quantitative accuracy and overall correctness.

The ground truth states that MDLZ's 2024 U.S. current tax provision is $268 million, but the LLM incorrectly adds $268M (federal) and $83M (state) to arrive at $351M, which is not supported by the original answer. The original answer treats $268M as the total U.S. current tax provision for MDLZ in 2024, not just federal. Similarly, for 2023, the LLM calculates $667M + $123M = $790M, but the ground truth reports MDLZ's 2023 U.S. current tax provision as $667M total, not $790M. These miscalculations stem from misinterpreting the components of the tax provision. (2) As a result, the combined 2024 U.S. current tax provision is incorrectly calculated as $816M ($351M + $465M) instead of the correct $733M. The 2023 total is incorrectly stated as $991M instead of $868M. The difference is then reported as $175M lower in 2024 instead of the correct $135M. All key calculations are therefore factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—combining data across companies and years—but fails due to incorrect input data. The model attempts to synthesize across entities (MDLZ and PM) and years (2023 vs 2024), but the synthesis is based on misinterpreted financial components (federal + state ≠ total U.S. provision as per ground truth). (4) Despite the structural relevance and correct identification of companies and years, the severe quantitative inaccuracies—especially in core financial figures and totals—warrant a low correctness score. Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right companies, years, and metric type, but factual fidelity is poor.",

In contrast, Union Pacific notes that its fuel surcharge programs trail fuel price fluctuations by approximately two months, which can lead to volatility in quarterly and yearly results, especially during periods of rapid fuel price changes. This difference in fuel surcharge responsiveness means FedEx can more quickly pass fuel cost increases to customers, while Union Pacific faces a built-in delay that may expose it to more financial risk during volatile fuel markets.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx’s fuel surcharge is tied to a weekly fuel price (the price ten days before the week of assessment) and is updated each week, so changes in fuel costs are passed through to customers almost immediately. Union Pacific’s surcharge program, by contrast, trails fuel‑price movements by roughly two months, so its revenue from surcharges lags the underlying cost changes and the railroad absorbs more of the price swing before the surcharge catches up, creating greater earnings volatility.",

(2) Calculations in the LLM answer are unsupported: no verification exists for $135M or $304M, and the comparison hinges on these false numbers. The ground truth emphasizes that only Costco quantifies its deferred tax impact, while Colgate does not — a key contrast the LLM misses by assigning precise figures to both. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model incorrectly assumes both companies disclose quantified deferred tax provisions, then draws a conclusion about opposing tax timing effects (deductible vs. taxable differences) based on false data. The correct reasoning, per the original answer, is that both have temporary differences, but only Costco provides quantification, limiting comparability. (4) Despite incorrect facts, the LLM attempts relevant contextual analysis — discussing tax timing effects, deferred tax benefits/liabilities, and contrasting implications — hence partial credit for contextual relevance. However, the core quantitative and qualitative failures severely undermine correctness.",

      "original_answer": "Apple involved Ernst & Young's tax subject matter resources to assess the technical merits of its tax positions, based on knowledge of relevant tax laws and experience with taxing authorities. Oracle similarly involved tax subject matter professionals during its audit to evaluate the technical merits of uncertain tax positions, using the same type of external expertise. Both companies also referenced communications with taxing authorities and, in Apple’s case, received external legal counsel confirmation letters.

The LLM fabricated or misattributed a specific FX impact figure for Costco that is not present in the ground truth. (2) The quantitative accuracy is partially correct: Colgate’s -4.0% FX impact is accurate, but the Costco FX number (0.2%) is unsupported by the original answer and thus incorrect. No calculation errors, but one key number is invalid. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed.

Instead, the ground truth contrasts Colgate’s FX headwinds with Costco’s favorable cost structure (wages/benefits), not FX impact magnitude. The LLM conflates cost structure advantages with FX sensitivity and incorrectly assumes Costco has low FX impact, when the original answer never quantifies it. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses regional cost structures and FX impacts, but misrepresents the data for Costco and draws unsupported conclusions.

This means PYPL's credit risk exposure would directly consider these interest receivables in their financial statements. In contrast, SCHW excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of loans when calculating its allowance for credit losses, indicating that accrued interest is treated separately and not subject to the same credit risk provisions as the principal loan amounts. This results in different financial statement visibility of credit risk exposure between the two companies, with PYPL including interest receivable in asset balances subject to credit risk and SCHW isolating it from credit loss estimation.",

The original answer states that PYPL *includes* accrued interest receivable in its asset balances subject to credit risk, while the LLM claims that PayPal 'does not include it in credit-loss calculations' — this directly contradicts the ground truth and undermines the core comparison. Additionally, the LLM introduces a figure ($42 million at 12/31/2020) not present in the original answer, which, while possibly true, is extraneous and not supported by the provided ground truth. (2) Quantitatively, the $36 million figure for PYPL at 12/31/2021 is correct and matches the original. The inclusion of the 2020 number is accurate per external knowledge but not verifiable from the ground truth provided, so it introduces unverified data. No calculation errors are present, but the misuse of the number in reasoning affects accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM incorrectly aligns PYPL’s policy: it says accrued interest is excluded from amortized cost and fair value of AFS securities (which may be technically accurate), but then wrongly infers this means it's excluded from credit loss considerations — whereas the original answer emphasizes that PYPL *does* include these receivables in credit risk exposure via their balance sheet presentation in other current assets. In contrast, SCHW's treatment is accurately described: accrued interest is removed from the amortized cost basis and reversed upon non-accrual, so the exclusion from credit loss estimation is correctly portrayed. The comparison thus breaks down due to the misrepresentation of PYPL’s approach. (4) Despite correct entity names (PYPL, SCHW), accurate dates, and mostly correct financial terms, the reversal of PYPL’s actual policy results in a significant qualitative and correctness penalty.

These individual values are therefore incorrect, despite being presented confidently with document citations. (2) The calculation itself (adding $2,757M + $1,613M = $4,370M) is mathematically correct, but since it is based on wrong input values, the result is factually inaccurate. The ground truth implies that either one or both of the source values are different in the actual filings—likely, the Union Pacific 'Accrued wages' figure is much lower than $1,613M, or Caterpillar’s figure differs. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—the model identifies the correct companies, the relevant line items, and attempts to sum them—but it fails at data extraction accuracy.

In contrast, TSLA disclosed that its sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience and are 'immaterial in all periods presented,' indicating that the company does not set aside significant reserves due to its assessment that the economic incentives for customers to return vehicles are low. This contrast reveals that LOW, as a traditional retail business, faces more frequent and predictable product returns requiring explicit financial provisioning, while TSLA's automotive sales model, especially with resale value guarantees, involves less immediate return risk due to structured buyback terms and customer financing arrangements. As a result, TSLA's revenue recognition policy assumes lower variability in returns, whereas LOW's policy reflects a more direct and material exposure to returns.",

These values match the original answer exactly in substance, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $245 million). No calculation errors are present.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the dollar amount ($245 million) and the characterization of Tesla’s reserve as 'immaterial' are both correct and properly attributed to the respective companies and fiscal year (2022, as reflected in LOW’s Jan 28, 2022 filing date). The LLM correctly avoids assigning a numerical value to Tesla’s reserve, consistent with the source.\n\n3) The reasoning is sound and reflects appropriate multi-hop synthesis across the two companies’ SEC filings and accounting policies. The LLM correctly links LOW’s reserve to its retail model and revenue recognition adjustments at point of sale, and contrasts this with TSLA’s ASC 606 treatment of returns as variable consideration, tied to resale guarantees and low return incentives. The conclusion about differing exposure to return risk is logically derived and semantically equivalent to the ground truth.\n\n4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy (9/10) is due to slightly less elaboration on the structural aspects of Tesla’s resale-value-guarantee program and customer financing arrangements compared to the original answer.

First, it states that PepsiCo's effective tax rate in 2024 was 19.4%, but the ground truth is 24.4%—matching Costco's rate. This misrepresents the core comparison. Second, the LLM swaps the foreign tax figures: it claims Costco's foreign tax expense is $726 million (≈30% of total), but the correct value is $109 million (1.1%); conversely, it reports PepsiCo's foreign tax as $109 million (1%), but the truth is $1,406 million (52% of $2,694 million). These inversions completely reverse the conclusion about foreign tax burden. (2) Calculations are also incorrect: the LLM derives percentages based on wrong inputs (e.g., $726M / $2.37B ≈ 30.6% is mathematically correct but based on fabricated data). The actual foreign tax burden for Costco is minimal (1.1%), while PepsiCo’s is dominant (52%), contrary to the LLM’s portrayal.

(4) No numbers or dates are incorrect (quantitative accuracy is perfect), and all entities (MA, MET, 2022 implied by context) are accurate. The slight deduction in qualitative accuracy is due to the additional, unverified detail about MA’s G&A treatment, which may or may not be consistent with the knowledge graph’s scope.

      "original_answer": "The net difference in Cash Provided by Investing Activities between Amazon and Nike is $(50.694) billion. Amazon's Cash Provided by Investing Activities was $(49.8) billion in 2023, primarily due to purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures of $48.1 billion, with investments like $1.25 billion in a note from Anthropic, PBC. Nike, in contrast, reported $894 million in Cash Provided by Investing Activities for fiscal 2024, mainly driven by a $1,721 million cash inflow from the net change in short-term investments. Amazon's negative figure reflects heavy capital investments and acquisitions, while Nike's positive inflow highlights a strategy of liquidating short-term investments.",
      "llm_answer": "The two companies differ by roughly **$50.7 billion** – Amazon’s 2023 cash‑flow from investing activities was a **$49.8 billion outflow**, while Nike recorded a **$0.894 billion inflow** in fiscal 2024 (‑$49.8 bn + $0.894 bn ≈ $‑50.7 bn)【page_22†L1-L4】【page_49†L1-L4】.  \n\nAmazon’s large negative number reflects heavy spending on **technology and fulfillment infrastructure, capital‑expenditure projects, and acquisitions (e.g., MGM, 1Life, and a convertible note to Anthropic)**, which together drove the $(49.8) bn cash use【page_23†L1-L7】.  \n\nNike’s modest positive cash flow stems mainly from a **net increase in short‑term investments (sales, maturities and purchases of marketable securities)** that generated a $894 million inflow, rather than significant capital‑expenditure outlays【page_49†L1-L4】.",

The net difference is accurately calculated as approximately $50.7 billion (i.e., -$49.8 billion + $0.894 billion = -$50.694 billion), which rounds correctly to $50.7 billion. The individual cash flows—Amazon’s $(49.8) billion outflow in 2023 and Nike’s $894 million inflow in fiscal 2024—are correctly stated and match the ground truth. 2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: numbers are correct in value, sign (outflow vs inflow), and unit (billion vs million), with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $0.894 billion = $894 million). The calculation of the net difference is mathematically accurate. 3) The qualitative reasoning is strong: the LLM correctly attributes Amazon’s negative cash flow to capital expenditures, acquisitions (MGM, 1Life), and investments like the convertible note to Anthropic, aligning with the ground truth mention of $1.25 billion in notes to Anthropic and $48.1 billion in capex. For Nike, the explanation correctly highlights net change in short-term investments (sales, maturities, purchases) as the driver, consistent with the ground truth’s $1,721 million inflow from short-term investments—though the LLM does not explicitly cite the $1,721 million figure, it correctly identifies the nature of the activity. 4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both the quantitative difference and the qualitative reasons for divergence. The only minor omission is the absence of the exact $1,721 million figure from Nike’s short-term investment activity, which slightly reduces qualitative completeness but does not impair the correctness of the explanation.

      "original_answer": "Amazon's cost of sales explicitly includes inbound and outbound shipping costs, which are a major component of its fulfillment expenses. This means that any increases in shipping costs directly raise Amazon's cost of sales, thereby reducing gross margins unless offset by other factors. In contrast, Nike reported that lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs contributed to a 220 basis point gross margin expansion. This indicates that while Amazon's cost structure is sensitive to shipping cost increases, Nike benefited from reduced logistics expenses, leading to improved profitability.",

It claims Lowe’s income-tax adjustment was $3.0 billion and Home Depot’s implied adjustment was $5.6 billion, leading to Lowe’s being $2.6 billion lower. However, the ground truth is that Lowe’s adjustment was $1,724 million higher than Home Depot’s.

(2) The quantitative values are wrong: the LLM reports $3.0B and $5.6B, which are not consistent with the ground truth difference of $1,724 million. Even if these were approximations, the direction of the comparison (lower vs higher) contradicts the correct relationship. Calculations based on operating income and effective tax rate must yield Home Depot’s implied tax adjustment, but the LLM’s implied calculation (if any) is not shown and results are incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the question requires computing HD’s implied income tax adjustment (operating income × effective tax rate), retrieving LOW’s actual income tax adjustment, and finding the difference.

      "question": "How did the changes in unit sales during their respective 2023 reporting periods affect the operating performance of Amazon and Nike, and what were the specific percentage changes in unit sales for each company?",
      "original_answer": "Amazon experienced an increase in unit sales during its 2023 calendar year, which positively impacted both its North America and International segments' operating performance. Specifically, the North America operating income improvement and the reduced International operating loss were attributed to increased unit sales. In contrast, Nike reported a 12% decrease in combined unit sales within the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels during its fiscal year 2023, which contributed to revenue declines and a 30% drop in EBIT. Therefore, while Amazon's unit sales growth supported stronger operating results, Nike's unit sales contraction significantly weakened its operating performance.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Amazon:** 2023 net‑sales grew about 12% as “increased unit sales” (primarily from third‑party sellers, advertising and subscriptions) lifted North‑America operating income from a loss to a **$14.9 billion gain** and reduced the International operating loss. The filing does not give a numeric percent for the unit‑sales increase, only that the rise in unit sales was the main driver of the operating‑performance improvement.  \n\n- **Nike:** 2023 unit‑sales changes were disclosed with percentages: **footwear unit sales rose ≈ 6 %**, while **apparel unit sales fell ≈ 9 %**. Those opposite trends helped offset each other, resulting in only a **2 % decline in EBIT** for the year.  ",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer contains significant factual errors and misrepresents key aspects of the ground truth. (1) Quantitative Accuracy: The LLM incorrectly states that Nike's footwear unit sales rose by 6% and apparel fell by 9%, leading to a 2% EBIT decline. This contradicts the ground truth, which reports a 12% decrease in combined unit sales (wholesale and DTC) and a 30% drop in EBIT. These numbers are entirely incorrect and unsupported by the original answer. Additionally, the claim of a '2% decline in EBIT' is false. For Amazon, while the $14.9 billion North America operating income figure may be plausible, it is not mentioned in the ground truth, making it potentially fabricated or misattributed. (2) Completeness: The question asks for the specific percentage changes in unit sales for each company. The LLM correctly notes that Amazon did not disclose a specific percentage, but incorrectly provides percentages for Nike’s segments instead of the overall 12% decline in combined unit sales, failing to answer the core quantitative request. (3) Entity Accuracy: The companies and years are correct (Amazon and Nike in 2023), but the financial metrics (EBIT change, unit sales changes) are wrong. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop synthesis fails. The LLM incorrectly infers that offsetting trends in Nike footwear and apparel led to minor EBIT impact, when in fact the ground truth states the 12% unit sales drop significantly hurt operating performance with a 30% EBIT decline. This reverses the magnitude and implication of the impact. (5) Semantic Equivalence: The overall message is distorted—Amazon’s positive impact from unit sales is partially correct, but Nike’s situation is grossly misrepresented. The LLM minimizes the severity of Nike’s decline, contradicting the original answer’s emphasis on significant negative impact. Thus, despite some structural relevance, the factual core is flawed, warranting a low correctness score.",

      "question": "How does the impact of net sales growth on cost management efficiency differ between Procter & Gamble's SG&A expenses and Walmart's Sam's Club segment performance, and what specific factors contribute to these differences?",
      "original_answer": "Procter & Gamble experienced a 10% increase in SG&A expenses to $23.3 billion, with SG&A as a percentage of net sales rising 200 basis points to 27.7%, primarily due to increased marketing spending. Although marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased by 170 basis points, this was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. In contrast, Walmart’s Sam’s Club segment saw net sales increase by $1.8 billion or 2.2% for fiscal 2024, with comparable sales growth benefiting from increases in transactions and average ticket, particularly in grocery and health and wellness. The Sam’s Club segment also experienced a positive contribution from e-commerce sales, which helped offset declines in fuel sales due to deflation. While P&G’s cost management was challenged by higher SG&A relative to sales growth, Walmart’s segment performance reflected more direct alignment between sales growth and operational efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "Procter & Gamble’s modest 2 % net‑sales increase in FY 2024 was accompanied by a **rise in SG&A as a share of sales (up 200 bps to 27.7 %)**, because the company’s marketing spend and overhead‑inflation (wage, other cost increases) grew faster than the scale benefit from higher sales, even after a 60‑bps productivity offset.  \n\nWalmart’s Sam’s Club, by contrast, showed **opposite cost‑leverage behavior**: when comparable sales jumped 14.7 % in FY 2023, operating expenses fell 97 bps as a share of sales, but with only a 2.2 % sales rise in FY 2024 the expense ratio rose 46 bps, driven by lower fuel sales (which reduced revenue without cutting fixed costs) and higher technology spending.  \n\nThus, P&G’s cost‑management efficiency eroded despite sales growth due to aggressive marketing and overhead pressure, whereas Sam’s Club’s efficiency improves with strong sales growth and is hurt when modest sales are offset by fuel‑price and technology cost dynamics.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It states Procter & Gamble had a '2% net-sales increase in FY 2024', which is not supported by the original answer and contradicts the implied growth context. The original answer does not specify P&G's overall net sales growth, only that SG&A rose to $23.3B with a 200 bps increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales to 27.7%. The LLM correctly notes the 200 bps increase in SG&A as a % of sales and attributes it partly to marketing spend, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it introduces a '60-bps productivity offset' not mentioned in the original. Regarding Walmart’s Sam’s Club, the LLM incorrectly states 'comparable sales jumped 14.7% in FY 2023'—the original answer discusses FY 2024 performance with a 2.2% net sales increase and mentions comparable sales growth driven by transactions and average ticket, but does not specify the 14.7% figure or reference FY 2023. The claim that operating expenses fell 97 bps in FY 2023 is unsupported. For FY 2024, the LLM says the expense ratio rose 46 bps due to lower fuel sales and higher technology spending—this nuance is plausible but not present in the original answer, which focuses on e-commerce offsetting fuel deflation. 2) Multiple numbers are incorrect or hallucinated: the 2% sales growth for P&G, 14.7% comp growth in FY 2023, 97 bps decline and 46 bps rise in expense ratios, and 60 bps productivity offset. Only the 200 bps rise in P&G's SG&A ratio and 2.2% sales growth at Sam’s Club are accurate. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model attempts to contrast cost management efficiency in response to sales growth across two companies, which addresses the question’s intent. However, the reasoning is based on fabricated data points, undermining the validity of the comparison. The conclusion that P&G’s cost efficiency eroded while Sam’s Club’s depends on sales strength is consistent with the original’s theme, but the supporting logic relies on incorrect figures. 4) Despite incorrect numbers, the LLM captures the qualitative contrast: P&G faced cost pressure despite sales growth due to marketing and overhead, while Sam’s Club benefited from sales drivers like e-commerce and transaction growth. The contextual relevance is high because it directly addresses the comparative cost efficiency question, but the factual foundation is weak, leading to a moderate correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "NVIDIA extended the useful lives of its server, storage, and network equipment, resulting in a $135 million increase in operating income for fiscal year 2024 due to lower depreciation expenses. This indicates a cost management strategy focused on optimizing asset utilization over time. In contrast, Oracle recognizes cloud services revenue ratably or based on customer usage, which reflects a revenue recognition strategy tied directly to service delivery patterns. Comparing these approaches reveals that NVIDIA focuses on spreading infrastructure costs over a longer period to improve profitability metrics, while Oracle aligns revenue recognition closely with actual service consumption, highlighting different financial reporting strategies in managing cloud operations.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s 2023 filing notes that it lengthened the estimated useful lives of its server, storage and network equipment from three to four‑or‑five years, which lowered depreciation expense by $33 million in cost of revenue and $102 million in operating expenses (see NVDA Note 1, p. 55). In contrast, Oracle records customer pre‑payments for cloud‑service contracts as deferred revenue and then recognizes that revenue ratably or on a usage basis over the contract period (see Oracle Deferred Revenues, p. 92). Thus, NVIDIA’s reporting treats cloud‑infrastructure costs as long‑lived capital assets to spread expense, while Oracle’s reporting treats cloud services as a subscription‑type revenue stream that is earned over time.",

(1) It correctly identifies NVIDIA's change in useful life from 3 to 4–5 years and breaks down the $33 million reduction in cost of revenue and $102 million in operating expenses, totaling $135 million in lower depreciation—matching the ground truth's reported $135 million increase in operating income. The numbers are correct and add up appropriately, though the LLM attributes the savings more granularly than the original answer, which is acceptable and even more detailed. (2) The LLM accurately describes Oracle’s revenue recognition policy—deferring revenue and recognizing it ratably or based on usage—citing the correct accounting treatment and aligning with the original answer.

(4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the original, with slightly different phrasing but identical core insights. The only minor point is that the LLM refers to '2023 filing' while the ground truth references fiscal year 2024; however, this likely reflects the timing of the filing (e.g., 2023 filing for FY2024), so it does not constitute a material error.

PayPal's outstanding balance in its merchant loan portfolio was $1.2 billion as of the same date, significantly smaller in scale. The allowance for loan losses at JPM is designed to cover potential credit losses across a broad range of loans, while PayPal's credit risk is concentrated in its merchant finance products like PPWC and PPBL, where repayment depends on merchants' payment processing volumes. The difference in scale indicates that JPM has a much larger and systemically important lending operation, while PayPal’s lending is more specialized and tied to its digital payments ecosystem.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the allowance for loan losses for PayPal. The ground truth states that PayPal's *outstanding balance* in its merchant loan portfolio was $1.2 billion, but does not provide a specific allowance amount. The LLM incorrectly asserts that PayPal had a $160 million allowance (sum of $148M for loans and $12M for interest-and-fees), which is not supported by the original answer or implied data. This is a critical error in quantitative accuracy. JPMorgan's allowance is correctly reported as $5,005 million (~$5.0 billion), which aligns with the ground truth. (2) The calculation of a '30-fold' difference is based on incorrect data: $5.0B / $160M = ~31.25, but since PayPal's allowance is not actually stated in the original, this comparison is invalid. Additionally, the LLM introduces 'total loans of $278B' for JPM and 'merchant receivables' for PayPal, which are not mentioned in the original answer and appear to be hallucinated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—comparing scale and risk exposure between JPM and PayPal—but fails in execution due to reliance on fabricated figures. The original emphasizes JPM's diversified portfolio versus PayPal's concentration in merchant finance tied to processing volumes, which the LLM only partially captures, omitting the key point about repayment dependency on transaction volumes. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the LLM maintains contextual relevance by addressing the comparative scale and risk implications. However, the core quantitative error undermines the correctness score, limiting it to 4.

      "original_answer": "JPMorgan Chase extended loans by a weighted average of 23 months for single term extensions and 137 months for other-than-insignificant payment deferrals with term extensions, while PayPal reported a weighted average term extension of 24 months across its merchant loan modifications. This indicates that PayPal's modified loans have a slightly longer average extension period compared to JPMorgan's single term extensions, but significantly shorter than JPMorgan's extended deferral and term extension category.",
      "llm_answer": "JPMorgan Chase’s loan‑modification tables show that the “Term‑extension” category lengthened the contracts by a weighted‑average of **23 months** (the other “payment‑deferral + term‑extension” group averaged 137 months, but the primary term‑extension figure is 23 months). PayPal’s merchant‑loan modifications report a weighted‑average term extension of **24 months**. Because the extensions are essentially the same, the average life of JPMorgan‑modified loans is only about one month shorter than that of PayPal’s modified loans, resulting in a virtually identical impact on the duration of the two portfolios.",

However, it omits the critical distinction that JPMorgan also has a separate category—'other-than-insignificant payment deferrals with term extensions'—with a 137-month extension, which is central to the comparative impact on average duration. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers cited (23 and 24 months) are accurate, and the one-month difference is correctly noted. But the conclusion that the portfolios have 'virtually identical impact' fails to acknowledge that JPMorgan has a second, much longer extension category (137 months), which significantly affects the overall average duration of its modified loans. This leads to a misleading comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks about the impact on the 'average duration of modified loans in their respective portfolios,' which requires considering all modification types. The LLM incorrectly focuses only on the 'primary' 23-month figure for JPMorgan, ignoring the 137-month cohort, thus failing to synthesize the full scope of JPMorgan's data. (4) While the answer is contextually relevant and numerically precise for the subset presented, the omission of a major data point and the resulting incorrect qualitative conclusion reduce correctness and reasoning scores.

However, the ground truth states 4.77%, likely due to rounding differences in intermediate steps (e.g., if more decimal places were used in the source data). This minor discrepancy affects the final difference: LLM computes 5.75% - 4.78% = 0.97 percentage points, while the ground truth reports 0.98%. The difference between 0.97 and 0.98 is due to this rounding choice.

Conversely, it claims Johnson & Johnson had no divestiture gain, while the ground truth shows a $600 million gain. These errors completely reverse the financial outcomes for both companies. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers are incorrect: Bristol-Myers Squibb's $55M loss is misrepresented as a $600M gain, and J&J's $600M gain is omitted entirely. The final combined total of $0.6 billion gain is wrong; the correct net is $545 million gain ($600M gain - $55M loss). The LLM also misattributes the $0.6 billion figure to Bristol-Myers Squibb instead of Johnson & Johnson. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly extract or attribute the divestiture figures from the respective 10-Ks.

      "original_answer": "Elevated consumer debt levels are causing discretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers for Altria, influencing their purchasing behaviors, including brand mix and adoption of smoke-free products. This directly affects Altria's strategy to maintain a total adjusted OCI margin of at least 60% through 2028 while investing in innovative smoke-free products. Similarly, Walmart notes that consumer debt levels impact buying patterns and disposable income, prompting them to absorb cost increases, reduce prices in certain categories, and focus on opening-price points to maintain customer spending. Both companies are adapting to the same macroeconomic constraint—elevated consumer debt—by adjusting their product and pricing strategies to retain consumers and maintain financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Altria says that “higher consumer‑debt levels … create discretionary‑income pressure on adult tobacco consumers,” which has already lifted the industry’s discount‑segment share and is prompting the company to watch the shift from premium to lower‑priced brands and to accelerate its move toward smoke‑free and other lower‑priced products (Altria 2023 MD&A, Trends and Developments).  \n\nWalmart likewise identifies “consumer‑debt levels and buying patterns” as a macro‑economic driver of its pricing strategy, stating that it is responding by emphasizing everyday‑low‑prices—absorbing cost increases, cutting prices in selected categories and focusing on price‑point offerings—to keep price‑sensitive shoppers buying despite tighter household finances (Walmart 2023 MD&A, Factors affecting results and pricing/merchandising strategies).",

Walmart, on the other hand, considers several factors when executing its $20.0 billion share repurchase program, including current cash needs, leverage capacity, and the cost of borrowings. As of January 31, 2024, $16.5 billion remained available under the program, which Walmart expects to fund primarily through free cash flow. Both companies factor the cost of borrowings into their capital allocation decisions, but Altria's reliance on subsidiary cash flows reflects a structural dependency, while Walmart's approach is more directly tied to its operational free cash flow generation.",
      "llm_answer": "Altria says it “is a holding company that is primarily dependent on the capital resources of our subsidiaries to satisfy our liquidity requirements,” receiving cash mainly from dividend and interest payments from those affiliates and using its credit‑rating‑driven cost of borrowing only as a secondary source of liquidity. Walmart, by contrast, expects the $20 billion share‑repurchase program to be “majority… funded through the Company’s free cash flow,” but it explicitly weighs “cost of borrowings” among the factors that determine when and how much to repurchase, and its short‑term borrowing program carries a weighted‑average rate of about 5 % (2024) to 2‑3 % (2023). Thus, Altria’s capital allocation is driven by subsidiary cash‑flow availability, while Walmart’s is driven by its own cash generation with borrowing costs influencing the timing and scale of repurchases.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and captures the core distinctions between Altria and Walmart in terms of liquidity sources and capital allocation, with only minor omissions. (1) Quantitatively, the LLM correctly identifies Altria’s structural dependency on subsidiary cash flows and Walmart’s expectation to fund the $20.0 billion share repurchase program primarily through free cash flow. While the LLM mentions Walmart’s short-term borrowing rates (5% in 2024, 2–3% in 2023), these specific rates are not in the ground truth and appear to be inferred or sourced externally; however, the ground truth does confirm that cost of borrowings is a factor, so this addition doesn’t invalidate the response. The ground truth includes Altria’s $3.7 billion cash balance and Walmart’s $16.5 billion remaining repurchase capacity—these numbers are missing in the LLM answer, representing a minor quantitative omission. (2) The LLM accurately reflects that Altria relies on dividends, distributions, and intercompany interest, and that borrowing is secondary, aligning with the holding company structure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it correctly contrasts Altria’s subsidiary-driven liquidity model with Walmart’s operational free cash flow model, and both companies’ use of borrowing costs in capital allocation decisions is appropriately contextualized—Altria’s cost of borrowing as secondary, Walmart’s as a timing/scale factor. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in meaning, though slightly less detailed. The omission of specific dollar figures (e.g., $3.7B cash, $16.5B remaining) prevents a perfect score, but the core logic, entities, and financial reasoning are correct. Contextual relevance is excellent—every part of the question is addressed directly and coherently.",

      "original_answer": "A $50 million potential decrease in ADBE's unrecognized tax benefits suggests that some previously uncertain tax positions may be resolved within the next year. This would likely result in a corresponding adjustment to ADBE's tax provision, indicating that its prior reserves were potentially overstated, or that the resolution of audits has clarified the adequacy of its tax reserves. This directly supports ADBE's assertion that it regularly assesses the likelihood of outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes. Similarly, AAPL also evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its tax provision, though AAPL does not specify a quantitative estimate of potential changes. Both companies thus use ongoing assessments of audit outcomes to guide the sufficiency of their tax reserves, but ADBE provides a specific dollar amount of potential change, while AAPL offers a more qualitative evaluation.",
      "llm_answer": "A Adobe (ADBE) notes that, because the unrecognized tax‑benefit balance could fall by as much as $50 million in the next year, the company would see a modest reduction in the amount it may ultimately have to recognize, thereby strengthening its view that the current income‑tax provision is more than adequate. In contrast, Apple (AAPL) does not quantify a similar expected change; it simply states that it “regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes,” using that ongoing assessment to judge whether its tax reserves are sufficient.",

(2) The answer addresses both parts of the multi-hop question: ADBE’s specific $50M potential adjustment and its implication for tax provision adequacy, and AAPL’s more qualitative, non-quantified approach. (3) Entities are correct—ADBE and AAPL are accurately identified, and the financial concept of unrecognized tax benefits and tax provision adequacy is properly applied. (4) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that a $50M decrease implies prior reserves may have been conservative, thus supporting the adequacy of the current tax provision. It also correctly contrasts ADBE’s quantitative disclosure with AAPL’s qualitative, ongoing assessment approach. The only minor shortcoming is a slight softening of the nuance in the original answer—specifically, the original emphasizes that ADBE’s disclosure supports its assertion about regular assessment of audit outcomes, which the LLM implies but does not explicitly state.

However, Thermo Fisher Scientific’s 2024 10-K filing only includes a placeholder note about consolidated financial statements without disclosing any specific impairments, investments, or developments in the Biopharma segment.

While the original answer breaks down the $2.9 billion into specific components ($1.0 billion for B7H4V, $475 million for Medrol, $435 million for Zavzpret, etc.), the LLM answer does not include these granular figures. However, it accurately summarizes the total and the DMD-specific charge, which are the key quantitative elements. (2) All numeric values mentioned in the LLM answer are correct: $2.9 billion and $240 million are accurately reported with proper context. The absence of the sub-component breakdown is a minor omission but does not affect the overall correctness of the financial impact described. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly contrasts Pfizer’s detailed impairments with Thermo Fisher Scientific’s lack of specific Biopharma segment disclosures, citing that Thermo Fisher’s 10-K only contains general segment information and no mention of Pfizer or joint activities. This aligns with the ground truth’s reasoning that insufficient evidence exists to link the two companies’ financial activities. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question—Pfizer’s financial impact and the lack of connection to Thermo Fisher.

In contrast, Charles Schwab states that Principal Transactions Revenue is recognized primarily as a result of accommodating clients' fixed income trading activity and includes adjustments to the fair value of securities positions.

Schwab describes it as revenue generated from “accommodating clients’ fixed‑income trading activity” and as “including adjustments to the fair value of securities positions and unrealized gains and losses on cash and investments segregated for regulatory purposes.”  Thus, Schwab treats it as a component of trading income, while JPMorgan treats it as a separate valuation‑adjustment line in its investment‑banking results.",

Since CVS provides Medicare Advantage coverage to beneficiaries under contracts with CMS, and Medicare contracts alone accounted for 73% of CVS's federal government revenues in 2023, this exclusion could directly affect CVS's ability to offer comprehensive respiratory care coverage.

(1) Quantitatively, the 73% figure for Medicare contracts' share of CVS's federal government revenues is correctly cited from the CVS 10-K, matching the original answer. No other numerical values (e.g., dates, dollar amounts) are present, and all references are consistent. Format variation (73 % vs 73%) is acceptable. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the key entities: TEZSPIRE (Amgen's drug), Medicare Part B, Medicare Advantage plans, CMS, and CVS's Health Care Benefits segment. It accurately cites Amgen’s 10-K regarding the potential exclusion and CVS’s 10-K for revenue dependency. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects Amgen’s disclosure about TEZSPIRE’s coverage risk to CVS’s business model reliance on Medicare contracts, then infers reduced drug utilization and capitation payments. The conclusion that this could 'materially affect' CVS’s Medicare-related earnings is a slightly more conservative phrasing than the original answer’s emphasis on enrollment and cost impacts, but it captures the core financial risk. (4) The answer is contextually excellent—directly addressing the question about impact on CVS’s Medicare Advantage business. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly mention the potential effect on beneficiary enrollment or unmet medical needs, which are part of the original answer’s broader impact assessment. However, 'reduced drug utilization and capitation payments' implies these dynamics. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-supported, and semantically equivalent with only slight omission of secondary consequences.",

This aligns with HD's definition of comparable sales, which is based on sales from stores open at least one year and includes e-commerce sales, as outlined in the Results of Operations section of its MD&A.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model was expected to report how LOW’s ticket and transaction changes influenced its comparable sales and relate that to HD’s definition of the metric. Instead, it incorrectly shifts focus to HD’s performance data and fails to correctly synthesize LOW’s actual results with HD’s definitional framework.

(2) The calculation for CVS is accurate ($71M + $72M = $143M), but the Amgen figure is incorrect. The combined total is reported as 'about $310 million', which results from $167M + $143M = $310M, but the correct total per the original answer is $323M.

      "original_answer": "At LOW, the average ticket remained relatively stable at $103.37 in fiscal 2024, showing only a slight decrease from $103.51 in 2023, which suggests minimal negative impact on per-customer spending. In contrast, SBUX experienced a 4% decline in average ticket, contributing to a $210 million reduction in comparable store sales. This significant drop in average ticket at SBUX directly impacted international total net revenues, which decreased by $149 million overall, with foreign currency translation and lower product and equipment sales further compounding the decline. Therefore, while LOW maintained stable average ticket performance, SBUX's drop in average ticket had a measurable negative financial impact.",
      "llm_answer": "- **Lowe’s (LOW):**  The average ticket rose only modestly – from $103.51 in 2023 to $103.37 in 2024 (about a 0.3 % increase, or roughly $0.14 per transaction).  That small uplift helped offset a 3 % fall in comparable customer transactions, but it was not enough to prevent overall revenue from slipping 3.1 % to $83.7 billion in fiscal 2024.  \n\n- **Starbucks (SBUX):**  A 4 % decline in average ticket drove a $210 million reduction in comparable store sales, which was a key factor in the $149 million (≈2 %) drop in international total net revenues for fiscal 2024.  The weaker ticket size therefore directly contributed to the decline in sales performance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "(1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors, particularly regarding LOW's average ticket trend and revenue performance. The original answer states that LOW's average ticket decreased slightly from $103.51 in 2023 to $103.37 in 2024, but the LLM incorrectly claims it increased (from $103.51 to $103.37), which is a contradiction in direction despite a correct magnitude. This misrepresents a decrease as an increase. Additionally, the LLM introduces a 3.1% revenue decline to $83.7 billion and a 3% fall in customer transactions for LOW—details not present in the ground truth and unsupported by the provided data. For SBUX, the $210 million reduction in comparable store sales and $149 million drop in international total net revenues are correctly cited, aligning with the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is compromised: the direction of change in LOW’s average ticket is wrong, and unsourced figures (e.g., $83.7B revenue, 3% transaction decline) are fabricated or hallucinated. The 4% decline in SBUX’s average ticket and its $210M impact are accurate. (3) Reasoning for SBUX is sound—correctly linking lower average ticket to sales decline. However, for LOW, the reasoning is flawed due to incorrect data interpretation and introduction of unsupported multi-hop elements (e.g., transactions and overall revenue decline). The model fails to accurately synthesize LOW’s stable ticket performance as a neutral factor. (4) Contextual relevance is high—both companies are addressed, and the core concept of average ticket impact on sales is explored. However, correctness is significantly undermined by key numerical and directional errors, especially for LOW, warranting a mid-range score of 5.",

The average training hours per person at Accenture is correctly stated as about 61 hours. However, the key error lies in the comparison: the LLM says Accenture’s 61 hours per employee is 'tiny compared with Oracle’s 2 million total training hours', which is a flawed comparison (per-person vs. total). The ground truth correctly notes that Oracle lacks a per-person metric and emphasizes Accenture's more intensive per capita investment. 2) Quantitatively, all numbers are directionally accurate with appropriate qualifiers ('over', 'about', 'roughly'), and the sum is correct. 3) The reasoning fails in the multi-hop comparison: it incorrectly compares a per capita figure (Accenture's 61 hours) to a total volume (Oracle's 2 million hours), which is logically invalid and misrepresents the insight. The model does not recognize that Oracle's total cannot be meaningfully compared to Accenture's per-person average. 4) Contextual relevance is high as all entities (Accenture, Oracle, fiscal 2022, training hours) are correct and the response addresses both parts of the question, but the flawed logic undermines the qualitative accuracy.

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar utilizes a mark-to-market approach, recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter or on an interim basis if triggering events occur. This results in full recognition of any valuation changes in the period they occur, directly impacting earnings volatility. In contrast, Lockheed Martin amortizes actuarial gains or losses over time, as shown by the changes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, which includes both the actual return versus expected return on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. This amortization approach spreads the financial statement impact across multiple periods rather than recognizing it all at once, leading to smoother earnings.",

The ground truth states the combined rent expense is $363.2 million, but the LLM calculates $1.78 billion ($294M + $1,486.3M), which is over 4x higher. This indicates a fundamental failure in quantitative accuracy. (2) While the LLM cites $294 million for General Motors and $1,486.3 million for McDonald’s, these values do not sum to the correct total from the knowledge graph. Either the individual values are incorrect despite appearing precise, or the knowledge graph reflects a different scope (e.g., only a subset of rent expenses). However, since the ground truth is authoritative, the LLM’s numbers must align with it — they do not. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model identifies both companies, extracts rent expenses for 2021, and attempts to sum them — but the synthesis leads to a result that contradicts the verified truth. This suggests either incorrect source data interpretation or a failure in grounding.

In contrast, LMT's fixed-price contracts require them to absorb cost fluctuations, as profits depend on meeting cost estimates—variations lead to higher or lower profits or even losses. This shows CAT used pricing power to mitigate cost pressures, while LMT managed risks through internal cost control under fixed-price terms.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar’s 2021 profit surge was driven largely by “higher sales volume … and favorable price realization” (Cat 10‑K p. 31‑34), which the company used to offset rising component, transportation and raw‑material costs and the supply‑chain delays it was experiencing (Cat 10‑K p. 31). In contrast, Lockheed Martin’s earnings are shaped by its reliance on “fixed‑price contracts… where we agree to perform the work for a pre‑determined price” (LMT 10‑K p. 58); under this model the firm must contain its own costs and manage supply‑chain disruptions internally because any cost overruns directly erode profit. Thus, Caterpillar combats cost pressure by passing higher prices to customers, whereas Lockheed Martin manages the same pressures through disciplined cost control embedded in fixed‑price contract terms.",

The reinvested earnings of Philip Morris International are significantly higher than the amount PepsiCo intends to reinvest internationally.",
      "llm_answer": "PepsiCo says it “intends to continue to reinvest **$7 billion** of earnings outside the United States” (Undistributed International Earnings section, PEP 10‑K 2022, p. 88).  \n\nPhilip Morris International reports “**Earnings Reinvested in the Business**” of **$33,082 million** (i.e., about $33.1 billion) at December 31 2021 (PM 10‑K 2022, p. 75).  \n\nThus, PMI’s reinvested earnings are roughly $26 billion (about 4½‑5 times) larger than PepsiCo’s planned international reinvestment.",

(1) Quantitatively, the numbers are accurate: PepsiCo's $7 billion intended international reinvestment and Philip Morris International's $33,082 million ($33.082 billion) in 'Earnings Reinvested in the Business' as of December 31, 2021, are correctly reported. The LLM appropriately notes that $33,082 million is about $33.1 billion, which is a valid rounding. (2) The comparison is sound: the difference is approximately $26 billion, and stating that PMI’s amount is about 4.5 to 5 times larger is mathematically accurate (33.1 / 7 ≈ 4.73). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is correct—information from two different 10-K filings (PEP and PM, both 2022 reports referencing 2021 data) is properly synthesized. (4) Entities are correctly identified: PepsiCo and Philip Morris International (via ticker PM), correct metric names, and correct time reference (December 31, 2021). (5) The answer fully addresses both parts of the question: the amount PepsiCo intends to reinvest internationally and how it compares to PMI’s reinvested earnings.

      "question": "What is the combined percentage point impact on effective tax rates from foreign operations for ACN and ORCL in fiscal 2022, and how do their respective adjustments for other tax-related activities differ in magnitude and direction?",
      "original_answer": "The combined percentage point impact from foreign operations for ACN and ORCL in fiscal 2022 is 2.9 percentage points. ACN reports a 0.8 percentage point increase from non-U.S. operations taxed at other rates. ORCL reports $536 million in tax impact from foreign earnings at other than U.S. rates, which, when normalized to its $1,606 million U.S. federal statutory tax provision, results in a 33.4% effective foreign tax differential (i.e., $536M / $1,606M), or approximately 2.1 percentage points below the U.S. federal statutory rate. These foreign operation effects must be interpreted in the context of other adjustments: ACN reports a 3.0 percentage point increase from other net activity in unrecognized tax benefits and a 3.0 percentage point reduction from excess tax benefits from share-based payments. ORCL reports a $263 million net benefit from settlements and releases and a $441 million expense from domestic tax contingencies, indicating contrasting directional adjustments of $704 million total in offsetting impacts.",
      "llm_answer": "- Foreign‑operations impact on the effective tax rate in FY 2022 was **+0.8 percentage‑points for Accenture (ACN)** (the “Non‑U.S. operations taxed at other than U.S. rates” line) and **‑8.8 percentage‑points for Oracle (ORCL)** (the gap between the 21 % U.S. statutory rate and Oracle’s 12.2 % effective rate, driven largely by foreign earnings). Together they amount to a **net –8.0 percentage‑point impact**.\n\n- The “other‑tax” adjustments differ markedly. Accenture’s other items total about **3.0 pp**, but this is fully offset by an equal‑size **‑3.0 pp** excess tax benefit from share‑based compensation, leaving a net effect essentially zero. Oracle’s other adjustments add roughly **7 pp** (the “Other, net” line) with no offsetting credit, so they increase Oracle’s effective tax rate by about seven points.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. The foreign operations impact for ORCL is incorrectly calculated as -8.8 percentage points, derived from the difference between the 21% U.S. statutory rate and ORCL's 12.2% effective tax rate. However, the ground truth specifies that the foreign impact is $536 million, normalized to the $1,606 million U.S. federal statutory tax provision, resulting in a 33.4% differential of the statutory rate, or approximately 2.1 percentage points *below* the U.S. rate — not 8.8 points. The combined impact is therefore not -8.0 percentage points, but +0.8 (ACN) + (-2.1) (ORCL) = -1.3, not the stated -8.0. The ground truth states the *combined* impact is +2.9 percentage points, which contradicts both the LLM’s calculation and sign. This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of how to compute percentage point impacts from foreign operations.\n\n2) The LLM incorrectly states ORCL’s foreign impact as a gap between statutory and effective rates, which conflates total tax effects with the specific component due to foreign operations. The ground truth isolates the $536M foreign earnings impact and normalizes it to the U.S. tax provision, yielding ~2.1 percentage points reduction — not the full 8.8-point difference in effective tax rates. Additionally, the combined impact in the original answer is stated as +2.9 percentage points, which implies the two effects are additive in direction (but the LLM and ground truth disagree on ORCL’s sign and magnitude). However, based on the ground truth, ACN’s +0.8 and ORCL’s -2.1 would sum to -1.3, not +2.9 — suggesting possible misinterpretation in the original answer or LLM answer. But the LLM does not reproduce the +2.9 figure at all, instead calculating -8.0, which is unsupported.\n\n3) For other adjustments, the LLM misrepresents both companies. It claims ACN’s other items are fully offset by share-based compensation, but the ground truth states a +3.0 pp increase from unrecognized tax benefits and a separate -3.0 pp reduction from share-based payments — two distinct adjustments, not a net zero. The LLM incorrectly implies they offset each other in net effect, which is not stated in the original. For ORCL, the LLM cites a '7 pp' increase from 'Other, net' with no explanation, but the ground truth specifies a $263M benefit from settlements and $441M expense from tax contingencies — offsetting items totaling $704M in gross adjustments, not a net 7 pp increase. The LLM fails to capture the *contrasting directional adjustments* emphasized in the original.\n\n4) Entity and metric identification is partially correct: ACN and ORCL are correctly identified, fiscal year 2022 is assumed correctly, and some line items (e.g., share-based payments) are referenced. However, the reasoning is flawed in multi-hop synthesis: the model fails to normalize ORCL’s foreign tax impact correctly, misinterprets the nature of 'other' adjustments, and draws incorrect conclusions about net effects. While the answer attempts to address both parts of the question, the quantitative inaccuracies and flawed logic severely undermine correctness. The contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses the right companies and general categories, but the details are largely incorrect.",

The difference is calculated as roughly $3.1 billion, which aligns with the ground truth calculation of $3,065 million ($4,765M - $1,700M). (2) The numbers are presented with slight rounding: $4,765 million is reported as 'about $4.8 billion' (acceptable approximation), $1,700 million as '$1.7 billion' (exact), and the difference as '$3.1 billion' versus the precise $3,065 million.

The missing $185 million for COF and the $382 million total are significant quantitative omissions, though not misstatements.

According to the ground truth, MDT reported $1,255 million in capitalized R&D, not $971 million, and MRK reported $2,099 million, not $1,255 million. The combined total is therefore incorrect: $3,354 million (ground truth) vs. $2.23 billion claimed. The deferred tax assets are also inaccurate: MDT’s is $5,006 million (not $3.48 billion), and MRK’s is $3,937 million (not ~$3.5 billion). These errors undermine the entire comparison. (2) Calculations and comparisons are flawed. The LLM concludes that capitalized R&D is 'significantly lower' than deferred tax assets, but due to incorrect inputs, this reasoning fails. In reality, MRK’s capitalized R&D represents about 53% of its DTA—over half—so it is not 'significantly lower.' Even MDT’s 25% is material. The LLM missed this key insight due to wrong data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is attempted—combining R&D and DTA across two companies and comparing—but fails because the underlying data is incorrect. The model does recognize the need to compare R&D capitalization to net deferred tax assets after valuation allowance, showing some structural understanding. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses the right concepts (capitalized R&D, deferred tax assets, comparison), uses correct company tickers and fiscal year, and attempts synthesis.
