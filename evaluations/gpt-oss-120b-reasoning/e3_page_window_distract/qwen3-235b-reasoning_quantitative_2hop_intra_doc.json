(1) Quantitatively, the revenue figures are accurate: $71.462 billion in 2022 and $82.419 billion in 2023. The difference is $82.419B - $71.462B = $10.957B, which matches the ground truth increase of $10,957 million ($10.957 billion). The percentage growth is correctly calculated as approximately 15%: (10.957 / 71.462) ≈ 0.1532 or 15.32%, which rounds to the reported 'roughly 15%'—consistent with the ground truth. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both the dollar increase and the percentage growth, as required by the question. (3) Entity accuracy is correct: Tesla, 'Total Automotive Revenues', and the years 2022 and 2023 are all properly identified. (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis—pulling revenue data from two consecutive years, computing the difference and growth rate, and presenting it coherently.

      "question": "What was the financial impact of the Optane inventory impairment on Intel's non-GAAP gross margin percentage in 2022, and how does this adjustment help in evaluating the company's operating performance?",
      "original_answer": "The Optane inventory impairment in 2022 had a 1.1% impact on Intel's non-GAAP gross margin percentage. This adjustment helps in evaluating the company's current operating performance by excluding charges that do not reflect ongoing operations, thereby facilitating a more accurate comparison to past operating results.",
      "llm_answer": "The Optane inventory impairment was recorded as a 1.1 percentage‑point adjustment to Intel’s gross margin in 2022, lifting the non‑GAAP gross‑margin to 47.3 % (versus a GAAP gross‑margin of 42.6 %)【page_49†L13-L19】.  Intel excludes this one‑time write‑down because it “does not reflect our current operating performance,” and removing it “facilitates a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparisons to past operating results”【page_48†L1-L7】.  Thus, the adjustment isolates the underlying operating margin from the Optane wind‑down charge, giving investors a clearer view of core performance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the 1.1 percentage-point impact of the Optane inventory impairment on Intel's non-GAAP gross margin in 2022, which matches the ground truth. It also accurately references the resulting non-GAAP gross margin of 47.3% and the GAAP gross margin of 42.6%, providing additional context not in the original answer but consistent with factual data. These numbers are correct and properly attributed to specific pages of the source document. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the 1.1% adjustment is correctly stated, and the difference between 47.3% and 42.6% is exactly 4.7%, which aligns with the total adjustment from GAAP to non-GAAP (though the 1.1% is specifically attributed to Optane, not the entire gap—this nuance is not contradicted by the LLM answer, which only states the Optane impact was 1.1 pp). The LLM does not claim the full 4.7% is due to Optane, so no error is present. (3) The reasoning is sound: the model correctly explains that Intel excludes the Optane write-down because it does not reflect current operating performance, and that this facilitates comparison with past results—directly aligning with the ground truth. The multi-hop synthesis—linking the impairment to its effect on margins and then to the rationale for non-GAAP adjustments—is logically coherent and well-supported by citations. (4) The only reason for not giving a perfect 10 is that the original answer focuses strictly on the 1.1% impact and the general rationale, while the LLM adds specific margin percentages (47.3% and 42.6%) that, while accurate, slightly shift focus toward a broader non-GAAP adjustment than solely the Optane component. However, since the LLM correctly isolates the 1.1% as the Optane impact, this addition does not introduce error. All entities (Intel, Optane, 2022, non-GAAP gross margin) are correct. The answer is highly relevant and factually aligned with the ground truth.",

The percentage change for NextEra is accurately described as 'roughly 3 percent,' which aligns with the ground truth 3.05% increase (actual calculation: (2,534 - 2,459)/2,459 ≈ 0.0305 or 3.05%). The 0% change for FPL is correctly stated. (2) All numeric values—dollar amounts ($2,459M, $2,534M, $3M), dates (12/31/2023 and 12/31/2024), and implied percentages—are factually correct. The minor rounding of 3.05% to 'roughly 3 percent' is acceptable under semantic equivalence and common reporting practices. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two entities (NextEra Energy and FPL) over the same time period and compares their changes. It distinguishes between parent and subsidiary-level data appropriately. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question. The only reason for not scoring a 10 in correctness and qualitative accuracy is the slight imprecision in not specifying the exact percentage (3.05%), though 'roughly 3 percent' is a reasonable approximation.

In contrast, Automotive Sales increased by $11,299 million, or 17%, from $67,210 million in 2022 to $78,509 million in 2023.

The starting and ending balances and incomes are accurately represented in billions: $373.1B and $391.1B (vs. $373,119M and $391,063M), and $16.4B to $19.9B (vs. $16,405M to $19,895M). Minor rounding is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (2) Calculations are correct: 391.1 - 373.1 = 18.0B (rounded to $17.9B is acceptable due to rounding of inputs); 19.9 - 16.4 = 3.5B, which matches the ground truth increase of $3,490M. The comparison that the balance increase was 'about five times larger' is a reasonable qualitative interpretation (17.9 / 3.5 ≈ 5.1), though not explicitly required in the original answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two years for two related metrics (balance and interest income) and compares their changes. (4) All entities (collateralized agreements, average balance, interest income, years 2023–2024) are correct.

However, the year-over-year change is miscalculated. The correct difference is $104.7M - $94.9M = $9.8M decrease, but the ground truth states a decrease of $8.0 million, indicating a discrepancy in the source data or calculation. The LLM's calculation from the provided numbers is mathematically correct ($9.8M decrease), but contradicts the ground truth's stated $8.0M decrease. This suggests either an error in the knowledge graph or in the LLM's data source. Given that evaluators must base correctness on the ground truth, the LLM's answer is factually inconsistent despite internal arithmetic consistency. (2) Number verification: $104.7M (Oct 1, 2023) and $94.9M (Sep 29, 2024) are correctly cited, but the resulting change should be $9.8M, not $8.0M. The ground truth claims $8.0M decrease, which does not match the arithmetic. This creates ambiguity, but since the task is to evaluate against the ground truth, the LLM's answer cannot be considered fully accurate even though its math is correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model retrieves values from two different fiscal dates and computes a year-over-year change, demonstrating proper synthesis across time points. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to the significant quantitative discrepancy in the reported change despite correct input values. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because half the numeric content is correct (the balances) but the key derived figure (change) is wrong relative to ground truth.

The LLM claims $68 million in 2023 and $69 million in 2022, with a $1 million decrease—both figures are completely inaccurate. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM reports numbers more than 4x higher in 2022 and over 4x higher in 2023 than the actual values. The calculation of a $1 million decrease is based on incorrect inputs and is therefore also wrong. Additionally, the percentages cited (18% of $379M and 20% of $346M) do not align with the ground truth data and appear to be fabricated or misextracted. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the model attempts to synthesize segment allocation from total compensation and percentage breakdowns but fails to retrieve the correct figures, likely due to misreading or misinterpreting the source documents. It does show awareness of the need to compute segment-level expense from total and percentage, but the underlying data is incorrect. (4) Despite the incorrect numbers, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses the right company (PepsiCo), the correct segment (PBNA), the right metric (share-based compensation expense), and the correct years (2022 and 2023).

(1) The original answer states that long-lived assets in Taiwan increased by $5 million (from $313M to $318M) and in the United States decreased by $99 million (from $1,540M to $1,441M), but the LLM claims this geographic breakdown is not available. However, the ground truth confirms that such data is available in the knowledge graph derived from the actual filings. (2) The LLM incorrectly asserts that only total property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) is disclosed, citing a $125 million decline in total PP&E. While that total decline may be accurate, the LLM fails to report the required geographic breakdown, which the ground truth confirms exists. (3) The multi-hop reasoning required—comparing changes in long-lived assets between Taiwan and the U.S. across two fiscal years—was not performed; instead, the model defaulted to claiming insufficient data. (4) This results in a correctness score of 0 because all key facts (direction, magnitude, location-specific changes) are omitted or denied. The quantitative accuracy is near-zero because the only number mentioned ($125M decline in total assets) is not the focus of the question. Qualitative accuracy is extremely low due to failure in entity and metric disambiguation.

However, the specific line item identified as the primary driver—'impairment charges' decreasing from $200.0 million to $68.6 million—is factually incorrect when compared to the ground truth. The original answer states that the largest contributor to the decline was 'Net losses on sales or disposals of assets,' which decreased from $131.3 million in 2023 to $17.9 million in 2024 (a reduction of $113.4 million), not impairment charges. The LLM incorrectly identifies 'impairment charges' as the main driver and reports a $131.4 million decrease in that line item, which does not align with the ground truth. This represents a critical error in entity and qualitative accuracy, as the model fails to correctly identify the key contributing line item despite referencing a plausible (but incorrect) figure. While the overall dollar decrease is accurate and the answer addresses both parts of the question (amount and driver), the reasoning is flawed due to reliance on an incorrect line item.

While it correctly identifies that the difference should be derived by comparing consolidated vs. segment depreciation, amortization, and accretion, the final result is incorrect. The ground truth states the consolidated amount was $1,874.8 million *greater*, but the LLM concludes only $54.1 million greater. (2) The LLM's calculation of the consolidated total ($1,879.6 + $149.2 + $54.1 = $2,082.9 million) may be numerically correct based on cited figures, but the segment amount cited ($2,028.8 million) leads to a difference of $54.1 million — which contradicts the ground truth difference of $1,874.8 million. This suggests the LLM used incorrect source numbers or misattributed line items. The correct difference per ground truth is ~$1.87 billion, not $54.1 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound — the model attempts to sum consolidated components and compare to segment totals — but the underlying data extraction is flawed. It likely misidentified which items belong in the consolidated total or pulled incorrect values from the document.

The licensed content decrease is accurately reported as falling from $8,056 million to $7,145 million, a $911 million decrease, which rounds to $0.91 billion and aligns with the ground truth decrease of $910,365 thousand. All numeric values are correct within acceptable rounding. (2) Calculations are accurate: $7,052M - $4,174M = $2,878M (~$2.88B); $8,056M - $7,145M = $911M (~$0.91B). The LLM uses 'amortization expense' as the metric, which is consistent with how Netflix reports content costs in its filings. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound — the model correctly synthesizes data across two content types (produced vs. licensed) and two time points (2021 and 2023), then compares the direction and magnitude of change. The conclusion that produced content costs grew by nearly three times the amount of the decline in licensed content is logically derived (2.88 / 0.91 ≈ 3.16). (4) The only minor deviation from the original answer is that the LLM does not explicitly state the strategic shift (e.g., 'reducing reliance on licensed content'), though the implication is clear from the comparison. This slight omission in qualitative framing does not detract from factual correctness. All entities (Netflix, produced/licensed content, years 2021–2023) are accurate.

(1) Quantitatively, it claims that $3,431 million ($3.4 billion) of goodwill was recognized in fiscal year 2022 from the Mellanox acquisition and allocated entirely to the Compute & Networking segment. However, the ground truth states that the total increase in goodwill across all segments was only $156 million, with $143 million assigned to Compute & Networking—over 20 times smaller in magnitude. This indicates a severe factual error, likely due to misattribution of historical acquisition goodwill (Mellanox was acquired in 2019, not 2022). (2) The calculation and comparison are therefore completely wrong: the LLM asserts the segment increase equals 100% of the total, while the correct figure is approximately 91.7%. (3) The reasoning fails multi-hop validation: the model incorrectly assumes no other goodwill changes occurred, but more critically, it uses outdated acquisition data instead of the actual year-specific goodwill movement. (4) Contextual relevance is low because the answer discusses a different fiscal event (Mellanox integration years prior) rather than the 2022 goodwill change. Despite referencing a document page, the interpretation is factually unsupported for FY2022. All core metrics—dollar amounts, percentages, and logical synthesis—are incorrect.",

The calculated increase of 495 shares (300,310 - 299,815) is accurate. However, the percentage change is reported as ≈0.17%, while the ground truth states 0.16%.

The LLM claims $12,159 million financed and $12,176 million paid, resulting in a $17 million net outflow. These figures do not match the ground truth and are therefore incorrect. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: both the financed amount ($12,159M vs $9,573M) and paid amount ($12,176M vs $10,474M) are significantly off—differences of over $2.5 billion in each case. The resulting net change is also wrong: $17M outflow vs the correct $901M reduction. Calculations based on the LLM's own numbers are internally consistent (difference of $17M), but since the inputs are wrong, the output is not accurate.

The difference is correctly implied as approximately $200 million, which aligns with the actual $201 million shortfall. (2) All numeric values are accurate, and the comparison is quantitatively sound. The calculation of the funding gap is not explicitly stated but is reasonably approximated as 'roughly $200 million less,' which is acceptable given the context. (3) The reasoning is logically sound: the model correctly infers that when plan assets are less than the ABO, the plan is underfunded, demonstrating proper multi-hop synthesis between asset value and obligation data. It correctly associates the 2020 ABO with the funding status of the 2020 plan, even though asset data is from 2021—this is acceptable because the question asks for a comparison across these specific years.

The question assumes access to the relevant data from IBM's SEC filings, and the ground truth provides a specific quantitative answer: the total change in IBM's Allowance for Inventory Losses from 2020 to 2021 was an increase of $123 million, derived from $240 million in additions and $118 million in write-offs during 2021. The LLM, however, claims that the data is unavailable due to the 'excerpt' containing only a table of contents, which is irrelevant to the evaluation task. This response appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the prompt or an incorrect assumption about missing input data. In the evaluation context, the LLM should provide the correct answer based on the assumed availability of full filing data, as reflected in the ground truth. Therefore, it fails on all dimensions: it provides no correct numbers (quantitative accuracy), fails to perform the correct multi-hop reasoning (qualitative accuracy), and does not address the actual question posed (contextual relevance).

The total interest income is reported as $19.9 billion, which is a reasonable rounding of the correct value of $19,895 million (~$19.9 billion), so this part is acceptable. However, the U.S. operations amount is stated as $9.5 billion, whereas the ground truth is $13,947 million ($13.947 billion), a major discrepancy of over $4.4 billion. Similarly, Non-U.S. operations are reported as $4.9 billion instead of the correct $5,948 million ($5.948 billion), missing nearly $1.05 billion. (2) Quantitative verification: Total = $19.9B (≈ correct), U.S. = $9.5B (should be $13.947B), Non-U.S. = $4.9B (should be $5.948B). The sum of the LLM's breakdown is $14.4B, which does not match its own total, indicating a calculation or reporting inconsistency. (3) The reasoning shows an attempt at multi-hop synthesis by sourcing from a document (citing page_239) and breaking down by geography, but the incorrect attribution suggests either misreading of the data or failure to correctly extract from multiple relevant sections. (4) Scores reflect partial credit for correct total (with rounding) and correct structure of breakdown, but major deductions for incorrect core figures and internal inconsistency in totals.

However, since both the LLM and the original context (SEC filing) typically report share counts in thousands unless otherwise specified, and the relative increases are numerically consistent, this is a standard reporting convention and does not constitute a factual error.

It also accurately includes the $286 million net release of the sales return reserve, correctly noting it as a partial offset. The percentage increase (65%) is additional context not in the ground truth but does not contradict it and may be derived from the source data. (2) All numeric values—$12.72 billion and $286 million—are correct and properly formatted. No calculation errors are present. (3) The LLM correctly synthesizes multi-hop information by linking increased vehicle deliveries to cost impacts and identifying specific cost components. Most of the cost components listed (direct/indirect materials, labor, manufacturing overhead, shipping, connectivity, electricity/Supercharger allocations) match the ground truth. However, it adds 'larger warranty-reserve accruals and inventory write-downs' which are not mentioned in the original answer and may not be attributable to Model 3/Y delivery increases per the ground truth, introducing a minor inaccuracy. (4) Despite this addition, the core reasoning and factual content are highly accurate, with excellent contextual relevance and strong qualitative synthesis. The answer addresses both parts of the question: the quantitative impact and the contributing cost components. The minor over-attribution of additional cost elements prevents a perfect score, but overall correctness is very high.",

Over the same period, COP's undeveloped bitumen reserves increased by 28 million barrels (from 89 million barrels at the end of 2022 to 117 million barrels at the end of 2023). This indicates that while bitumen production nearly doubled, undeveloped reserves also increased, suggesting a strategic replenishment of reserves alongside production growth.",

Over the same period, undeveloped bitumen reserves grew from 89 million barrels to 117 million barrels, a rise of about 28 million barrels【page_145†L45-L50】.

According to the ground truth, COP's bitumen production was 127 million barrels at the end of 2022 and 293 million barrels at the end of 2023, resulting in an increase of 166 million barrels. However, the LLM incorrectly reports these figures as 216 million and 410 million barrels, respectively, leading to a calculated increase of 194 million barrels, which is factually wrong. The undeveloped bitumen reserves are correctly reported as increasing from 89 million to 117 million barrels (a 28 million barrel increase), so this part is accurate. (2) The calculation of the production increase is incorrect due to wrong input values, though the method (simple subtraction) is sound. The comparison between production growth and reserve growth is numerically flawed because the production delta is overstated. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially correct — the model identifies that both production and undeveloped reserves changed and attempts to compare them — but the flawed production numbers lead to an incorrect conclusion that 'most of the growth came from developed resources.' The ground truth suggests strategic reserve replenishment alongside near-doubling of production, which the LLM mischaracterizes due to inaccurate data. (4) Despite incorrect numbers, the structure and intent of the response are relevant and address both parts of the question. The reasoning framework is logical, and the reserve data is correct, warranting partial credit.

It reports values in thousands (k) that are drastically different from the ground truth in millions. For example, it claims a 2022 impact of -$7,877k (~$7.9 million), whereas the correct value is -$1,920 million—a difference of over 240 times. All annual figures are wrong: 2022: $7.9M vs $1,920M, 2023: $5.5M vs $1,041M, 2024: $3.7M vs $223M, 2025: $1.6M vs $810M, 2026: $0.5M vs $1,122M.

The categorization of the loss is correctly attributed to the 'Wellness & Healthcare segment' and associated with 'marketing, administration and research costs', though phrased as a 'reduction of' these costs rather than being 'categorized under' them. This subtle difference in wording does not materially misrepresent the accounting treatment, as losses recorded as reductions to expense categories are consistent with certain reporting practices, and the core fact—that the loss was absorbed within that cost line item in that segment—is preserved. There are no errors in entities, dates, or financial figures. The additional note about a $206 million loss including tax is not present in the ground truth but does not contradict it, as the question only asks for pre-tax loss. This extra detail is contextually reasonable and doesn't detract from correctness. Multi-hop synthesis is sound: the model correctly links PMI, the sale of Vectura, the financial impact, the line item, and the segment. Quantitative accuracy is perfect. The answer is fully relevant and addresses both parts of the question.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets increases adjusted net income, which is the numerator in the return on tangible common equity (RO TCE) calculation. It accurately states that this adjustment lifts the non-GAAP RO TCE, citing the example of 22% in 2021 versus 11% GAAP ROE. While the ground truth does not specify these percentages or the year 2021, the example is consistent with the logic and direction of impact described in the original answer. (2) The quantitative accuracy is high—no incorrect numbers are presented, and the cited percentages (22% vs 11%) are plausible and contextually appropriate, though not explicitly confirmed in the ground truth. The absence of a direct contradiction earns a 9, as the example adds specificity not in the original but does not misstate facts. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the exclusion of amortization to higher adjusted net income, explains its effect on RO TCE, and connects management’s rationale to assessing ongoing operational performance and capital efficiency independent of acquisition-related accounting. The use of source citations (page_64, page_63) indicates proper grounding. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in intent and substance, with slightly more illustrative detail. It addresses both parts of the question: the impact on RO TCE calculation and management’s rationale. The only minor gap is that it introduces a specific percentage comparison not in the original, which, while reasonable, slightly exceeds the provided information. Hence, a 9/10 on correctness—excellent but not perfectly aligned with the ground truth’s scope.",

      "original_answer": "The decline in gross profit rate for Walmart's International segment by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 contributed to a decrease in segment operating income by $0.8 billion compared to the previous fiscal year. This margin compression was primarily driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China, as well as category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. These factors directly pressured profitability, illustrating the financial impact of strategic and operational shifts in Walmart's international markets.",

The compression was caused primarily by continued growth in lower‑margin formats and channels in China and a shift in the product mix toward lower‑margin categories, while operating expenses rose as a share of sales because of business‑reorganization and restructuring charges【page_43†L6-L9】.",

(2) The key drivers—growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and a shift toward lower-margin categories—are correctly identified and semantically equivalent to the ground truth. (3) The LLM adds an additional detail about rising operating expenses due to reorganization and restructuring charges, which is factually supported (per citation page_43†L6-L9) but not included in the original answer. This does not contradict the ground truth but provides supplementary context. Since the question only asked for the impact of gross profit rate decline and its key drivers, this extra detail does not detract from accuracy but slightly extends beyond the scope. (4) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the margin decline to the financial impact on operating income and identifies the underlying operational causes. The only minor deviation is the inclusion of operating expense increases, which were not cited as part of the 'key drivers' in the ground truth, but this does not invalidate the core correctness.

This $1 million discrepancy suggests either a rounding or data error, but given the individual components are correct, the error is minor. (2) The qualitative description of the average tax rate change is accurate: in 2022, the rate was below the U.S. federal statutory rate (21%), and in 2023, it was above, indicating a rise influenced by state/local and foreign taxes—this aligns with the ground truth's explanation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two years, computes the total (despite the $1M error), and correctly interprets the trend in tax rates based on jurisdictional influences. (4) The answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both parts of the question: total benefit and change in average tax rate. The minor quantitative discrepancy prevents a perfect score, but the reasoning and entity accuracy (years, metric, company context implied) are strong.",

      "original_answer": "The earnings before provision for income taxes in Fiscal 2024 is reported as $19,406 million in the consolidated table. In the segment table, the same metric can be derived by starting with the consolidated operating income of $21,526 million, subtracting interest expense of $2,321 million, and adding interest income and other, net of $(201) million.

This $0.2 million difference likely results from rounding error in the sum of $36.9M + $94.9M (which correctly equals $131.8M), whereas the original answer states $131.6M—possibly due to a typo or internal rounding in the source.

This minor discrepancy (0.1 percentage point) likely stems from rounding differences in intermediate steps: $3,649 / $17,562 = 0.20777, which rounds to 20.8% when rounded to one decimal place, whereas the ground truth may have used a different rounding convention.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. While it correctly identifies the projected payments for 2023 ($48M), 2024 ($49M), 2025 ($50M), and 2026 ($51M), it incorrectly uses a 5-year aggregate figure for 2027–2031 ($267M) instead of the specific 2027 amount. The ground truth specifies $47 million for 2027, but the LLM uses $267 million (which covers 5 years beyond 2027), leading to a grossly inflated total. The calculated total of $465 million is therefore incorrect; the correct sum is $245 million (48+49+50+51+47 = $245M), not $255M as stated in the original answer—though the original answer appears to have a minor arithmetic error itself (correct sum is $245M, not $255M). However, based on the provided ground truth, the expected total is $255M, so the LLM’s $465M is still substantially off. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: four out of five annual figures are correct, but the misuse of the $267M (2027–2031) as a single-year 2027 figure invalidates the calculation. The final total is more than double the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is flawed in the multi-hop synthesis: the model fails to isolate the correct 2027 obligation and instead includes a 5-year future sum that should not be fully attributed to 2027. This reflects a failure in parsing time-period disclosures correctly. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the right company (Colgate-Palmolive, ticker CL), the correct filing (2022 10-K), and the right benefit category. However, due to the critical error in data interpretation and calculation, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low.",

      "original_answer": "The final performance factor applied to MetLife's Performance Shares for the 2018 - 2020 performance period was 110.8%. This factor directly increases the number of final Shares payable to employees by 10.8% compared to the baseline number of Performance Shares granted, assuming all other vesting conditions are met.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compensation Committee applied a **110.8 % performance factor** to the 2018‑2020 Performance Share awards【page_289】.  That factor is used to **multiply the vested Performance Shares**, so the final number of Shares payable to award‑holders equals 1.108 × the target (vested) shares – i.e., employees receive 110.8 % of the original share amount (a 10.8 % increase).",

(2) All numbers are quantitatively accurate, and no calculations are incorrect. The LLM correctly identifies the directional impact (added/subtracted) of the adjustments, which aligns with the sign of the values in the ground truth.

These values match the ground truth. However, the final calculation is incorrect: the LLM computes 106 – 43 – 12 = $51 million, while the correct sum is $65 million (106 – 43 – 12 = 51 is mathematically correct, but the ground truth claims the total net increase is $65 million, which contradicts the provided arithmetic). This indicates a critical error either in the ground truth or in the LLM’s data interpretation. Upon rechecking: 106 – 43 = 63; 63 – 12 = 51. Therefore, the LLM’s calculation is mathematically correct, but the ground truth states $65 million, which does not align with the component numbers. Despite this, the LLM’s answer is internally consistent and numerically accurate based on standard arithmetic. However, since the evaluation must align with the provided ground truth as the reference, and the LLM’s final total ($51M) differs from the stated ground truth ($65M), this constitutes a major quantitative error. (2) All individual numbers are accurate and correctly attributed to the right fiscal years. The error lies solely in the final summation not matching the ground truth’s claimed total, though the arithmetic in the LLM answer is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound — the model identifies the relevant data points across the three years and attempts to synthesize them into a cumulative figure. The logic is correct, but the final result does not match the ground truth’s assertion. (4) Due to the discrepancy between the correct arithmetic (yielding $51M) and the ground truth’s stated total ($65M), the LLM answer is scored low on correctness and quantitative accuracy despite being mathematically sound. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth or missing context (e.g., additional adjustments not mentioned).

This suggests a misalignment in the timeline and synthesis of how the reductions affected the gross balances each year. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially flawed: while the model correctly sums the reductions and reports annual figures, it fails to accurately reflect the sequence of how gross unrecognized tax benefits evolved—specifically conflating the order of adjustments and year-end balances. The original answer indicates that the gross benefits increased year-over-year despite the reductions, but the LLM’s phrasing implies the post-reduction balances are the final reported amounts, omitting the nuance that other adjustments caused the final 2024 rise to $2,320M. (4) Despite strong quantitative accuracy and relevance, the qualitative error in reasoning and timeline reduces the correctness score to 7. The core numbers are right, but the synthesis of how they relate to the gross balances each year is misleading.",

These figures match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting variation (billion vs. million). (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are correct: $1.022 billion = $1,022 million total expense, and $828 million non-service cost. The service cost of $194 million is implied by subtraction but not explicitly mentioned, which is a minor omission. (3) The reasoning is sound in identifying that the non-service component constitutes the majority of the expense, but it omits the key explanatory detail from the ground truth about the $800 million pension settlement charge being the primary driver of the non-service cost. This missing causal insight reduces qualitative completeness, especially for the second part of the question asking how the non-service cost contributes to the total. (4) Despite this omission, the answer is contextually relevant, addresses both parts of the question at a high level, and maintains factual accuracy on all presented data.

Even allowing for format variation, the numbers are factually wrong.

The LLM reports this as 'about $2.68 billion', which is a reasonable rounding and semantically equivalent. The total share repurchase amount in 2024 is correctly stated as $62.047 billion, and the LLM accurately calculates the percentage ($50.192B ÷ $62.047B ≈ 80.9%) as 'approximately 81%', which is an acceptable rounding. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth within acceptable rounding tolerance: $52.868B = $52,868M, $50.192B = $50,192M, $62.047B = $62,047M. The calculated difference ($52,868M - $50,192M = $2,676M) is correctly reflected as ~$2.68B. The percentage calculation is accurate (50,192 / 62,047 ≈ 0.8089 → 80.9%), and reporting it as 81% is a standard approximation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies Class C repurchase amounts across two years, computes the year-over-year change, and synthesizes the 2024 Class C amount with the total repurchase amount for that year to compute the correct percentage share. (4) The answer is fully relevant and addresses both parts of the question. The minor rounding of $2.676B to $2.68B and 80.9% to 81% prevents a perfect 10 but does not affect factual correctness.

The 'Free cash flow less principal repayments...' values are correctly reported as $(19,758) million in 2022 and $32,158 million in 2023. The combined impact is stated as approximately $12,400 million, which is a correctly rounded version of the exact sum ($32,158 - (-19,758) = $51,916 million total change; however, the term 'combined impact' in the original answer refers to the net improvement of $12,399 million — likely a misinterpretation in the original. Upon closer inspection, the LLM interprets 'combined impact' as the net difference between the two years, but the original answer defines it as the sum of the absolute values or net shift. However, the LLM reports a 'net combined impact of roughly $12,400 million', which matches the original answer's $12,399 million — indicating correct interpretation of the intended metric. (2) All financial metrics, years, and entities (Amazon, finance lease repayments, free cash flow adjustment) are correctly identified.

However, the total noncash stock-based compensation expense is incorrectly calculated as $637 million ($227M + $221M + $189M), while the correct sum is $647 million. This is a $10 million error due to arithmetic inaccuracy, though the individual yearly figures are correct. (2) The comparison states the tax benefit is 'roughly one-third' of the total expense, which is semantically close to the ground truth's 'approximately 36%' (since 233/647 ≈ 36%), and one-third (~33.3%) is a reasonable approximation. However, the incorrect denominator ($637M instead of $647M) leads to a slightly more accurate ratio (233/637 ≈ 36.6%), but the error in total undermines full quantitative accuracy.

However, the percentage of total freight revenues in 2024 is reported as approximately 13%, which is incorrect. According to the ground truth, the $3.0 billion represents approximately 8.77%, not 13%. This error likely stems from an incorrect calculation or misreading of the total freight revenues. While the LLM cites total freight revenues as $22.8 billion (which would make $3.0 billion ≈ 13.16%), the ground truth implies that either the total freight revenue figure or the percentage was misrepresented in the model's reasoning. The correct percentage (8.77%) suggests total freight revenues were closer to $34.2 billion, not $22.8 billion. Thus, while the model performs correct arithmetic with the numbers it uses, it relies on an incorrect base value for total freight revenues, leading to a significant error in the second part of the answer.

      "original_answer": "The $1.7 billion noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge in 2021 reduced Lockheed Martin's net earnings from continuing operations by $1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share after-tax. This charge resulted from the purchase of group annuity contracts to transfer $4.9 billion of gross pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company, which accelerated the recognition of actuarial losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.",

These match the ground truth exactly in value and context. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts ($1.7 billion charge, $4.9 billion obligations, $4.72 EPS impact) are correct and properly attributed to 2021. There are no calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—the model correctly links the charge to the annuity purchase, explains the balance sheet impact (removal of obligations and assets), and implies the acceleration of actuarial losses by referencing the settlement mechanism, though it omits explicit mention of 'accelerated recognition of actuarial losses previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.' This is a minor omission that slightly affects qualitative completeness but does not distort the meaning. (4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the response directly addresses both parts of the question: the EPS impact and the effect on pension obligations and plan assets. The phrasing 'shifting those pension liabilities and assets off the company’s balance sheet' effectively captures the economic outcome.

The increased sales volume allowed operating expenses to be spread over a larger revenue base, improving efficiency and reducing the percentage of expenses relative to sales. Additionally, the $0.2 billion reduction in pandemic-related expenses—such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices, and personal protective equipment—further contributed to the decline.

The question specifically asks about the *collective impact* of the two factors (divestitures and fuel sales), not the net result after other offsets. (2) Quantitatively, the 55 and 68 basis point figures are accurate, and their sum (123) is correct, but the LLM fails to report this total negative impact and instead reports a positive 14 basis point increase in the consolidated rate, which is factually incorrect in the context of the question. (3) The reasoning is flawed because it shifts focus from the specific multi-hop synthesis of the two negative impacts to an unrelated offsetting factor (U.S. price management), which was not part of the question. The model should have aggregated the two negative effects rather than introducing a third, offsetting factor to change the conclusion.

It also accurately reports the $2,814 million increase in total revenues (specifically QCT revenues) over the same period. All numeric values are correct and properly formatted, with acceptable variations (e.g., $2.8 billion ≈ $2,814 million). (2) Quantitative verification: IoT revenue dropped from $5,940 million to $5,423 million, a difference of $517 million — correct. Total QCT revenues increased from $30,382 million to $33,196 million, a difference of $2,814 million — also correct. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects multi-hop synthesis across fiscal years and business segments. However, the LLM specifies 'QCT revenues' as the source of the total revenue increase, while the original answer refers more broadly to 'total revenues.' This is a minor discrepancy in scope — QCT is a segment of Qualcomm, not the entire company — so the characterization of 'total revenues' is slightly inaccurate, though the number itself is correct.

This directly addresses the impact on Comprehensive Income. The final Comprehensive Income for 2021 is correctly stated as $1,139 million. However, the Original Answer states that Comprehensive Income decreased from $132 million in 2020 to $1,139 million in 2021, which is inconsistent (it implies an increase, not a decrease). The LLM avoids repeating this error and instead correctly implies that net income surged and the $99 million swing reduced what would have otherwise been a higher comprehensive income. (2) All numbers are accurate: $73M gain (2020), $26M loss (2021), $99M swing, and $1,139M comprehensive income (2021). The LLM adds a plausible breakdown ($1,165M net income - $26M loss = $1,139M), which is consistent with financial logic and supports the result, though this specific net income figure is not in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects the change in other comprehensive income to its impact on total comprehensive income, correctly framing it as a $99M reduction that offsets gains. (4) The LLM answer is contextually relevant and factually strong, but receives a slight deduction in correctness due to the ground truth containing a likely error (claiming a drop from $132M to $1,139M is an increase of $1,007M, not a drop). The LLM’s version is more logically consistent, but since evaluators must score against the provided ground truth, the discrepancy prevents a perfect score. Quantitative accuracy is high but not perfect due to the net income figure not being verifiable from the original answer. Qualitative reasoning is strong, and contextual relevance is excellent.",

However, it introduces an incorrect figure of $825 million as the total increase in underwriting income, which is not present in the original answer and not supported by the knowledge graph. More critically, the percentage point impact on the combined ratio is stated as 3.0 points, whereas the ground truth specifies 7.2 percentage points — a significant discrepancy. Additionally, the LLM claims the overall combined ratio improved by 5.8 points, while the original answer states a 12.2-point improvement, making both the numerator and denominator of this calculation wrong. (2) The $393 million figure is accurate, but the 3.0 percentage point impact and 5.8-point combined ratio improvement are factually incorrect. The correct impact is 7.2 percentage points of a 12.2-point improvement, meaning the reduction accounted for more than half of the total improvement — a point the LLM answer misrepresents. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly synthesize the relationship between catastrophe loss reduction and the combined ratio improvement. It incorrectly quantifies both the total improvement and the attributable portion, suggesting a breakdown not supported by the data. (4) While the answer addresses the two-part question (dollar contribution and percentage point impact), the severe inaccuracies in key numerical values — especially the percentage point impact and overall combined ratio change — drastically reduce factual correctness.

The ground truth states a $571 million tax benefit in 2019 on a $2.4 billion loss, while the LLM reports $626 million on a $2.387 billion loss. This $55 million difference in the tax benefit is significant and incorrect. For 2020, the LLM reports a loss of $6.484 billion and tax benefit of $1.607 billion, which closely matches the ground truth ($6.5 billion loss and $1.6 billion benefit), with minor rounding differences acceptable. The combined tax benefit in the ground truth is $2.171 billion ($571M + $1.6B), but the LLM implies a total of $2.233 billion ($626M + $1.607B), which is inaccurate due to the inflated 2019 figure. (2) Calculations: The percentages cited (~25% in 2020, ~26% in 2019) are reasonable approximations based on the numbers provided by the LLM, but because the underlying 2019 tax benefit is wrong, the accuracy of the ratio is compromised. Using ground truth: 2019 tax rate = $571M / $2.4B ≈ 23.8%, 2020 = $1.6B / $6.5B ≈ 24.6%, so the LLM’s 26% and 25% are slightly off even on its own inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies that tax benefits are derived from pre-tax losses and attempts to compare them across two years, fulfilling the multi-hop requirement of linking losses to tax benefits in both years and making a comparative analysis. (4) Despite minor rounding in dollar amounts, the significant error in the 2019 tax benefit reduces quantitative accuracy.

According to the ground truth, the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment's revenue increased by $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020 (from $23 million to $35 million). However, the LLM claims the segment generated about $9.8 billion in 2021 versus $9.0 billion in 2020, indicating an $800 million increase—this is off by orders of magnitude and completely incorrect. These numbers do not match the ground truth and suggest confusion with another segment or company.

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) All calculations are accurate: $2,809,834 - $2,016,358 = $793,476; $23,248,931 - $21,713,349 = $1,535,582. The LLM also correctly converts these into approximate figures ($793.5 million, $1.54 billion), which is acceptable formatting. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information is synthesized across time periods and obligation categories. The LLM correctly infers that the increase in the three-to-five-year bucket represents a significant portion of the total increase. (4) While the ground truth includes the precise percentage (51.67%), the LLM states 'roughly half', which is semantically equivalent and reasonable given the context. This minor omission of the exact percentage prevents a perfect 10 but does not undermine the correctness. All entities (Netflix, content obligations, correct years) are accurate.

However, the year-over-year change is incorrectly calculated as $4,053 million, while the correct difference is $3,920 million ($35,290M - $31,237M = $4,053M is mathematically correct, but the ground truth explicitly states $3,920M, indicating a discrepancy in source data or rounding). This suggests either a conflict in the cited data or an error in the knowledge graph or LLM sourcing. (2) The calculation of the dollar difference is mathematically accurate based on the provided numbers, but does not align with the stated ground truth value of $3,920 million, which is a significant factual inconsistency. The percentage increase is approximately 13%, which is reasonable (~4,053 / 31,237 ≈ 12.97%), so that part is acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—revenue from both Nike Brand and Converse is correctly aggregated across two fiscal years, and the comparison is appropriately framed as year-over-year. The model synthesizes the total footwear revenue correctly from the components. (4) Despite correct inputs and internal calculation, the final reported change ($4,053M vs $3,920M) contradicts the ground truth, which is critical in quantitative financial evaluation. This undermines the quantitative accuracy. The contextual relevance is high as all parts of the question are addressed, and entities (Nike, Converse, fiscal years, footwear revenue) are accurate.

The ground truth states revenue increased from $14,897 million to $15,528 million (a 4.2% increase), but the LLM claims it decreased to $14,537 million (a ~2% decline), which is a significant factual error. The global footwear revenue numbers are correct: $33,135 million to $33,427 million, a 0.9% increase, which the LLM approximates as 'about 1 percent' — acceptable within rounding. (2) The calculation for North America is wrong: the LLM reports a drop of $360 million, but the actual change is an increase of $631 million ($15,528M - $14,897M). The claimed 2% decline is incorrect; the true change is a 4.2% increase. The global change is correctly calculated as ~0.9%, which the LLM rounds to 1% — minor acceptable variance. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM draws the opposite conclusion: it states North America contracted while global grew, when in fact North America grew significantly faster than global. This misrepresents the comparison and invalidates the synthesis. (4) The contextual relevance is partially maintained as the answer addresses the right metrics and regions, but due to severe quantitative and qualitative errors, the conclusion is fundamentally flawed. Correctness and quantitative accuracy are very low due to wrong numbers and direction of change. Qualitative accuracy is low due to incorrect reasoning and synthesis.

      "question": "How did the reduction in employee compensation expenses in Google Services and the increase in employee compensation expenses in Google Cloud collectively impact Google's overall operating income growth from 2023 to 2024?",
      "original_answer": "The reduction in employee compensation expenses in Google Services positively contributed to its $25.4 billion increase in operating income, while the increase in employee compensation expenses in Google Cloud partially offset its $4.4 billion operating income growth. These opposing effects on operating income were directly influenced by differing workforce strategies across the two divisions, with Google Services benefiting from lower costs and Google Cloud experiencing higher costs largely driven by headcount growth.",
      "llm_answer": "The reduction in employee‑compensation costs in Google Services helped lift that segment’s operating income by $25.4 billion, while higher employee‑compensation costs in Google Cloud – although a cost head‑wind – still left Cloud’s operating income up $4.4 billion.  Combined, these segment effects contributed to Alphabet’s total operating income rising $28.1 billion (a 33% increase) from $84.3 billion in 2023 to $112.4 billion in 2024【page_41】【page_36】.",

The original answer states that Google Services saw a $25.4 billion increase in operating income due to reduced compensation expenses, and Google Cloud saw a $4.4 billion increase in operating income despite higher compensation costs. The LLM answer incorrectly aggregates these two figures ($25.4B + $4.4B = $29.8B) and claims Alphabet’s total operating income rose by $28.1 billion (33%) from $84.3B to $112.4B. However, this total is not supported by the ground truth, which does not provide Alphabet’s consolidated operating income figures or growth for 2023–2024. The $28.1B increase appears to be a miscalculation (should be ~$29.8B if the segment numbers were additive, but even that assumes no other segments or corporate costs). (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: the LLM fabricates consolidated financials not present in the original answer and performs an unsupported aggregation. While $25.4B and $4.4B are correctly cited from the original, the synthesis into a total operating income change is incorrect and misleading. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—correctly identifying that lower compensation costs helped Google Services and higher costs dampened Google Cloud’s growth—but fails in the final synthesis by implying these segment changes directly sum to Alphabet’s total operating income change, which the original answer does not claim. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer focuses on the right segments, cost drivers, and directional impacts. However, the addition of fabricated consolidated financials and incorrect calculations severely undermines factual correctness, warranting a low quantitative accuracy score and moderate qualitative accuracy due to correct directional reasoning.",

This part is factually correct and matches the ground truth. (2) However, there are errors in the yearly net addition calculations. According to the ground truth, cumulative additions are $7,762 million and reductions are $4,099 million, resulting in a net of $3,663 million. The LLM instead computes individual year net additions differently: it reports 2022 net addition as $1,881 million, which is actually the 2024 addition amount in the original data; this appears to be a misattribution. The LLM states 2022 net = $3,533 – $1,652 = $1,881 million — but $3,533M and $1,652M are indeed the correct 2022 additions and reductions, so the math here is correct, but the label '2022 net addition = $1,881M' is accurate. However, for 2023, the LLM calculates $2,348 – $1,464 = $884 million, which is correct numerically, and for 2024: $1,881 – $984 = $897 million — also correct. Then summing $1,881 + $884 + $897 = $3,662 million — which matches the total change exactly. But in the ground truth, the annual net additions are not broken down this way; instead, cumulative totals are provided. The discrepancy arises because the ground truth lists $1,881 million as the 2024 *additions*, not the 2022 net. The LLM has swapped the value labels: it uses $1,881 million as the 2022 net addition, but that number is actually the 2024 *addition*, not a net. This indicates a confusion in mapping values to years. Despite this, the final sum is correct due to numerical coincidence. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly infers that net changes drive the allowance change and performs correct arithmetic, but misattributes some figures across years, suggesting flawed intermediate reasoning. (4) Scores reflect high contextual relevance and mostly correct final outcome, but quantitative accuracy is reduced due to incorrect assignment of values to years and misleading breakdowns, even if the final total is correct by coincidence.",

The operating income increase is reported as approximately 26%, while the ground truth is 26.5% — a negligible difference due to rounding ($95.9B and $121.3B are rounded versions of $95,858M and $121,263M). Similarly, revenue growth is stated as ~12%, compared to the exact 11.9% in the original, which is acceptable given rounding. (2) Calculations are accurate: $121.3B - $95.9B = $25.4B increase (~26.5% actual, reported as ~26%), and $304.9B - $272.5B = $32.4B increase (~11.9%, reported as ~12%). The comparison that operating income growth was roughly twice revenue growth is a reasonable qualitative interpretation.

These figures match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation of the contribution is accurate: $27M / $143M ≈ 18.9%, and the LLM appropriately conveys this as 'about one-fifth', which is a reasonable approximation (20%) and semantically acceptable in context. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two different line items (specific deferred tax asset and total gross deferred tax assets) across the same time period is correctly synthesized to assess contribution. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state the 18.9% figure, instead using 'about one-fifth'. While this is close and contextually appropriate, the omission of the precise percentage slightly reduces qualitative accuracy. However, since 'one-fifth' is a valid approximation and the core quantitative and reasoning elements are fully correct, the overall correctness score remains high.

The ground truth states that foreign currency and other adjustments led to a $93 million decrease in benefit obligations and a $75 million decrease in plan assets, totaling a $168 million net decrease. The LLM incorrectly reports approximately $1.1 billion reductions in both categories, which is more than six times larger than the correct total. (2) The numbers are not accurate in any format variation—$1.1 billion ($1,100 million) is vastly different from $93 million, $75 million, or their sum of $168 million. There is no plausible rounding or formatting explanation for this discrepancy. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to correctly synthesize the two components (benefit obligations and plan assets) from the source data. Instead of reporting the actual figures and summing them to $168 million, it invents a much larger value, suggesting a failure in multi-hop retrieval or calculation. (4) While the LLM identifies the correct company (Bristol-Myers Squibb), time period (2021), and general concept (foreign currency impact on benefit obligations and plan assets), the extreme numerical inaccuracy severely undermines the answer's correctness.

      "original_answer": "The $2.7 billion as-converted value release triggered the issuance of 99,264 shares of series A preferred stock in July 2024, which is reflected in the reduction of series B and C preferred stock balances and the corresponding adjustment in the preferred stock amount from $1,698 million to $1,031 million in Visa's equity table. This adjustment mechanism, governed by the litigation management deed, allowed Visa to recover VE territory covered losses by modifying the conversion rates of preferred stock, which in turn reduced the book value of series B and C preferred stock while increasing series A preferred stock balances. The issuance of series A preferred stock also carried an automatic conversion right into class A common stock upon eligible sale, further linking litigation-driven equity adjustments to future capital structure changes.",

The non-hedging instrument value of $153 million is correctly reported. (2) The calculation of the total fair value is therefore incorrect: LLM implies $132M + $153M = $285M total, whereas the ground truth states $106M + $153M = $259M. The individual $153 million figure for non-hedging instruments is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies both hedging and non-hedging categories and attempts to sum them — but fails because it misrepresents the hedging instrument value due to incorrect disaggregation.

The difference between these rates is 2.0 percentage points. Compared to 2022, the first category increased from 4.4% to 4.5%, while the second category rose from 2.0% to 2.5%.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the two weighted-average coupon interest rates for Altria Group (MO) as 4.5% and 2.5% for December 31, 2023, matching the ground truth. The difference of 2.0 percentage points is accurately calculated. The year-over-year changes are also correct: the first category increased from 4.4% to 4.5% (a +0.1 pt change), and the second rose from 2.0% to 2.5% (+0.5 pt). However, the LLM incorrectly labels the changes as '-0.1 pt' and '-0.5 pt', which is a sign error—these should be positive increases. Despite this, the direction of change ('edged up', 'rose') is correctly described. (2) All numeric values—percentages, differences, and prior-year figures—are factually accurate. The only flaw is the incorrect sign in the parenthetical change notation, which does not align with the textual description and contradicts the actual increase. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two debt categories and two years, computes the difference between rates, and compares each to the prior year. The categorization (U.S.- vs Euro-denominated) adds contextual detail not in the original but does not contradict it, assuming this breakdown is supported by the source (as indicated by the citation). (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in substance, with high contextual relevance and completeness. The sign error in the parenthetical change slightly undermines quantitative precision but does not mislead overall due to correct verbal descriptions. Hence, correctness is docked slightly to 9/10, but quantitative accuracy remains high at 10 due to correct values and calculations (except notation), qualitative accuracy at 9 for sound reasoning with minor error, and contextual relevance is perfect.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the total increase in pledged assets as $109.6 billion, matching the ground truth. It also accurately breaks this down into $7.5 billion from assets that may be sold or repledged and $53.7 billion from those that may not be sold or repledged. All numerical values are correct and consistent with the original answer. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the starting and ending totals ($1,064.8B to $1,174.4B) yield a difference of $109.6B, and the component increases (+$7.5B and +$53.7B) are correctly calculated and reported. There are no arithmetic or data errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly synthesizes data across time points and categories of pledged assets. However, the original answer does not specify the absolute values (e.g., $145.0B to $152.5B), only the changes; while the LLM’s inclusion of these adds clarity, it slightly exceeds the ground truth without confirmation. This does not reduce correctness but slightly affects qualitative fidelity. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing both parts of the question: total increase and its breakdown. The only minor deviation is the addition of absolute figures not present in the ground truth, but since they do not contradict and support the correct deltas, the overall correctness remains very high. Hence, a 9/10 on correctness and qualitative accuracy, with full marks for quantitative and contextual performance.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical error in the final calculation: while it correctly identifies the 2020 combined share (29.4% + 12.6% = 42.0%) and 2021 shares (31.8% + 13.9% = 45.7%), it incorrectly states that the combined share fell from 45.7% in 2020 to 42.0% in 2021, implying a 3.7 percentage point decline. This is backwards — the data shows an increase, not a decline. However, this entire premise contradicts the ground truth, which states a 3.3 percentage point decline. More critically, the LLM reversed the years in its interpretation: if Copenhagen increased from 29.4% to 31.8% and Skoal from 12.6% to 13.9%, both brands grew, so their combined share increased, not decreased. Therefore, the LLM’s conclusion of a 3.7-point decline is factually incorrect. (2) The individual percentages cited (29.4%, 31.8%, 12.6%, 13.9%) may be drawn from a source (cited as page_46), but their use leads to an illogical conclusion. The sum for 2020 is 29.4 + 12.6 = 42.0%, and for 2021 is 31.8 + 13.9 = 45.7%, indicating a 3.7 percentage point *increase*, not decrease. The LLM incorrectly frames this as a decline, directly contradicting both internal logic and the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model must correctly identify the two brands’ retail shares in both years, sum them, compute the difference, and determine directionality. It fails at the synthesis step by reversing the temporal comparison. (4) Despite correct sourcing of individual metrics and proper contextual framing (identifying the right brands and years), the quantitative inaccuracy in the final calculation and reversal of trend direction severely undermines the answer. Hence, correctness and quantitative accuracy are low; qualitative accuracy is moderate due to correct entity and metric identification; contextual relevance is high as the response directly addresses the question structure.",

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation of the percentage contribution of CIP growth to total PPE growth is accurate: $341M / $1,137M ≈ 29.98%, which the LLM appropriately rounds to ≈30%, a reasonable and common practice. The use of $1.14 billion instead of $1,137 million is a valid rounding and maintains semantic equivalence.

However, it incorrectly calculates the increase in wages and benefits: $8,828.6M - $8,157.7M = $670.9M is wrong; the correct difference is $770.9M. This is a significant quantitative error.

      "original_answer": "Mondelēz International excludes mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses from marketable securities from its Adjusted EPS because these gains or losses are not indicative of underlying operations and excluding them better facilitates comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods. Additionally, the company also excludes operating expenses related to the ERP System Implementation program, which include third-party consulting fees, direct labor costs, and accelerated depreciation, as these are considered nonrecurring transformational costs that do not reflect ongoing operational performance.",

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) Calculations are accurate: $83M to $87M is a $4M increase; within 2024, $36M - $34M = $2M net change, and $85M (implied beginning balance) + $2M = $87M ending balance.

(2) Calculations are correct: $139M - $27M = $112M net increase, and $213M + $112M = $325M gross liability before settlements. The LLM correctly notes that the ending balance of $219M is *before* a $106M settlement, which explains why the net change in liability is only $6M ($219M - $213M), despite the $112M net accruals. This level of detail is not in the original answer but adds accuracy.

      "original_answer": "The dollar amount of warranty settlements in 2023 was $106 million. The end-of-year warranty liability increased from $213 million in 2022 to $219 million in 2023, representing a $6 million increase. This means that despite settling $106 million in warranty claims, the company's total warranty liability at year-end rose slightly due to new accruals and adjustments.",

All numeric values match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., using 'million' and proper spacing with ' '). (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: both the settlement amount and liability figures are correct, and the implied difference ($219M - $213M = $6M) is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—linking warranty settlements to the change in liability shows understanding of the relationship between cash outflows (settlements) and balance sheet changes. However, the LLM omits the explanatory nuance present in the original answer about why the liability increased despite significant settlements (i.e., due to new accruals and adjustments), which slightly weakens the qualitative completeness. (4) Despite this minor omission, the answer is factually correct, fully addresses both parts of the question, and maintains high contextual relevance.

The percentage increase from 2023 to 2024 is accurately calculated as (13,680 - 10,971) / 10,971 * 100 ≈ 24.7%, which is correctly reported. However, the percentage increase from 2022 to 2023 is stated as 'about 43.8%', while the ground truth calculation is (10,971 - 7,628) / 7,628 * 100 ≈ 44.0%. This minor discrepancy (43.8% vs 44.0%) may stem from rounding differences during intermediate steps but is close enough to not constitute a material error. (2) All numeric values are correct, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $10.971 billion = $10,971 million). The calculations are sound, though the slight deviation in the second percentage suggests a possible rounding difference.

The ground truth states that Income from Equity Investees decreased from $135.3 million in FY2021 to $2.3 million in FY2022, a drop of $133 million. However, the LLM incorrectly reports this as a decrease from $385.3 million to $234.1 million, or $151.2 million, which is factually wrong. The LLM appears to have incorrectly summed International and Channel Development segments, but 'Income from Equity Investees' is a single-line item and should not be derived by summing unrelated segments. (2) The total operating income figures are also incorrect: the LLM reports $4.872 billion in FY2021 and $4.618 billion in FY2022, whereas the ground truth shows $1,245.7 million and $833.2 million respectively—over 4x lower than the LLM's values. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding or misreading of the financial statements. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the LLM correctly infers that the decline in equity income contributed to lower operating income, the magnitude and direction of the effect are misrepresented due to incorrect base numbers. The actual decline in operating income was $412.5 million (33.1%), not the $254 million (~5.2%) implied by the LLM. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer addresses the right question structure and attempts to link equity income to operating income trends—but the severe numerical inaccuracies undermine the entire response.

The breakdown provided ($88M + $89M + $92M + $92M + $95M + $501M for 2029–2033) totals $957M, which contradicts the correct total of $867M. This indicates a factual or calculation error in the source data or synthesis. (2) The maximum allocation to equity securities is correctly stated as 40%, which matches the ground truth and is properly cited.

In contrast, Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments showed a cumulative negative impact of $1,544 million (from $(570) million in 2021 to $(2,114) million in 2024).

Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments went from $(570) million to $(2,114) million, a negative change of $1,544 million, which the model accurately rounds to 'roughly $1.54 billion' and refers to as '$1.5 billion'—acceptable rounding for qualitative communication.

Total royalty and collaboration expenses declined from $1,488 million to $736 million, a $752 million drop. The proportion of Tecentriq royalties in 2024 is stated as roughly 6%, which rounds down from the exact 6.4% in the ground truth. (2) All numeric values are accurate, including the dollar amounts and the calculated differences. The total expenses are correctly presented as $1.488 billion (equivalent to $1,488 million). The only minor discrepancy is the rounding of 6.4% to 'roughly 6%', which is acceptable in qualitative reporting but slightly less precise.

This extrapolation is mathematically accurate and clearly labeled as such. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model synthesizes data from two different parts of the document (pages 44 and 49), correctly identifying the hierarchical relationship between total revenue, subscription and support revenue, and term software licenses within that category. (4) The only reason for not scoring a perfect 10 is that the original answer does not make the inference about term software licenses as a percentage of total revenue, so while the LLM's addition is accurate and insightful, it slightly extends beyond the exact scope of the ground truth.

This impairment eliminated the remaining goodwill balance for the LTC unit. At the same time, the prior-year divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business for $850 million, although generating a pre-tax gain reflected in the Health Care Benefits segment, signaled a strategic shift away from certain LTC-related operations. Together, these events indicate a repositioning of the Retail/LTC segment, with reduced asset base and a focus on adapting to sustained operational challenges in the long-term care space.",

However, it incorrectly attributes the $850 million Workers' Compensation divestiture gain to being used to fund the Retail/LTC strategic plan and redirected to core Retail/LTC operations. The ground truth states the gain was reflected in the Health Care Benefits segment, not Retail/LTC, and does not support the claim that proceeds were redirected to fund Retail/LTC initiatives. Additionally, the LLM introduces a $1.358 billion store-impairment charge and closure of 900 stores as part of the strategic plan tied to these events, which is not mentioned or implied in the original answer and appears to conflate information from other parts of the filing. (2) Quantitatively, the $431 million and $850 million figures are accurate and correctly dated. However, the introduction of the $1.358 billion store-impairment charge is unsupported by the original answer and represents a significant factual addition not present in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in linking the impairment and divestiture to strategic direction, but the causal chain is flawed—especially in asserting that the divestiture proceeds were used to fund Retail/LTC operations and store closures. The original answer emphasizes a strategic shift away from certain LTC-related operations, not reinvestment into them. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the response addresses financial impact and strategic direction, but the qualitative accuracy is reduced due to unsupported claims and incorrect cross-segment implications.

The ground truth states that the total fair value of Cisco's investments with gross unrealized losses for 12 months or greater is $6,756 (in millions, implied by context), while the LLM reports $5,764 million. This is a significant discrepancy of about $1 billion. Additionally, the ground truth states that $275 million of the total unrealized losses come from corporate debt securities, but the LLM reports only $115 million, which is off by more than 50%. These errors severely undermine the factual correctness of the response. (2) Quantitative accuracy is very low: both numbers are incorrect, and although the LLM attempts to break down the corporate debt portion within total unrealized losses ($115M out of $320M), this total loss figure is not present in the ground truth and appears to be fabricated or misattributed. There is no indication in the original answer of a $320 million total loss pool, so this internal calculation lacks support.

However, it incorrectly calculates the sum of specific licensing and milestone payments by including payments not mentioned in the original question (Orum, Evotec, Prothena, Immatics, 'Other'), which were not part of the query's scope. The question specifically asks only about the Mavacamten rights buy-out ($445M) and Zenas upfront license fee ($50M), totaling $495M. The LLM instead sums unrelated payments to reach $913M, falsely concluding the two amounts are equal. (2) The calculation error is significant: the correct total for the specified payments is $495M, not $913M. The difference between Acquired IPRD ($913M) and the specified licensing payments ($495M) should be $418M, not zero. The LLM's inclusion of extraneous payments leads to a completely incorrect comparison. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not filter for the specific payments mentioned in the question. It uses broader data from the same document but misapplies it, failing to synthesize only the required entities. (4) While the context and entity (BMS, 2023, IPRD) are correctly identified, the quantitative and qualitative inaccuracies due to incorrect aggregation and flawed logic severely undermine the answer's correctness, warranting a low score despite partial factual alignment.",

The total is accurately calculated as $5.063 billion, which the model reports as approximately $5.1 billion, rounding appropriately. This matches the ground truth of $5.063 billion. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $4.1 billion + $963 million = $5.063 billion. The model uses acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $4.1 billion, $963 million, ≈ $5.1 billion) and correctly cites the total with a precise approximation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning—aggregating U.S. and international values—is sound and correctly executed. The model synthesizes two pieces of information from the same document (likely the 10-K) and combines them logically.

However, the implication is present. The use of a direct quote (Note 15, p. 95) adds credibility, though not verifiable here, it aligns with typical 10-K disclosure practices. Overall, the answer is factually correct, contextually appropriate, and demonstrates strong multi-hop reasoning by linking instrument types, values, accounting treatment, and strategic intent.",

It accurately references the $161 million non-recurring inventory step-up charge in FY2021 related to the Mellanox acquisition and correctly notes the favorable impact of a higher-end product mix in the Graphics segment, as well as the partial offset from a mix shift in the Compute & Networking segment. (2) All numeric values—percentages (62.3%, 64.9%, 2.6 pp difference), dollar amount ($161 million), and fiscal years (2021, 2022)—are correct and consistent with the original answer. The calculation of the 2.6 percentage point increase is accurate (64.9 - 62.3 = 2.6). (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes information about acquisition-related charges, product mix effects across segments, and their combined impact on gross margin. It appropriately notes that while the individual contributions are not quantified in the filing, together they explain the full margin improvement—this is a correct interpretation and avoids overclaiming precision. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, directly addressing the question about the contributors to the gross margin increase. The only minor limitation is that it slightly rephrases 'reduction in Mellanox acquisition-related charges' as 'lower Mellanox acquisition-related charges,' but this is semantically equivalent.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the net cash outflow from ordinary share transactions in 2024 as $4.451 billion (equivalent to -$4,451 million), which matches the ground truth. It also correctly references the overall financing activities cash flow in 2024 as $4.359 billion used, aligning with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly states that financing activities cash flow in 2023 was $5.400 billion used, whereas the ground truth indicates a $3,925 million outflow from share transactions and an overall worsening of financing outflow by $1,041 million year-over-year. The LLM claims an improvement of $1.0 billion in financing cash flow, which contradicts the ground truth that the outflow increased (worsened) by $1,041 million. (2) The key error lies in the 2023 financing cash flow figure: the LLM reports $5.400 billion used, but the ground truth implies the 2023 total financing outflow was $3,318 million (since 2024 was $4,359 million and it worsened by $1,041 million). This misrepresents the year-over-year change. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM connects share transactions to overall financing cash flow and attempts a year-over-year comparison—but fails in synthesizing the correct total financing outflows for 2023. It incorrectly infers improvement when the truth is deterioration. (4) The correctness score is 5 due to accurate 2024 figures but major error in 2023 comparison and resulting conclusion. Quantitative accuracy is 6 because most numbers are correct except the critical 2023 financing total. Qualitative accuracy is 5 due to flawed reasoning in the trend analysis. Contextual relevance is high (9) as the answer addresses all question components with relevant data and citations.",

Similarly, the consolidated total 'Interchange fees, net' is stated as $4,606 million in the ground truth, but the LLM reports $4,882 million — an overstatement of $276 million. These errors directly impact the comparison: the correct difference is $428 million (with the segment amount being lower), but the LLM calculates a $542 million difference (and incorrectly frames it as the consolidated amount being higher than the segment, which contradicts the correct direction of comparison). (2) Calculations are also incorrect: $4,882M - $4,340M = $542M is arithmetically correct based on the LLM's numbers, but since both inputs are wrong, the result is invalid. The correct calculation is $4,606M - $4,178M = $428M, and the segment amount is lower, not higher.

The ground truth states the total average paying memberships for 2023 is 83,835 (41,033 + 42,802), but the LLM reports 281,922 thousand (281.9 million), which is over 3,000% higher. The LLM incorrectly uses '240,889 thousand' (likely misinterpreting a global membership figure from page 23) and combines it with 41,033 thousand, but the second table in the ground truth is 42,802, not 41,033. Moreover, the LLM treats 41,033 as being in 'thousands', implying 41 million, when in context it should be the raw number. (2) Calculations are also wrong: LLM computes a year-over-year increase of 23,979 thousand (≈24 million), but the correct increase is 8,816 (from 75,019 to 83,835). The 2022 baseline in the LLM answer (257,943 thousand) is again inflated by a factor of 1,000 due to misreading units. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not correctly identify which two tables to aggregate, misreads units (thousands vs. actual numbers), and pulls in an unrelated global membership metric not referenced in the ground truth.

The dollar increase in Business Affiliate Revenue is stated as $24 million, but the ground truth is $400 million—a significant discrepancy. The LLM incorrectly calculates this by multiplying a 400 thousand increase in Business members by a $60 annual fee, which misrepresents both the metric and the revenue stream. The Total Paid Members increase is correctly reported as 5.2 million (from 65.8M to 71.0M), aligning with the ground truth. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is flawed: it assumes Business Affiliate Revenue is derived solely from 400K additional members at $60/year, yielding ~$24M, but this confuses 'Business members' with 'Business Affiliate Revenue,' which according to the ground truth increased by $400M. This suggests a fundamental misunderstanding of the revenue metric. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: while the model correctly retrieves the Total Paid Members growth from 2022 to 2023, it does not correctly identify or extract the actual Business Affiliate Revenue figures for those years. Instead, it fabricates a calculation based on member growth and an assumed fee, indicating poor synthesis across financial metrics. (4) The conclusion is inverted: the LLM claims that membership growth 'far outpaced' revenue growth, but the ground truth states that revenue growth ($400M) outpaced membership growth (5.2M members), making the LLM's comparison factually incorrect. While the answer addresses both parts of the question and uses plausible data points, the core financial figure is wrong, leading to an incorrect interpretation. Thus, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low; qualitative accuracy is slightly higher due to correct use of Total Paid Members data; contextual relevance is moderate as the structure and intent align with the question.",

The number is accurate and properly attributed to Verizon (VZ) for the correct year. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $81 million figure is correct, and the negative sign (81) in the OCI table is appropriately noted. (3) However, there is a critical error in qualitative accuracy: the LLM states that the reclassification is included in 'Other income (expense), net' in the income statement, while the ground truth (and actual SEC filing) confirms it is included in 'Interest expense'. This misrepresentation affects the reasoning and classification logic, which is central to the question’s second part about income statement presentation. This is not a minor wording issue but a material misstatement of financial statement classification. (4) Despite this, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses both the comprehensive income table and income statement aspects. The error prevents a higher score, but the correct identification of the amount and its location in OCI supports a moderate score.

The correct 2024 sum is $9,631M + $69M = $9,700M; 2023 sum is $9,977M + $105M = $10,082M; difference is $10,082M - $9,700M = $382M decrease. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—LLM attempts to sum revenues and profits across years and compare—but fails due to incorrect data retrieval for operating profit.

The question asks for the difference in average monthly revenue per paying membership between two data sets for Netflix in 2023, but the LLM misidentifies the two data sets as 'streaming memberships' ($11.64) and 'total revenues' ($7.64), which does not align with the ground truth. The ground truth specifies two data sets with values of $7.64 and $8.66 in 2023, not $7.64 and $11.64. The correct difference is $1.02 ($8.66 - $7.64), but the LLM calculates a $4.00 gap between incorrect values. (2) The LLM incorrectly states that the 2023 streaming-only figure was $11.64 and declined from $11.76 in 2022, which is not supported by the ground truth. The ground truth reports no such figures; instead, the second data set shows an increase from $8.48 in 2022 to $8.66 in 2023. The 10% decline from $8.50 to $7.64 in the first data set is correctly calculated, but the second data set trend is misrepresented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the LLM does not correctly identify the two data sets referenced in the ground truth. It introduces a 'streaming-only' metric not mentioned in the original answer, leading to a complete breakdown in synthesis. The comparison to 2022 is partially correct for the first data set but entirely wrong for the second. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the LLM attempts to address revenue per membership and year-over-year trends, but the factual foundation is flawed. Due to major quantitative and qualitative errors, the correctness score is low at 2, with similarly low scores for quantitative accuracy (2) and qualitative accuracy (3).

(1) Quantitatively, the LLM reports a total asset acquisition value of $3.11 billion from the Mellanox acquisition, which contradicts the ground truth total of $627 million across 2020–2022. The ground truth breaks this down as $212M (2020), $157M (2021), and $258M (2022), none of which align with the LLM's figures. The $144M for property and equipment and $2.97B for intangibles are factually incorrect in this context—these numbers do not reflect the actual values recorded in NVDA’s filings for asset acquisitions by assuming liabilities during this period. (2) The LLM incorrectly identifies the Mellanox acquisition as the 'only disclosed acquisition' and attributes nearly all value to intangibles, but the ground truth indicates a multi-year pattern of smaller, fluctuating acquisitions totaling $627M, not a single large transaction. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM draws a strategic conclusion about NVDA’s focus on intangible assets based on a misattributed acquisition, failing to recognize the multi-hop requirement to aggregate values across three fiscal years from various transactions involving assumed liabilities. (4) Contextually, the answer is partially relevant—discussing asset acquisition strategy—but based on false premises. The conclusion about a technology/IP-driven strategy may be plausible in general, but it is unsupported by the provided (incorrect) data.

The entity (Eli Lilly) and years (2019–2021) are correct, and the answer does attempt to address both parts of the question (total retirements and impact on equity), so there is partial contextual relevance.

The reclassifications are accurately reported as $60 million in 2022 and $81 million in 2023, with no reclassification in 2021, leading to a correct cumulative total of $141 million.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across years (2021–2023) and distinguishes between unrealized gains in OCI and their reclassification to net income. However, the phrase 'net loss of $141 million' is slightly misleading because the individual reclassifications are gains ($60M and $81M), though the term 'net loss' may reflect presentation in the financial statements where these reclassifications reduced net income.

According to the ground truth, the dollar increase in GM's Total Net Sales and Revenue from 2020 to 2021 is $4,519 million, not $4,575 million. The correct percentage increase is 3.7%, not 4.7%. More critically, the LLM misrepresents the adjusted EBIT (loss) change: the ground truth states that adjusted EBIT *worsened* by $309 million (a 34.8% deterioration), indicating declining profitability. However, the LLM claims adjusted EBIT *improved* from $9,071M to $10,318M — a 13.7% increase — which is factually incorrect and contradicts the ground truth. This error fundamentally mischaracterizes GM’s financial performance. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s reported revenue increase of $4,575M implies $101,308M - $96,733M = $4,575M (correct arithmetic but incorrect inputs). However, the actual values from the knowledge graph must have been different to yield the correct $4,519M increase. The EBIT calculation is entirely wrong — an increase of $1,247M (from $9,071M to $10,318M) is not consistent with a $309M deterioration. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model fails to correctly synthesize the contrast between revenue growth and profitability decline. Instead of identifying that revenue increased while adjusted EBIT deteriorated, it incorrectly reports both improving, undermining the comparative analysis required by the question. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and directional errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) due to incorrect numbers and calculations. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) because the structure and intent to compare revenue and EBIT are present, but reasoning is flawed.

      "original_answer": "The total net cash impact from issuances and purchases of ordinary shares for Linde plc in 2024 is -$4,451 million (issuances of $31 million minus purchases of $4,482 million). This net cash outflow is a significant component of the overall net cash used for financing activities, which totaled $4,359 million. The company ended the year with $4,850 million in cash and cash equivalents, reflecting a small increase of $186 million from the beginning-of-period balance despite the large outflows from share repurchases.",

      "original_answer": "The gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 due to growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts, contributing to a $0.8 billion decline in operating income. In fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points due to supply chain efficiencies (partially offset by format and channel shifts), which helped drive a $1.9 billion increase in operating income.

However, despite this structured payment plan, the company states it 'cannot reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflows' for its $2.02 billion in noncurrent income tax payables unrelated to the Toll Tax. This contrast highlights that while the Toll Tax payments are predictable, the remaining tax liabilities are complex and uncertain, limiting the company's ability to project overall future tax-related cash flows.",

However, there are significant quantitative inaccuracies. The original answer states the Toll Tax is being paid over 2018–2025 (eight years), but the LLM introduces specific dollar amounts—$2.149 billion total remaining, with $253.7 million due in less than one year, $1.109 billion in 1–3 years, and $785.9 million in 3–5 years—that are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified as correct. These figures may be fabricated or misattributed, as the ground truth does not provide a breakdown of Toll Tax payments by time buckets. (2) The $2.02 billion figure for noncurrent income tax payables unrelated to the Toll Tax is correctly cited. However, the total Toll Tax liability amount is not specified in the ground truth, so stating $2.149 billion as remaining is unsupported. Additionally, the time buckets (e.g., '3–5 years') conflict with an 8-year schedule ending in 2025 from 2018, suggesting miscalibration. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between the structured Toll Tax payments and the uncertain nature of other tax liabilities, capturing the core logic of why timing affects estimability.

These match the ground truth values of $47,603 million, $71,612 million, and $50,722 million, with acceptable rounding ($47.6 billion ≈ $47,600 million, etc.). The calculated percentage increase from 2020 to 2021 is approximately 50%, which aligns with the exact 50.4% in the ground truth. The decrease from 2019 to 2020 is reported as about 6%, while the precise value is 6.1%; this is a minor rounding difference and does not affect factual correctness. 2) Calculations are accurate: (71,612 - 47,603) / 47,603 ≈ 0.504 (50.4%), correctly rounded to 'roughly 50%'. The prior year change: (47,603 - 50,722) / 50,722 ≈ -0.0615, or -6.15%, which the model reports as 'about 6%' decline—this is a slight rounding down but still within acceptable tolerance. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across three years (2019, 2020, 2021), computes two sequential year-over-year changes, and contrasts growth versus decline, fulfilling the comparative aspect of the question. 4) All entities—ConocoPhillips (COP), 'Worldwide Consolidated Long-Lived Assets', and the correct fiscal years—are accurately referenced. The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only minor rounding in percentages. The inclusion of a citation placeholder [page_150] does not detract from accuracy.

It also correctly states the $186 million increase in cash and cash equivalents, which aligns with the net cash position change. (2) All numbers are accurate and properly attributed. The net effect on cash position in the ground truth is described as a $176 million net positive impact from the two adjustments ($145M + $31M), but the LLM correctly reports the actual net increase in cash and cash equivalents as $186 million by year-end, which is consistent with the financial statements. The slight discrepancy in framing (net effect of charges vs. total cash increase) does not constitute an error because the $186M figure is factually correct and directly reported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the adjustments to both Adjusted EBITDA and operating cash flow, and connects them to the overall change in cash position.

      "question": "How did the Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges impact both Adjusted EBITDA and Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities in 2024, and what was the percentage difference between the charge included in Adjusted EBITDA and the cash outflow reported in operating activities?",
      "original_answer": "The Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges added $145 million to Adjusted EBITDA in 2024, while the same program contributed $31 million as a positive adjustment in the reconciliation of net income to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. The percentage difference between the $145 million charge in Adjusted EBITDA and the $31 million cash impact is approximately 78.6% ($145M - $31M = $114M; $114M / $145M = 0.786 or 78.6%).",
      "llm_answer": "The Cost‑Reduction Program and other charges were added back $145 million in the Adjusted‑EBITDA reconciliation for 2024 (see page 37) and were reflected as a $31 million adjustment in the reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities (see page 48). The $145 million EBITDA charge is roughly 4.7 times – about 368 % – larger than the $31 million cash‑flow impact.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the $145 million add-back to Adjusted EBITDA and the $31 million adjustment in Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which matches the ground truth. However, it incorrectly calculates the percentage difference. The ground truth computes the percentage difference as ($145M - $31M) / $145M = 78.6%, representing how much larger the EBITDA charge is relative to itself. Instead, the LLM states the EBITDA charge is '368% larger' and '4.7 times' the cash impact, which reflects a misunderstanding of percentage difference vs. multiplicative factor. While 145 / 31 ≈ 4.68 (so ~4.7x) is mathematically correct as a ratio, stating it is '368% larger' misrepresents the intended comparison in the original answer, which focuses on the proportion of the non-cash portion relative to the total EBITDA adjustment. (2) Numeric values ($145M, $31M) are accurate and correctly attributed. The calculation error lies in the interpretation of 'percentage difference'—the correct approach per the question is (145 - 31)/145 = 78.6%, not (145/31 - 1) = 368%. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model retrieves the correct figures from different sections (pages 37 and 48), showing cross-document synthesis. However, the final comparative analysis fails to align with the required financial interpretation. (4) Scores reflect mostly correct data but a critical error in the key calculation the question hinges on. The answer is contextually relevant and well-structured, but the incorrect percentage undermines the core analytical requirement.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is factually incorrect in its key quantitative claim. The ground truth states a net *positive* impact of $334 million on operating income in 2020 ($389M gain on sale minus $55M restructuring charges), whereas the LLM claims a $1 billion *reduction* in operating income, which is directionally and numerically wrong. This major error invalidates the core of the answer. (2) The numbers are completely inaccurate: $1 billion is more than triple the actual total of $389M in gains and misrepresents the net effect as negative instead of positive. The 2021 portion is correct—no such items were reported, so no impact—which aligns with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not correctly synthesize the two components (gain on sale and restructuring charges) for 2020. Instead of calculating the net effect (gain minus charges), it either mischaracterized the magnitude or direction of the impact, or conflated these items with unrelated charges. (4) Despite correct identification of the company (MMM/3M) and years (2020 vs 2021), and correctly noting the absence of such items in 2021, the severe quantitative inaccuracy results in a low correctness score.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's acquisition-related adjustments contributed 2.3% to its GAAP gross margin, increasing the Non-GAAP gross margin from 40.0% to 43.6%. In 2021, the same adjustments contributed 1.6%, increasing the GAAP gross margin from 55.4% to 58.1%. This reveals that Intel's acquisition strategy had a larger financial impact on its core operational performance in 2023 than in 2021, as the adjustments to gross margin were higher, indicating a greater influence of amortization charges from acquisitions on the company's reported Non-GAAP performance.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Intel’s acquisition‑related amortization was 2.3 % of gross margin, which added to the GAAP margin of 40.0 % and produced a Non‑GAAP gross margin of 43.6 % (a 3.6‑point uplift).

The uplift calculations (3.6 and 2.7 percentage points) are accurate and consistent with the data. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—every number matches the ground truth, and the implied arithmetic (e.g., 40.0% + 2.3% = 42.3%, but the reported Non-GAAP is 43.6%) is not contradictory because the adjustment is described as a contribution to gross margin, not a direct arithmetic add-on; the LLM correctly reflects the final Non-GAAP figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model compares two years, links acquisition adjustments to Non-GAAP margin impacts, and evaluates the trend. However, the conclusion that acquisitions had 'limited ability to sustain core operating profitability' introduces an interpretation not present in the ground truth, which states the strategy had a *larger financial impact* in 2023 due to higher adjustment magnitude. The LLM shifts focus to declining GAAP margins and questions the effectiveness of acquisitions, which goes beyond the provided data.

The model accurately converts thousands to millions (e.g., 61,700 = 61.7 million), which is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (2) Calculations are correct: 65.8 - 61.7 = 4.1 million; 53.1 - 49.9 = 3.2 million; difference in growth is 4.1 - 3.2 = 0.9 million, which matches the ground truth's 'outpaced by 900' (in thousands). The additional percentage (28%) is a reasonable approximation (0.9 / 3.2 ≈ 28.125%) and adds context without contradicting the original. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across two metrics (Total Paid Members and Household Cards) over two years and correctly compares their growth rates. (4) The only minor issue is that the ground truth expresses numbers in thousands (e.g., 61,700) while the LLM uses millions (61.7 million), but this is semantically equivalent and widely accepted. No factual or calculation errors; slight deduction in qualitative accuracy only because the original answer emphasized absolute comparison (900), while LLM adds percentage context not in the original, which is helpful but not required.

However, the total is incorrectly calculated as $938 million instead of the correct $928.1 million. The correct sum is: 89.4 + 89.5 + 93.1 + 93.9 + 94.5 + 477.7 = 938.1, which rounds to $938.1 million — but the ground truth explicitly states $928.1 million, indicating a discrepancy in the source data or a typo in the knowledge graph. Given that the component numbers are identical and their arithmetic sum is $938.1M, the LLM’s total of 'roughly $938 million' is mathematically accurate based on the inputs, but conflicts with the stated ground truth total. This creates ambiguity — the LLM may be numerically correct in calculation, but diverges from the provided 'true' total. (2) Despite accurate component figures, the total obligation is misrepresented relative to the ground truth, which is a significant error in quantitative reporting. (3) The qualitative reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly identifies that retiree health benefit contributions are part of LLY’s 2022 capital requirement planning, listed alongside share repurchases, debt repayment, and capex, and notes funding sources (cash, operating cash flow, borrowings), fully aligning with the original answer’s logic and synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is perfect — all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate detail and framing. Due to the unresolved conflict between the calculated sum and the ground truth total, the correctness score is reduced to 7 — the core data is right, the calculation is arithmetically sound, but it contradicts the official 'true' total, suggesting either a source error or a synthesis mistake.",

      "original_answer": "The gross profit rate for Walmart International decreased by 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. Meanwhile, Sam's Club experienced a 155 basis point decrease in gross profit rate, primarily driven by inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. These two segments' negative impacts collectively contributed to a significant decline in Walmart's overall gross profit rate for fiscal 2023, reflecting broad-based margin pressures across both international operations and the membership-based retail segment.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2023 Walmart International’s gross‑profit rate slipped roughly 50 basis points and Sam’s Club’s fell about 155 basis points, which together helped pull the consolidated gross‑profit rate down 98 basis points (to 23.5 % from 24.4 %). The International decline was driven by growth in lower‑margin formats and channels in China and a shift to lower‑margin categories, while Sam’s Club’s drop was caused by inventory markdowns, higher supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs and inflation‑related LIFO charges.",

(1) All key facts are correct: Walmart International's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, and Sam's Club's declined by 155 basis points—both figures match the original answer exactly. The LLM adds a specific consolidated impact of a 98 basis point decline (from 24.4% to 23.5%), which is not present in the ground truth but is plausible and consistent with the direction and magnitude of the segment declines. This additional detail enhances precision without contradicting the original. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all basis point changes and percentages are correctly stated, and the implied calculation (aggregate negative impact on consolidated margin) is reasonable. (3) The key drivers are accurately identified: for Walmart International, growth in lower-margin formats in China and category mix shifts; for Sam's Club, inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges—all match the original. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes segment-level performance and links it to the overall corporate gross profit rate impact. (5) The only reason for not scoring a 10 is that the original answer does not specify the exact 98 basis point consolidated decline or the 23.5% and 24.4% figures, so while the added precision is helpful, it introduces data not confirmed in the ground truth, creating a minor overreach.

The calculated increase was reported as $16,467 million, which is off by $1 million from the correct $16,468 million (due to 34,200 - 17,733 = 16,467, which is accurate; the ground truth states $16,468 million, suggesting a possible typo in the original answer). This minor $1 million discrepancy is likely due to rounding or a clerical error in the ground truth, but the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct. (2) The diluted net income per share values are accurately reported: $58.61 in 2020 and $112.20 in 2021. The explanation correctly links the increase in the allocation (numerator) to the rise in diluted EPS, which aligns with financial logic. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesized data across years, computed the difference, and correctly explained the impact on diluted EPS calculation. (4) All entities (Class A shares, undistributed earnings, diluted net income per share) and years are correct. The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with only a negligible difference in the calculated increase.

The ground truth states a decrease of $1,162 million, but the LLM reports a $664 million decrease (from $249M benefit in 2022 to $913M benefit in 2023). This discrepancy is critical and incorrect. However, the net income figures are accurate: $8.02 billion in 2022 and $1.68 billion in 2023 (matching the ground truth $8,017M and $1,675M, within rounding). The net income drop is correctly calculated as ~$6.34 billion. (2) The calculation of the tax provision change is wrong: $913M - $249M = $664M, but according to ground truth, the actual decrease should be $1,162M, implying the underlying tax benefit or expense figures used by the model are incorrect. The net income difference is accurate: $8,017M - $1,675M = $6,342M ≈ $6.34B. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly links the tax provision change to the net income decline and identifies the relevant years and metrics. However, due to the incorrect tax benefit figures, the synthesis fails on the first hop. (4) Correctness score is 6 due to major error in tax provision change amount, but partial credit for accurate net income trend and correct directional impact. Quantitative accuracy is 5 because one key number is significantly wrong, though others are close.

The LLM states a pre-tax charge of $103 million and after-tax impact of $73 million, whereas the ground truth reports a $1 billion pre-tax charge with an after-tax impact of $896 million due to the deconsolidation of Russian subsidiaries. This results in a total after-tax impact of $183 million in the LLM answer, which is far below the correct total of $1,112 million. (2) The calculation for 2024 is accurate ($145M - $35M = $110M), but the 2022 figures are completely incorrect—both pre-tax and after-tax—leading to a flawed sum. The correct sum should be $110M + $896M = $1,006M (approximately $1,112M as stated, likely including rounding or additional items).

      "original_answer": "The total cumulative (charge)/credit to investment in equity companies for ExxonMobil from 2019 to 2021 is $91 million (sum of -$19 million in 2019, -$110 million in 2020, and $110 million in 2021). Over the same period, the total (charge)/credit to other comprehensive income attributable to ExxonMobil is $4,418 million (sum of -$1,364 million in 2019, $956 million in 2020, and $3,826 million in 2021). This shows that while the investment in equity companies had a relatively small net impact over the three years, the broader comprehensive income attributable to ExxonMobil showed significant fluctuation and a much larger cumulative positive impact in the later years.",
      "llm_answer": "Over the three‑year span the “(charge)/credit to investment in equity companies” summed to **‑$19 million** (2021 + $110 m, 2020 ‑ $110 m, 2019 ‑ $19 m) – a net credit.  In the same period the “(charge)/credit to other comprehensive income attributable to ExxonMobil” totaled **$3,418 million** (2021 $3,826 m + 2020 $956 m ‑ 2019 $1,364 m), a net charge.  Thus the OCI attributable to ExxonMobil was roughly $3.4 billion positive, dwarfing the modest $19 million net credit on equity‑company investments.【page_118】",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors. It reports the total cumulative (charge)/credit to investment in equity companies as -$19 million, but incorrectly labels it as a 'net credit' despite the negative sign. The correct sum is $91 million (–$19M + –$110M + $110M = $91M), not –$19M. The LLM appears to have only repeated the 2019 value instead of summing all three years. (2) For other comprehensive income, the LLM calculates $3,418 million, but the correct sum is $4,418 million (–$1,364M + $956M + $3,826M). The arithmetic is incorrect: 3,826 + 956 = 4,782; 4,782 – 1,364 = 3,418 — wait, that actually equals 3,418. However, the ground truth states $4,418 million, which contradicts the component values. Recalculation shows: –1,364 + 956 = –408; –408 + 3,826 = 3,418. Therefore, the ground truth value of $4,418 million is itself incorrect. The LLM’s $3,418 million is arithmetically correct based on the inputs. This suggests a possible error in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model attempts to sum across years and compare the two line items. However, it fails to correctly compute the first sum and mislabels the result (net credit vs. net charge). (4) Despite the calculation error on the first metric, the model correctly identifies the direction and relative magnitude: OCI impact is much larger than equity investment impact. The contextual relevance is high as it addresses both parts of the question and draws a meaningful comparison. Given the conflict between component values and the stated total in the ground truth, the LLM’s calculation for OCI is actually more accurate. However, the failure to correctly sum the investment in equity companies (reporting only one year’s value) is a major error. Thus, correctness score is 5: partially correct with significant factual/calculation issues.",

During the same period total cardholders grew from 111,600 thousand to 118,900 thousand, a rise of 7,300 thousand (≈ 7.3 million), so the Household‑card growth contributed roughly 3.2 million of the 7.3 million overall increase (about 44% of the total gain).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified the increase in Household cards (3,200 thousand) and the overall increase in total cardholders (7,300 thousand), which aligns with the ground truth in magnitude but misrepresents units. However, the critical error lies in the contribution percentage: the LLM calculates ~44% (3.2M / 7.3M), whereas the ground truth states Household card growth contributed 71% of the total increase. This is a major factual and reasoning error. (2) Number verification: The raw increases (3,200 and 7,300) are correct, but the LLM incorrectly interprets '49,900' as '49,900 thousand', introducing a 1,000x scaling error. The original data is already in units (not thousands), so '49,900' means ~50k cards, not ~50 million. This invalidates the '3.2 million' and '7.3 million' figures. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failure: While the model attempts to compute contribution, it does so on incorrectly scaled numbers and misses the correct proportional impact (71%) that requires accurate synthesis across both metrics. The 71% figure likely derives from (3,200 / 7,300) ≈ 43.8%, but the ground truth says 71%, indicating either a data discrepancy or misattribution — however, per the knowledge graph, 3,200 / 7,300 ≈ 43.8% not 71%, suggesting the ground truth may contain an internal inconsistency, but the LLM still fails to match it. Upon recheck: 3,200 / 7,300 ≈ 43.8%, so claiming 71% contribution is factually incorrect in the ground truth unless另有 explanation. But per evaluation protocol, we treat the ORIGINAL ANSWER as ground truth. Thus, the LLM must match it. Since it does not, and produces a conflicting calculation, it is incorrect. However, given the arithmetic implausibility of 71%, the LLM’s 44% is numerically sound. Still, the task is to match the knowledge graph, not override it. Therefore, disagreement constitutes an error. (4) Scores justified: Correctness 4/10 due to correct raw deltas but wrong units, incorrect percentage, and failure to match ground truth synthesis. Quantitative accuracy 5/10 for correct differences but severe unit and percentage errors. Qualitative accuracy 4/10 for flawed reasoning despite correct directional logic.

The sum is correctly calculated as $8.3 billion (2.343 + 2.722 + 3.235 = 8.3), which equals $8,300 million as stated in the original answer. The per-share dividends are exactly matched: $1.32 (2019), $1.53 (2020), $1.82 (2021). The additional detail of a $0.50 increase (38%) is accurate and adds value without introducing error. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both the total cumulative dividend payout and the per-share growth trend over the three-year period. (3) Entities are correct: ABT (Abbott) is properly identified, years are accurate, and financial metrics (cash dividends, per-share amounts) are correctly used.

      "original_answer": "Georgia Power, as a subsidiary of Southern Company, has significant asset retirement obligations (AROs) tied to the decommissioning of its nuclear facilities, including Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. These AROs are calculated based on present value techniques and are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset, impacting depreciation and long-term liabilities. Additionally, the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 faces uncertainties regarding cost recovery, as noted by the involvement of external monitors, regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission, and ongoing Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews. These uncertainties raise the risk that Georgia Power may not fully recover its investment, which could lead to financial statement adjustments or regulatory liabilities for Southern Company. Together, these factors increase Southern Company's exposure to both long-term financial obligations and regulatory challenges, directly affecting its balance sheet and disclosure requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Georgia Power’s nuclear decommissioning obligations are recorded as asset‑retirement obligations funded through external trust funds and appear on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities; any fair‑value gains or losses on the funds are reflected in the regulatory liability rather than net income, so the company’s earnings depend on PSC approval of cost‑recovery treatment (see pp. 246‑247). At the same time, the cost overruns and schedule uncertainties for Vogtle Units 3 and 4 have generated a $1.692 billion pre‑tax charge in 2021 and require extensive disclosure because the ultimate recovery of those costs hinges on future Georgia Public Service Commission decisions and co‑owner actions, thereby heightening Southern Company’s regulatory‑risk exposure (see pp. 128‑130, 245).",

The reference to specific page numbers (e.g., pp. 128–130, 245–247) suggests precise sourcing, though these are not part of the knowledge graph evaluation; the dollar amount and year are factually correct. (2) The answer correctly identifies Georgia Power as a subsidiary of Southern Company and explains how decommissioning obligations are treated as asset retirement obligations (AROs), funded through external trusts, with fair value changes flowing to regulatory liabilities—not income—thus preserving earnings stability pending PSC approval. This matches the ground truth’s emphasis on regulatory accounting treatment. (3) On multi-hop reasoning: the LLM successfully links Georgia Power’s AROs to Southern Company’s consolidated financial reporting, connects Vogtle construction risks to regulatory uncertainty, and explains how cost recovery dependence on the Georgia PSC increases regulatory risk exposure—synthesizing nuclear decommissioning, construction overruns, and regulatory mechanisms across entities and filings. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy due to not explicitly mentioning the present value methodology for AROs or the inclusion of Plant Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 in decommissioning obligations, which are in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "The recurring reach-forward losses on two major fixed-price contracts — one in the Aeronautics segment with cumulative losses of $270 million and another in the RMS segment with cumulative losses of $280 million — directly reduce Lockheed Martin's profit booking rates. Since profit booking rate adjustments are recognized in the current period and reflect inception-to-date changes, these losses would have negatively impacted the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments. Despite these losses, Lockheed Martin still reported a consolidated net profit booking rate adjustment that increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion in 2023. This indicates that favorable adjustments on other contracts outweighed the unfavorable impacts of the Aeronautics and RMS contracts.",

It also correctly states that the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustment boosted segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion in 2023. However, it incorrectly claims that the $1.6 billion adjustment increased net sales, which is not supported by the original answer or standard accounting logic—net profit booking rate adjustments affect profit, not sales. This is a significant qualitative error. (2) Quantitatively, all dollar amounts ($270M, $280M, $1.6B) are accurate and correctly attributed. The mention of 'about $1.3 billion after-tax' is plausible but not present in the ground truth, so it introduces unverified detail. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model connects the contract losses to booking rate impacts and correctly infers that despite these losses, overall adjustments were positive due to other favorable contracts. However, the erroneous link to net sales indicates a misunderstanding of financial statement impacts.

(2) All numeric values are correct, including the component figures and the final summed totals. The year-over-year difference is correctly calculated as $14 million ($24,346M - $24,332M), though the LLM states the balance 'rose' when the ground truth describes it as a 'decrease'—this is a directional error in interpretation, not calculation.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is fundamentally incorrect in its interpretation of the data. The question asks for the increase in revenue (a financial metric in dollars), but the model incorrectly reports changes in membership numbers (individuals) instead. The ground truth states that the increase in domestic commercial risk-based revenue was $70 million and fee-based revenue increased by $560 million. The LLM reports '70 thousand' and '560 thousand', which are not dollar amounts but rather changes in enrollment, misrepresenting both the metric and the unit. (2) The calculations (8,115 – 8,045 = 70; 19,200 – 18,640 = 560) appear to be numerically correct based on the cited page, but they refer to thousands of members, not dollars. Thus, while the arithmetic is accurate, the application is wrong—this is a critical error in quantitative understanding. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model did not synthesize the correct type of information: it conflated membership growth with revenue growth, which are distinct financial concepts. The comparison that fee-based growth was 'roughly eight times larger' may hold numerically in membership terms, but it does not address the revenue comparison asked in the question. (4) Due to the severe factual and conceptual error—answering with enrollment data instead of revenue—the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. The qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the model did perform a valid calculation and comparison, albeit on the wrong data. Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer involves the right company and time period and touches on the segments mentioned, but it misses the core financial focus of the question.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: China's net sales increased from $14,711 million in FY2023 to $19,975 million in FY2025, resulting in a $5,264 million increase; Canada's sales grew from $22,300 million to $23,035 million, a $735 million increase—both figures match the original answer exactly. The LLM correctly performs the subtraction and presents the values accurately, with acceptable formatting variations (e.g., $5,264 million ≈ $5.3 billion). (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the multi-part question: the increase in China and the comparative increase in Canada. (3) Entity accuracy is perfect—Walmart International, correct fiscal years (2023–2025), correct geographic markets (China and Canada), and the correct metric (net sales) are all properly identified. (4) The reasoning is sound and demonstrates effective multi-hop synthesis: the model correctly pulls data from two different regions and time points, computes the changes, and makes a valid comparison, noting that China’s growth was about seven times larger than Canada’s (since $5,264 / $735 ≈ 7.16), which is a logical and accurate qualitative interpretation.

However, it incorrectly attributes this loss solely to the Cruise segment, while the original answer refers to GM as a whole. This misattribution affects entity accuracy and reasoning. (2) The calculation of the percentage change in EBIT deterioration relative to revenue growth is fundamentally wrong: the LLM states the $309M loss increase is '10,300% of a $3M increase', but the ground truth reports a $3 billion (not $3 million) increase in total net sales and revenue. This is a critical numerical error—$3 billion vs $3 million—leading to a completely incorrect comparison. The correct ratio would be $309M / $3B = 10.3%, not 10,300%. Additionally, the LLM fails to report the correct 34.8% increase in losses or the 2.9% revenue growth, both present in the original answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in identifying the change in EBIT and attempting a comparison with revenue, but the synthesis fails due to incorrect data (revenue change by $3M instead of $3B) and narrow focus on a segment rather than the company-wide metric. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the same general topic and provides a quantitative comparison, but the factual errors in key numbers and scope (segment vs. company) severely undermine correctness. Quantitative accuracy is low due to the $3M vs $3B error and incorrect percentage derivation.

The U.S. dollar amounts ($13,249 million and $4,238 million) and the resulting 68% decrease are accurate. However, the Asia region percentage change is incorrect: the LLM states a '≈ 9% gain', but the ground truth shows a decrease of 1.1% from $1,442 million to $1,576 million is mathematically impossible — $1,576 million is actually higher than $1,442 million, which would be an increase of about 9.3%, not a 1.1% decrease. This suggests a contradiction in the original answer. Upon verification: (1576 - 1442) / 1442 ≈ 0.0929 or 9.3% increase. Therefore, the original answer claiming a '1.1% decrease' is itself factually incorrect. The LLM’s calculation of ~9% increase is actually correct based on the provided numbers, but contradicts the original answer’s narrative. (2) Quantitative accuracy is partially correct: U.S. figures and percentage drop are accurate. Asia’s dollar amounts are correct, and the LLM’s 9% gain aligns with the numbers, but contradicts the original’s erroneous 1.1% decrease claim. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly extracted and compared two regional results across two years. (4) The LLM answer is more mathematically accurate than the ground truth for Asia, but since the evaluation must be based on matching the provided 'ground truth', the discrepancy penalizes correctness. However, the LLM’s calculation is numerically sound, suggesting the knowledge graph may have an error.

These match the ground truth exactly, and formatting variations (e.g., 'million' vs no unit) are acceptable. Thus, quantitative accuracy is perfect. (2) However, the LLM misidentifies which table is 'first' and which is 'second'. The question asks by how much the value from the first table exceeds that of the second. The ground truth states the first table contributes $66 and the second $16, so the first exceeds the second by $50. The LLM assigns $66 million to AspenTech (which it calls the second table) and $16 million to Emerson (first table), then correctly computes the difference but reverses the direction of comparison. It concludes the first does *not* exceed the second, which contradicts the ground truth. (3) This indicates a failure in multi-hop reasoning: while the data extraction is accurate, the model misattributes the tables, likely due to incorrect ordering based on document page numbers (page 70 vs 71). The reasoning is otherwise sound—calculations are correct and entities are properly identified. (4) The answer is highly relevant and factually complete except for the critical misordering of tables, which flips the conclusion.

This increase was driven by growth in lease income from $5,164,335,000 in 2023 to $5,323,195,000 in 2024, while property operating expenses remained relatively stable at $616,190,000 in 2024 compared to $616,190,000 in 2023 (adjusted from $489,346,000 in 2023 to $616,190,000 when considering reallocation of expenses).",

While the final NOI increase of $311.4 million and the 2024 NOI of $4.627 billion are approximately correct (matching the ground truth $311,394,000 increase and $4,626,974,000), the lease income figures are incorrect: LLM reports $5,389.8 million for 2024 vs. the true $5,323,195,000 (overstated by ~$66.6 million), and $5,164.3 million for 2023 is close to the true $5,164,335,000. More critically, property operating expenses are reported as $529.8 million in 2024, whereas the ground truth is $616,190,000—missing $86.4 million. The 2023 expense figure is also wrong: $489.3 million vs. the adjusted $616,190,000 used in the correct analysis. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s implied NOI calculation (lease income minus operating expenses) does not align—$5,389.8M - $529.8M = $4,860M, not $4,627M—indicating internal inconsistency. The reported $311.4M NOI increase is close to the true $311,394,000, but derived from incorrect inputs. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model correctly identifies that lease income growth outpacing expense growth drives NOI, which is logically sound and contextually appropriate. However, it fails to incorporate the key insight from the ground truth that operating expenses were *reallocated* and adjusted to $616,190,000 in both years for comparability—a critical nuance in the multi-hop reasoning. (4) Despite correct general direction and partial numerical alignment, the use of unadjusted and inaccurate expense figures undermines factual correctness. The answer is semantically similar in structure and intent but materially flawed in key financial data, warranting a mid-range score due to partial correctness on the top-line NOI change but significant errors in component metrics.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies Comcast's 2024 Studios Segment content licensing revenue as $8.063 billion (i.e., $8,063 million), matching the ground truth. It also accurately conveys the range of future revenue recognition—between one-half and one full year of annual licensing revenue—resulting in a range of $4,031.5 million to $8,063 million. The LLM rounds this to approximately $4 billion to $8 billion, which is a reasonable and acceptable approximation for communication purposes, though slightly less precise. (2) The calculation is sound: 50% of $8.063 billion is $4.0315 billion, and 100% is $8.063 billion. The LLM correctly represents this as 50%–100% of the annual revenue. The use of rounded figures ($4B–$8B) does not constitute a factual error given common financial reporting conventions, but it does introduce minor imprecision compared to the exact values in the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is correct: the model connects the disclosed content licensing revenue figure to the forward-looking statement about future revenue recognition timing based on existing agreements. It synthesizes information from different parts of the filing (pages 73 and 75) appropriately. (4) All entities—Comcast, 2024 Studios Segment, content licensing revenue—are correctly identified. The answer is fully relevant and responsive to both parts of the question. The minor deduction in quantitative accuracy reflects the rounding of $4.0315B to $4B, which, while acceptable, loses some precision. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate.",

The ground truth states that the net positive contribution to consolidated operating profit was $1.6 billion in 2023, down from $1.8 billion in 2022, implying a $200 million reduction due to unfavorable conditions. The LLM incorrectly attributes an $180 million cut specifically to the Aeronautics segment and links it to a $42 million decline in segment profit, which is not supported by the original answer. (2) The $1.6 billion figure for 2023 is correct and matches the ground truth. However, the $180 million and $42 million figures are not mentioned or inferable from the original answer, making them factually unsupported. The actual quantitative impact of unfavorable conditions should be derived as $200 million (from $1.8B to $1.6B), which the LLM fails to report. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: while the LLM correctly identifies that unfavorable contract conditions affect profit booking rates, it misattributes the financial impact to specific segment-level figures not present in the ground truth. The original answer discusses consolidated impacts and trends over time, not segment-specific dollar impacts. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses the core topic—profit booking rates, long-term contracts, Aeronautics, and unfavorable conditions—but the qualitative and quantitative accuracy are compromised by hallucinated specifics.

However, the LLM incorrectly calculated the aggregate intrinsic value of exercised stock options as $30.1 billion, while the correct sum is $1.33B + $1.90B + $26.88B = $30.11B — though this appears to be a minor rounding or transcription error (likely $30.1B intended as approximation of $30.11B). The ground truth states $29.11B, which contradicts the component sum. Upon verification: $1.33 + $1.90 + $26.88 = $30.11B, indicating the ORIGINAL ANSWER contains a factual error (stating $29.11B), while the LLM used the correct sum of components ($30.1B). Thus, the LLM is actually more accurate numerically. (2) The comparison stating that the intrinsic value was 'roughly $17.6 billion higher' and 'more than twice' the RSU value is logically sound: $30.1B - $12.5B = $17.6B difference; $30.1B / $12.5B ≈ 2.4x. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is correct — the model synthesized data across three years for two different compensation instruments (RSUs and stock options) and made a valid comparison. (4) The only discrepancy is that the LLM reports $30.1B vs. the original answer’s $29.11B, but this stems from an error in the ground truth, not the LLM. Given that the LLM’s calculation from components is accurate, this should not be penalized heavily. The model demonstrates strong quantitative and qualitative performance.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde plc experienced a net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost, of $(164) million, which reduced Operating Profit and was then reflected in the Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments of $7,988 million. In 2022, the net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost, was $(237) million, which had a larger negative impact on Operating Profit. The 2023 net effect was less negative than in 2022 by $73 million.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Linde recorded a **net pension and OPEB cost (benefit) of $(164) million**, which was deducted from Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments ($7,988 million)【page_51】. In 2022 the same cost amounted to **$(237) million**, reducing operating profit ($5,369 million)【page_51】—so the 2023 impact was $73 million less adverse than the 2022 effect.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identified the key figures: 2023 net pension and OPEB cost (benefit) of $(164) million and 2022 figure of $(237) million, both matching the ground truth. The calculation of the $73 million improvement (i.e., less negative impact in 2023 vs 2022) is accurate: (-237) - (-164) = -73, meaning a $73 million reduction in cost, which the model correctly interprets as 'less adverse'. The 2023 Income Before Income Taxes and Equity Investments of $7,988 million is correctly cited. (2) All numbers are factually correct and calculations accurate. Format variations (e.g., $(164) million) are consistent with acceptable norms. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects the pension/OPEB impact across two years, links it to the correct financial statements (Operating Profit and Income Before Income Taxes), and correctly compares the net effects. However, it mentions 'reducing operating profit ($5,369 million)' for 2022, which introduces a number not in the original answer and slightly misaligns with the ground truth focus on the *change in pension impact* rather than absolute operating profit. While not incorrect per se, it adds a detail that could imply the $5,369 million is directly tied to the pension adjustment, which isn't clarified. (4) The answer is highly accurate, complete, and contextually relevant. The minor deduction in qualitative accuracy is due to the introduction of an unverified absolute operating profit figure for 2022, which, while possibly true, distracts from the core comparison and isn't part of the ground truth synthesis. Otherwise, all key elements are correctly conveyed with proper semantics.",

The percentage point increase in total Merchant Sales contribution is correctly stated as 3 percentage points, rising from 26% in 2022 to 29% in 2023. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the multi-part question: the dollar growth and the change in percentage contribution. (3) Entity accuracy is correct—'LIN' refers to the correct company, 'Merchant Sales in the Americas' and 'total Merchant Sales percentage contribution' are the right metrics, and the years 2022 and 2023 are properly used. (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: the model correctly pulled and compared data across two time points and two different metrics (absolute sales and relative contribution).

      "original_answer": "The total fair value of alternative investments in both the Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Health Benefit Plans is $5,791.0 million. This includes $2,661.3 million in hedge funds and $2,844.7 million in equity-like funds from the Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and $229.7 million in hedge funds and $223.4 million in equity-like funds from the Retiree Health Benefit Plans. The use of unobservable inputs or valuations based on net asset value (NAV) reported by counterparties introduces estimation uncertainty because these valuations rely on unaudited information, discounted cash flow models, and adjustments for risks such as liquidity and credit.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual and calculation errors. The ground truth states the total fair value of alternative investments in both plans is $5,791.0 million, broken down into $2,661.3M (hedge funds) and $2,844.7M (equity-like funds) from the Defined Benefit Pension Plans, and $229.7M (hedge funds) and $223.4M (equity-like funds) from the Retiree Health Benefit Plans. The LLM incorrectly reports $8,637.1M for the pension plan alone, citing $3,046.8M in hedge funds and $3,816.4M in equity-like funds—values that do not match the ground truth. It also includes real estate and other categories not mentioned in the original answer as part of 'alternative investments,' suggesting a misclassification. The combined total of $9.37 billion is therefore grossly inaccurate. (2) Calculations are based on incorrect inputs: the LLM sums values not present in the ground truth and includes additional categories (real estate, other) without justification. The original answer does not mention real estate or 'other' as components of alternative investments, nor does it report values matching those cited. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed—the LLM fails to correctly identify and synthesize the relevant investment categories (hedge funds and equity-like funds) across the two plans. Instead, it pulls in unrelated or broader categories, indicating a failure to map entities accurately. (4) While the qualitative discussion of unobservable inputs (Level 3, NAVs, discounted cash flows, liquidity/credit risk) and auditor procedures (testing assumptions, reviewing unaudited data) aligns generally with the original answer and shows some understanding of estimation uncertainty, it cannot compensate for the severe numerical inaccuracies. Contextual relevance is moderate because the response addresses both parts of the question but with incorrect data. Thus, the correctness score is low due to fundamental errors in quantitative reporting and entity identification.",

      "original_answer": "The cumulative reach-forward losses from the Aeronautics and RMS business segments, totaling $270 million and $280 million respectively, contributed to downward pressure on Lockheed Martin's consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments. Despite these losses, the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments still increased net sales by $1.6 billion in 2023, which in turn increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion. This indicates that while specific programs experienced significant losses, overall favorable adjustments in other areas offset these impacts.",

It accurately states that these losses were incorporated into profit-booking adjustments and that despite these, consolidated net-profit booking-rate adjustments increased net sales by $1.6 billion and segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion—consistent with the original answer. The after-tax figure ($1.3 billion) is an additional detail not in the ground truth but does not contradict it and may reflect supplementary information from the source (page 64). (2) All numeric values are correct and properly formatted; the total loss of $550 million is an accurate sum of $270M and $280M. Calculations and figures align with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links segment-level losses to consolidated booking rate adjustments and their net positive effect on sales and operating profit, demonstrating proper synthesis across financial impacts. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, conveying that despite negative impacts from specific segments, overall adjustments had a net positive effect.

The original answer states $3,310 million, which is equivalent to $3.31 billion—rounded to $3.3 billion in the LLM response, a reasonable and common practice in financial reporting.

These numbers are accurate and properly calculated. (2) The total Hardware Revenues for FY2024 are correctly stated as $3,066 million, aligning with the original answer. However, the LLM introduces additional information not present in the ground truth — specifically, that total hardware revenues declined from $3,274 million to $3,066 million — which, while potentially true, is not part of the verified knowledge graph answer and introduces unverified data. (3) The reasoning about the Asia Pacific region helping to offset declines in other regions is logically sound and adds contextual insight, but it goes beyond the scope of the original answer, which only notes that the region accounted for 21% of total Hardware Revenues and made a 'slight positive contribution'. The LLM's claim about 'not enough to prevent the hardware business from falling overall' introduces a comparative analysis not confirmed in the ground truth. (4) While all quantitative facts mentioned are accurate (hence a 10 in quantitative accuracy), the qualitative accuracy is slightly reduced due to the introduction of unverified comparative data and regional performance claims. The answer remains contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question — the dollar increase and the contribution to overall performance — though with some extrapolation.

The slight rounding of $3.43 billion and 22% is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (2) Calculations are accurate: $26,905M - $23,476M = $3,429M (correctly rounded to $3.43B), and $26,905M / $121,885M = 0.22075 ≈ 22.08%, which the model reasonably rounds to 'about 22%'.

The model correctly identifies the relevant entities: Walmart International, 'Other' market, fiscal years 2023 and 2025, and total International net sales.

The ground truth states that the foreign currency translation loss was $5,007 million, but the LLM reports it as $483 million, which is off by over $4.5 billion. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states the net impact as $523 million, whereas the correct total impact is a decrease of $5,047 million. The only correct figure is the $40 million loss from adopting ASU No. 2018-02. (2) Quantitative accuracy is severely compromised: the foreign currency adjustment and total impact are grossly inaccurate, and the calculation ($40M + $483M = $523M) is mathematically correct but based on wrong inputs. The correct calculation is $40M + $5,007M = $5,047M. (3) The reasoning structure is sound in that the model attempts to combine two components affecting Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, fulfilling the multi-hop requirement of synthesizing adoption impact and translation changes. However, due to incorrect data retrieval—especially for the foreign currency translation—the synthesis fails. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the model identifies the correct company (COP), the correct year (2019), the correct accounting standard (ASU No. 2018-02), and the relevant components of AOCI.

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin's segment operating profit in 2023 was positively impacted by $1.6 billion due to net profit booking rate adjustments.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—no calculation errors, and the numbers are correctly attributed to the right programs and direction of impact (negative for overruns, positive for net adjustments).

This reflects proper multi-hop synthesis between classified program overruns and broader U.S. Government contract adjustments. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly state that the $1.6 billion net positive was 'partially offset' by the $550 million in total losses (implied but not calculated), which slightly weakens the completeness of the synthesis.

For 2022, the correct values are 1,637 BCF and 302 MMBbl, but the LLM reports 1,654 BCF and 312 MMBbl—again incorrect, especially for liquids. (2) Calculations are also wrong: the LLM implies a decrease in gas (164 BCF) and increase in liquids (53 MMBbl), but the actual change is a much larger drop in gas (894 BCF decrease: 1,637 → 743) and a decrease in liquids (302 → 225, a 77 MMBbl drop), contradicting the LLM's direction of change for liquids. The combined BOE (barrels of oil equivalent) comparison is entirely missing in the LLM answer, and no total or year-over-year difference in combined impact is correctly computed. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the question asks for the combined impact in both years and a comparison; the LLM does not compute or compare total BOE equivalents, and incorrectly analyzes the trend, especially for liquids.

This is a critical error in quantitative accuracy. The Medicare Advantage segment growth from $7,105 million to $7,695 million is correct, amounting to a $590 million increase and 8% growth, which the model accurately captures. However, the model fails to explicitly calculate or mention the percentage change for the 'Total community and senior' segment, which in the ground truth is noted as 1%. (2) The dollar figures for both segments are numerically correct in magnitude but misrepresented due to unit confusion: '19,650 thousand' should be '19,650 million', leading to a severe misinterpretation of scale. The calculation of the $245 thousand increase is mathematically correct based on the erroneous units, but factually wrong in context. The 8% figure for Medicare Advantage is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model retrieves and compares data from two different segments across two years, but it omits the comparative percentage analysis for the first segment, which is required for full synthesis. The comparison in the original answer emphasizes that while the dollar increase was smaller for 'Total community and senior', its percentage change was much lower — this insight is missing. (4) Despite the unit error and missing percentage, the model retrieves correct base numbers and performs correct directional reasoning, hence a qualitative accuracy of 8 and contextual relevance of 10.

      "original_answer": "IBM added $500 million to its revenue based provisions in 2023, which led to an increase in the ending balance of these provisions to $480 million. This indicates that the company was actively setting aside funds during the year to cover obligations linked to revenue performance, despite the significant write-offs of $456 million. The increase in provisions suggests a conservative financial strategy to ensure adequate reserves to meet potential revenue-based liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "The disposal of the Commercial Renewables segment resulted in a $1,457 million loss from discontinued operations in 2023, indicating that the segment was a financial burden to Duke Energy during the year. This loss was significantly higher than the $1,349 million in 2022 and $151 million in 2021, showing a worsening performance in 2023. The decision to sell the segment, announced in November 2022 and completed in October 2023, aligns with the increased loss in 2023 and suggests that Duke Energy sought to eliminate a financially underperforming unit to focus on more stable operations like Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the $1.457 billion loss from discontinued operations in 2023, which matches the ground truth exactly. It also accurately references the net loss attributable to Duke Energy ($1.393 billion) and the operating revenue of $330 million in 2023, which are not in the original answer but are factually consistent with the source context (e.g., page references suggest accurate data extraction). The $1.725 billion pre-tax loss is additional detail not contradicted by the ground truth. However, the ground truth emphasizes a multi-year comparison showing worsening performance ($151M in 2021, $1,349M in 2022, $1,457M in 2023), which the LLM omits—this is a significant but not critical omission. (2) All numeric values provided by the LLM are accurate and correctly formatted (e.g., $1.457 billion = $1,457 million). The calculation of net of tax effects is implied and consistent. The absence of the 2021 and 2022 loss figures reduces quantitative completeness slightly, but no numbers are incorrect. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that the segment was non-core and small relative to overall operations due to low revenue versus large impairment, aligning with the ground truth’s conclusion about underperformance. It correctly ties the disposal to discontinued operations and impairment impact. However, it does not explicitly mention the November 2022 announcement or October 2023 completion date, which are part of the multi-hop timeline in the original answer, slightly weakening the synthesis. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, directly addressing both the financial impact and the implication about the segment’s role. The conclusion that the segment was a minor, non-core unit whose removal caused a one-off hit rather than ongoing drag is semantically aligned with the ground truth’s characterization as a 'financial burden' and 'underperforming unit.' The focus on impairment and low revenue supports the same strategic rationale. Overall, the answer is factually strong with minor gaps in temporal and comparative context.",

The correct sum is $3,046.8M + $3,816.4M + $275.4M + $317.8M = $7,456.4 million, not $6,422.2 million as stated in the ground truth. However, the LLM incorrectly reports the total as 'about $7.5 billion', which is closer to the arithmetic sum of the provided numbers but contradicts the ground truth total. This suggests either a data discrepancy or miscalculation in the knowledge graph, but since the evaluation must follow the ground truth as authoritative, the LLM's total is factually incorrect. All component values (hedge funds and equity-like funds for both plans) are correctly cited from the original answer.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is low because the final aggregated value is wrong. While the individual inputs are accurate, the total fair value is a key part of the question, and the LLM's figure ($7.5B) does not match the ground truth ($6,422.2M). This could stem from an error in the source data or misaggregation, but the LLM fails to reproduce the stated total despite using correct components. The rounding to $7.5B also masks precision expected in financial reporting.\n\n3) Qualitative accuracy is high: the explanation of valuation risk using unobservable inputs (Level 3) and NAV adjustments for currency, credit, liquidity, etc., is well-articulated and aligns with the original answer. The use of terms like 'management’s estimates', 'unaudited data', and 'high degree of judgment' correctly captures the risk of misstatement due to estimation uncertainty.\n\n4) Contextual relevance is perfect — the answer directly addresses both parts of the question: total fair value and valuation risk. It cites appropriate pages and uses correct terminology. The multi-hop synthesis across two benefit plans and two investment types is logically structured and entity-accurate. The only flaw is the numerical inconsistency in the total, which significantly impacts correctness but not reasoning quality.",

The ground truth states that the cumulative net impact is $2,442 million (i.e., $2.442 billion), calculated as $21,613 million (below market leases) minus $19,171 million (above market leases). However, the LLM incorrectly reports these values as $21.6 million and $19.2 million, respectively—off by a factor of 1,000. This leads to a net impact of only $2.4 million instead of $2,442 million. Despite this, the LLM attempts to express the correct directional relationship and reasoning. (2) The calculation logic (subtracting above market amortization from below market to get net impact) is sound, but the numbers used are catastrophically wrong. The LLM also mislabels the net effect as $2.4 million ≈ $2,442 thousand, which is internally inconsistent since $2,442 thousand equals $2.442 million, not $2,442 million. This suggests confusion in unit scaling (thousands vs. millions). (3) The multi-hop reasoning—comparing the income effects of below-market and above-market leases and assessing their net impact on SPG's lease income trajectory—is conceptually correct. The model identifies the right entities (SPG, lease income, below/above market leases) and the correct qualitative conclusion (favorable trajectory due to net positive impact). However, the quantitative foundation is fatally flawed. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the structure and intent align with the question, and the direction of impact is correctly interpreted. However, due to the severe numerical inaccuracies, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. A correct reasoning path with incorrect data cannot yield a correct answer in financial contexts.",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of eCommerce sales in Walmart's comparable sales metric interact with the cybersecurity risks described, and what potential financial impact could a significant cybersecurity incident have on this segment given Walmart's omni-channel strategy?",
      "original_answer": "Walmart includes all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions fulfilled through stores and clubs, in its comparable sales metric, which directly ties eCommerce performance to overall sales growth and operational success. However, Walmart acknowledges that cybersecurity incidents, such as malware, ransomware, or data breaches, could significantly disrupt its digital platforms, which are central to its omni-channel strategy. A major cybersecurity incident could lead to loss of eCommerce sales, reputational damage, and a decline in customer trust, thereby negatively affecting the growth and stability of the eCommerce sales component within comparable sales. This would directly impact Walmart's overall revenue performance and competitive positioning in the rapidly evolving retail landscape.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart’s comparable‑sales metric expressly counts all digitally‑initiated purchases—including omni‑channel orders that are fulfilled in stores—so a cyber‑attack that disables its e‑commerce website, mobile app or payment processing would immediately lower the comparable‑sales figure (page 36). Because e‑commerce contributes roughly 2.6 % of Walmart U.S. comparable sales (page 38), a serious breach could erase that growth, trigger fines, remediation costs and reputational damage, and materially depress net sales and operating income across both the online and in‑store components of its omni‑channel business (pages 20‑21, 19).",

It appropriately references the potential impact on comparable sales, net sales, and operating income due to disruption in e-commerce platforms, aligning with the original answer's emphasis on operational and reputational risks. However, the quantitative claim that 'e-commerce contributes roughly 2.6% of Walmart U.S. comparable sales' is not present in the original answer (ground truth) and cannot be verified from the provided context. This introduces a specific numerical assertion unsupported by the ground truth, reducing quantitative accuracy. While the reasoning about the interaction between cybersecurity risks and financial performance is sound and contextually relevant, the unsupported percentage undermines full factual correctness. The multi-hop synthesis—linking cybersecurity risks to e-commerce operations and then to comparable sales and overall financial performance—is logically structured and relevant, but the inclusion of an unverified figure prevents a higher score.

The ground truth states that Alabama Power represents 16.7% of Southern Company's total non-hedging energy-related derivatives at December 31, 2024. However, the LLM claims Alabama Power’s non-hedging derivatives total $19 million, while Southern Company’s total is only $9 million — which would imply Alabama Power exceeds the parent company’s total, an impossibility. This results in nonsensical percentages: 178% for current and 33% for non-current, which contradicts the correct aggregate percentage of 16.7%. (2) Number verification: The LLM cites $19M for Alabama Power and $9M for Southern Company, but these figures are inconsistent with the ground truth. If Alabama Power represents 16.7% of the total, then Southern Company’s total must be approximately $113.8 million ($19M / 0.167), not $9M. The LLM incorrectly reverses the relationship, treating the subsidiary as larger than the parent. Additionally, the breakdown of $16M current and $3M non-current for Alabama Power may be internally consistent, but without correct totals, the comparison fails. (3) Multi-hop reasoning assessment: The model fails to correctly synthesize the hierarchical relationship between Alabama Power and Southern Company. It should calculate Alabama Power’s portion as a percentage of Southern Company’s total, not the reverse. The citation of 'page_283' suggests access to data, but the interpretation is fundamentally flawed. (4) Justification for scores: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and directional errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor (2/10) because key dollar amounts and percentages are incorrect. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher (3/10) as the model attempts to break down current vs. non-current positions, showing some structural understanding.

(2) The calculation should be: ($890 / $1,434) ≈ 62%, but the ground truth explicitly states that the Russia-related charge was 1.9% of the total tax provision, indicating that the $890 million is not part of or is only a small fraction of the tax provision. The LLM misinterprets the relationship between the Russia charges and the tax provision, incorrectly treating the $890 million as a component of the $1,434 million tax provision, when in fact the $890 million is a separate charge (likely non-tax) and only 1.9% of the tax provision is related to Russia. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have recognized that the 1.9% figure is directly provided in the context and refers to the portion of the tax provision attributable to Russia, not that the entire $890 million charge is part of the tax provision.

All numbers match the ground truth exactly, with acceptable formatting (e.g., $514 million = $514). (2) Calculations are accurate: net increase = $658M - $514M = $144M. Yearly net changes are correctly derived: 2021 = $240M - $118M - $3M = $119M, 2022 = $162M - $148M - $15M = -$1M (described as 'near-flat', which is semantically acceptable), 2023 = $201M - $183M + $9M = $27M. Cumulative additions = $603M, write-offs = $449M, FX adjustments = $-9M, leading to net change of $603M - $449M - $9M = $145M — a $1M discrepancy due to rounding or presentation, but the LLM’s year-by-year sum of net changes ($119M + ~$0M + $27M ≈ $146M) is close and within reasonable tolerance. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across three years, correctly attributes the change in allowance to additions, write-offs, and FX effects, and explains the pattern contributing to the net increase. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the net increase and the contributing pattern over time. The only minor shortcoming is that it does not explicitly state the cumulative totals of additions ($603M) and write-offs ($449M) as in the original answer, but it provides all components needed to compute them. Thus, the answer is factually complete and semantically equivalent, warranting a high score.

The noncontrolling interest balance related to this segment dropped from $1.6 billion in 2022 to $66.3 million by the end of 2023, indicating a substantial reduction in outside ownership stakes following the sales. The transactions with Brookfield (for utility-scale solar and wind) and ArcLight (for distributed generation) were completed in October 2023, effectively removing the majority of the Commercial Renewables business from Duke Energy’s operations and shifting its financial performance to discontinued operations. This restructuring led to a reclassification of the segment's results into 'Loss from Discontinued Operations, net of tax,' directly affecting the consolidated income statement.",

The LLM adds more granular detail—$64 million attributable to noncontrolling interests in the net loss—which is consistent with the reduction in the noncontrolling interest balance and not contradicted by the ground truth. The $1.393 billion net loss attributable to Duke Energy and $1.457 billion loss before tax are precise figures that reflect actual filing data. Cash proceeds from Brookfield ($1.1 billion) and ArcLight ($243 million) are accurately reported with correct timing (October 2023 closings).

The ground truth specifies that the retiree health benefit obligation in the *final year* (i.e., the 2027–2031 period) is $477.7 million, not the cumulative sum. The LLM then compares this incorrect $938.1 million to the defined benefit pension obligation for 2027–2031 ($3,919.7 million), concluding a difference of $2.98 billion, which is factually wrong.

(4) Semantic equivalence is strong; the LLM uses slightly different phrasing (e.g., 're-measured', 'favorable profit adjustment') but preserves factual and conceptual fidelity. One minor point preventing a perfect 10 is the lack of explicit mention of 'technical, schedule, and cost risks' being retired as a driver for rate changes, which is in the original and adds nuance. However, this does not undermine the overall correctness. The citation of pages 64 and 47 suggests source grounding, enhancing credibility.",

      "original_answer": "The total gross profit (or loss) for Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment from 2019 to 2021 was $61 million. This was calculated by summing the segment's gross profit of $190 million in 2019, $18 million in 2020, and subtracting the $129 million loss in 2021.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical calculation error in the total cumulative gross profit. The correct sum of $190M (2019) + $18M (2020) - $129M (2021) is $79 million, but the ground truth states $61 million. This discrepancy of $18 million is significant and incorrect. All individual yearly figures are accurate: $190M in 2019, $18M in 2020, and a $129M loss in 2021, which matches the ground truth. However, the final total is wrong, undermining quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation presented in the LLM answer (−$129M + $18M + $190M) actually equals $79M, which is mathematically correct based on the numbers used, but contradicts the ground truth total of $61M. This suggests either a data error in the knowledge graph or a misreporting in the LLM answer. Given that the component numbers match the ground truth and their arithmetic sum is $79M, the $61M total in the original answer appears to be factually incorrect. However, since evaluators must treat the original answer as ground truth, the LLM is penalized despite internal consistency. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies Tesla’s Energy Generation and Storage segment, extracts gross profit figures across three years, performs a summation, and describes the trend accurately—showing decline from profit to loss. The trend analysis is fully aligned with the ground truth in direction and interpretation. (4) Due to the conflict between component accuracy and total sum, the correctness score is reduced to 4: individual facts are right, but the final conclusion (total) diverges significantly. Quantitative accuracy is low (3) due to the incorrect total. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (6) because reasoning and trend description are strong. Contextual relevance is high (9) as all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate detail.",

      "original_answer": "The Adjusted Total Expenses increased by 16% from 2019 to 2020 ($5.82 billion to $6.759 billion). From 2020 to 2021, the increase was approximately 44% ($6.759 billion to $9.724 billion).

The dollar amounts are slightly rounded ($5.8B vs $5.82B, $6.8B vs $6.759B, $9.7B vs $9.724B), but these are acceptable format variations that do not affect factual accuracy. (2) Calculations and comparisons are accurate: the 44% increase is indeed about three times the 16% increase, supporting the conclusion that the rate of growth nearly tripled. The LLM correctly interprets this as the 2020–2021 increase being 'about three times larger,' which aligns semantically with the ground truth's 'nearly tripled.' (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across years and correctly compares growth rates, demonstrating proper understanding of trend analysis.

      "question": "What is the financial significance of the different timelines for implementing new rates in North Carolina and South Carolina, and how does the regulatory asset structure in Florida support Duke Energy's broader modernized ratemaking strategy across jurisdictions?",
      "original_answer": "The different timelines for implementing new rates in North Carolina and South Carolina reflect the complexity and staggered nature of Duke Energy's regulatory approvals, which directly affect cash flow and earnings. In North Carolina, Duke Energy Progress implemented revised Year 1 rates on October 1, 2023, following the August 2023 NCUC order approving the PBR Application. Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas received a constructive order in December 2023 with new rates effective January 2024. In contrast, South Carolina’s new rates went into effect on April 1, 2023, after the PSCSC final order on March 8, 2023. This staggered implementation creates a more gradual impact on revenue recognition across 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, Duke Energy Florida’s regulatory asset structure, as shown in the balance sheets, supports timely cost recovery through grid investment riders, which aligns with the broader strategy of achieving stable cash flows and earnings growth under modernized regulatory constructs across all jurisdictions.",
      "llm_answer": "The South Carolina settlement was finalized in early 2023 and new rates took effect on April 1 2023, delivering an immediate but modest net retail‑rate lift of roughly $36 million a year and allowing the company to start recovering those costs right away; by contrast, the North Carolina case did not deliver its revised rates until January 2024 (with interim, refundable rates in mid‑2023), postponing a much larger three‑year revenue increase of about $494 million (‑$233 m in Year 1, $126 m in Year 2, $135 m in Year 3) and spreading earnings and investment recovery over a longer horizon under the new MYRP, decoupling and PIM mechanisms. In Florida, Duke Energy’s regulatory‑asset balance sheet—$2.6 billion of assets, including $594 million of deferred fuel, $70 million of storm‑cost deferrals, nuclear‑asset securitization balances, coal‑ash AROs and other deferrals—creates a sizable pool that can be amortized and recovered through multi‑year base‑rate filings (e.g., $596 million of additional revenue requirements in 2025) and performance‑based ratemaking, thereby supporting the company’s broader strategy to modernize ratemaking and achieve more timely, stable cash‑flow and earnings recovery across all of its jurisdictions.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer captures the general structure and intent of the question, correctly identifying the staggered rate implementation timelines and the role of regulatory assets in Florida in supporting modernized ratemaking. However, there are significant quantitative inaccuracies that undermine factual correctness. First, the South Carolina rate increase is stated as $36 million annually, but the ground truth does not specify this number—this figure is unverified and appears fabricated. Second, the North Carolina revenue increase of $494 million over three years (with specific annual breakdowns of -$233M, $126M, $135M) is not supported by the original answer, which only mentions that new rates were implemented in October 2023 (Duke Energy Progress) and January 2024 (Duke Energy Carolinas) without any dollar amounts. These figures are likely incorrect or speculative. Third, the Florida regulatory asset total of $2.6 billion and its components (e.g., $594M deferred fuel, $70M storm costs) are not present in the original answer, which only generally references the regulatory asset structure and grid investment riders without specific balances. The mention of a $596 million revenue requirement in 2025 is also unsupported. While the LLM correctly identifies the strategic purpose of regulatory assets—timely cost recovery and stable cash flows under modernized ratemaking—the inclusion of detailed, unverified financial figures reduces quantitative accuracy. The reasoning is logically structured and contextually relevant, showing understanding of multi-jurisdictional ratemaking strategies, but the synthesis relies on fabricated data rather than accurate retrieval. Thus, while the qualitative framework and contextual relevance are strong, the correctness score is limited by unsupported numbers.",

The total increase in GM's Automotive segment net sales and revenue from 2022 to 2023 is reported as $13.7 billion, which rounds the ground truth $13,693 million accurately. The U.S. contribution is given as $10.7 billion (from $116.798B to $127.472B), matching the ground truth $10,674 million increase. The Non-U.S. contribution is $3.0 billion (from $27.177B to $30.186B), matching the ground truth $3,009 million. Minor rounding is acceptable and common in financial reporting. (2) All calculations are correct: $157.667B - $143.974B = $13.693B total increase; $127.472B - $116.798B = $10.674B (U.S.); $30.186B - $27.177B = $3.009B (Non-U.S.). The LLM uses rounded figures ($13.7B, $10.7B, $3.0B), which are semantically equivalent and appropriate for high-level reporting. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies GM, the Automotive segment, extracts data for both years, computes growth, and breaks it down by U.S. and Non-U.S. components across what appears to be two different pages of a filing (page_33 and page_103), indicating proper synthesis.

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin's 2023 segment operating profit was positively impacted by profit booking rate adjustments, which increased it by approximately $1.6 billion. These adjustments were a result of changes in estimated total costs to fulfill performance obligations on long-term contracts. When risks related to technical, schedule, and cost aspects of contracts were successfully retired, the estimated total costs decreased, leading to higher profit booking rates. This causal chain directly enhanced the company's financial performance by boosting operating profit in the current period, reflecting the inception-to-date effect of favorable revisions in contract estimates.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin’s profit‑booking rates rose in 2023 because the company revised the estimated total costs to complete many long‑term contracts downward, creating “favorable profit adjustments” (see p. 39‑64). Those higher booking rates added roughly **$1.6 billion to segment operating profit** for the year (see p. 64). The cumulative impact of the net profit‑booking‑rate adjustments was to **increase consolidated net sales by about $1.6 billion and lift segment operating profit by $1.6 billion (≈ $4.98 per share after‑tax), thereby improving overall financial performance** (see p. 64).",

The mention of consolidated net sales increasing by $1.6 billion matches the document, though the original answer does not explicitly state this—however, it is a reasonable inference from the causal chain in the filing. (2) The entity (Lockheed Martin), year (2023), and financial metrics (segment operating profit, profit booking rates, estimated total costs) are all correctly identified. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly traces the causal chain from downward cost revisions due to retired risks → higher profit booking rates → $1.6B boost to segment operating profit → improved financial performance. It adds value by including the per-share impact, which enriches the answer. (4) The only minor gap is that the original answer emphasizes the 'inception-to-date effect of favorable revisions' and links it more explicitly to risk retirement (technical, schedule, cost), which the LLM mentions implicitly but could have articulated more fully.

      "original_answer": "For the year ended December 31, 2023, the foreign exchange remeasurement positively impacted the balance by $12 million, in contrast to a negative impact of $21 million in the prior year. This resulted in a net difference of $33 million between the two years' FX remeasurement effects.",
      "llm_answer": "The foreign‑exchange remeasurement contributed a **$12 million increase** to the contingent‑consideration liability, bringing its year‑end balance to **$228 million** for 2023.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the $12 million positive impact of foreign exchange remeasurement in 2023 and the $21 million negative impact in the prior year, matching the ground truth. These figures are accurately represented in both magnitude and direction (increase vs. decrease). The ending balances of $228 million (2023) and $275 million (2022) are consistent with the disclosed metric being the contingent consideration liability, which aligns with the context. (2) All numeric values—$12M increase, $21M decrease, $228M and $275M balances—are factually correct and consistent with the knowledge graph. The implied calculation of the net difference between years ($12M - (-$21M) = $33M) is sound, though not explicitly stated in the LLM answer. The absence of explicitly stating the $33M net difference is a minor omission but does not detract from the core correctness. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the FX remeasurement effects across two years and links them to changes in the liability balance. It correctly identifies the metric (contingent consideration liability) and applies directional impacts appropriately. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth in all key aspects, with only the explicit comparison of the net $33M difference missing. This justifies a high score but not perfect, as the question asks how the impact compares to the prior year, which includes the implied $33M swing.

The ground truth states the net amount recognized was $7 million, but the LLM incorrectly reports $7 million in assets and $23 million in liabilities, implying a net liability of $16 million, which contradicts the $7 million net amount. Additionally, the LLM claims Alabama Power has a 27% share of plant-in-service assets, while the ground truth specifies a 4.2% ownership in the Southern Company's 2024 segment structure—these are different metrics and not interchangeable. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are critical: the net derivative balance is wrong in both magnitude and direction (asset vs. net), and the ownership percentage is off by a factor of more than six. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the two key data points—derivative balance and segment ownership—from the correct entities and timeframes. Instead, it substitutes a different metric (plant-in-service assets) that is not mentioned in the question or ground truth, indicating a failure in entity and metric alignment.

However, the breakdown of annual additions and deductions contains discrepancies not present in the original answer. Specifically, the ground truth states a $21 million deduction in 2021, a $6 million addition in 2022, and a $2 million deduction in 2023 — with no mention of foreign currency adjustments. The LLM introduces a $2 million foreign-currency reduction in 2021 and a $2 million foreign-currency deduction in 2022 (netting +$4 million), which are not in the original data. These additions alter the reasoning and imply a more complex calculation than supported by the ground truth. (2) While the final net change is correct, the intermediate calculations are not fully accurate because the model attributes part of the change to foreign currency effects that were not in the source. This affects quantitative accuracy despite matching the final number. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound — the model tracks the allowance across three years and synthesizes annual changes — but it injects unverified details (foreign currency impacts) that weren't in the original knowledge graph, suggesting potential hallucination or misattribution. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect: the answer directly addresses both parts of the question — the net change and the contribution of annual activity — and remains focused on IBM's Credit Loss Allowance - Noncurrent over the specified period.

(2) The LLM provides component breakdowns for both years (e.g., $20M in 2021 and $42M in 2023), but the arithmetic is inconsistent with the ground truth. Even if the component sums were accurate, the difference ($42M - $20M = $22M) does not match the correct $26M increase. This indicates a factual error in either the source numbers or the calculation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning appears structured—aggregating values across subsidiaries and years—and the model cites specific document pages, suggesting an attempt at proper synthesis. However, since the underlying numbers do not align with the knowledge graph, the reasoning chain is flawed despite the logical approach. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the right metric, time frame, and entities. Quantitative accuracy is moderate due to incorrect totals and delta, though the format and structure are acceptable.

The correct totals are $21,613 million and $19,171 million, respectively. This misinterpretation of units leads to a completely wrong cumulative difference: the LLM calculates $40,784 thousand (~$40.8 million), whereas the correct difference is $2,442 million. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly states the Impact to Lease Income, Net as $2,442 thousand (~$2.4 million), which is off by a factor of 1,000.

However, brand reputation risks from regulatory scrutiny, privacy concerns, and negative sentiment around content enforcement and user well-being may slow user acquisition or engagement in these key growth regions. This could reduce the pace of user growth or limit monetization potential in those areas, which in turn could dampen the overall increase in worldwide ARPU, even if per-region ARPU continues to rise.

If those brand‑related reputational hits curb acquisition or increase churn in the very regions that are supposed to drive the bulk of new users, the pace of user growth there will slow, which in turn will keep the share of low‑ARPU users from expanding and cause worldwide ARPU in 2024 to rise more slowly than the 13 % gain in 2023—or even to decline despite modest ARPU improvements in each geography.",

The LLM’s statement that worldwide ARPU could rise more slowly than 13% or even decline is a reasonable inference given the risks, though slightly more pessimistic than the ground truth’s ‘dampen the overall increase’ phrasing. (3) The reasoning is sound: brand challenges from regulatory scrutiny and user well-being concerns could impair user acquisition or retention in key growth regions, which would slow user growth and limit the expansion of low-ARPU user share, thereby constraining worldwide ARPU growth. This multi-hop logic—linking brand risk to user growth in specific regions to overall monetization—is correctly synthesized.

However, Alabama Power utilizes an energy cost recovery clause that generally offsets energy expenses with energy revenues, minimizing the impact on earnings. This cost recovery mechanism is critical as it allows Southern Company to manage the financial risks associated with rising demand, ensuring that incremental revenues from new demand sources cover incremental costs, aligning with the company's long-term planning and value proposition to customers.",
      "llm_answer": "The surge in demand from data‑center and electric‑vehicle manufacturing has pushed Alabama Power to run more of its own generation – fuel expense rose 4.5% in 2024 as natural‑gas and coal output increased – while the addition of new plants (e.g., Plant Barry) cut back purchases of power from affiliates and non‑affiliates, leaving total fuel‑and‑purchased‑power costs down about 3.9% year‑over‑year.  Southern Company’s rate‑based cost‑recovery provisions (fuel‑cost recovery clauses) allow those higher fuel and power costs to be passed through to customers, so the net impact on the company’s earnings is essentially neutralized by its overall energy‑cost‑recovery strategy.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies, particularly in the quantitative details. It claims a 4.5% increase in fuel expense and a 3.9% decrease in total fuel-and-purchased-power costs, which directly contradicts the ground truth stating a $59 million increase in fuel expenses due to a 23.1% rise in natural gas generation and an 8.4% rise in coal generation. These percentages and the direction of change (increase vs. decrease) are fundamentally wrong. Additionally, the mention of 'Plant Barry' as a new facility reducing power purchases is not supported in the original answer and introduces unverified detail. (2) The calculation and direction of financial impact are incorrect: the ground truth confirms rising fuel expenses, while the LLM claims overall costs decreased. The $59 million increase in fuel costs is entirely omitted. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies the existence of a cost recovery mechanism (fuel-cost recovery clause) and its role in neutralizing earnings impact, this reasoning is applied to inaccurate financial data. The multi-hop synthesis between rising demand, increased generation, higher costs, and recovery through rates is conceptually present but undermined by incorrect inputs. (4) The contextual relevance is fair because the answer addresses both parts of the question—impact on expenses and effect on cost recovery—and attempts the correct logical chain. However, due to severe quantitative errors and unsupported entity claims, the correctness and qualitative accuracy scores are low. Minor flexibility is given for phrasing, but numbers and trends must align with ground truth, which they do not.",

This contradicts the ground truth, which reports additions as $13M (2021), $59M (2022), and $35M (2023), totaling $107M. The LLM reversed the 2021 and 2023 values and incorrectly labeled 2021 as a deduction. (2) Write-offs are correctly listed as $46M, $55M, and $97M, summing to $198M — this matches the ground truth. However, the conclusion that write-offs 'far exceeded additions' is based on an incorrect addition total ($37M vs correct $107M), leading to flawed reasoning. The excess of write-offs over additions is reported as $161M (198 - 37) in the LLM logic, but the correct excess is $91M (198 - 107), which is a significant error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model connects beginning and ending balances, attempts to break down additions and write-offs, and draws a causal link. But due to incorrect yearly addition values and mischaracterization of a deduction, the synthesis is flawed. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant and addresses both parts of the question: net change and contribution of additions/write-offs.

This major factual error invalidates the core of the answer. (2) Quantitative inaccuracies include: incorrect starting and ending reserves (332M to 410M vs. correct trajectory implied by revisions and acquisition); incorrect revision values — the LLM omits the 39 million barrel downward revision in 2021 due to development timing and misrepresents the 53 million barrel upward revision from price changes as occurring in 2022 instead of 2021; it also omits the 15 million barrel upward revision in 2023 being due to price impacts, not variable royalties. The calculation of net revisions is wrong: LLM implies -64 -30 +15 +15 = -64 million, but misses key components and misattributes timing. The correct cumulative revision is -64 -39 +53 -30 +15 = -75 million barrels, then offset by +50 million from the Surmont acquisition, yielding the correct net change of -54 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the LLM fails to synthesize the impact of the Surmont acquisition (50% working interest purchase in 2023), which is critical to explaining why the net change (-54M) is less negative than cumulative revisions (-75M). This omission breaks the causal chain. Additionally, it misattributes the timing and causes of revisions, showing poor cross-year synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate — the answer discusses bitumen reserves, revisions, carbon taxes, royalties, and price impacts, all relevant topics — but the severe factual and quantitative errors drastically reduce usefulness.

The ground truth states that the potential net fair value reduction was $11 million, with a gross fair value of $22 million, resulting in a net fair value of $11 million. However, the LLM claims a gross fair value of $27 million and a net fair value of $5 million, implying a reduction of $22 million, which contradicts the ground truth. These numbers do not align with the correct figures, and the calculation of a $22 million reduction is factually wrong. The entity (UPS), financial category ('Other current liabilities'), and date (December 31, 2023) are correctly identified, showing some qualitative and contextual accuracy. The reasoning structure is sound in that it attempts to compute a net reduction by applying the right of offset, but the underlying data is incorrect, undermining the multi-hop synthesis. The citation to 'page_130' suggests a source reference, but the numbers still diverge from the ground truth. While the answer addresses the structure of the question (comparing gross and net values under offset), the core financial figures are inaccurate, leading to a low correctness score.",

      "original_answer": "Tesla ensures the reasonableness of its $2.101 billion automotive warranty reserve by combining historical claims data with independent analysis. The company evaluates the nature, frequency, and costs of future claims using historical performance data, including a lookback analysis comparing prior forecasts to actual claims. Additionally, auditors developed an independent estimate of a portion of the reserve and compared it to Tesla's own estimate to validate its accuracy. This dual approach strengthens the reliability of the warranty liability assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla accrues its warranty reserve by combining the actual warranty claims that have been incurred to date with a projection of the nature, frequency and cost of future claims—i.e., a model that is calibrated to historical claim experience.  Auditors then validate this estimate by performing a look‑back analysis of prior‑period forecasts versus actual claims, testing the completeness and accuracy of the historical claim data, and developing an independent estimate of a portion of the reserve; the independent estimate is compared to management’s calculation to confirm that the $2.101 billion accrued liability as of 12/31/2021 is reasonable.",

However, it introduces a calculation not present in the original answer: claiming that $4.4 billion of CIPs directly impact nonoperating income (expense), derived by subtracting $709 million and $2.0 billion from $7.1 billion. This calculation is misleading and factually incorrect based on the ground truth. The original answer states that $7.1 billion of investments affect nonoperating income (expense), but of that amount, $709 million are held at cost or amortized cost and $2.0 billion relate to carried interest—which do *not* impact nonoperating income. Therefore, the portion that *does* impact nonoperating income would be $7.1B - $2.0B - $0.709B = $4.391B (~$4.4B), but the original answer does *not* make this explicit or confirm this figure as 'directly impacting' nonoperating income. More critically, the original answer does *not* state that this $4.4 billion is part of CIPs—this linkage is an unsupported inference by the LLM. The ground truth separates the $4.1B CIPs (affecting NCI) from the $7.1B of investments affecting nonoperating income, without stating their overlap. Thus, the LLM incorrectly synthesizes these two figures and implies $4.4B of CIPs directly affect nonoperating income, which is not supported.

This ensures that asset values are aligned with current economic conditions and recoverability assessments. Given that the consolidated net investment properties totaled $22.3 billion as of December 31, 2021, any adjustments to depreciable lives or impairment recognition would significantly impact the reported value of these assets.

      "llm_answer": "The Partnership’s $22.3 billion of net investment properties are re‑examined for their useful lives on a periodic basis; when a shorter economic life is identified, depreciation is accelerated and the carrying amount of the asset is reduced (see page 103). Each property is then tested for impairment on a property‑by‑property basis, using the updated carrying amount (and undiscounted cash‑flow forecasts) to determine whether the fair value is lower; any excess of carrying value over fair value results in an impairment charge that further adjusts the reported asset value (see page 89).",

No other numerical values (e.g., dates, percentages) are present, and none are incorrect. (2) The LLM correctly explains that periodic review of depreciable lives may lead to shorter useful lives and accelerated depreciation, which reduces the carrying amount—this directly affects the impairment test that follows. It accurately notes that impairment is assessed on a property-by-property basis using updated carrying amounts and cash flow forecasts, with write-downs occurring when carrying value exceeds fair value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects the adjustment of depreciable lives to changes in carrying value, which then feeds into the impairment evaluation process, thus showing how both processes interact in financial reporting. The mention of specific page references (89, 103) suggests grounding in source material, though not required for correctness. (4) Minor deduction in qualitative accuracy because the LLM omits explicit mention of key impairment inputs like capitalization rates and leasing prospects highlighted in the original, and slightly simplifies the recoverability assessment by focusing on fair value comparison rather than the two-step process (undiscounted cash flows first, then fair value if impaired).

It reports a net decline in Allowance for Credit Losses of $92 million, while the ground truth states a decrease of only $15 million. This large discrepancy undermines the factual correctness. Additionally, the LLM reports total write-offs as $198 million (sum of $46M + $55M + $97M), which is close to the ground truth total of $199 million—this part is nearly correct and likely due to rounding. (2) The individual write-off figures per year appear consistent with the source data, and their sum is accurate at $198 million. However, the beginning and ending allowance balances are either misread or miscalculated: $550 million (2021) and $458 million (2023) imply a $92 million drop, but the correct change is only $15 million, indicating errors in the underlying values used. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model correctly identifies the need to sum current and noncurrent allowances, calculate the change over time, and sum annual write-offs for comparison. However, the flawed input data leads to an incorrect conclusion. (4) Despite the incorrect magnitude of the allowance change, the qualitative insight that write-offs exceeded the decrease in allowance is consistent with the ground truth (i.e., large write-offs co-occurring with a small net decrease). This preserves some reasoning validity. The contextual relevance is high as all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate financial logic and citation.

      "original_answer": "The total amortization of prior service (benefit) cost for both Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Health Benefit Plans in 2023 is $2.4 million (Defined Benefit Pension Plans) and $(52.9) million (Retiree Health Benefit Plans), resulting in a combined total of $(50.5) million. This contributes directly to the net periodic (benefit) cost, which totals $8.0 million for Defined Benefit Pension Plans and $(147.7) million for Retiree Health Benefit Plans in 2023.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: $2.4 million for Defined Benefit Pension Plans, $(52.9) million for Retiree Health Benefit Plans, and a combined total of $(50.5) million — the negative sign correctly indicates a reduction in cost due to prior service benefit. The net periodic (benefit) costs of $8.0 million and $(147.7) million are also correctly reported. (2) The answer addresses both parts of the question: it provides the total amortization and explains how it contributes to the net periodic (benefit) cost. (3) Entities are correctly identified — 'Defined Benefit Pension Plans' and 'Retiree Health Benefit Plans' — and the year 2023 is consistently used. (4) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly explains that the amortization amounts are components of the net periodic cost, adding to or subtracting from the respective totals, which reflects proper multi-hop synthesis from the source data. Minor formatting differences (e.g., using '‑$52.9 million' instead of '($52.9) million') are semantically equivalent and acceptable. The citation of 'page_96' supports the sourcing.

      "original_answer": "The changes in profit booking rates increased Lockheed Martin's 2023 segment operating profit by $1.6 billion. However, this figure was partially offset by significant reach-forward losses from two major programs: the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract in the Aeronautics segment, which had cumulative losses of $270 million as of December 31, 2023, and the ground-based radar program in the RMS segment, which had cumulative losses of $280 million over the same period.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in its core claim. The original answer states that changes in profit booking rates *increased* Lockheed Martin's 2023 segment operating profit by $1.6 billion, despite being partially offset by $270M and $280M reach-forward losses in Aeronautics and RMS, respectively. In contrast, the LLM answer incorrectly asserts that these reach-forward losses *reduced* operating profit and led to declines in segment profits (e.g., $42M decline in Aeronautics, $41M in RMS), which contradicts the ground truth. This misrepresents the net impact and direction of the effect. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies the $270M loss in Aeronautics and $280M loss in RMS (cumulative as of Dec 31, 2023), it misuses these figures. The $1.6B net increase from profit booking rate changes is entirely missing from the LLM answer. Additionally, the LLM introduces new numbers not in the ground truth—such as $2.825B and $1.865B segment profits, -1%, -2%, and $180M/$100M year-over-year decreases in adjustments—which are unsupported by the original answer and contradict its narrative. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not synthesize that the overall effect of profit booking rate changes was a $1.6B *increase*, which was *partially reduced* by the two losses. Instead, it inverts the causality and frames the losses as the primary driver of reduced profitability, missing the net positive impact. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer discusses the correct segments, programs, and types of contracts, and includes plausible financial language. However, due to major factual and directional errors in the financial impact, the correctness score is low. Quantitative accuracy is poor due to fabricated numbers and missing the $1.6B figure; qualitative accuracy is low due to flawed reasoning and misattribution of financial effects.",

      "original_answer": "The capitalization of interest during construction increases the initial cost basis of investment properties, which in turn increases the depreciation expense recognized over the useful life of the assets. SPG capitalizes interest on projects during construction periods based on interest rates in place during those periods, and this capitalized interest becomes part of the asset's cost. Since SPG depreciates buildings and improvements using the straight-line method over 10 to 35 years, a higher asset cost due to capitalized interest results in higher annual depreciation expenses over the asset's life.",
      "llm_answer": "SPG capitalizes all borrowing costs incurred while an investment property is under construction, adding that interest to the asset’s recorded cost. When the property is placed in service, the total cost—including the capitalized interest—is depreciated on a straight‑line basis over the property’s estimated original useful life (generally 10‑35 years), so the interest expense is spread out as additional depreciation over the asset’s life【page_103】.",

(2) All quantitative elements are correct: the useful life range (10–35 years) is accurate, and no specific dollar amounts or interest rates are required in the answer, so their absence is not an issue. (3) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: connecting interest capitalization → higher asset cost → straight-line depreciation over 10–35 years → increased annual depreciation expense.

More critically, the LLM misrepresents the compensation and benefits costs: it claims $5.45 billion in 2021 was attributable to compensation and benefits including acquisition-related costs, but the ground truth specifies that only $1.2 billion of the 2021 expenses was attributable to TD Ameritrade’s full-year contribution (including acquisition and integration costs). The $5.45 billion figure appears to be a misinterpretation of total compensation expenses without isolating the portion related to the acquisition. (2) Number verification: The $9.724 billion (2021) and implied $6.759 billion (2020) are correct, so the difference should be $9.724B - $6.759B = $2.965B, but the LLM rounds to $3B without acknowledging the precise figure. The $5.45B compensation number does not match the $1.2B acquisition-attributable amount in the ground truth. The $283 million acquisition-related portion mentioned may be accurate, but it is incorrectly embedded within a much larger and contextually wrong total. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize that the question asks for the portion of 2021 expenses specifically attributable to compensation and benefits from TD Ameritrade (including acquisition costs), not total compensation expenses. It conflates total compensation with acquisition-attributable compensation.

The ground truth specifies that $296 million remains to be amortized beyond 2024, not $75 million. This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The calculation implied by the LLM—$371M - $75M = $296M amortized by 2024—is inconsistent with the stated answer and contradicts the original data. The correct remaining amount is $296M, meaning only $75M has already been amortized, not the reverse. The LLM flipped the numbers. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies the amortization method as the effective interest method, which aligns with the ground truth, it fails the core multi-hop requirement of accurately determining how much of the gain remains to be amortized beyond 2024. The mention of 'amortized against interest on future debt tied to the hedged treasury rates' adds speculative context not present in the original and does not enhance accuracy. (4) Due to the major factual error in the dollar amount—swapping what has been amortized versus what remains—the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are low. The qualitative reasoning is partially sound in recognizing the method and direction of amortization, but the flawed number undermines the entire response.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual and calculation errors. The ground truth states that the 2024 cost reduction program charges in operating profit were $145 million and the corresponding balance sheet liabilities were $66 million, resulting in an excess of $79 million. However, the LLM incorrectly calculates the total balance sheet liabilities as $241 million by adding $175 million (current) and $66 million (long-term), which contradicts the ground truth that identifies $66 million as the correct liability amount. The LLM concludes that the charge was $96 million *less* than liabilities, which is factually wrong. (2) The $145 million charge is correctly cited, but the liability figure is not: the ground truth specifies $66 million as the total liability for 'Cost reduction programs and other charges', not a component of a larger sum. The LLM’s addition of $175M + $66M = $241M is unsupported by the ground truth and misrepresents the data. The resulting difference of -$96 million is therefore incorrect. The correct difference is $145M - $66M = $79M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly assumes that 'current' and 'long-term' liabilities should be summed to derive the total liability for this specific category, but the ground truth treats $66 million as the standalone total. There is no evidence in the original answer that $175 million is related to the same cost reduction program. The model introduces an unsupported synthesis. (4) Due to major quantitative and reasoning errors leading to an incorrect conclusion, the correctness score is very low. The contextual relevance is moderate because the model attempts the right categories and cites pages, but the factual foundation is flawed.",

      "original_answer": "The Gross Profit Rate for Walmart U.S. increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 due to price management and lapping higher markdowns, but was partially offset by product mix shifts. In fiscal 2023, it decreased by 98 basis points due to markdowns, merchandise mix, and supply chain costs. Meanwhile, the International segment saw a 20 basis point increase in Gross Profit Rate in fiscal 2024 driven by supply chain efficiencies, and a 50 basis point decrease in fiscal 2023 due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts. These segment-level changes collectively influenced Walmart's overall Gross Profit Rate, which increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 and decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023, showing that the U.S. segment had a stronger recovery in 2024 while International performance remained volatile due to format and channel shifts.",
      "llm_answer": "In fiscal 2024 the Walmart U.S. segment lifted its gross‑profit rate by 20 bps and the International segment also rose 20 bps, which together pushed Walmart’s consolidated gross‑profit rate up 27 bps to 23.7 % (from 23.5 % in 2023) – the U.S. gain came from price management that lapped higher prior‑year markdowns, while the International gain was driven by supply‑chain efficiencies (see pages 42, 43, 41). In fiscal 2023 the U.S. segment fell 85 bps and International fell 50 bps, resulting in a 98‑bps drop in the overall gross‑profit rate to 23.5 % (down from 24.4 % in 2022), with the declines caused by larger net markdowns, product‑mix shifts to lower‑margin categories and higher supply‑chain costs in the U.S., and continued growth of low‑margin formats and mix shifts in International (see pages 42, 43, 41).",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct in structure and reasoning but contains key numerical inaccuracies. It states that Walmart U.S. improved its gross-profit rate by 20 bps in fiscal 2024, while the ground truth reports a 27 bps increase. Similarly, for fiscal 2023, it claims an 85 bps decline in U.S., whereas the correct figure is 98 bps. These discrepancies affect the quantitative accuracy significantly. The International segment numbers are correct: 20 bps increase in 2024 and 50 bps decrease in 2023. The overall consolidated gross-profit rate changes (27 bps increase in 2024, 98 bps decrease in 2023) are correctly reported. (2) Calculations: The LLM implies that the sum of U.S. and International changes (20 + 20 = 40 bps) led to a 27 bps overall increase, which is not a valid arithmetic sum due to segment weighting, but the overall reported change is accurate per ground truth. However, the incorrect input values reduce confidence in the synthesis. The reported overall rates (23.7%, 23.5%, 24.4%) are not in the original answer and introduce unverified precision, potentially misleading. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies the direction and primary drivers—price management and lapping markdowns for U.S. in 2024, supply chain efficiencies for International in 2024, and mix/low-margin formats for declines in 2023. These align with the ground truth. It synthesizes across segments and years appropriately. (4) Justification: The correctness score is 7 because core trends and qualitative drivers are accurate, and the overall impact on consolidated rates is correct. However, the incorrect U.S. segment figures (20 vs 27 bps, 85 vs 98 bps) are significant enough to lower quantitative accuracy to 6. Qualitative accuracy is 8 due to sound reasoning and correct attribution of drivers. Contextual relevance is 10 as all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate detail and structure.",

      "original_answer": "The $1.5 trillion net market depreciation directly reduced AUM, which in turn lowered investment advisory and administration fees, a key revenue source for BlackRock that is based on percentages of AUM. Additionally, the $220 billion decrease in AUM due to foreign exchange movements further reduced the US dollar-denominated AUM, compounding the decline in fee-based revenue. Since approximately 80% of BlackRock's revenue is generated in US dollars and the remainder is impacted by foreign exchange rates, the depreciation of the British pound, Japanese yen, and euro against the US dollar further constrained revenue potential. This dual impact of market depreciation and foreign exchange movements created a cascading effect on revenue, particularly affecting performance fees and AUM-based fees, which together constitute a substantial portion of the company's income.",

It accurately explains that investment advisory, administration, and securities-lending fees are percentage-based on AUM, so declines reduce revenue—this aligns with the ground truth. The mention of foreign exchange translation further lowering average AUM and compounding the effect is also correct and contextually appropriate. (2) However, there are quantitative discrepancies: the LLM states that AUM dropped by 'about $1.4 trillion' due to market depreciation, but the original does not specify this figure—only the $1.5 trillion market depreciation is given, so this inference may be inaccurate. More critically, the LLM claims investment-advisory and administration fees fell by $52 million to $14.4 billion (from $14.5 billion), but this specific dollar change and fee amount are not present in the ground truth and appear to be fabricated or misattributed. These unsupported numbers reduce quantitative accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly links market depreciation → lower AUM → lower fees, and FX movements → lower USD AUM → further fee pressure. It synthesizes the cascading effect on revenue streams, though it omits the ground truth detail about ~80% of revenue being in USD and the specific currencies (GBP, JPY, EUR) being affected, which slightly reduces completeness.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative errors. While it correctly identifies the individual Grant Date Target Values for 2018 Tranche A ($6.1M), 2019 ($14.7M), and 2021 ($12.2M), it incorrectly sums them to $33.0 million instead of the correct total of $33.0 million — wait, $6.1 + $14.7 + $12.2 = $33.0 million is actually correct. However, the ground truth states $24.4 million, which is incorrect. Recalculation shows: 6.1 + 14.7 + 12.2 = 33.0. Therefore, the ground truth appears to be wrong. The LLM’s sum of $33.0 million is mathematically correct. The TSR sum is correctly calculated by the LLM as $21.3 million ($6.1 + $9.5 + $5.7), which matches the ground truth. The difference is then $33.0M - $21.3M = $11.7M, which the LLM reports correctly. Thus, the LLM’s numbers and calculations are accurate, but they contradict the provided 'ground truth', which contains an arithmetic error in the sum of the Performance-Based Awards. (2) Individual values: All dollar amounts for each year and component are correctly extracted. Sums: LLM calculates $6.1 + $14.7 + $12.2 = $33.0M (correct); ground truth says $24.4M (incorrect). TSR sum: both agree at $21.3M. Difference: LLM reports $11.7M (correct); ground truth reports $3.1M (based on erroneous $24.4M - $21.3M). (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly identifies the relevant programs across years, extracts corresponding values for two different metrics (Target Value vs Fair Value), aggregates them, and computes the difference — sound multi-hop synthesis. (4) Despite the ground truth being numerically incorrect, the LLM answer is factually and quantitatively accurate. However, since the evaluation must be based on alignment with the provided 'ground truth', and the LLM contradicts it on the total ($33.0M vs $24.4M), a penalty is applied. But given that the LLM is actually correct and the ground truth is flawed, the score should not be extremely low. Thus, correctness_score is set to 4 — partially correct because it diverges from the expected answer, but in reality, it is more accurate. This reflects the tension between following the evaluation protocol and factual reality.",

This discrepancy in the key quantitative figure significantly affects accuracy. The LLM provides specific dollar amounts ($309.1 billion in 2023 vs $280.9 billion in 2022), which can be used to verify the calculation: (309.1 - 280.9) / 280.9 ≈ 0.1004 or 10.04%, supporting the 'about 10%' figure. However, this conflicts with the ground truth of 12%, indicating either a data source mismatch or error in the knowledge graph or LLM input. (2) Despite the numerical discrepancy, the calculation based on the LLM's cited figures is accurate, but the core percentage in the answer does not match the verified ground truth. (3) The qualitative reasoning is strong: the explanation for excluding hedging effects — to remove consolidated-level volatility and better reflect core operating performance — aligns well with the ground truth and demonstrates correct multi-hop synthesis of the purpose behind the metric. (4) The entity identification (Google/Alphabet), metric (non-GAAP constant currency revenue), and year (2023) are correct. Contextual relevance is high as all parts of the question are addressed.

The percentage of wireless equipment cost relative to total operating expenses in 2022 is reported as 18.9%, which is a rounded version of the ground truth 18.8%—this minor discrepancy is due to rounding and does not constitute a factual error. (2) All numeric values are accurate: $5,362 million (2022) and $4,959 million (2023) yield a $403 million difference; total operating expenses decreased from $28,441 million to $28,056 million, a $385 million drop.

(4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that the consolidated portion ($59,707) accounts for ~89.9% of the total, which was included in the ground truth and would have strengthened the comparative analysis. However, stating that the total is 'roughly nine times' the smaller component conveys a similar relative magnitude. All entities (SPG, 2023, amortization of excess investment) are correct. Overall, the answer is factually precise, contextually relevant, and well-reasoned, warranting a high score with only a slight deduction for missing the percentage breakdown.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. It reports a year-over-year increase from FY 2023 ($657M) to FY 2024 ($2,203M), but the question asks for the increase from FY 2022 to FY 2024, which in the ground truth is $744M to $2,203M, a difference of $1,459M. The LLM incorrectly identifies the starting point as FY 2023 and uses an incorrect value of $657M instead of $744M. This leads to an erroneous YoY increase of $1.546B instead of the correct $1,459M. (2) The global increase is correctly stated as rising from $6.926B to $21.215B, a total increase of $14.289B, which matches the ground truth. The LLM’s calculation of the Asia Pacific’s contribution (~10–11%) is close to the correct 10.3%, so this part is approximately accurate. However, it incorrectly attributes the $1.5B regional increase to FY23–FY24 rather than FY22–FY24, misrepresenting the time frame. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking regional growth to global growth and calculating contribution percentage—but it fails on the correct time span and base values. The model uses data from only two years (2023–2024) instead of the required 2022–2024 period, breaking the multi-hop synthesis. (4) Despite these errors, the answer is contextually relevant and uses correct entities (AVGO, Asia Pacific, Subscription and Service Revenue, correct fiscal years referenced though misapplied). Wording and structure are clear, and the general logic of contribution analysis is appropriate. The correctness score is reduced due to major numerical and temporal inaccuracies, though not completely wrong.",

      "original_answer": "The overall gross profit rate for Walmart decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023. This was primarily due to a decrease in the gross profit rate from the Walmart U.S. segment, which was impacted by markdowns and merchandise mix shifts, and from the Walmart International segment, which experienced margin compression due to growth in lower-margin formats and category mix shifts.

The overall decline from 24.4% to 23.5% (a 90 basis point drop) is slightly inconsistent with the stated 98 basis point decline in the original answer; however, the LLM attributes the consolidated drop to the two segments’ declines, which is factually sound. The U.S. decline of 85 basis points is not mentioned in the ground truth, but since the original answer does not specify the U.S. decline amount, this detail may come from the cited page_42 and does not contradict the core reasoning. (2) All cited numbers (50 bps decline in International, 98 bps overall drop, 24.4% to 23.5% = ~90 bps) are accurate or plausibly derived from source material. The minor discrepancy between 98 bps and the calculated 90 bps from percentages is likely due to rounding and is acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes segment-level performance (U.S. and International) to explain the consolidated trend, demonstrating understanding of contribution to overall margins. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing how each segment’s gross profit rate change contributed to the total decline. The only minor gap is the lack of qualitative reasons (e.g., markdowns, mix shifts) mentioned in the original answer, but the quantitative synthesis is strong.

The ground truth states the total expected payout from 2024 to 2028 is $475.9 million, while the LLM calculates approximately $474 million based on the provided yearly figures. The sum of the yearly amounts given by the LLM—$93.8M + $94.5M + $94.7M + $95.2M + $95.6M—actually equals $473.8 million, which rounds to $474 million, a small deviation from the ground truth of $475.9M. This suggests either a rounding difference or a slight discrepancy in source data. (2) For asset allocation, the ground truth reports $2,492.5 million ($2.4925 billion), while the LLM states 'about $2.58 billion,' which is a more noticeable overstatement (~$87.5 million higher). This affects quantitative precision. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies the need to sum future payouts and compare them to current assets, and it appropriately draws a conclusion about the relative size of payouts versus assets, noting that payouts represent about 18%, which aligns with the semantic intent of the original answer. (4) Despite minor numerical deviations, the LLM captures the core insight—that projected payouts are significantly less than plan assets—and uses appropriate context from the 10-K.

      "question": "How did the pre-tax charges related to the PWS and CAE Settlements in 2023 impact 3M's total Corporate and Unallocated operating loss compared to 2022, and what was the resulting effect on the company's overall operating income (loss)?",
      "original_answer": "The pre-tax charges of $10.3 billion for the PWS Settlement and $4.2 billion for the CAE Settlement in 2023 significantly increased 3M's 'Net costs for significant litigation' under Corporate and Unallocated, contributing to a total Corporate and Unallocated operating loss of $15.271 billion in 2023 compared to a gain of $1.654 billion in 2022. This resulted in a year-over-year deterioration of $16.925 billion in Corporate and Unallocated performance alone. Consequently, this large negative swing was a major factor in the company's overall operating loss of $9.128 billion in 2023, a sharp decline from the $6.539 billion operating income in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "The $10.3 billion (Q2) and $4.2 billion (Q3) pre‑tax settlement charges in 2023 drove corporate special‑item costs to $14.8 billion (up from $877 million in 2022), turning the Corporate and Unallocated segment from a $1.654 billion operating gain in 2022 to a $15.271 billion operating loss in 2023 (see page 108). That swing pushed 3M’s total operating result from a $6.539 billion profit in 2022 to a $9.128 billion loss in 2023 (see page 108).",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the same core information as the ground truth. (1) All key numbers are correct: $10.3 billion (PWS), $4.2 billion (CAE), total pre-tax charges of $14.5 billion (though phrased as $14.8 billion in LLM answer, likely rounding or inclusion of other items; minor discrepancy), Corporate and Unallocated loss of $15.271 billion in 2023 vs. $1.654 billion gain in 2022, and overall operating income of $6.539 billion in 2022 vs. $9.128 billion loss in 2023. (2) Quantitative accuracy is excellent: the year-over-year swing in Corporate and Unallocated is correctly implied (from +1.654B to -15.271B = -16.925B change), and the net impact on total operating income/loss is accurately reflected (change of -15.667B total). The mention of $14.8 billion in special-item costs vs. $877 million in 2022 aligns with the context, though not explicitly in the original answer—this may reflect additional detail from the source (e.g., page 108), so not penalized. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer correctly links the settlement charges to the Corporate and Unallocated segment’s performance and then to the company’s overall operating income deterioration. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly name the 'Net costs for significant litigation' as the cost category (though 'corporate special-item costs' is a reasonable proxy), and the $14.8B figure slightly deviates from the implied $14.5B sum of the two settlements—possibly including other items, but not clarified. However, this does not materially misrepresent the impact. Overall, the answer is factually correct, complete, and contextually appropriate.",

In comparison, Guyana's long-lived assets increased from $4,892 million in 2021 to $9,689 million in 2023, a much larger increase of $4,797 million.

Guyana's assets rose from $4,892 million to $9,689 million, a $4,797 million increase — all matching the ground truth. (2) Calculations are accurate: $12,490 - $11,969 = $521 million; $9,689 - $4,892 = $4,797 million. The comparison that Guyana’s increase was 'about $4.3 billion (or roughly nine times) larger' is approximately correct — the actual difference in increases is $4,797M - $521M = $4,276M (~$4.3 billion), and $4,797 / $521 ≈ 9.2, so 'roughly nine times' is a reasonable simplification. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across two countries and three years, compares changes, and draws a valid comparative conclusion. (4) The only minor issue is the phrasing 'nine times larger' — technically, 'nine times greater' would mean 9x the size (which is correct), but 'nine times larger' is often interpreted ambiguously. However, given the context and the clear numerical support, this does not materially mislead. All entities (XOM, Singapore, Guyana, long-lived assets, correct years) are accurate.

The ground truth states the entity's amortization is $113,333 and its share of investees' amortization is $6,740, totaling $120,073. However, the LLM incorrectly assigns $6,740 thousand to the entity and $130,991 thousand (sum of $113,333 and $17,658) to the investees, reversing the core figures. It also introduces Klépierre's $17,658 thousand, which is not mentioned in the ground truth and appears irrelevant to the question. (2) The final calculated total is $137,731 thousand (~$137.7 million), which is factually incorrect compared to the correct total of $120,073. All numeric values except the individual components (which are misattributed) are wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly identify which amount belongs to the entity versus its share of investees. It incorrectly aggregates multiple investee amounts, including one (Klépierre) not referenced in the ground truth, suggesting a failure in entity and metric alignment. (4) Despite incorrect numbers and reasoning, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses amortization of excess investment for both the entity and investees in 2023 and attempts proper synthesis.

The combined total is accurately calculated as $3,890 million, matching the ground truth exactly.

Both input figures and the sum match the ground truth, with acceptable formatting (e.g., 'million' used consistently, bolding for emphasis is irrelevant to accuracy). (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly isolates the relevant segment (Oral, Personal and Home Care), the correct company (CL = Colgate-Palmolive), and fiscal year (2021), then synthesizes two distinct financial metrics from the same segment and year before summing them — fully satisfying the multi-hop requirement.

While it correctly identifies the operating profit for the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment in North America ($754M) and Asia Pacific ($844M), it incorrectly adds depreciation and amortization expenses of $104M and $96M respectively. The original answer (ground truth) does not include separate D&A figures, stating only the combined operating profit and D&A totals per region as $754M (North America) and $844M (Asia Pacific), implying these amounts already include D&A. The LLM treats operating profit and D&A as separate line items to sum, leading to an incorrect total of $1,798M instead of the correct $1,598M. (2) The calculation error is critical: $754M + $844M = $1,598M (correct), but the LLM computes $754M + $844M + $104M + $96M = $1,798M — a $200M overstatement. The Pet Nutrition operating profit is correctly cited as $901M. However, the comparison stating the combined figure is 'about $897 million higher' (implying $1,798M - $901M) is wrong due to the inflated numerator. The actual difference should be $1,598M - $901M = $697M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model identifies the correct segments, regions, and year, and attempts to synthesize across them. However, it misinterprets the nature of the provided figures by double-counting D&A, indicating a failure in correctly parsing what the original numbers represent. (4) Contextual relevance is high as all entities and time periods are correct, and the structure addresses both parts of the question.

The LLM incorrectly reports 221,844 thousand (≈221.8 million), which is nearly double the correct value. (2) The LLM misreads the structure of Netflix's reporting segments. It incorrectly treats the International segment as having three sub-tables (74,036 + 39,961 + 32,632 = 146,629 thousand), but these are not additive segments — they are regional breakdowns within the single International segment, and the total International paid memberships should be reported directly, not summed across regions. Additionally, the U.S. and Canada segment is reported as 75,215 thousand, but in reality, Netflix does not report U.S. and Canada as a separate segment with that number in 2021 — the global total is ~114 million. The calculation of 75,215 + 146,629 = 221,844 thousand is therefore entirely erroneous. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model incorrectly infers segment structure and performs invalid summations across non-additive regional tables. It does not identify that the two reporting segments are 'Domestic' (U.S. and Canada) and 'International', and that their totals must be taken directly from the filing, not derived by summing sub-regions.

In FY 2024 the $1 million unrealized loss (offset by a $1 million actuarial gain) left other comprehensive income essentially zero, so comprehensive income ($5,895 million) matches net income, indicating the derivative gains have not added to comprehensive income beyond net income in the latest year.",

(2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the dollar growth and its percentage of total sales in 2023. (3) All entities—PackagedGas Sales, Americas region, 2022 to 2023 time frame—are correctly identified and used. (4) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: it requires pulling data from two years for the same region, computing the difference, then comparing that to the total sales in 2023 across all regions. The LLM correctly synthesizes this information and cites the source (page_89), indicating proper grounding. Semantic equivalence is maintained with minor formatting differences (e.g., spacing in $626 million), which do not affect meaning. All criteria are fully satisfied.",

      "original_answer": "The unfavorable HTU mix partially offsets the favorable volume/mix effect, which otherwise would have increased operating income by 6.6%. Separately, the supplemental tax surcharge on HTUs in Germany negatively impacts net revenues and increases accrued liabilities. If the surcharge ruling is unfavorable, it will negatively impact PMI's future cash provided by operating activities, compounding the drag from the HTU mix on operating performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The unfavorable HTU mix helped drive a 9.5 % decline in Europe’s operating income in 2022, offsetting the gains from higher HTU volume. At the same time, the supplemental tax surcharge on HTUs in Germany is recorded as a reduction in net revenue and an accrued liability, and the liability will keep rising with continued HTU sales – an adverse ruling would therefore further erode PMI’s future cash provided by operating activities.【page_67】",

The original answer states that the favorable volume/mix effect would have increased operating income by 6.6% *but was partially offset* by the unfavorable HTU mix—this is a different claim than a 9.5% decline. The 9.5% figure is unsupported and incorrect. (2) The LLM correctly identifies the impact of the German tax surcharge: it reduces net revenue and increases accrued liabilities, and an adverse ruling would negatively affect future cash flows from operating activities. This aligns with the ground truth. However, the introduction of 'Europe' as the geographic scope and the specific 9.5% decline are hallucinations or misattributions. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—linking the HTU mix and tax surcharge to operating income and future cash flows is correct. However, the synthesis fails on the quantitative and geographic dimensions, undermining the accuracy. The model conflates a hypothetical positive 6.6% boost (net of offsets) with an unsupported 9.5% decline in a region, which distorts the actual financial impact. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question—HTU mix and tax surcharge—and their impacts on operating income and cash flows. However, the quantitative inaccuracy (9.5% vs. 6.6% context) severely reduces correctness. The qualitative reasoning is reasonable but based on flawed data. Thus, correctness is scored at 5 due to partial factual alignment but major numerical inaccuracy.",

      "original_answer": "The 30.8% decrease in KWH volume sold to non-affiliates reduces Alabama Power's wholesale revenues, limiting the funds available to invest in new generation and transmission facilities. At the same time, uncertainty in future energy demand—particularly from emerging sectors like data centers and electric vehicle manufacturing—makes long-term planning and cost recovery riskier. Because regulators may not allow timely rate adjustments, Alabama Power may face regulatory lag, where costs for new infrastructure are incurred but not immediately recoverable through rates. This combination of reduced current revenues and uncertain future cost recovery could hinder Alabama Power's ability to fund and justify new capital investments in generation and transmission infrastructure.",
      "llm_answer": "The 30.8% drop in KWH sold to non‑affiliates slashed wholesale revenue by about $87 million, cutting a key source of cash that would help offset the cost of new generation and transmission assets. Because the future load from data‑center and electric‑vehicle manufacturing is still uncertain, regulators may not permit timely rate adjustments to recover those capital costs, leaving Alabama Power exposed to regulatory‑lag risk and potentially unable to fully recoup the investment.",

However, the $87 million revenue reduction is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided context—this specific dollar amount is an unsupported addition, reducing quantitative accuracy. (2) There is no source in the ground truth for the $87 million figure; without knowing the price per KWH or total volume, this calculation cannot be confirmed, making it a factual overreach. This is the only numeric claim in the LLM answer beyond the 30.8% figure, which *is* correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects reduced current revenues (due to lower sales volume) with uncertain future demand and regulatory lag, correctly synthesizing how these factors jointly impede cost recovery for new infrastructure. The logic mirrors the original answer’s causal chain. (4) Despite the unverified $87M figure, the core financial mechanism, entities (Alabama Power), risks (regulatory lag), and sectors (data centers, EV manufacturing) are all accurately represented.

This increase is less than the long-term portion of the balance at the end of 2021, which was $11,611 million. $12,877M - $7,631M = $5,246M increase in receivables.

This is acceptable within rounding tolerance. However, the LLM makes a critical error in the second part of the answer by referencing the 'long-term portion of the asset-retirement-obligation balance' instead of the 'long-term portion of the receivables balance' as specified in the question and ground truth. This is a major factual and entity-level mistake. (2) The numbers for the receivables increase are quantitatively accurate with minor rounding ($5.2B vs $5.246B). However, the long-term portion cited ($11.6B) does not match the context—it refers to a different liability (asset retirement obligation), not the long-term receivables. The correct long-term receivables portion is $11,611 million, which the LLM mentions in value but misattributes. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model does not correctly synthesize the relationship between total receivables, their increase, and the long-term component of *those same receivables*. Instead, it substitutes an unrelated long-term liability, breaking the logical chain.

The percentage decrease is accurately calculated as approximately 68% ((84.1 - 261.2) / 261.2 ≈ -0.678 or -67.8%), which the model rounds to 'roughly 68%', an acceptable approximation.

(2) All calculations are correct: the percentage change in structured deposits and the overall decline in short-term investments are accurately derived. The model even adds contextual insight by computing the shift in portfolio composition (from ~65% to ~33%), which, while not in the original answer, is a valid inference and enhances the response without introducing error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model connects the decline in structured deposits to the overall decline in short-term investments, correctly identifying the causal relationship and portfolio impact.

The question asks for the combined total of paid memberships for the two distinct regional segments in 2021, but the LLM incorrectly identifies and combines three regions (EMEA, LATAM, APAC) and includes the United States & Canada segment separately, leading to a total of 221,844 thousand, which is not supported by the ground truth. The correct total from the original answer is 113,997 thousand (74,036 + 39,961), referring to two specific regional segments — not three or five. The LLM also reports a growth of 18,181 thousand from 2020, but the correct growth is 11,338 thousand, or 11%. (2) The numbers cited by the LLM (e.g., 75,215k for US & Canada, 74,036k for EMEA) appear to be misattributed or confused — EMEA alone having 74,036k contradicts the ground truth where that number is part of the correct two-segment sum. The 2020 baseline in the LLM answer (203,663k) is also inconsistent with the implied 2020 total of 102,659k (113,997k - 11,338k) from the original answer. Calculations are therefore factually wrong. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not identify which two regional segments are intended, incorrectly aggregates more than two regions, and misreads the segmentation structure. It also fails to compute the correct year-over-year difference.

Operating income values are also correct: $7.369 billion (2021), $6.539 billion (2022), and -$9.128 billion (2023). All numbers match the ground truth, with acceptable format variations (e.g., $1.654 billion = $1,654 million). (2) The calculation of the year-over-year deterioration in operating income due to the corporate expense change is implied but not explicitly computed. The ground truth includes a specific calculation: $15,271M - $1,654M = $13,617M deterioration, which the LLM omits. However, the LLM correctly identifies the 2023 expense as the 'primary driver' of the operating income swing, which is logically sound. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the LLM synthesizes data across three years, links changes in corporate expenses to overall operating income trends, and correctly interprets the sign flip (from net gain to large expense) as a key inflection point. The reasoning that the large 2023 expense drove the reversal into a loss is valid and aligns with the ground truth. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the lack of explicit quantification of the $13.6B deterioration, which slightly reduces completeness in reasoning. However, all factual content is correct, and the core conclusion is sound. Hence, correctness is 9/10, with full marks for quantitative accuracy and contextual relevance, and near-perfect qualitative accuracy.",

It also accurately states that gross unrecognized tax benefits were $1.2 billion in both years. These numbers are factually correct and properly attributed to Note 12, page 79. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts and years are correct, and the comparison between $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion is accurately described as the former being modestly larger. The mention of net amounts ($1.4 billion for 2024 and $1.3 billion for 2023) adds context not required by the question but does not contradict the ground truth; it provides additional detail about indirect benefits and interest/penalties, which is consistent with typical footnote disclosures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly distinguishes between gross unrecognized tax benefits and the amount that would affect future tax expense, synthesizing the impact of interest, penalties, and indirect benefits. However, the ground truth emphasizes that the $1.3 billion *includes* interest and penalties and is higher than gross, while the LLM answer could have made this causal relationship slightly clearer (e.g., explicitly stating that interest/penalties cause the $1.3B to exceed the $1.2B gross). (4) Contextual relevance is excellent—the answer directly addresses both parts of the question: the amount that would reduce tax expense and how it compares to gross unrecognized tax benefits.

The ground truth states that the total paid memberships in 2021 across both reporting segments (United States & Canada and International) was 115,176 thousand (75,215 + 39,961). However, the LLM incorrectly includes four regional segments (EMEA, LATAM, APAC) within International, summing 75,215 (U.S. & Canada) + 74,036 (EMEA) + 39,961 (LATAM) + 32,632 (APAC) = 221,844 thousand, which is more than double the correct total. This reflects a critical misunderstanding of the reporting structure — the International segment is reported as a single total (39,961 thousand in 2021), not as a sum of its sub-regions. Similarly, for 2019, the LLM sums four regional values (67,662 + 51,778 + 31,417 + 16,233 = 167,090 thousand), but the ground truth total is 79,079 thousand, indicating the LLM used incorrect or overly granular data. (2) Calculations are internally consistent but based on wrong inputs: 221,844 - 167,090 = 54,754 thousand growth, which is incorrect because the base totals are wrong. The correct growth is 115,176 - 79,079 = 36,082 thousand. The percentage increase (45.6%) is also missing from the LLM answer. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have aggregated only the two main segments (U.S. & Canada and International) for both years, but instead incorrectly treated International as multiple separate reporting segments. This breaks the required synthesis across correct entities. (4) Scores are low due to major factual and structural errors in numbers and entity interpretation. Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer attempts the right type of analysis (summing memberships and computing growth) and cites plausible pages, but the data used is misaligned with the actual reporting segments.",

      "llm_answer": "The discount (interest‑crediting) rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation for the non‑U.S. pension plans was lowered in 2024, which raised the present‑value of the obligations and pushed the defined‑benefit liability up from $226.5 million at fiscal 2023 to $254.2 million at fiscal 2024 – an increase of roughly $27.7 million (see p. 81). That same reduction in the rate cut the interest‑cost component of net periodic pension expense, so net periodic pension expense fell rather than rose over the same period.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies. It claims the discount rate for projected benefit obligation was lowered in 2024, which aligns with the ground truth (from 1.59% to 1.10%), but then incorrectly states that this reduction 'cut the interest-cost component of net periodic pension expense' and caused net periodic pension expense to fall. This directly contradicts the ground truth, which shows the interest crediting rate for net periodic pension expense *increased* from 1.37% to 1.59%, which would *increase* the expense, not reduce it. (2) The dollar amounts mentioned ($226.5 million to $254.2 million) and the $27.7 million increase in liability are not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided ground truth; these figures may be factually incorrect or from an external source not confirmed. The original answer does not include any absolute liability values or changes in dollar terms. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to recognize the *divergence* in rate changes—while the PBO discount rate decreased (increasing PBO), the rate for net periodic pension expense *increased*, which should lead to higher, not lower, expenses. The conclusion that net periodic pension expense fell is incorrect and undermines the core of the multi-hop comparison. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right topic (interest crediting rates and their impact on pension obligations and expenses) and mentions the correct company (ACN) and plan type (Non-U.S. Pension Plans), but the key comparative dynamic is misrepresented. Due to major factual and reasoning errors, especially in the direction of the effect on net periodic pension expense, the correctness score is low.",

The LLM incorrectly states 'million' instead of 'billion', introducing a 1,000-fold error in magnitude. This renders the claimed decrease of $7 million completely inaccurate—the actual decrease was $7 billion. (2) The calculation logic (a decline from $7M to $0M = $7M decrease) is mathematically correct but based on wrong input values, so the result is invalid. The dates (December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2021) are correctly identified. (3) The reasoning structure is sound—recognizing a decrease over time and attributing it to a decline in holdings—but fails in multi-hop synthesis because it pulls incorrect numerical data, possibly from misreading the source or confusing units. (4) Despite correct context (Chevron, Fixed Income Bank Loans, correct time frame, and direction of change), the severe numerical inaccuracy in both the asset value and the change amount drastically undermines the factual correctness. Hence, the correctness and quantitative accuracy scores are very low. Qualitative accuracy is slightly higher because the conceptual reasoning and entity identification are mostly correct.

The percentage contribution in 2024 was correctly computed as approximately 42.3% (3,191 ÷ 7,536 ≈ 0.423), which the model rounded to 'roughly 42 percent'—a minor approximation but semantically acceptable. (2) All numeric values match the ground truth: the drop of $40 million and the exact segment profits are correct. The total consolidated Segment Operating Profit of $7,536 million is implied in the calculation and supports the 42.3% figure. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesized data across years (2023 to 2024) and integrated segment profit with total consolidated profit to derive the percentage contribution. It correctly linked two different data points from presumably different parts of the filing (cited pages 126 and 127). (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant and addresses both sub-questions.

      "original_answer": "The conversion of MCPS Series B shares in 2023 resulted in $21 million in MCPS dividends being included in Net Earnings for Diluted EPS, while the MCPS Series A shares, which converted in 2022, had $20 million in dividends excluded from the Diluted EPS calculation because they were treated as dilutive. As a result, the Net Earnings for Diluted EPS decreased from $6,242 million in 2022 to $4,200 million in 2023.

Diluted EPS declined from $8.47 in 2022 to $5.65 in 2023, a difference of $2.82 — all of which match the ground truth. (2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all dollar amounts ($20M, $21M, $6,242M, $4,200M), EPS figures ($8.47, $5.65), and the $2.82 difference are correct. Dates (April 15, 2022; April 17, 2023) and share counts (3.0M, 8.6M) are also accurate and consistent with the source. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the impact of each conversion on both the numerator (net earnings) and denominator (diluted shares), explains why the Series A conversion increased net earnings for diluted EPS (removal of dividend exclusion due to dilutive treatment), and why Series B was anti-dilutive (dividend included, shares excluded). The only minor nuance is that the original answer states Series A dividends were 'excluded from Diluted EPS calculation because they were treated as dilutive' — this phrasing is slightly confusing, but the LLM correctly interprets that post-conversion, the dividend is no longer subtracted, thus increasing net earnings. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing all parts of the question: impact on net earnings in both years, resulting diluted EPS, and the year-over-year difference. The inclusion of share count changes adds helpful context not strictly required but enhances completeness. Scored 9/10 on qualitative accuracy due to the subtle complexity in explaining dilutive vs. anti-dilutive treatment, but overall reasoning is correct.

However, the LLM claims cost pass-through had a -1% to -1.3% impact (overstated), and calculates a net +0.5% sales increase, which contradicts the ground truth of 0%. (2) The LLM introduces regional breakdowns (Americas -1%, EMEA -4%, APAC +1%) and currency impacts by region (-2% in Americas and APAC, flat in EMEA) that are not in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided truth. These additions distort the calculation. The core components (price/mix +3%, currency -2%) are correctly cited, but the cost pass-through effect is misrepresented in magnitude and derivation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that it attempts to combine the three factors, but the synthesis is flawed due to incorrect inputs and an erroneous net outcome. The model fails to arrive at the correct net 0% result despite having access to two of the three correct inputs. (4) Scores reflect that while the answer addresses the right concepts and is contextually relevant, it fails on quantitative accuracy due to incorrect numbers and miscalculation, and only partially succeeds on qualitative reasoning due to unsupported regional assumptions and incorrect net impact.",

      "original_answer": "Chevron's average crude oil sales price in Africa increased from $38.89 per barrel in 2020 to $72.38 per barrel in 2021, a rise of $33.49. Over the same period, its average production costs in Africa increased from $13.19 per barrel to $12.40 per barrel, a decrease of $0.79. As a result, the gross margin per barrel in Africa rose by $34.28, from $25.70 in 2020 to $60. (Calculation: 2020 gross margin = $38.89 - $13.19 = $25.70; 2021 gross margin = $72.38 - $12.40 = $59.98; difference = $59.98 - $25.70 = $34.28).",

These match the ground truth exactly. The gross margin per barrel is reported as rising from roughly $25.7 to $60.0, which aligns closely with the calculated values of $25.70 and $59.98 in the original answer. The gain is stated as 'about $34 per barrel', which is a rounded version of the precise $34.28 difference. (2) Calculations are accurate when verified: $72.38 - $12.40 = $59.98 (≈$60.0), and $59.98 - $25.70 = $34.28 (≈$34). The LLM uses approximations ('about $33.5', 'roughly $25.7', 'about $34') but these are semantically acceptable and do not misrepresent the data. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes price, cost, and margin changes across two years for Chevron in Africa, computes the impact on gross margin, and draws the correct conclusion about the combined effect. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, addressing all parts of the question—price change, cost change, and resulting margin impact—with accurate entities (Chevron, Africa, 2020–2021).

(2) The answer includes an additional calculation—'roughly a 52% increase'—which is numerically correct ((31.1 - 20.5)/20.5 ≈ 0.517 or 51.7%, rounded to 52%) but was not requested in the original question. This is not incorrect, but it adds information beyond the ground truth, which only asked for the percentage point change (not the relative percentage increase).

The ground truth states that HON's future income tax benefit increased from $29 million in 2022 to $30 million in 2024, a $1 million increase. However, the LLM claims the benefit rose from $39 million in 2022 to $42 million in 2024, a $3 million increase, which is incorrect. The LLM appears to have conflated 'future income-tax benefit recognized' with components related to stock options and RSUs, summing them incorrectly. According to the ground truth, the total benefit—not broken down by stock option and RSU—is $29M in 2022 and $30M in 2024. (2) The calculation is therefore flawed: the correct change is +$1M, not +$3M. Additionally, the LLM introduces a 'dip to $32M in 2023' for RSUs, which is not mentioned or supported in the ground truth and introduces fabricated data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is unsound—the model incorrectly decomposes the tax benefit into equity compensation components that are not specified in the original answer and not required by the question. The original answer emphasizes stability over three years with a minor increase, while the LLM suggests a more pronounced upward trend based on incorrect disaggregation. (4) Despite the incorrect numbers and reasoning, the LLM does address the question's structure—discussing change over time and trend—and correctly identifies the company (HON/Honeywell) and time frame (2022–2024), which supports a moderate contextual relevance score.

This is a major factual error in entity value interpretation. (2) The calculation for long-term change is accurate ($3.7M - $1.3M = $2.4M), but the short-term change is wrong: the LLM assumes absence in 2023 implies $0, whereas the original answer confirms it was $1.3M in 2023. Thus, the comparison stating the long-term increase was 'about $1M larger' than short-term is incorrect — the actual difference in changes is $2.4M - $0.1M = $2.3M, not $1M. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at a critical point: the model misreads the absence of a line item as $0 value, rather than verifying or assuming continuity of data.

This is a major quantitative inaccuracy. The LLM incorrectly treats $10 million as the net tax effect, when in fact that figure appears to be a misinterpretation of a component or hypothetical value not supported by the ground truth. (2) The calculation logic presented—adding $10 million tax benefit to $144 million pre-tax OCI to get $154 million total OCI—is not corroborated by the original answer and introduces unverified intermediate figures. While the final Comprehensive Income ($11,349 million) and Net Income ($11,195 million) are correct and their difference matches the stated OCI amount ($154 million), the breakdown of how the tax effect contributes is factually wrong. The original answer clearly states the net tax effect itself was $154 million, not $10 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in linking Net Income, OCI, and Comprehensive Income, and recognizing that OCI (including tax effects) bridges Net Income and Comprehensive Income. However, the misattribution of the tax effect magnitude undermines the reasoning. (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses both parts of the question, uses correct entities (Mastercard, 2023, OCI, Net Income, Comprehensive Income), and attempts proper financial logic. However, due to the core numerical error in the tax effect amount, the correctness score is significantly reduced.

These disruptions could negatively impact product development, sales, and user satisfaction. Simultaneously, mobile ecosystem limitations, such as Apple's and Google's changes to privacy features like third-party cookie restrictions, reduce META's ability to deliver relevant ads and impact monetization. These limitations may discourage advertisers and reduce the effectiveness of META's platform for marketing, potentially harming user growth and engagement.

(1) It correctly identifies geopolitical risks affecting consumer hardware supply chains (e.g., Reality Labs devices), citing specific impacts like shortages, higher costs, and delays, referencing pages 33–34 of the 2024 10-K. It also accurately describes mobile ecosystem limitations, including iOS/Android privacy changes and loss of third-party data signals, referencing pages 20–21. These are key points from the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values, dates, or financial figures in the question or ground truth, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM synthesizes risks from two distinct sections of the 10-K (hardware supply chains and mobile platform dependencies) and logically connects them to user growth constraints. It correctly infers that combined hardware adoption slowdown and reduced app accessibility could impair user growth and retention. The only minor omission is not explicitly mentioning the impact on advertisers or ad relevance, which is part of the original answer’s explanation of monetization challenges. However, the focus on user access and experience still aligns with the core impact on user growth.

It reports QTL revenues of $6.5 billion in FY 2022 and $13.8 billion in FY 2023, resulting in a $7.3 billion increase, which is grossly inaccurate compared to the ground truth values of $731 million in 2022 and $733 million in 2023—an actual increase of only $2 million. These numbers are off by an order of magnitude, suggesting a fundamental error in data retrieval or interpretation. (2) The calculation of a $7.3 billion increase is based on incorrect inputs and thus invalid. The correct year-over-year difference is $733M - $731M = $2M. The LLM’s figures are more than 10 times higher than actual, indicating severe quantitative inaccuracy. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies that QTL revenue comes from licensing royalties recognized over time based on handset sales—a point consistent with the licensing model described in the ground truth—the reasoning is applied to justify a non-existent large revenue jump, undermining the logical coherence. The model fails to connect the modest revenue change to the steady nature of royalty-based income, instead implying that increased handset shipments caused a massive spike, which contradicts the expected stability implied by the ground truth. (4) Despite referencing correct qualitative aspects of the QTL business model (royalty-based, tied to handset sales), the answer is severely compromised by incorrect data, leading to a low correctness score. The contextual relevance is partially preserved due to mention of licensing and royalties, but the magnitude of numerical errors renders the response misleading and factually unsound.",

      "original_answer": "The total increase in 'Interest incurred on debt and other' for LIN from 2022 ($277 million) to 2024 ($555 million) is $278 million. This increase contributes to a rise in net interest expense, which grew from $63 million in 2022 to $256 million in 2024, an increase of $193 million. This shows that rising debt-related interest costs have significantly impacted LIN's overall interest expense burden.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde’s “interest incurred on debt and other” rose from $277 million in 2022 to $555 million in 2024 – a total increase of $278 million.  This upward swing helped push the company’s net interest expense up sharply, from $63 million in 2022 to $256 million in 2024, indicating that higher borrowing costs substantially lifted overall net interest costs.",

(1) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: 'Interest incurred on debt and other' is correctly stated as $277 million in 2022 and $555 million in 2024, with a correct increase of $278 million (555 - 277 = 278). Net interest expense is accurately reported as rising from $63 million in 2022 to $256 million in 2024, an increase of $193 million, which aligns with the ground truth. (2) The answer is complete, addressing both parts of the question: the total increase in interest incurred and its impact on net interest expense. (3) Entity accuracy is correct—'LIN' is properly identified as Linde (LIN), and the financial metrics and years (2022, 2024) are accurate. (4) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that the rise in interest incurred contributes to higher net interest expense, demonstrating proper multi-hop synthesis between the two metrics over time.

It reports operating profit of $754 million (North America) and $844 million (Asia Pacific), and D&A expenses of $104 million and $96 million, respectively. Adding these gives $1,798 million, which contradicts the ground truth of $1,700 million. These individual figures are not aligned with the correct data, leading to an incorrect total. (2) The calculation itself (summing four values) is logically appropriate for the question, but the input numbers are wrong, making the result inaccurate. Even minor rounding differences cannot justify the $98 million discrepancy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning structure is sound—identify segment, region, year, extract operating profit and D&A, sum across regions—but the model failed to retrieve the correct values from the source. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the model understood the required entities (segment, regions, financial metrics, year), but both quantitative and qualitative accuracy are severely compromised due to incorrect data retrieval, likely from hallucinated or misread figures.

The only minor issue is the use of 'million'—the original answer does not specify units, but given the context and typical reporting scales in SEC filings, 'million' is a reasonable and likely correct assumption. This does not constitute a factual error but rather a clarification of implied units. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across downstream and upstream assets and across two years, then computes the comparison.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, $605 million was spent on share purchases under the open-market program. Therefore, the amount spent on dividends was significantly higher than the amount spent on share purchases during the same fiscal year.",

Under its publicly announced open‑market share‑repurchase program it spent $605 million buying back shares in the fourth quarter, the amount reported for the year’s program【page_39】.

However, the dividend payout is stated as $3.2 billion, while the ground truth specifies $3,241,479 (approximately $3.24 million, not billion). This is a significant quantitative error—off by a factor of nearly 1,000. Despite this, the LLM interprets the comparison correctly, noting dividends were much larger than buybacks. (2) The calculation of the difference (~$2.6 billion more in dividends) is based on incorrect inputs: $3.2 billion minus $605 million does yield roughly $2.6 billion, but only if dividends were actually $3.2 billion. In reality, the total dividend outlay ($3.24 million) is only about $2.6 million more than the $605 million in buybacks—so the magnitude of the difference is misrepresented. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes dividend and share purchase data from the same fiscal year and draws a valid comparative conclusion, albeit with flawed numbers. It references the correct time period (fiscal 2024) and correctly attributes the $605 million to the full-year open-market program. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect—the answer addresses both parts of the question and provides a clear comparison. Due to the severe numerical inaccuracy in the dividend amount (mixing up millions and billions), the quantitative accuracy is penalized heavily. However, the reasoning and structure are strong, warranting high qualitative and contextual scores. Correctness is rated 8 because the core logic and entities are correct, but the factual error in scale is significant.",

However, the LLM reports negative values of $(581) million in 2021 and $(180) million in 2020, which are not only quantitatively wrong but also imply a completely different financial event (a reversal or reduction rather than a reallocation of undistributed earnings).

However, it incorrectly states that the 2020 rate (2.4%) was lower than the 2021 rate (2.8%), when in fact 2.4% is lower than 2.8%, meaning the 2020 rate was actually lower than both 2019 and 2021. The original answer states that 2.4% is 'higher than the 2.8% used in 2021' — this is a critical error in the ground truth itself, because 2.4% is not higher than 2.8%. Upon fact check: 2.4% < 2.8%, so the correct comparison is that 2.4% is lower than 2.8%. Therefore, the LLM answer's statement that 2.4% is lower than 2.8% is actually correct, while the original (ground truth) answer contains a factual error in the comparison. Despite this, the knowledge graph's original answer is considered the ground truth per instructions. Since the LLM contradicts the ground truth on a quantitative comparison, it is marked down. However, given that the LLM's numerical values are correct and the logic follows standard numerical comparison, the error lies in alignment with an incorrect ground truth. Still, per evaluation rules, the LLM must match the ground truth. Thus, the LLM is penalized for stating 2.4% is lower than 2.8%, when the ground truth incorrectly claims 2.4% is higher than 2.8%. This creates a conflict: the LLM is factually correct but disagrees with the ground truth. Given the strict requirement to match the original answer, the LLM is considered incorrect in the comparison. Therefore, the quantitative accuracy is reduced due to mismatch in the directional comparison (even though LLM is mathematically correct), and qualitative accuracy suffers due to failure to match the expected synthesis.

While it correctly identifies the $1.9 billion EV-related charges and $1.6 billion inventory adjustments, it incorrectly states the unfavorable vehicle mix impact as $0.9 billion, which is not supported by the ground truth. The ground truth does not quantify the vehicle mix impact numerically, only noting it as a contributing factor. The LLM then sums $1.9B + $0.9B = $2.8B as the total impact, which is factually incorrect. The actual EBIT-adjusted decline was $2,117 million ($14,474M - $12,357M), not $2.8B. (2) The percentage calculation is therefore also wrong: the LLM claims $1.6B is ~57% of $2.8B, but the question asks what percentage of the *EV-related charges* impact came from inventory adjustments, not the total combined impact. The correct calculation is $1.6B / $1.9B = 84.2%, which the LLM fails to report. Instead, it misdirects the percentage to the total incorrect $2.8B figure.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains major factual inaccuracies in key financial figures. It states that Accenture spent $4.5 billion on share repurchases, but the ground truth is $605 million—a significant overstatement by more than 600%. The dividend amount is approximately correct ($3.2 billion vs. $3,241.479 million), though slightly rounded down. The combined cash outlay is reported as $7.7 billion, whereas the correct total is $3,846.479 million (~$3.85 billion), meaning the LLM overstates total outlay by nearly double. The remaining share repurchase authorization of $2.694 billion is correctly stated. (2) Calculations: The LLM’s sum of $4.5B + $3.2B = $7.7B is mathematically correct based on its inputs, but the inputs themselves are factually wrong. The correct sum of $605M + $3,241.479M = $3,846.479M is not reflected. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The model attempts to synthesize repurchase spending, dividends, and remaining authorization, which shows understanding of the required logic. However, due to incorrect input data, the conclusion about total cash outlay is severely flawed. It also omits mention of the additional $4,000 million approved after August 31, 2024, which was part of the original answer context. (4) Justification: The correctness score is low (3/10) due to grossly inaccurate numbers for repurchases and total outlay. Quantitative accuracy is very poor (2/10) because the core dollar amounts are wrong. Qualitative accuracy is moderate (4/10) as the structure and intent of the reasoning are present, but based on faulty data.

The percentage calculation is accurate: (15,061 - 195) / 15,061 ≈ 0.987 or 98.7%. 2) However, the LLM incorrectly identifies the category responsible for the decline as 'Proved – Noble', while the ground truth specifies 'Unproved - Noble' as the category that dropped from $2,845 million to $0. This is a critical entity error affecting the qualitative accuracy. The 'Proved – Noble' may have been a significant 2020 acquisition, but the specific category cited as the primary contributor in the ground truth is 'Unproved - Noble'. 3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly links the drop in total acquisitions to the absence of a major acquisition category in 2021 compared to 2020 — but misattributes it to the wrong sub-category. This suggests access to related data but a failure in precise entity retrieval or synthesis. 4) Despite the factual error in the acquisition category, the answer remains contextually relevant and quantitatively precise.

The calculated increase of $1.5 billion matches the actual difference of $1,462 million when rounded. The total income from operations growth from $41.2 billion to $78.7 billion is accurate and consistent with the ground truth ($41,224 million to $78,714 million). The conclusion that the increase in corporate costs reduced net growth by about $1.5 billion is semantically equivalent to the ground truth statement that it reduced potential growth by $1,462 million. (2) All numeric values are correct within reasonable rounding: $3.3B ≈ $3,299M, $4.8B ≈ $4,761M, $41.2B ≈ $41,224M, $78.7B ≈ $78,714M. The $1.5B impact is a rounded version of $1,462M. Calculations (difference in corporate loss and total income growth) are logically sound and approximately accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is correct: the model synthesizes data across years and cost categories, correctly infers the negative impact of rising corporate losses on overall operating income growth, and contextualizes it within the broader increase in total income. (4) The answer is highly factually accurate, complete, and relevant.

These cost increases were partially offset by other cost savings, such as reduced advertising expenses. However, the unfavorable vehicle mix, particularly the increased sales of crossover vehicles, further pressured profitability.

It states that the combined cost impact was $3.9 billion ($2.0B + $1.9B), which is incorrect—the original answer specifies a combined impact of $2.9 billion, suggesting the $2.0B and $1.9B are not fully additive (possibly overlapping or partially offset). The LLM incorrectly calculates the sum and then builds further incorrect inferences on this error. Additionally, the LLM introduces specific figures not present in the ground truth—namely, EBIT-adjusted of $12.306 billion and a year-over-year decline of $682 million—which are unsupported by the original answer and likely incorrect. (2) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that warranty and EV charges negatively impacted EBIT-adjusted, acknowledges the role of vehicle mix, and notes that crossovers have lower margins than trucks. It also correctly references the concept of higher-margin trucks helping offset some costs. However, it misrepresents the vehicle mix effect by implying trucks helped recovery, while the original answer emphasizes that the *unfavorable shift to crossovers* amplified the negative impact. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially correct—linking cost increases and vehicle mix to EBIT-adjusted—but flawed due to incorrect numerical foundations and mischaracterization of the mix impact. (4) Contextual relevance is high, as the answer addresses the core question about cost impacts and vehicle mix on EBIT-adjusted.

This $1 million discrepancy affects the primary quantitative output. The increase from 2022 to 2024 is reported as $3 million ($42M - $39M), which is correct and matches the ground truth. (2) Individual yearly values cited—$30M, $32M, $29M from RSUs and $12M, $11M, $10M from stock options—are plausible and internally consistent, but their sum should be $124M only if all are accurate; however, the ground truth implies one or more of these values may be off by $1M cumulatively. The calculation logic (summing all years for total benefit, then comparing 2024 vs 2022) is sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly identifies two separate tables, extracts data across years, aggregates totals, and computes year-over-year change. It synthesizes information appropriately across sources (RSU and stock-option tables). (4) Despite correct reasoning and structure, the final total is off by $1M, which reduces quantitative accuracy significantly given the small scale of the numbers.

      "llm_answer": "Meta’s 11% year‑over‑year rise in ad impressions on its Family of Apps (page 61) helped lift advertising revenue, yet the company warns that its quarterly results can still swing because the volume and value of those impressions depend on many unpredictable elements—user‑base growth, engagement levels, ad‑targeting and measurement capabilities, regulatory changes, platform‑policy shifts, and ad‑pricing dynamics (page 26). Consequently, even with higher ad‑impression counts, the difficulty in forecasting the factors that drive ad delivery and user engagement creates a risk of fluctuating financial outcomes.",

The absence of the exact 22% figure is a minor omission but does not distort the factual relationship. (2) The LLM accurately reflects that unpredictable factors—such as user engagement, ad-targeting capabilities, regulatory changes, platform policies, and pricing dynamics—contribute to financial volatility, which matches the core reasoning in the ground truth. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: it connects ad impression growth to revenue, then explains how unpredictability in key drivers creates financial risk, synthesizing cause and effect across multiple factors. (4) The mention of 'page 61' and 'page 26' suggests document grounding, though not required for correctness. Wording differs slightly (e.g., 'swing' vs 'fluctuating'), but semantic meaning is equivalent.

All numbers match the ground truth, with only formatting differences (e.g., $5.4 billion vs $5,400 million), which are semantically equivalent. (2) Calculations are correct: 420 - 53 = 367 million increase; 5,400 - 4,359 = 1,041 million decrease. The rounding of $1,041 million to 'roughly $1.04 billion' is reasonable and does not distort accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies that despite a significant increase in cash outflow for Noncontrolling Interest Transactions, the overall net cash used in financing activities declined, indicating an offset from other financing activities.

      "original_answer": "The $35 million decrease in wholesale revenue from ended power supply agreements reduces Southern Company's short-term cash flows, which could constrain its ability to fund new generation assets. Simultaneously, the rising demand for energy from data centers and advanced manufacturing, such as electric vehicles, increases the need for new power generation and transmission infrastructure. However, because regulators may not allow timely rate adjustments to recover the full cost of these new assets, Southern Company faces regulatory lag and cost recovery risk. This situation is compounded when paired with reduced current revenues, as the company may struggle to fund capital expenditures while awaiting potential future recovery of costs through regulated rates or long-term PPAs, which themselves may not be extended or replaced at favorable terms.",
      "llm_answer": "The $35 million decline in wholesale revenue from power‑supply agreements that ended in 2023 (page 75) cuts the cash flow available to offset the cost of new generation assets. Because future demand from data‑center and electric‑vehicle production is uncertain (page 35), the incremental revenues that long‑term PPAs are expected to generate may not be enough to cover those capital costs, and regulators may not permit full cost recovery if market prices fall short of forecasts.",

(2) Quantitatively, the $35 million figure is accurate and correctly attributed to ended power supply agreements. The mention of '2023' and page numbers (75, 35) adds specificity not in the original answer but does not contradict it; however, the original answer does not specify a year, so this addition is unverifiable but not necessarily incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model connects reduced revenue to cost recovery challenges under long-term PPAs and regulatory risk. However, it omits the critical concept of *regulatory lag* and does not mention that cost recovery may be delayed even if approved, which is a central point in the ground truth. It also fails to note that long-term PPAs may not be replaced at favorable terms, weakening the synthesis.

      "original_answer": "An increase in the compensation assumption leads to higher pension obligations because it projects greater future pay growth for plan participants. This, in turn, increases the present value of expected benefit payments, which raises the pension liability recorded in the financial statements. These changes are also reflected in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), as differences between actual results and assumed compensation growth are recorded there and later amortized into earnings over time. This mechanism is explicitly described in the GE 2022 10-K disclosures.",

The ground truth does not provide any numerical sensitivity values from GE's 2022 10-K, nor does it mention a specific dollar impact of a 1% change in compensation assumptions. Therefore, the inclusion of precise dollar amounts ($2.5 billion) is unsupported by the provided ground truth and likely incorrect or at minimum unverifiable. (2) There is a fundamental issue with the direction of the AOCI impact as described: while an increase in compensation assumptions increases pension obligations (correct), it initially increases the actuarial loss (not decreases AOCI directly in a mechanical way), which is recorded in AOCI. A higher obligation leads to a larger unfunded liability, which increases the net actuarial loss in AOCI—so AOCI becomes more negative, but saying it 'cuts AOCI by $2.5 billion' oversimplifies and may misrepresent the accounting. (3) The qualitative reasoning about the mechanism—linking compensation assumptions to higher projected benefits and thus higher liabilities and AOCI impacts—is generally sound and aligns with multi-hop understanding of pension accounting and GE’s disclosures. The model correctly identifies the relationship between assumptions, obligations, and AOCI. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and attempts to address the core question using what appears to be a sensitivity table from the 10-K, but since the ground truth does not confirm the existence or values of such a table, the quantitative claims cannot be validated and likely reflect hallucination.

The ground truth states that Amazon's total principal repayment related to financing obligations in 2021 was $162 million in total, not $162 million per table. The LLM incorrectly assumes that the $162 million amount appears in both tables and should be summed to $324 million, which contradicts the original answer stating that the $162 million is the combined total from both disclosures. Similarly, for 2020, the correct total is $53 million, not $106 million. The calculated increase is therefore wrong: $109 million (correct) vs. $218 million (LLM's calculation). (2) Number verification: The individual yearly amounts in each table are likely $162M and $53M respectively (as per ground truth), but the LLM misinterprets the structure of the disclosure, assuming duplication instead of consistency across two presentations. There is no indication in the ground truth that the amounts should be added across tables; rather, both tables report the same item, and the total is already $162M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning failure: The model fails to correctly synthesize the information across the two cash flow presentations. It treats them as independent sources to be summed, rather than two disclosures of the same underlying figure. This reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of how financing obligations are reported in multiple tables within a single filing. (4) Scores justified: Correctness is low (2/10) due to major factual and calculation errors. Quantitative accuracy is poor because the key numbers (total repayments, year-over-year difference) are all incorrect.

The second figure—$2.02 billion for noncurrent income tax liabilities unrelated to the Toll Tax—is correct. (2) The calculation comparing the two amounts is based on incorrect input: claiming the Toll Tax obligation is '$130 million higher' stems from the erroneous $2.149B - $2.02B = ~$130M difference, which does not reflect reality since both values should be $2.02B according to the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "A 100 basis point increase in the assumed future rate of return results in a decrease in DAC and VOBA amortization. According to the 2022 10-K filing, this change has a net financial effect of approximately $30 million, with an offset to the unearned revenue liability.",
      "llm_answer": "A 100‑basis‑point rise in the assumed future rate of return would **decrease** the amortization of both DAC and VOBA.  The reduction in amortization, offset by an increase to the unearned‑revenue liability, nets to an overall impact of **about $30 million**.",

(1) Quantitatively: The Applications revenue increase is reported as $5.6 billion (vs. $5,560 million in ground truth) — this is a rounded but correct representation. Similarly, Infrastructure increase is $3.6 billion (vs. $3,649 million), again a reasonable rounding. Input values are also rounded: $12.6B vs $12,612M, $18.2B vs $18,172M, $17.6B vs $17,562M, $21.2B vs $21,211M — all within acceptable rounding tolerance. (2) Calculations are correct: $18.2B - $12.6B = $5.6B; $21.2B - $17.6B = $3.6B; difference in growth is $2.0B, which the model reports as ~$1.9B — slight rounding down but still accurate. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies two revenue streams across two years, computes YoY dollar increases, and compares them — fully addressing the two-part comparative question. (4) Entities (Oracle, Applications Cloud, Infrastructure Cloud, revenue types, years 2022–2024) are all correctly identified. (5) The conclusion that Applications showed higher growth in dollar terms is clearly and correctly stated. Only a minor deduction in quantitative accuracy due to rounding that slightly understates the exact difference ($1.961B actual difference in growth: $5.56B - $3.649B), but this does not affect overall correctness.

It states that 4.5 million shares were issued over the three fiscal years, but the ground truth is 14,981,522 shares (4,366,262 in 2022, 5,710,542 in 2023, and 4,904,718 in 2024). This is a major factual error. Additionally, the LLM claims the plan authorizes 'up to 10 million shares,' but the correct authorized maximum is 135,000,000 shares. The comparison that cumulative issuances represent 'well under half' is therefore also wrong — the correct figure is approximately 11.1%, which is still under the cap but far more than implied. (2) The numbers are not accurate in any format: 4.5 million vs. ~15 million issued and 10 million vs. 135 million authorized are off by orders of magnitude. Calculations based on these numbers are invalid. (3) The reasoning is flawed due to incorrect data inputs. The model fails to correctly synthesize multi-hop information across the three fiscal years and misrepresents the plan's authorized share limit, likely due to referencing incorrect or incomplete data (e.g., citing only ACN_10k_2023 and possibly missing updates or full plan details). (4) Scores are low because the core facts — total shares issued and authorized — are wrong, undermining the entire answer.

(1) It claims the 2022 diluted share count is not disclosed, but the original answer (ground truth) provides the exact number: 346,084 shares. This number is specific and verifiable, so the LLM's assertion of non-disclosure is false. (2) The LLM incorrectly cites 2021 data (345,755 shares) as the only available information, but the question explicitly asks for 2022. The ground truth breaks down the 2022 figure into 299,815 basic shares + 46,182 from Class B conversion + 87 from RSUs and other contingently issuable shares, totaling 346,084—none of which are mentioned or correctly reported by the LLM. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails completely: the LLM does not synthesize the components for 2022, nor does it acknowledge the conversion of Class B to Class A shares and RSUs in that year. Instead, it defaults to an unrelated year. (4) While the LLM correctly interprets the structure of diluted share calculations (basic + dilutive securities), its reliance on 2021 data and dismissal of 2022 availability renders the response factually wrong. The contextual relevance is low because it answers a different question (availability in excerpts) rather than the actual query.

The prior year adjustment for 2021 is correctly reported as $1.72 billion (equivalent to $1,720 million in ground truth). However, the LLM omits the 2020 prior year adjustment of $840 million, which is a key part of the original answer and necessary for fully addressing the impact of prior year adjustments on the change over the period. 2) Quantitatively, all provided numbers are accurate within acceptable rounding: $21.872 billion = $21,872 million, $24.483 billion = $24,483 million, and $1.72 billion = $1,720 million. The increase is correctly approximated as $2.6 billion (exact: $2,611 million). 3) The reasoning is sound in linking prior year adjustments to the change in medical costs payable, but the failure to mention the 2020 adjustment breaks the full multi-hop synthesis required—comparing the impact of prior year adjustments across both years is essential to fully explain the change. 4) Despite the omission, the answer remains highly relevant and conveys most of the required information with correct entities (UnitedHealth, medical costs payable, correct years and metric), hence high scores in qualitative accuracy and contextual relevance.

The total pension expense is severely understated: the LLM reports approximately $111.8 million ($111,775 thousand) as the sum of reclassified amounts from OCI, while the ground truth states the total pension expense across 2022–2024 is $617,238 (i.e., ~$617 thousand), which is over five times higher. The individual yearly figures cited by the LLM ($51.1M, $34.6M, $26.1M) are not only inconsistent with the ground truth ($188,001, $206,346, $222,891) but also appear to be misinterpreted—likely confusing amortization amounts from OCI with total pension expense. (2) The calculation in the LLM answer is numerically accurate (51.1 + 34.6 + 26.1 ≈ 111.8), but it is based on fundamentally wrong data inputs. The ground truth sum (188,001 + 206,346 + 222,891 = 617,238) is correct and precise. The LLM’s figure is off by orders of magnitude due to misidentification of the metric. (3) The reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly focuses on amounts reclassified from OCI, which are only a component (e.g., amortization of actuarial losses), not the total pension expense. It fails to identify the full net periodic pension cost. Regarding the service cost treatment, the LLM states it is recorded in the statement of comprehensive income as part of net periodic pension cost, but does not specify that service cost is included in operating expenses while other components are in 'Other income (expense), net'—a key distinction in the original answer. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the LLM attempts to address both parts of the question (total expense and service cost treatment), but with significant factual and conceptual errors.

(1) Quantitative Accuracy: The reported revenue of $3,490 million is significantly lower than the correct figure of $16,903 million. The answer also fails to report the U.S. ($6,186 million) and Non-U.S. ($10,717 million) breakdowns, which are essential to the question. The cited number appears to be either from a misread table or a wrong segment. (2) Completeness: The question has two parts—total revenue and geographic distribution. The LLM explicitly states that geographic distribution cannot be determined, which contradicts the ground truth that such data is available. Thus, the answer is incomplete. (3) Entity Accuracy: While the segment (Power) and year (2021) are correctly identified, the financial metric (revenue) is incorrectly quantified. (4) Reasoning: The model references a 'current-receivables table' which does not align with standard financial reporting structures—revenue is typically in income statements or segment disclosures, not receivables tables. This suggests a misinterpretation of the source document. (5) Semantic Equivalence: The answer conveys fundamentally different information—both in magnitude and completeness—compared to the ground truth. The conclusion that Non-U.S. regions contributed more than U.S. regions is entirely missing. Overall, the response reflects a failure in multi-hop reasoning and data extraction, likely due to incorrect source referencing or misidentification of financial data.",

It accurately states the cash flow impact as a $514 million outflow in FY2025 and a $1,637 million inflow in FY2024. These figures are factually correct and properly attributed to the relevant fiscal years. (2) All calculations are accurate: the sum of inventory values is correct ($17,409 + $16,894 = $34,303 million), and the directional impacts on cash flow (outflow vs. inflow) are correctly interpreted. The LLM does not explicitly calculate the net cash outflow effect of $2,151 million (i.e., -$514M - $1,637M) as stated in the ground truth, which is a minor omission in synthesis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound—information is correctly pulled from inventory balances and cash flow impacts across two fiscal years. However, the answer adds net cash provided by operating activities for each year ($9,625M and $8,140M), which was not asked and slightly distracts from the core comparison of inventory change effects. It also fails to explicitly state the net cash outflow effect of $2,151 million when comparing the two years, which is a key part of the original answer’s synthesis. (4) Despite this minor gap in full comparative synthesis, the LLM provides all necessary data for the user to derive the conclusion. The factual accuracy is excellent, wording is clear, and context is well-supported with correct page references. Hence, a high score of 9 is justified—very close to perfect but missing full explicit synthesis of the net cash effect across years.",

      "original_answer": "Comcast capitalizes film and television costs as part of its industry-specific accounting policies, which are tied directly to its activities in producing owned content and licensing third-party content for use across its owned television networks and digital properties. These costs are managed under multiyear distribution agreements, where expenses are generally recognized based on the rates in the agreements. The capitalization and amortization of these costs align with the company's predominant monetization strategy, which focuses on monetizing content on an individual basis.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast records the direct production, overhead, interest and acquisition costs of its owned film‑ and‑television programs (and the cost of licensed programs when the license starts) as “film and television costs” on the balance sheet.  These capitalized costs are then amortized in proportion to the revenue generated from the content—using an individual‑title forecast method for titles monetized on their own and a usage‑based method for content bundled with other assets—so that expense is recognized as the programs are delivered and consumed on Comcast’s owned linear networks (e.g., NBC, Telemundo) and digital platforms such as Peacock.

All entities (Comcast, NBC, Telemundo, Peacock) are correct, and no numerical inaccuracies are present—though no specific numbers (e.g., dollar amounts, dates) appear in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is assessed as perfect by default. The reasoning is sound and demonstrates proper multi-hop synthesis between accounting policy, content production/licensing, and monetization across platforms. The only minor limitation is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'multiyear distribution agreements' or that amortization rates are 'based on the rates in the agreements'—a nuance present in the original answer—though the concept is implicitly covered through proportional amortization to revenue.

This depreciation is associated with assets covered under Southern Company's NEIL insurance policies, which include Georgia Power's nuclear facilities.

Applying the 2023 composite depreciation rate of 3.8% for Georgia Power (page 216) gives a nuclear‑plant depreciation expense of roughly $370 million for the year.

The question asks for the total depreciation expense for Georgia Power's nuclear plants under NEIL insurance policies, but the LLM calculates an annual depreciation expense of $370 million using a 3.8% rate applied to plant-in-service value. However, the ground truth states that the total accumulated depreciation is $3,018 million — a cumulative figure, not annual. The LLM confuses annual depreciation expense with accumulated depreciation, which are fundamentally different metrics. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly reports Plant Hatch’s value as negative ($-1,446M), which is nonsensical and likely a formatting error from the source document. (2) The calculation of $9.7 billion in plant-in-service value is roughly correct (sum of $1,446M + $3,664M + $4,613M ≈ $9,723M), but applying a 3.8% depreciation rate to derive $370M is irrelevant because the question does not ask for estimated annual depreciation — it asks for total depreciation expense related to NEIL-covered assets, which the ground truth provides as $3,018M accumulated. The $89 million maximum annual assessment under NEIL is correctly cited, but the conclusion that it is 'well below the annual depreciation charge' misrepresents the relationship: the assessment is a liability in case of nuclear incidents, not an operating expense, and comparing it to depreciation is misleading. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the model should have retrieved the specific accumulated depreciation value from the knowledge graph ($3,018M) tied to NEIL-covered plants, not attempted an independent calculation. It also fails to explain that this depreciation relates to insured assets and that the $89M assessment is a contingent liability, not a routine expense.

Similarly, the U.S. revenue figures are grossly inaccurate: LLM claims U.S. revenue grew from $8,876,050 million to $11,614,894 million (increase of $2.74 billion), whereas the actual U.S. revenue was only around $1.5–1.6 billion total, increasing by $66.807 million. These numbers are off by orders of magnitude (e.g., trillions instead of billions). (2) Calculations are based on wrong inputs and thus invalid. The LLM’s stated increase of $2.81 billion for Non-U.S. and $2.74 billion for U.S. are both wrong; correct increases are $493.184 million and $66.807 million respectively. The comparison conclusion (Non-U.S. increase slightly larger than U.S.) is also incorrect—while Non-U.S. growth was indeed larger, it was dramatically so (over 7x), not 'slightly'.

The final balance and change amount are accurate. (2) However, there is a factual error in the timing of the activity: the LLM attributes the entire -$3 million 'Purchases, Sales and Settlements' to 2019, but the ground truth states the $3 decrease occurred in 2020, not 2019. Additionally, the LLM claims no activity in 2020 or 2021, while the ground truth specifies that the $3 decrease happened in 2020 and no value remained in 2021. This misattribution of the year of activity is a significant error in temporal reasoning. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially flawed: the model correctly synthesizes the beginning and ending values and computes the net change, but fails to correctly align the activity (purchases, sales, settlements) with the correct fiscal year. The ground truth indicates 2020 as the year of activity, but the LLM incorrectly assigns it to 2019 and then states no activity in 2020, which contradicts the evidence. (4) Despite this, the core quantitative facts (starting value, ending value, net change) are correct, and the conclusion of a full exit by 2021 is accurate. Hence, the correctness score is 7 (minor but notable error in timing), quantitative accuracy is 8 (numbers correct but applied to wrong year), qualitative accuracy is 6 (reasoning flawed in temporal logic), and contextual relevance is 10 (fully addresses the question's scope).",

While the individual yearly values for Prior Service Benefits, Net are correct ($55.4M, $52.4M, $50.5M), their sum is incorrectly calculated as $158.3 million instead of the correct $157.9 million. More critically, the total reclassifications are stated as $644.5 million, but the correct total is $744.7 million (sum of $357.9M + $250.8M + $35.8M). The LLM appears to have reversed the order of addition (listing $35.8M first) but then miscalculated the sum (35.8 + 250.8 + 357.9 = 644.5 is incorrect; the correct sum is 744.7). (2) The comparison to total reclassifications and the implied ratio (roughly four times larger) is inaccurate due to the wrong denominator. The original answer correctly notes that Prior Service Benefits represent ~21.2% of total reclassifications, but the LLM’s incorrect totals undermine this analysis. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—LLM identifies the need to sum across three years and compare two line items—but fails in execution due to arithmetic errors. The directionality (negative vs. positive) is mentioned, which adds qualitative context, but the claim of being 'four times larger' is unsupported by both correct and incorrect totals. (4) Despite these issues, the answer is contextually relevant and attempts all parts of the question. Entity accuracy (LLY, metric names, years) is correct, and the structure mirrors the required synthesis. However, the quantitative inaccuracies—especially in totals—are severe enough to significantly reduce correctness.

The Combat Arms Earplugs litigation charge significantly reduced margins in 2022, contributing to a decline in operating income margins before special items.

While it correctly identifies the $1.2 billion Combat Arms Earplugs litigation charge and the $0.8 billion PFAS-related asset impairment in 2022, it misattributes the financial impact to incorrect business segments. The ground truth states these charges impacted the Safety and Industrial segment, but the LLM incorrectly assigns the $0.8 billion PFAS charge to the Transportation & Electronics segment, which is not supported by the original answer. (2) The quantitative claims about margins (e.g., dropping to 9.8% and rising to 21.2% in Safety & Industrial, and 10.9% to 15.4% in Transportation & Electronics) are not present in the original answer and appear to be fabricated or misextracted. The ground truth does not provide specific margin percentages or year-on-year percentage point changes, so these precise figures cannot be verified and contradict the more general qualitative description provided. Additionally, the claim that margins rose to 21.2% in 2023 due to removal of charges introduces data not present in the original. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the question asks for the collective impact of both charges on Safety and Industrial margins, but the LLM splits them across two different segments, failing to synthesize the information correctly. It also introduces page references (page 30, 31) not present in the input, suggesting hallucination. (4) Despite these issues, the LLM correctly identifies the two charges and their negative impact in 2022, and the general idea that their removal contributed to margin improvement in 2023 aligns loosely with the recovery mentioned in the ground truth. However, the misattribution of segments and invention of specific margin figures severely undermine factual correctness.

      "original_answer": "The U.S. sources revenue for ACN increased by $66,807 (from $1,562,011 in fiscal year 2023 to $1,628,818 in fiscal year 2024). Over the same period, the total revenue increased by $559,991 (from $9,139,332 in fiscal year 2023 to $9,699,323 in fiscal year 2024). This indicates that while U.S. sources contributed to the overall growth, they accounted for only a fraction of the total revenue increase.",
      "llm_answer": "U.S. sources revenue (shown as North America) rose from $8.876 billion in FY 2023 to $11.615 billion in FY 2024 – an increase of roughly $2.74 billion【page_83】.  Total revenue grew from $15.573 billion to $21.120 billion, a rise of about $5.55 billion over the same period【page_83】, meaning the U.S.‑source gain was roughly half of the overall revenue growth.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is almost entirely incorrect in terms of factual content. The U.S. sources revenue for ACN is reported as $8.876 billion and $11.615 billion for FY2023 and FY2024 respectively, which is grossly inaccurate compared to the ground truth values of $1,562,011 and $1,628,818 (i.e., ~$1.56B and ~$1.63B). The claimed increase of ~$2.74 billion is therefore wrong; the actual increase is $66,807. Similarly, total revenue is falsely reported as growing from $15.573B to $21.120B (~$5.55B increase), whereas the true figures are $9,139,332 and $9,699,323, with an actual increase of $559,991. These numbers are off by billions of dollars, indicating severe factual inaccuracies. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent (e.g., $11.615B - $8.876B ≈ $2.74B), but since they are based on completely incorrect input values, the results are invalid. The ground truth shows U.S. revenue growth accounts for about 11.9% of total revenue growth ($66,807 / $559,991), not 'roughly half' as claimed. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because the model uses incorrect entities or misreads the data—possibly confusing ACN with another company or mislabeling regions (e.g., equating 'North America' with 'U.S. sources' may be acceptable, but the numbers still do not match). There is no evidence of correct synthesis across fiscal years or revenue segments. (4) The contextual relevance is low because the answer discusses the right type of comparison (U.S. vs total revenue change), but all underlying data is incorrect, leading to a misleading conclusion. Scores are low due to catastrophic failure in quantitative accuracy, which undermines all other aspects.",

      "question": "How does the weighting of net operating revenues in performance-based share unit awards for 2023 interact with the risks described that could reduce net operating revenues, and what might this imply for executive incentives and risk-taking behavior?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, net operating revenues accounted for 30% of the performance criteria in performance-based share unit awards. This significant weighting means that executive compensation is partially tied to the company's ability to maintain or grow net operating revenues. However, the 10-K filing highlights several risks that could reduce net operating revenues, such as regulatory changes (e.g., restrictions on plastic materials, water usage, and carbon emissions), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (e.g., a strong U.S. dollar affecting international revenue), and legal or compliance failures. These risks could make it more difficult for executives to meet performance targets tied to net operating revenues, potentially reducing the number of performance share units earned. This dynamic could incentivize executives to focus on mitigating these risks or, conversely, to take on more strategic risk to offset potential revenue declines and achieve the performance goals tied to their compensation.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 performance‑share unit awards assign a 30 % weight to net operating revenues, so a sizable share of executive compensation is tied directly to the company’s top‑line performance. Because the filing highlights many headwinds that could depress those revenues—new indirect taxes, packaging and labeling regulations, currency swings, litigation, cybersecurity incidents, and other legal or compliance risks—executives have a strong financial incentive to protect and grow revenue and to focus on mitigating those specific risks, which can encourage more revenue‑preserving, potentially risk‑averse, decision‑making.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and aligns well with the ground truth. (1) Quantitatively, the 30% weighting of net operating revenues in the 2023 performance-based share unit awards is correctly stated, matching the original answer. (2) The LLM identifies multiple risks that could reduce net operating revenues—such as regulatory changes (packaging and labeling), foreign exchange fluctuations (currency swings), litigation, and cybersecurity incidents—which are consistent with the types of risks mentioned in the ground truth (regulatory changes, FX, legal/compliance). While the original answer specifies 'indirect taxes' and 'carbon emissions' as examples, the LLM provides broader but relevant categories (e.g., 'indirect taxes' fall under regulatory changes). (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly infers that tying compensation to net operating revenues creates an incentive to protect revenue and mitigate risks, leading to potentially risk-averse behavior. This captures one side of the implication in the original answer. However, the LLM omits the counter-incentive mentioned in the ground truth—namely, that executives might take on *more* strategic risk to offset revenue declines and meet targets. This partial omission slightly weakens the qualitative completeness of the multi-hop synthesis. (4) Despite this, the answer remains contextually rich, factually correct, and highly relevant, accurately reflecting the core dynamics between compensation structure and risk exposure. Minor deduction only for not fully exploring the dual nature of incentive effects on risk-taking.",

      "question": "How much higher is the 2022 Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows for Chevron's consolidated companies compared to its affiliated companies, and what is the primary reason for this difference according to the methodology described?",
      "original_answer": "The 2022 Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows for Chevron's consolidated companies is $103,884 million, while for affiliated companies it is $25, (i.e., $21,942 million for TCO and $3,049 million for Other affiliated companies). This results in a difference of $78,884 million. The primary reason for this difference is the larger future cash inflows from production in the consolidated companies ($26,926 million for Europe and $48,067 million for Consolidated Companies excluding Europe) compared to affiliated companies, despite both being subjected to the same 10 percent midyear annual discount for timing of estimated cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s consolidated companies report a Standardized Measure Net Cash Flow of about $103.9 billion, versus roughly $25.0 billion for its affiliated companies – a gap of approximately $78.9 billion【page_110†L31-L34】. This disparity arises because the standardized measure is driven by the volume of proved oil‑and‑gas reserves and the associated future cash inflows; the consolidated entities own the bulk of those reserves, producing far larger discounted cash‑flow estimates under the methodology that uses average oil‑and‑gas prices, projected development/production costs, retirement obligations and taxes【page_109†L1-L7】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the 2022 Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows for consolidated companies as approximately $103.9 billion (vs. $103,884 million in ground truth) and affiliated companies as $25.0 billion (vs. $25,000 million total: $21,942M TCO + $3,049M Other), with a difference of $78.9 billion (vs. $78,884 million). These values are accurate within reasonable rounding. (2) Calculations are correct: $103.9B - $25.0B = $78.9B, matching the expected difference. The original answer's $25, (i.e., $21,942M + $3,049M) sums to $24,991M ≈ $25.0B, so the LLM’s rounding is acceptable. (3) The reasoning is sound and captures the core methodology: the disparity is due to larger reserves and future cash inflows in consolidated companies, consistent with the ground truth’s emphasis on higher production-driven cash inflows (e.g., $26,926M Europe + $48,067M non-Europe = $74,993M total for consolidated), despite the same 10% discount rate. While the LLM does not explicitly cite the regional cash inflow breakdowns, it correctly identifies the root cause—greater reserve ownership and resulting cash flows in consolidated entities. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the quantitative difference and the methodological reason. The only minor omission is the lack of explicit mention of the 10% midyear discount being applied equally, but the reference to 'discounted cash-flow estimates' under standard methodology implies it. Overall, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and semantically equivalent to the ground truth.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the percentage increase in Other Bets revenue (14.6%) and total revenues (41%), matching the ground truth. The dollar figures for Other Bets ($657M to $753M) and total revenues ($182.5B to $257.6B) are accurate and correctly cited from the appropriate pages. The calculation of ~14.6% (96 ÷ 657) is precise and properly rounded to '14–15%' which semantically aligns with 14.6%. The 41% increase in total revenue is correctly stated and matches the ground truth 41.1% when allowing for rounding. (2) All numeric values and calculations are factually correct. The $96M increase in Other Bets is accurate (753 - 657 = 96), and 96 / 657 ≈ 0.1461 → 14.6% is correctly computed. Total revenue increase: (257.6 - 182.5) / 182.5 ≈ 0.411 → 41.1%, which the LLM rounds to 41%—an acceptable approximation. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two different sections (page 34 for Other Bets, page 33 for total revenue) and correctly compares growth rates across entities and time periods. The conclusion that Other Bets grew far slower than total revenue is logically and factually supported. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both parts of the question. The only minor shortcoming is the slight rounding of 41.1% to 41% without explicit acknowledgment, and '14–15%' instead of the exact 14.6%, but these do not detract from factual correctness.

      "question": "How would a 1% decrease in estimated residual values of the leased vehicle portfolio impact GM Financial's depreciation expense, and what does this imply about the sensitivity of their asset valuation assumptions?",
      "original_answer": "A 1% decrease in estimated residual values of GM Financial's leased vehicle portfolio would increase depreciation expense over the remaining term of the portfolio. This sensitivity highlights the importance of residual value assumptions in determining financial performance. The explicit modeling of a 1% relative change in residual values demonstrates that depreciation expense is directly affected by these assumptions, which, if inaccurate, could result in significant financial adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "A 1 % decline in the estimated residual values of GM Financial’s leased‑vehicle portfolio would lift depreciation expense by roughly **$227 million in total** – about $158 million in 2024, $53 million in 2025, $15 million in 2026 and $1 million thereafter (see the 1 %‑change sensitivity table). This shows that depreciation expense is fairly sensitive to the residual‑value assumptions: even a modest 1 % shift in asset‑valuation inputs translates into a material expense impact, highlighting the importance of accurate residual‑value estimates.",

The ground truth does not provide any numerical estimates of financial impact, only a qualitative statement about increased depreciation expense and sensitivity. Therefore, these figures are factually unsupported and incorrect. (2) There is no verification possible for the $227 million total or its annual breakdown because the ground truth contains no such data. The inclusion of precise numbers creates a false sense of accuracy and represents a significant quantitative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the LLM correctly identifies that a 1% decrease in residual values increases depreciation expense and that this reflects sensitivity in asset valuation assumptions. This aligns with the conceptual logic in the original answer. However, the model fabricates granular financial data that cannot be derived from the provided ground truth, indicating overreach in quantitative inference. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the response addresses both parts of the question—impact on depreciation and implication for sensitivity—and uses appropriate terminology. However, the correctness score is low due to the invention of specific financial figures absent in the source, which fundamentally undermines factual accuracy.

      "original_answer": "The net change in Medical Costs Payable from the end of 2020 ($21,872 million) to the end of 2022 ($24,483 million) was $2,611 million. In 2021, reported medical costs were $186,911 million and medical payments were $184,388 million, resulting in a $2,523 million increase in payable obligations. This reflects that the company reported more medical costs than it paid during the year, which directly contributed to the growth in Medical Costs Payable by the end of 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth’s medical‑costs payable grew from **$21.872 billion at year‑end 2020 to $24.483 billion at year‑end 2022**, a net increase of about **$2.6 billion**【page_61】. In 2021 the company recorded **$186.9 billion of reported medical costs** versus **$184.4 billion of medical payments**, leaving a **$2.5 billion excess** that directly added to the payable balance and was the primary driver of the $2.6 billion increase【page_61】.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies the net change in Medical Costs Payable from end of 2020 ($21.872 billion) to end of 2022 ($24.483 billion), which is $2.611 billion; the LLM rounds this to $2.6 billion, which is acceptable and common in financial reporting. The reported 2021 medical costs ($186.9 billion vs. $186,911 million) and medical payments ($184.4 billion vs. $184,388 million) are accurately rounded and consistent with the ground truth. The excess of $2.5 billion (vs. exact $2,523 million) is a reasonable approximation. (2) Calculations: The difference between 2022 and 2020 payables is correctly approximated. The 2021 cost-payment gap is also correctly calculated within rounding tolerance. (3) Multi-hop reasoning: The LLM correctly links the 2021 accrual of more costs than payments to the growth in payables, and explains how this contributed to the increase observed by 2022, demonstrating sound synthesis across years and concepts. (4) The answer is contextually complete and relevant, addressing both the net change and the explanatory role of 2021 activity. The only minor shortcoming is the use of rounded figures without acknowledging the precise values, which slightly reduces quantitative precision but does not impair factual correctness. Hence, a score of 9 is appropriate.",

      "original_answer": "The Pet Nutrition segment reported a depreciation and amortization expense of $62 million in 2021, and it contributed 19% to the company's total worldwide Net sales during the same year. This indicates that while the segment accounted for a significant portion of Net sales, its depreciation and amortization costs were relatively modest compared to the overall business segments.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2021 the Pet Nutrition segment incurred **$62 million** of depreciation and amortization expense【page_117】. That same segment generated **$3.311 billion** of the company’s **$17.421 billion** worldwide Net sales, or about **19 %** of total sales【page_116】【page_3】—so the depreciation charge is a very small slice of the segment’s sales contribution.",

(1) Quantitatively, the depreciation and amortization expense of $62 million in 2021 is accurate, and the Pet Nutrition segment's contribution to total worldwide Net sales is correctly reported as 19%, supported by the exact figures of $3.311 billion in segment sales out of $17.421 billion in total sales. These numbers align with the knowledge graph and are properly cited to specific pages. (2) The calculation of 19% is accurate: $3.311B / $17.421B ≈ 0.190, confirming the percentage. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information about depreciation expense and sales contribution comes from different parts of the filing (pages 117 and 116/3), and the model correctly synthesizes these to compare the segment's cost and revenue impact. (4) The qualitative interpretation—that the depreciation charge is a small portion relative to sales—is logically consistent with the data and adds contextual insight without overreaching.

According to the ground truth, from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2021, foreign currency translation had a negative effect of -$775 million and acquisitions added +$21 million, resulting in a net change of -$754 million. The LLM incorrectly states that foreign currency translation added +$236 million and acquisitions +$15 million, for a combined +$251 million increase—this is the opposite direction and magnitude of the true effect. Additionally, the LLM claims Sky’s balance decreased from $13.300 billion in 2019 to $13.245 billion in 2020—a $55 million decline—but the ground truth shows an increase from $28,461 million to $29,950 million (a $1,489 million rise). These numbers are not only wrong but off by more than 50% in some cases. (2) All key figures are incorrect: the foreign exchange effect, acquisition impact, net change, and starting/ending balances for both periods are factually wrong. Calculations based on the LLM's own numbers (e.g., $13.300B to $13.245B = -$55M) are arithmetically correct, but the inputs are false. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails completely—instead of synthesizing the correct effects across years and factors, the model appears to have misread or hallucinated data, possibly confusing Sky with another entity or misreading the time periods. It does attempt to compare two periods as required, but with fabricated data. (4) The contextual relevance is low but not zero because the structure of the response addresses the two time periods and the requested factors (foreign exchange and acquisitions), so partial credit is given for attempting the right comparison framework.

However, the final cumulative calculation is incorrect. The LLM states the total net increase is $7 million, but the correct sum is $89 - $38 - $44 = $7 million — wait, this arithmetic is actually $7 million, not $94 million as claimed in the original answer. Upon re-evaluation, the ground truth appears to contain a calculation error: $89 - $38 = $51; $51 - $44 = $7 million. Therefore, the LLM’s calculation of $7 million is mathematically correct, contradicting the original answer’s claim of $94 million. This suggests the ground truth may be flawed. (2) All numbers per year are accurately extracted and formatted correctly. The LLM’s arithmetic is sound. (3) The multi-hop reasoning — aggregating data across three fiscal years for Adobe Inc. — is correctly executed with proper synthesis across time periods.

These discrepancies suggest the model pulled data from a different source or misread the filing. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent (e.g., $2,646M - $2,503M = $143M), but the underlying values do not match the ground truth.

However, this impact varies across its traditional electric operating subsidiaries: Alabama Power experiences a larger reduction of 5.3 percentage points, Georgia Power sees a smaller reduction of 2.2 percentage points, and Mississippi Power faces a 6.5 percentage point reduction. This variation indicates differing deferred tax positions among the subsidiaries, which may stem from differences in asset bases, regulatory environments, or investment patterns. Southern CompanyGas also experiences a 2.2 percentage point reduction, suggesting similar tax flowback mechanisms apply to its operations, though it does not benefit from the same scale of tax credits as Southern Power.",

According to the ground truth, the flowback reduces Southern Company's effective tax rate by 3.9 percentage points, with Alabama Power at 5.3 pp, Georgia Power at 2.2 pp, Mississippi Power at 6.5 pp, and Southern CompanyGas at 2.2 pp. However, the LLM claims Southern Company had a 6.6 pp reduction in 2022 (3.9 pp in 2024), which misrepresents the timing and magnitude. More critically, the subsidiary figures are entirely incorrect: it reports Alabama Power at 1.9 pp (2022) and 19.8 pp (2023), Georgia Power at 9.6 pp, and Mississippi Power at 7.8 pp—none of which align with the ground truth. These numbers contradict the original data, indicating a failure in accurate retrieval or synthesis. (2) The calculations and comparisons are therefore invalid. The LLM suggests larger impacts on subsidiaries than the parent company, which may align qualitatively, but the specific numerical discrepancies undermine any valid analysis. The mention of '2022' and '2024' introduces timeframes not present in the original question or answer, adding confusion. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in that the model attempts to compare the parent company to its subsidiaries and infer that tax flowback has a more pronounced effect in regulated utilities. This reflects an understanding of the structural tax dynamics. However, because the underlying data is wrong, the conclusion—while directionally plausible—is not supported by correct evidence. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses the right concepts (flowback, effective tax rate, subsidiary variation, tax dynamics), but the severe numerical inaccuracies drastically reduce factual correctness.

      "original_answer": "Amazon's principal repayments of finance leases decreased by $2,341 million (from $4,384 million in 2023 to $2,043 million in 2024). This indicates a reduction in the company's leasing obligations over the period, suggesting either fewer lease commitments or extended repayment schedules.",

The net change is correctly calculated as $2.611 billion, which the model reports as $2.6 billion — a reasonable rounding. (2) The quantitative accuracy is excellent: the increase of $2,611 million is accurately reflected, and the model adds contextual detail (medical payments of $184.4 billion) not in the original answer but consistent with sound reasoning.

The change in investment was a decrease of $754 million, not $5.5 billion. Additionally, foreign currency translation had a negative impact of $775 million, not a positive gain of $760 million. These are major numerical errors. (2) Completeness: The answer addresses the change in investment and foreign currency impact but misrepresents both.

(3) Entity Accuracy: The company (Comcast, Sky) and time period (2020–2021) are correct. However, the financial metric (equity-method investment) is mischaracterized. (4) Reasoning: The multi-hop reasoning fails—instead of calculating the change between two reported investment values, the model invents a narrative about acquisition leading to elimination of the investment, which is not supported by the ground truth. The foreign currency effect is also misrepresented in direction (positive vs. negative). (5) Semantic Equivalence: The answer conveys a completely different financial reality—downward $754M change due to negative FX vs. a $5.5B drop offset by FX gain. This is not semantically equivalent.

      "original_answer": "The $1,241 million swing in foreign currency translation impacts—from a $317 million gain in 2020 to a $924 million loss in 2021—reveals significant foreign exchange risk exposure in NEE's international operations. This volatility directly affected NEE’s Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), contributing to a year-over-year deterioration in its AOCI position related to foreign currency translation, which stood at a $(49) million balance by December 31, 2021. The loss in 2021, as disclosed in the consolidated statements of income, flowed through to AOCI, worsening its position from a $(42) million balance at the end of 2020.

However, it incorrectly states that the AOCI foreign currency translation balance was a '$49 million deficit'—the ground truth specifies a $(49) million balance, which is consistent with a $49 million loss, so this is semantically acceptable. But the LLM introduces a new figure—'$6 million net OCI gain for 2021'—that is not present in the original answer or implied by the data, and which contradicts the narrative of a $924 million loss flowing into AOCI. This is a significant quantitative error. (2) The calculation of the $1,241 million swing (317 + 924 = 1,241) is correct. The AOCI balance at year-end 2021 is correctly cited as $(49) million in the ground truth, and the LLM approximates this as a '$49 million deficit', which is acceptable. However, the addition of the '$6 million net OCI gain' is unsupported and misleading, as the original answer emphasizes the deterioration in AOCI due to the $924 million loss, with no mention of an offsetting gain. (3) The reasoning correctly links the foreign exchange swing to NEE’s AOCI and recognizes the materiality of FX risk. It captures the cause-effect relationship between translation losses and AOCI erosion. However, it fails to mention the prior year AOCI balance of $(42) million, which would have shown the year-over-year deterioration of $7 million (from $(42) to $(49)), weakening the multi-hop synthesis. The erroneous 'net OCI gain' further undermines the logical coherence. (4) Despite the introduction of an incorrect figure, the core insight—that NEE has significant FX exposure impacting AOCI—is preserved, and the key numbers (swing, gain/loss, ending AOCI) are mostly correct. Hence, the correctness score is 7: the main facts are right but with a notable error affecting quantitative precision.",

This mechanism contributes to Southern Company's effective tax rate being 18.8%, which is significantly lower than the federal statutory rate of 21.0%, as stated in the reconciliation of tax rates. The flowback effect is more pronounced at Georgia Power and Mississippi Power, indicating a greater tax benefit at these subsidiaries compared to Alabama Power.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual inaccuracies in the quantitative values provided. According to the ground truth, the flowback reduces Southern Company's effective tax rate by 6.6 percentage points, Alabama Power by 1.9, Georgia Power by 9.6, and Mississippi Power by 7.8. However, the LLM states Southern Company is reduced by 3.9 pp (2024), with varying figures across years (9.2 pp in 2023, 6.6 pp in 2022), implying time-series data not present in the original answer, which presents a single period. The subsidiary numbers are also incorrect: Alabama Power is listed as 5.3 pp instead of 1.9, Georgia Power as 2.2 pp instead of 9.6, and Mississippi Power as 6.5 pp instead of 7.8. These discrepancies are substantial and affect the core of the answer. (2) The calculation and reconciliation logic is partially correct — the flowback does reduce the effective tax rate from the 21% statutory rate, and it is reported in the tax rate reconciliation. The LLM correctly identifies this mechanism as a negative adjustment. However, the actual impact magnitudes are wrong, undermining the accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to correctly synthesize the comparative impact across Southern Company and its subsidiaries. It incorrectly suggests that subsidiaries have larger reductions than the parent (e.g., Alabama Power at 5.3 pp vs Southern Company at 3.9 pp), whereas the ground truth shows Georgia Power (9.6 pp) and Mississippi Power (7.8 pp) have larger benefits than Southern Company (6.6 pp), while Alabama Power (1.9 pp) has a smaller one. The LLM misrepresents the relative tax benefits. (4) The contextual relevance is fair — the answer addresses the flowback mechanism, its role in tax rate reconciliation, and compares parent to subsidiaries. However, due to severe numerical inaccuracies and incorrect year-specific framing not in the original, the qualitative and quantitative accuracy scores are low. The correctness score is 3 due to mostly incorrect numbers and misrepresentation of the comparative tax benefit, despite some correct conceptual framing.",

      "original_answer": "Chevron's (CVX) Results of Producing Operations in the U.S. decreased from $13,249 million in 2022 to $7,936 million in 2024, representing a 40.1% decline. For its affiliated company TCO, the results decreased from $4,276 million in 2022 to $2,882 million in 2024, a 32.6% decline. These changes reflect significant downward trends in operational performance for both the U.S. segment and the affiliated company over the two-year period.",

      "detailed_feedback": "1) The LLM answer correctly identifies all key numerical values: Chevron's U.S. results decreased from $13,249 million in 2022 to $7,936 million in 2024, and TCO's results fell from $4,276 million to $2,882 million over the same period. These figures match the ground truth exactly. The dollar declines ($5,313M for CVX, $1,394M for TCO) are accurate. The percentage declines are reported as 'about 40%' and 'roughly 33%', which are appropriately rounded versions of the precise 40.1% and 32.6% in the original answer. Minor rounding (32.6% → 33%) is acceptable under semantic equivalence.\n\n2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: all source numbers are correct, differences are accurately calculated ($13,249 - $7,936 = $5,313; $4,276 - $2,882 = $1,394), and percentage changes are reasonably approximated (5,313/13,249 ≈ 40.1%, 1,394/4,276 ≈ 32.6%). The use of 'about' and 'roughly' justifies the rounded percentages.\n\n3) Qualitative accuracy is high: the entities (Chevron/CVX, TCO/Tengizchevroil), metric (Results of Producing Operations), and time frame (2022 to 2024) are all correctly identified and synthesized. The reasoning correctly compares two affiliated entities across two years, fulfilling the multi-hop requirement. Only a minor point is deducted because the LLM does not explicitly name TCO as 'Tengizchevroil' in the initial reference, though it does so later.\n\n4) Contextual relevance is excellent: the answer directly addresses both parts of the question—changes in operational results for CVX U.S. and TCO, including magnitude and percentage change. The response is focused, complete, and supported with citation markers. Overall, this is a highly accurate, well-reasoned answer with only negligible rounding in percentages, fully within acceptable variation.",

The ground truth states that Raytheon’s Business Segment Sales increased by $130 million between 2023 and 2024, but the LLM claims a $363 million increase, which is significantly off. (2) The LLM provides specific figures: $26,350 million in 2023 and $26,713 million in 2024. The difference is $363 million ($26,713 - $26,350 = $363), so the internal calculation is mathematically correct based on those inputs. However, these input values do not align with the ground truth data, indicating either incorrect source data or misidentification of the figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning appears structurally sound—extracting segment sales for two years and computing the difference—but it fails at entity and data accuracy. It may have used data from the wrong company or business segment (e.g., RTX instead of Raytheon-specific data, or conflating total company sales with segment sales). (4) Despite correct formatting, contextual framing, and logical structure, the answer is fundamentally wrong in quantitative terms, which heavily penalizes correctness and quantitative accuracy.

The use of '2022' instead of '2023' is a critical entity error, and the amount $36.7 million does not match the correct $38.7 million. The total calculated by the LLM ($69.4 million) is therefore incorrect; the correct total is $71.4 million. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: two dollar amounts are wrong (one by $2 million), one year is incorrect (2022 vs 2023), and the sum is miscalculated due to incorrect inputs. Only the $32.7 million for 2024 is accurate. (3) The qualitative reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies that perpetual land easement payments are classified under 'Deferred financing costs and other financing activities' and that they increase deferred financing costs, which aligns with the ground truth. This shows correct synthesis of the accounting treatment. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses both parts of the question—total payments and impact on deferred financing costs—and references appropriate financial line items and implications, despite factual inaccuracies.

The annual breakdown—$1.0 billion in 2019, $1.375 billion in 2020, and $2.1 billion in 2021—sums to $4.475 billion, which is accurate. (2) The impact on net cash from financing activities is mostly correct: the LLM reports $6.6 billion in 2019, $25.2 billion in 2020, and $474 million in 2021. These figures align with the trend in the ground truth, though the ground truth does not specify 2019’s value. However, the LLM incorrectly states that net cash from financing was $474 million in 2021 without noting that it turned negative ($-7,030 million) in that year due to high redemptions—this is a material omission. The ground truth emphasizes the negative turn in 2021, which the LLM fails to reflect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links preferred stock redemptions (cash outflows) to their impact on net cash from financing activities across years, citing the increasing redemption amount in 2021 as a key driver. However, it misses the full severity of the 2021 decline, undermining the completeness of the impact assessment.

However, it reports total assets as $23.5 billion, which is incorrect — the ground truth states $29,196 million ($29.2 billion). This significant numerical error undermines the quantitative accuracy. (2) The calculation of the difference between assets and debt ($17 billion) is based on incorrect asset value: using $23.5B assets - $6.3B debt gives ~$17.2B, but with correct assets of $29.2B, the difference should be ~$22.9B. The model does not compute or mention the debt-to-asset ratio (21.6%), which is a key part of the original answer and directly addresses the comparison requested. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in that it attempts a comparison between debt and assets, but fails to perform the appropriate ratio analysis implied by 'how does this compare' — a ratio or percentage-based comparison is more informative than absolute difference in this context.

      "original_answer": "NextEra Energy allocates corporate interest expenses to the NEER segment based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt, which increases NEER's interest expense relative to its revenue projections. According to the segment reporting data, NEER's expected revenues drop significantly after 2022—from $4,400 million in 2022 to $365 million in 2023 and continuing to decline—while its interest costs remain tied to this debt-heavy allocation method. In contrast, FPL maintains more stable and higher revenues over the same period, which allows it to better absorb interest expenses. This methodology may disproportionately impact NEER's financial performance in later years, as declining revenues combined with a fixed debt-based interest allocation could compress margins and signal higher financial risk for the NEER segment compared to FPL.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer includes several correct elements, such as the 70% debt deemed capital structure for NEER and the contrast with FPL's actual interest expenses. However, it introduces specific dollar amounts for NEER's allocated interest ($367M in 2021, $659M in 2020, $873M in 2019) and FPL's interest expenses ($588M, $600M, $594M) that are not present in the original answer or supported by the ground truth from the knowledge graph. These figures may be factually accurate in the actual filings, but since they are absent in the ground truth and not inferable from it, their inclusion without corroboration reduces quantitative accuracy. Additionally, the LLM cites specific capex projections ($10.2B for NEER, $38.9B for FPL) and contract revenues ($570M, $8.6B), which are not mentioned in the original answer and represent unverified details not aligned with the provided ground truth. (2) While the core concept of deemed capital structure (70% debt) is correct, the original answer emphasizes the impact of declining NEER revenues post-2022 (from $4,400M to $365M in 2023) and how fixed interest allocation exacerbates margin pressure—this critical multi-year revenue drop is entirely missing in the LLM response. This omission significantly weakens the completeness and correctness of the financial impact analysis. (3) The reasoning about NEER’s profitability being constrained due to allocated interest is sound and correctly contrasts with FPL’s self-financed interest, showing good qualitative understanding of the allocation mechanism. However, the failure to incorporate the dramatic revenue decline for NEER—a key driver of financial stress in the original answer—represents a major gap in multi-hop synthesis across time and segments. (4) The contextual relevance is high because the LLM addresses the core issue of interest allocation methodology and its differential impact on NEER vs FPL. Still, the correctness score is reduced to 6 due to unsupported numbers and the absence of the crucial revenue projection trend, which is central to the original answer’s conclusion about disproportionate financial risk for NEER in later years.",

This reduction in flowback, which previously served to lower the effective tax rate below the statutory rate, meant that one of the key factors that typically reduces the effective tax rate had less of an impact in 2024. Therefore, the absence of this benefit partially explains why the effective tax rate may have moved closer to the statutory rate, even though other factors like non-taxable AFUDC equity and ITCs continued to keep it lower than the statutory rate.",

The ground truth does not state that Southern Company's effective tax rate increased to 18.5% in 2024 or that it was 11.4% in 2023—these specific percentages are not present in the original answer and are unsupported by the provided context. There is no mention of an 'employee-stock-plan dividend deduction' or 'non-deductible depreciation' as offsetting factors in the ground truth; instead, the correct factors cited are non-taxable AFUDC equity and ITCs (Investment Tax Credits). These entity and metric substitutions represent major factual errors. (2) The $197 million figure is correctly referenced, but the associated calculations and comparative tax rate figures (18.5%, 11.4%, 21%) are fabricated or incorrectly sourced, failing the quantitative accuracy check. The directionality (that reduced flowback increases the effective tax rate) is logically sound and aligns with the ground truth, but the precise numerical impact is not corroborated. (3) The reasoning partially captures the multi-hop logic: the reduction in flowback means less of a downward pull on the effective tax rate, which could cause it to rise toward the statutory rate. However, the model introduces incorrect explanatory factors instead of citing the correct ones (AFUDC equity and ITCs), indicating a failure in synthesizing the correct causal elements from the knowledge base. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the answer addresses the core mechanism—how reduced flowback affects the effective tax rate—and attempts to explain the relationship between temporary differences and tax rate movements.

It also correctly implies the 2020 value ($543.74) through context, which aligns with a 19.6% increase from 2019. (2) All calculations are accurate: $604.74 - $454.82 = $149.92. The 19.6% increase from $454.82 yields approximately $543.74, and an 11.2% increase from that value brings it to approximately $604.74, confirming internal consistency. The mention of a '33% gain' overall is a reasonable approximation of the compound growth ((1.196 * 1.112) - 1 ≈ 33%), which is not required in the ground truth but adds value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across three fiscal years, correctly sequences the YoY growth, and explains the compounding effect implicitly. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more detail (e.g., intermediate value and overall percentage), but no factual deviations.

These numbers were not part of the ground truth and may inaccurately imply that such a breakdown is either a result of or related to the fuel recovery provisions. (2) The $480 million and $1.0 billion revenue increases are correctly cited, and format variations (e.g., $480 million vs $480 million) are acceptable. However, the inclusion of unsourced net income figures undermines quantitative accuracy.

(3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly synthesizes that fuel cost recovery leads to revenue-expense offsetting across both subsidiaries, which is central to the conclusion. However, it fails to fully convey the complete neutrality of the impact by suggesting net income 'rose only modestly'—a claim not supported in the original answer and contradicted by the principle that there should be no net income effect. This misrepresents the magnitude of the impact. (4) Contextual relevance is high because the response addresses the core mechanism and entities involved.

      "original_answer": "Google's investment tax credit carryforwards of $700 million, which begin to expire in 2025, are not likely to be realized. This limitation negatively impacts Google's potential tax benefit realization because the company cannot fully utilize these credits to reduce future tax liabilities.

Pratt & Whitney's Net Sales are accurately given as $20,530 million in 2022 and $18,296 million in 2023, a decline of $2,234 million. The LLM rounds this to '$2.2 billion (≈11%)', which is acceptable (actual: $2,234M = $2.234B; 10.9% ≈ 11%). (2) Calculations are correct: (70,899 - 68,758) / 68,758 ≈ 3.1%; (20,530 - 18,296) / 20,530 ≈ 10.9%. The rounding to 11% is a minor approximation but within acceptable limits. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is mostly sound: the LLM correctly identifies that Pratt & Whitney’s decline contrasted with overall growth. However, it states the decline 'pulled the overall growth down and offset the gains in Collins Aerospace and Raytheon', which reverses the causal relationship. The ground truth clarifies that growth in Collins and Raytheon *offset* Pratt & Whitney’s decline—i.e., they drove the net increase despite Pratt’s drop.

The year-over-year growth from 2021 to 2022 is accurately calculated as 12% ((2,592 - 2,307) / 2,307 ≈ 0.123 or 12.3%, rounded to 12%), which aligns with the original answer. (2) The CAGR calculation is slightly off: the LLM states 'roughly 10%' and shows a computation of ~9.9% using (2,592 / 2,147)^(1/2) - 1. However, the correct CAGR over a three-year period (from 2020 to 2022) should use an exponent of 1/2 (since it's two compounding periods), which the model does correctly. The actual value is (2,592 / 2,147)^(0.5) - 1 = 1.207^(0.5) - 1 ≈ 1.0986 - 1 = 9.86%, which rounds to 9.9%. The ground truth reports 10.1%, which appears to be a minor discrepancy—possibly due to rounding or more precise underlying data (e.g., exact figures before rounding to millions). Given that both answers round to approximately 10%, and the method is correct, this is a negligible difference. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data across years and correctly distinguishes between three-year CAGR and one-year growth, citing appropriate pages. (4) All entities—Medtronic (MDT), Specialty Therapies segment, fiscal years 2020–2022—are correctly identified. The conclusion that the 2021–2022 growth rate exceeded the longer-term CAGR is logically valid and matches the original.

This is reflected in the interest cost dropping from $35 million in 2020 to $23 million in 2021. Additionally, the actuarial gains of $20 million in 2021 further reduced the benefit obligation.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect—dollar amounts, percentages, and implied calculations (e.g., $35M - $23M = $12M decrease) are all correct.

The ground truth specifies 'actuarial gains of $20 million', not a reduction in losses. This misstatement slightly affects the reasoning clarity but does not change the final outcome.

However, it incorrectly states the increase in income tax benefit as $37 million (86 - 49 = 37), whereas the ground truth correctly identifies this change as a $28 million increase. This is a calculation error, though the source numbers are correct. (2) All other numeric values (after-tax expense levels, pre-tax levels, and net increase) are accurate and properly formatted. The $115 million net increase is correctly derived from the $152 million pre-tax rise minus the $37 million (not $28 million) offset in tax benefit — while the final net figure is correct, the explanation contains an internal inconsistency in the offset amount. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is largely sound: the model synthesizes data across fiscal years and correctly attributes the after-tax trend to movements in pre-tax expense and tax benefits. The logic flow is coherent and addresses both parts of the question — the total increase and the contributing factors. Only the magnitude of the tax benefit change is miscalculated.

The comparison stating that the 2024 expense was about $909 million higher is accurate ($1,022M - $113M = $909M).

This matches the ground truth exactly. However, the Comparable Sales percentage change is partially misrepresented. The ground truth states that Comparable Sales decreased by 3.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 (i.e., a year-over-year decline of 3.2 percentage points from the prior year's growth). The LLM instead frames it as a swing 'from a 3.1% increase to a 3.2% decrease', implying a change in trend but adding a specific prior-year figure (3.1% increase) not present in the original answer. While this may be factually accurate based on the source document, the original answer only specifies the 3.2% decrease in 2023 versus 2022, not the exact prior-year value. Thus, the LLM adds precision not in the ground truth, potentially misleading if unverified. (2) The dollar amounts and their difference ($22.62) are correct. The calculation of a '3.6% drop' in sales per square foot is mathematically sound ((22.62 / 627.17) ≈ 3.6%), though this percentage was not requested. The error lies in the Comparable Sales interpretation: the question asks for the 'change in Comparable Sales percentage', which the ground truth answers directly as a 3.2% decrease. The LLM overcomplicates it with a 6.3 percentage point swing, which, while possibly accurate contextually, goes beyond what the original answer provides.

The Life Sciences Solutions segment saw a decrease of $3,555 million, or approximately 26.3%, from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is mostly correct but contains minor inaccuracies in percentage figures and rounding. The ground truth states a 7.5% decrease for Specialty Diagnostics, while the LLM reports 8%, likely due to rounding $4.8B and $4.4B (which are rounded versions of $4,763M and $4,405M). The actual calculated decrease is (4,763 - 4,405)/4,763 ≈ 7.52%, so 7.5% is more accurate. Similarly, Life Sciences Solutions decreased from $13,532M to $9,977M, a drop of (13,532 - 9,977)/13,532 ≈ 26.27%, correctly rounded to 26.3% in the original; the LLM reports 26%, which is acceptable but less precise. (2) Dollar amounts are correctly represented in rounded form ($4.8B ≈ $4,763M, $4.4B ≈ $4,405M, etc.), and the direction and magnitude of changes are accurate. The comparison between segments is valid. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies both segments, retrieves revenue figures for both years, computes percentage changes (within rounding), and compares them appropriately. (4) The answer addresses all parts of the question: percentage decrease for Specialty Diagnostics, revenue change in Life Sciences Solutions, and a comparison. Wording differs but meaning is semantically equivalent. Scores reflect high accuracy with minor quantitative imprecision due to rounding affecting percentage calculations.",

However, in 2024, the change in the estimated useful life of tower assets from 20 to 30 years led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense ($649 million after tax), which positively affected the 2024 financial performance. Therefore, while the prior year's impairment charge continued to reflect poor performance in discontinued operations, the asset life extension significantly improved the current year's operating results by reducing depreciation costs.",

In the first quarter of 2024 the Company extended the estimated useful life of its tower assets from 20 to 30 years, which lowered depreciation and amortization expense by roughly $730 million for the year, thereby reducing the depreciation component of the discontinued‑operations loss (page 95).",

It accurately notes that this non-recurring charge does not impact 2024 results directly. The key quantitative point—the $730 million reduction in depreciation and amortization expense due to the change in useful life from 20 to 30 years in 2024—is correctly stated and matches the ground truth. However, the LLM introduces a specific figure of $978.3 million for 2024 loss from discontinued operations (net of taxes) and $96 million of depreciation within that, which are not present in the original answer and may be extraneous or overly specific without being directly relevant to the question’s focus on the collective impact of the two events. (2) All core numbers ($322 million, $730 million) are accurate and correctly attributed to the right years and events. The after-tax figure of $649 million mentioned in the ground truth is missing in the LLM answer, which slightly reduces completeness on financial impact detail. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly separates the 2023 non-recurring impairment (affecting prior year) from the 2024 change in accounting estimate that reduces depreciation, and links the latter to improved financial performance via lower expenses. It correctly infers that the depreciation reduction affects the discontinued operations loss, though this nuance is more detailed than in the original. (4) The answer is highly contextually relevant, addressing both the goodwill impairment and asset life change, and their combined effect on depreciation and discontinued operations. The inclusion of extra details (e.g., page references, exact D&A within discontinued ops) suggests overfitting to a source document but doesn’t introduce factual errors.

This increase directly corresponds to the change in deferred tax liabilities related to ROU lease assets, which also rose from $96 million to $153 million over the same period.

The ground truth states that ROU lease assets increased from $96M to $153M (a $57M increase), but the LLM claims the 'fair-value-measured portion' of ROU assets fell from $112M to $0, which contradicts the original answer and introduces a concept ('fair-value-measured') not present in the ground truth. This misrepresents the core quantitative fact. (2) The deferred tax liability increase from $96M to $153M ($57M rise) is correctly reported, aligning with the ground truth. However, the ROU asset values are wrong—$112M vs. $96M as starting point—and the claim of a drop to $0 is unsupported by the original data. Calculations for the tax liability change are accurate, but the ROU asset change is incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails: the original answer asserts a direct correspondence between ROU asset values and deferred tax liabilities (both moving from $96M to $153M), implying equivalence or direct linkage. The LLM instead posits a divergence—ROU assets decreasing while deferred tax liabilities increase—contradicting the ground truth's assertion of direct alignment. This reflects flawed synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses ROU assets and deferred tax liabilities over the correct time period and references the correct relationship to tax differences, but the core facts are incorrect. The mention of 'Other assets (3)' and page citations adds specificity but does not compensate for factual errors. Overall, major factual and reasoning errors reduce correctness significantly despite partial alignment on the tax liability figure.",

The comparison stating that 2024’s impairments were roughly $2.3 billion lower than adjusted 2023 is accurate (difference = $2,521M - $187M = $2,334M ≈ $2.3B). (2) All numbers, calculations, and fiscal years are correct. The use of $2.577 billion and $56 million to derive $2.521 billion is mathematically sound and consistent with the source data. Format variations (e.g., billion vs million) are handled correctly. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two fiscal years, adjusts for a gain from a joint venture (A+E), and makes a valid year-over-year comparison. It correctly interprets that the $2.521 billion in 2023 was net of the gain, requiring backward inference to gross it up and then re-adjust—though the answer presents it as a subtraction, which is logically equivalent. (4) The answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth, with slightly more detail (e.g., explaining the $56M as 50% of the gain), but does not introduce errors. The only minor shortcoming is that the original answer emphasizes that 2023 had 'significantly higher' impairments *before any adjustments*, while the LLM focuses on the adjusted figure; however, the LLM still correctly conveys the comparative magnitude.

This impairment was driven by a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and the impact of a new restructuring program. The evaluation of net sales growth rates—both short-term and residual—was a key component in determining the fair value of the Gillette brand. Adverse changes in macroeconomic factors, grooming habits, currency exchange rates, and competitive pressures could negatively impact these growth rates, which in turn would reduce the estimated fair value of the intangible asset and potentially trigger future impairments.",

These figures reflect precise alignment with the ground truth, including the sensitivity analysis mentioned on pages 30–31. (3) The reasoning is sound and captures the multi-hop element: it correctly identifies that net sales growth assumptions—specifically short-term and residual growth rates—are central to the fair value model, which directly ties into the impairment trigger. While the LLM omits mention of the higher discount rate, currency weakening, and restructuring program as additional drivers (noted in the original), it emphasizes the key role of growth rate assumptions, which the original confirms as 'a key component.' The omission of secondary factors slightly reduces completeness but does not invalidate the core accuracy. (4) The answer is contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question: the financial impact and the role of net sales growth assumptions.

(1) All numeric values are accurate: $294 million for fiscal 2022, $303 million for fiscal 2023, total of $597 million, and an increase of $9 million—all match the original answer exactly. (2) Calculations are correct: $294M + $303M = $597M, and $303M - $294M = $9M. Format variations (e.g., $597 million vs $597M) are acceptable and do not affect accuracy. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—information from two fiscal years is correctly synthesized to compute the total and year-over-year change. (4) Entities are accurate: company (HD/Home Depot), metric (after-tax stock-based compensation expense), and fiscal years (2022 and 2023) are all correctly identified and used.

The Life Sciences Solutions segment revenue decreased from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023, representing a 26.3% decline.

(2) The percentage declines are slightly rounded: the ground truth reports a 7.5% decline for Specialty Diagnostics and 26.3% for Life Sciences Solutions, while the LLM reports 'about 8%' and 'roughly 26%'. These are reasonable approximations and do not constitute significant errors—rounding to whole percentages is common and acceptable in financial summaries. The core comparison (Specialty Diagnostics declining less than Life Sciences Solutions) is accurate and correctly emphasized.

It also accurately reports the shift in operating income from a $179 million loss in 2023 to a $328 million profit in 2024. The calculated improvement in operating income of $507 million ($328M - (-$179M)) is correct and adds useful context not explicitly stated in the original answer. (2) All numeric values—$5M, $10M, $179M, $328M—are factually accurate and properly attributed to the correct years. Calculations are precise and consistent with the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the worsening investee losses with the overall improvement in operating performance, and correctly infers that the positive swing in operating income offset the increased equity losses. The conclusion that this boosted overall results aligns with the original answer’s implication. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer does not explicitly mention that the growing investee loss created 'downward pressure' on financial performance before being offset—this nuance is present in the original answer and slightly enriches the qualitative explanation. However, the core reasoning and facts are preserved, and the omission does not distort meaning. Hence, correctness and qualitative accuracy are slightly reduced but remain high.",

This is calculated by subtracting the ending balance (15,116,786) from the beginning balance (15,550,061), which equals a net reduction of 433,275 shares due to repurchases of 499,372 shares and net issuances of 66,097 shares.",

The net change is accurately calculated as -433,275 thousand shares, matching the ground truth. (2) All calculations are correct: 15,550,061 - 15,116,786 = 433,275 (decrease), and the net change is consistent with repurchases minus issuances (499,372 - 66,097 = 433,275). The use of 'thousand' units is consistent across all numbers, and the conversion to 'about 433 million' is accurate. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes beginning balance, repurchases, issuances, and ending balance to compute the net change. It correctly interprets that repurchases reduce shares outstanding and issuances increase them, leading to a net decrease. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly state that the net reduction is 'due to' repurchases and net issuances in the same causal phrasing as the original, though it presents all components. This slightly affects qualitative accuracy but not factual correctness. All entities (Apple, 2024, common stock, repurchases, issuances) are correct.

(2) All calculations are accurate: the difference in both segment and total values are correctly implied, and while the LLM does not explicitly compute the 13.8% contribution of Grooming to the total increase, this is a derived metric not directly asked for in the question. The question asks for the net change in Grooming and how it compares to the overall change; the LLM appropriately notes that the total increase is 'far larger,' which is a valid qualitative comparison. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two time points and two different aggregation levels (segment vs. total), correctly identifying trends and making a valid cross-entity comparison. (4) The only minor shortcoming is the omission of the explicit percentage contribution (13.8%), which adds analytical depth but is not strictly required to answer the two-part question about net changes and comparison.

      "original_answer": "The deferred income tax credits of $4,536 million as a liability in Southern Company's consolidated financials arise primarily due to prior tax rate discrepancies and unamortized ITCs. These credits represent tax benefits previously recognized at higher rates than currently enacted and unamortized investment tax credits that are being gradually recognized over time. The total net amount of deferred income tax credits across all listed subsidiaries—Alabama Power ($1,398 million), Georgia Power ($2,149 million), Mississippi Power ($219 million), and Southern Company Gas ($755 million)—sums to $4,536 million, matching the consolidated liability.",

(2) However, the quantitative error is severe: the LLM incorrectly adds the consolidated total ($4,536 million) to the subsidiary amounts, resulting in a sum of $9,057 million. The correct total net amount is simply the sum of the subsidiaries — $1,398M + $2,149M + $219M + $755M = $4,536M — which already matches the consolidated liability. The LLM treats the consolidated figure as an additional component rather than the aggregate, leading to a doubling of the actual value. This invalidates the final number despite correct subsidiary figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails at the synthesis stage: the model should recognize that the consolidated liability equals the sum of the subsidiaries, not be added to them. This indicates a failure in logical aggregation across entities, a key aspect of multi-hop financial reasoning. (4) While the contextual relevance is high — the answer addresses the right companies, the correct accounting concept, and cites relevant pages — the critical calculation error undermines the factual correctness.

This leads to a completely wrong percentage increase of ≈124% instead of the correct 76.0%. However, the 'Affiliated Companies - TCO' figures ($18,652M in 2020 and $36,314M in 2021) are accurate, and the calculated 95% increase (rounded from 94.7%) is acceptable with minor rounding. (2) Calculations: The TCO calculation is correct ((36,314 - 18,652) / 18,652 ≈ 94.7%), but the Consolidated Companies calculation uses incorrect base values, making it invalid.

The ground truth states that the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment contributed $35 million in 2021 and $23 million in 2020, whereas the LLM reports $13.5 billion and $10.5 billion—off by a factor of nearly 400x. This massive discrepancy invalidates the core of the response. (2) Quantitative accuracy is extremely low: reported revenues are in the billions instead of millions, and the year-over-year increase is stated as $3 billion instead of $12 million. The percentage increase in the ground truth is 52.2%, while the LLM implies a ~28.6% increase, which is also incorrect. Calculations and figures are entirely inconsistent with the source data. (3) While the LLM correctly identifies the segment name and references the PPD acquisition as a contributing factor, it fails to correctly associate the timing and financial impact. The acquisition occurred on December 8, 2021, so its contribution would be minimal in 2021, yet the LLM implies a massive $3 billion uplift—unrealistic for a partial-month contribution. The reasoning does not align with the plausibility of the event timeline. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because the answer addresses the right segment, time frame, and acquisition, and attempts a year-over-year comparison. However, due to catastrophic numerical errors, the answer is effectively misleading. The citation of 'page_93' suggests a source reference, but the data does not match the ground truth.

These match the ground truth exactly. (2) The calculation of net foreign tax impact ($511M – $88M = $423M) is accurate and explicitly shown.

      "original_answer": "Regulatory pressure on interchange fees in the EU and Australia has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact American Express's discount revenue by exerting downward pressure on merchant discount rates. This occurs because competitor pricing adjustments in response to interchange fee caps influence American Express's own pricing strategy. Since discount revenue is recognized at the time the Card Member transaction occurs and is retained as part of the merchant payable for facilitating transactions, any reduction in discount rates directly reduces the revenue earned per transaction. Additionally, American Express has exited its network businesses in the EU and Australia due to regulatory constraints, which further limits its ability to generate discount revenue in those regions.",
      "llm_answer": "The EU and Australian rules that cap interchange fees force American Express to lower the merchant‑discount rates it can charge, which directly reduces the amount of discount revenue it earns and retains from merchants. Because discount revenue is recorded at the time each Card Member transaction occurs, those caps immediately shrink the per‑transaction discount revenue recognized on the income statement, lowering overall discount‑revenue earnings.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer correctly identifies the core mechanism by which regulatory pressure on interchange fees in the EU and Australia affects American Express's discount revenue model. It accurately explains that caps on interchange fees lead to lower merchant discount rates, which directly reduce discount revenue, and correctly notes that discount revenue is recognized at the time of transaction, impacting income immediately. This aligns with the ground truth in terms of financial recognition and the causal relationship between regulation and revenue. However, the LLM answer omits a key element from the original answer: American Express's exit from its network businesses in the EU and Australia due to regulatory constraints. This is a significant strategic consequence that further limits discount revenue generation in those regions and represents an important part of the multi-hop reasoning required. While the explanation of revenue recognition and pricing pressure is factually correct and semantically equivalent to the ground truth, the omission of the network exit reduces completeness. There are no numerical inaccuracies (quantitative accuracy is perfect as no specific numbers are involved and all conceptual financial linkages are correct), and the reasoning that is present is sound.

(1) Quantitatively: The ground truth states ESPN's total domestic revenue decreased from $9,267 million in 2023 to $9,131 million in 2024 (a 1% decline), but the LLM claims an increase from $14,945 million to $15,339 million (a 3% rise), which are not only incorrect but involve fabricated numbers not present in the original data. The claimed $1,650 million in subscription-fee revenue and $133 million increase are unsupported by the ground truth, which does not provide a breakdown of subscription revenue. (2) The increase in ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber from $5.49 to $6.14 is correctly stated, and the 12% increase is approximately accurate ((6.14-5.49)/5.49 ≈ 11.8%), so this single input fact is correct. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is flawed: the LLM incorrectly infers that higher per-subscriber revenue led to a large increase in total domestic revenue, while the ground truth explicitly states total domestic revenue declined despite the per-user revenue increase. This indicates a failure in multi-hop synthesis—correctly identifying one trend but incorrectly linking it to the overall financial outcome. (4) Contextual relevance is low because the answer fabricates key financial figures and misrepresents the trend, failing to address the actual relationship asked in the question: how a positive change in one metric impacted an overall outcome that actually deteriorated. The answer contradicts the ground truth rather than explaining the nuanced disconnect between subscriber-level gains and overall revenue decline.",

However, the year-over-year increase was incorrectly calculated as $23 million instead of the correct $27 million (271 - 248 = 23, but ground truth states $27 million increase — this is a contradiction in the ground truth itself, as 271 - 248 = 23, not 27). Despite this, the LLM's calculation is mathematically accurate, suggesting a possible error in the ground truth or data source. (2) All numbers except the delta are correct; the $23 million increase is mathematically sound, so the LLM's quantitative output is internally consistent. The total of $519 million is correct (248 + 271 = 519). (3) The multi-hop reasoning — aggregating two-year totals and computing year-over-year change — is correctly applied. The model synthesizes data across years accurately. (4) The contextual relevance is perfect: all parts of the question are addressed with appropriate sourcing. The discrepancy in the YoY change appears to stem from a conflict between the stated ground truth and arithmetic reality. Given that the LLM's math is correct and values match the reported figures, it should not be penalized for a potential ground truth error, but since the ground truth explicitly states a $27M increase, a slight deduction is made for not matching it exactly, though the calculation is sound.",

      "original_answer": "The Specialty Diagnostics segment experienced a decrease in revenue from $4,763 million in 2022 to $4,405 million in 2023, representing a decline of $358 million. At the same time, Thermo Fisher's consolidated revenues decreased from $44,915 million in 2022 to $42,857 million in 2023, a decline of $2,058 million. Therefore, the decline in Specialty Diagnostics accounted for approximately 17.4% of the total consolidated revenue decline year-over-year.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is highly accurate and conveys the essential information from the ground truth. (1) All numeric values are correct: $4.763 billion (2022) and $4.405 billion (2023) for Specialty Diagnostics, and $44.915 billion to $42.857 billion for consolidated revenues match the original answer (allowing for format variation: billion vs million). The year-over-year decline of $358 million in Specialty Diagnostics and $2,058 million in consolidated revenue is consistent, and the implied 8% decline in Specialty Diagnostics (~7.94%) and ~4.7% decline in consolidated revenue (~5% rounded) are correctly characterized. (2) Calculations are sound: the percentage declines are approximately correct (actual: (4763-4405)/4763 ≈ 7.52%; LLM reports 8%, likely rounded). Consolidated decline: (44915-42857)/44915 ≈ 4.58%, LLM reports 'about 5%', which is reasonable rounding. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is correct: the LLM identifies the trend in Specialty Diagnostics and compares it to the overall consolidated trend, concluding that the segment decline was steeper—this aligns with the ground truth that Specialty Diagnostics accounted for 17.4% of the total decline, indicating a relatively larger impact. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly quantify the 17.4% contribution to the total decline as in the original answer, which slightly reduces completeness in multi-hop synthesis. However, stating that the segment's drop was 'steeper' captures the comparative trend accurately. Thus, the answer is factually correct, well-reasoned, and contextually appropriate, warranting a high score with only a small deduction for missing the precise proportional contribution.",

This matches the ground truth exactly. The 'Other income (expense), net' increased from $1,424 million to $7,425 million, a $6,001 million increase, which the LLM rounds to $6.0 billion — an acceptable approximation. The LLM correctly states that the $829 million improvement contributed to this increase. (2) All calculations are accurate: $1,238M - $409M = $829M; $7,425M - $1,424M = $6,001M. The LLM uses rounded figures ($0.83 billion instead of $829 million and $6.0 billion instead of $6,001 million), but these are semantically equivalent and commonly accepted in financial reporting. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the improvement in foreign exchange loss to the overall increase in 'Other income (expense), net'. It does not explicitly calculate the 13.8% contribution ($829M / $6,001M ≈ 13.8%), but it conveys the same information by stating the $829M improvement contributed roughly $0.83 billion of the total gain, which is factually correct and contextually sufficient. (4) The answer is highly relevant, accurately synthesizes data across years and metrics, and maintains entity accuracy (GOOGL, correct years, correct financial line items). The only minor omission is the explicit percentage contribution (13.8%), but since the component values are correct and the contribution is described in absolute terms, this does not undermine the overall correctness.

While it correctly identifies the overall decrease in outstanding shares as approximately 1.31 billion (matching the ground truth of 1,310,000 thousand), it misrepresents the scale by stating '1.31 billion shares' instead of '1.31 million shares' — a critical 1000x error. The original data shows a decrease from 16,426,786 to 15,116,786 shares, which is ~1.31 million, not billion. (2) The annual net changes are grossly inaccurate: the LLM claims net declines of 483 million, 393 million, and 433 million shares for 2022–2024, which sum to over 1.3 billion, but the correct net reductions are much smaller — derived from repurchases of ~568k, 471k, and 499k and issuances of ~85k, 78k, and 66k, resulting in net reductions of ~483k, 393k, and 433k per year (not millions). Thus, the LLM inflated all figures by a factor of 1,000. (3) The reasoning structure is sound — it correctly attributes the decrease to repurchases exceeding issuances annually and links this to the cumulative trend — but the flawed numbers undermine the multi-hop synthesis. (4) Contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question: total decrease and contribution from repurchases/issuances.

The ground truth states $4,686 million as the total across all subsidiaries, but the LLM incorrectly reports a combined liability of $(9,353) million, which is approximately double the correct value and has an erroneous negative sign (indicating a credit as a negative liability, which misrepresents the nature of the figure). The individual subsidiary values listed (Southern Company $4,686M, Alabama Power $1,506M, etc.) sum to $9,353M, suggesting the LLM misunderstood the data — likely treating the parent company’s total as a component of the sum rather than the consolidated total. This results in severe quantitative inaccuracy. (2) The calculation verification shows: $4,686 (Southern Co) + $1,506 + $2,161 + $241 + $759 = $9,353M — confirming the LLM incorrectly summed the parent and subsidiaries, double-counting. The correct total is $4,686M, as stated in the original answer. (3) Regarding multi-hop reasoning, the LLM correctly identifies that the liability arises from historical differences in tax rates and unamortized ITCs, citing the correct conceptual explanation from the regulatory liabilities section (page 239), which aligns with the ground truth. This shows sound qualitative understanding of the underlying cause. (4) Contextually, the answer is relevant and attempts to synthesize data across subsidiaries and link to regulatory explanations, but the fundamental numerical error undermines the correctness.

The original answer clearly states that after subtracting the gain, operating income dropped to $348 million and net income became a loss of $(217) million. The LLM answer instead implies the gain positively contributed to income, which is the opposite of the correct treatment. (2) Quantitatively, the $2.724 billion gain, $4.369 billion GAAP operating income, and $4.013 billion net income are correctly reported (with format variation accepted: $2.724 billion = $2,724 million). However, the derived after-tax effect of $2.685 billion is not corroborated by the ground truth, which reports a net loss after adjustments, not a large positive addition. There is no mention of the $39 million tax benefit in the original answer, making this detail unsupported. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is fundamentally flawed: the model fails to understand that special items like gains on divestitures are excluded from adjusted operating and net income, not added to them. It misrepresents the direction of the adjustment, leading to an incorrect conclusion. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate—the answer discusses the right company (3M), year (2022), and financial concepts—but the core reasoning and conclusion are incorrect, severely undermining factual accuracy.

These values are reported accurately with acceptable formatting variations. (2) Quantitatively, the numbers are correct: the $1.7 billion charge and $668 million post-charge adjustment align with the original answer. However, the LLM fails to explicitly calculate or mention the implied underlying net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $2,368 million ($668M + $1.7B), which is a required part of the question's second sub-part. This omission affects completeness and reasoning. (3) The reasoning is partially sound — the model correctly links the charge to the reduction in the net adjustment, but it does not perform the multi-hop synthesis of inferring the pre-charge value, which requires adding the settlement charge back to the reported adjustment. This missing step indicates a gap in full logical synthesis despite having the necessary numbers. (4) Contextual relevance is perfect — the response directly addresses the topic, uses correct terminology, and cites a relevant page. However, due to the missing calculation of the underlying adjustment value, the answer is incomplete on a key component of the multi-hop query, warranting a score of 7 for correctness and qualitative accuracy.

However, regulations such as interchange fee caps in the EU and Australia have created downward pressure on merchant discount rates by limiting pricing flexibility.

The mention of American Express exiting network businesses in those regions is consistent with the original. (3) The reasoning is sound: the LLM correctly synthesizes how regulatory constraints limit pricing flexibility and thereby constrain revenue growth, linking fee caps to reduced margin and volume.

      "llm_answer": "Pension enhancements are booked inside the “Employee‑Related Costs” component of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. On the balance sheet they are shown as a charge against assets, which either lowers the net pension‑plan asset balance or, when the plan is under‑funded, increases the pension liability. By folding those enhancements into the restructuring program, Colgate‑Palmolive treats the pension obligation as a managed employee‑cost item, using the initiative’s cost‑reduction and resource‑reallocation focus to fund and control its broader employee‑related liabilities.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer correctly identifies that pension enhancements are treated as charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs and that this affects the balance sheet by reducing pension assets or increasing liabilities—this aligns with the ground truth. However, it incorrectly references the '2022 Global Productivity Initiative' and frames the pension enhancements as part of a restructuring program, which is not mentioned in the original answer and introduces a factual inaccuracy regarding the broader financial strategy. The company (CL) is correctly identified as Colgate-Palmolive, but the year in the question is 2024, while the LLM answer refers to 2022, creating a mismatch in time period. (2) There are no explicit numerical values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages) in either answer, so quantitative accuracy is not compromised—minor issues like year reference (2022 vs 2024) are more contextual than quantitative. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly links pension enhancements to balance sheet impact and employee-related costs, but fails to accurately synthesize the strategic rationale—instead of indicating a strategic decision possibly tied to workforce restructuring or long-standing practices as in the ground truth, it incorrectly ties the enhancements to a specific initiative (2022 Global Productivity Initiative) not present in the original, suggesting flawed cross-document or cross-year synthesis. (4) Correctness is scored 6 due to accurate core mechanics but significant error in context and strategy explanation; qualitative accuracy is 6 due to correct terminology but incorrect strategic framing; quantitative accuracy is 8 because no numbers are wrong (none provided), and the year discrepancy is more contextual; contextual relevance is 9 as the response stays on topic and addresses both balance sheet and strategy aspects, albeit with inaccuracies.",

      "contextual_relevance": 10,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains a critical calculation error in the total sum of Increases Related to Current Year Tax Positions. The correct sum is $66M (2020) + $1,582M (2021) + $75M (2022) = $1,723M, which matches the LLM's stated total. However, the ground truth states $1,643M, indicating a discrepancy in the source data. Upon verification, $66 + $1,582 + $75 = $1,723, not $1,643 — so the LLM's calculation is mathematically correct, but the ground truth appears to have an error. Despite this, the LLM's total ($1,723M) contradicts the provided ground truth ($1,643M), so per evaluation protocol, the answer must be penalized for quantitative inaccuracy relative to the stated ground truth. (2) The Gross Unrecognized Tax Benefits value of $3,245 million is correctly cited. The comparison that the three-year total is less than the FY2022 gross unrecognized tax benefits is correct in direction, and the qualitative description 'roughly $1.5 billion lower' is reasonable: $3,245M - $1,723M = $1,522M, which is ~$1.5B. However, since the ground truth asserts a different total ($1,643M), the LLM's total diverges from expected. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly identifies the relevant line item across three fiscal years, sums them, retrieves the correct end-2022 gross unrecognized tax benefits, and makes a valid comparison. (4) The entity accuracy and contextual relevance are perfect — all metrics and years are correctly identified. The qualitative reasoning is strong. However, due to the numerical mismatch with the ground truth (even though the LLM's math is correct), the quantitative accuracy is low, dragging down the overall correctness score. The model should have matched the ground truth's total of $1,643M, but it does not — either due to a data extraction error or a ground truth error.

The LLM reports this as a $3.6 billion decrease, which is a rounded but acceptable approximation ($3,557 million ≈ $3.6 billion). The original answer uses the exact figure, but rounding to one decimal place in billions is common and semantically equivalent. (2) The LLM correctly states the swing in 'Free cash flow less principal repayments of finance leases and financing obligations' from a $19.8 billion outflow (original: $19,758 million) to a $32.2 billion inflow (original: $32,158 million), which represents an improvement of approximately $52 billion. The exact swing is $51,916 million, so $52 billion is a reasonable rounding. All core financial figures are accurate within acceptable rounding conventions. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the reduction in repayments to the improvement in the adjusted free cash flow metric, demonstrating synthesis across two time periods and two financial metrics. (4) The answer is fully contextually relevant, directly addressing both parts of the question. The only minor shortcoming is the use of rounded figures without explicitly noting the rounding, which slightly reduces quantitative precision but does not affect factual correctness. Hence, a score of 9 is justified—excellent accuracy with minor approximation.",

The difference between these figures is $7,968M - $7,653M = $315M, which matches the LLM's calculation.

However, the LLM claims the segment's depreciation was $423 million and total corporate depreciation was $831 million—both figures are wildly off.

(2) Calculations are sound: $15.437B - $14.106B = $1.331B ≈ $1.33B, and $794M + $525M = $1.319B ≈ $1.33B, with the small difference due to rounding. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is correct—the model synthesizes data from two different pages (revenue totals and breakdown by rents/royalties) to explain the composition of growth. (4) Entities are accurate: McDonald’s, franchised-restaurant revenues, 2022 vs. 2023, rents, and royalties are all correctly identified. (5) The answer addresses all parts of the question: total increase and its breakdown. Wording differs slightly but meaning is preserved. No factual, numerical, or logical errors.",

      "original_answer": "A deterioration in the financial condition of Coca-Cola's equity method bottling partners could directly reduce Coca-Cola's net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups, as well as decrease equity income or lead to impairments of equity method investments. Simultaneously, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations—particularly a strengthening U.S. dollar against major currencies—could materially affect Coca-Cola's financial results, especially since $25.6 billion of net operating revenues in 2021 came from operations outside the U.S. The combination of these two risks could lead to a dual impact: reduced revenue from key distribution partners and a decline in the dollar value of international revenues when translated into U.S. dollars, both of which would negatively affect overall financial performance.",
      "llm_answer": "A weakening of the financial condition of bottling partners—especially those accounted for under the equity method—could cut Coca‑Cola’s sales of concentrates and syrups and reduce its equity‑method earnings, potentially leading to impairments of those investments (see page 21). At the same time, heightened foreign‑currency volatility—particularly a stronger U.S. dollar—would translate foreign sales into fewer dollars, compressing net operating revenues and operating income (see page 23). Together, lower partner‑driven sales and adverse currency translation could compound to depress Coca‑Cola’s net operating revenues and overall financial performance.",

      "original_answer": "Georgia Power contributes $10,118 million in operating revenues to Southern Company, forming a significant portion of its financial base. However, Georgia Power is also subject to a maximum annual insurance assessment of $89 million under the NEIL policies, which could increase Southern Company's financial risk exposure if triggered. This assessment could impact Southern Company's operational stability by diverting funds that might otherwise be used for growth or debt reduction. Additionally, in the event of a nuclear incident, Georgia Power's uninsured losses could further strain Southern Company's finances, as insurance proceeds may not cover all incurred expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "The NEIL nuclear‑insurance program could require Georgia Power to pay up to **$89 million** in annual assessments if losses exceed the insurer’s fund (page 209); any shortfall in coverage would be absorbed by Georgia Power and, because the utility is a Southern Company subsidiary, could “have a material effect on Southern Company’s … financial condition and results of operations” (page 209).  At the same time, Georgia Power delivers roughly **$10 billion** of operating revenue each year (2023 operating revenues $10,118 million versus Southern Company’s $25,253 million total, page 211), providing a large, stable cash‑flow base that helps offset the modest insurance‑assessment risk and supports overall operational stability.",

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: $89 million and $10,118 million are correctly reported, with acceptable rounding of revenue to $10 billion. No calculation errors. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM connects Georgia Power’s insurance exposure to Southern Company’s financial risk, acknowledges the materiality of potential shortfalls, and balances this against Georgia Power’s substantial revenue contribution. It correctly infers that the stable cash flow helps offset the assessment risk, which aligns with the original answer’s implication of operational stability. (4) The only minor gap is that the LLM does not explicitly mention uninsured losses in the event of a nuclear incident beyond insurance shortfalls, which slightly reduces qualitative completeness.

However, it misrepresents the net totals: it states a net total of $312 million expense in 2021 and $291 million expense in 2019, treating the negative pension values as positive expenses and the positive postretirement credits as reducing the total. While the arithmetic (349 - 37 = 312, 333 - 42 = 291) is numerically correct, the sign convention is reversed — the ground truth reports the total amortization as negative values (-$312 million in 2021 and -$291 million in 2019), indicating net credits. (2) The comparison is therefore incorrect: the LLM claims the combined amortization was $21 million higher in 2021, but in reality, the net credit decreased (from -$291M to -$312M is a $21M increase in credit magnitude, but the direction depends on interpretation). The ground truth correctly states a 'slight decrease of -$21 million' — meaning the net credit became more negative by $21M. The LLM incorrectly frames this as an increase in expense, when in fact the net credit (negative amortization) increased in absolute value. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — it pulls correct values from both years and both plans — but fails in correctly interpreting the sign and direction of the net amortization. The synthesis is accurate in data retrieval but flawed in financial interpretation.

This was partially offset by reduced tobacco sales, which improved the sales mix. However, the overall gross profit rate for Walmart increased by 14 basis points in fiscal 2022 due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment, despite the negative impact from the Sam's Club segment.",

It states that Walmart's overall gross profit rate fell by 68 basis points in fiscal 2022, which directly contradicts the ground truth: the overall gross profit rate for Walmart *increased* by 14 basis points. The 68 basis point decrease applies only to the Sam's Club segment's gross profit rate due to fuel sales, not the company overall. Additionally, the LLM incorrectly frames the removal of tobacco as a negative (drag), while the ground truth states reduced tobacco sales *improved* the sales mix, acting as a partial offset. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the 68 basis point figure is misapplied to the wrong entity (Walmart overall vs. Sam's Club segment), and the correct 14 basis point overall increase is omitted entirely. No correct calculation or directional impact for the net effect on Walmart’s total gross profit rate is provided. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails: the model does not synthesize the offsetting effect of Sam's Club dynamics with the positive price management in Walmart U.S., which was key to the overall 14 bps increase. It incorrectly aggregates segment-level impacts to the corporate level without considering other segments. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate because it addresses fuel and tobacco in Sam's Club and mentions profitability impact, but the conclusion is fundamentally wrong. Scores reflect major factual and reasoning errors despite some correct elements (e.g., low-margin nature of fuel).",

The ground truth states $73M (2024), $56M (2025), and $59M (thereafter), totaling $188M for 2024–2026 and thereafter. However, the LLM incorrectly assigns $131M to 2024, $73M to 2025, $56M to 2026, and $59M thereafter, summing to $319M — which is not supported by the ground truth and misallocates amounts across years. The correct total committed revenue is $228M, not $319M. (2) The LLM reports Technology Services Revenue as $1.485B in 2023 vs $1.364B in 2022, calculating a $121M increase — this aligns with the ground truth in magnitude ($1.5B vs $1.4B, $121M increase), though the exact figures are slightly more precise in the LLM answer. However, the core increase amount is correct, so this part is factually acceptable. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails on the first part: the model misreads the time periods and amounts for committed revenue, incorrectly adding a 2026 figure and misassigning values across years. It also references BlackRock, which is not mentioned in the original answer and may indicate entity confusion. (4) The contextual relevance is high as the answer addresses both parts of the question and cites appropriate pages.

      "original_answer": "The $135.4 billion backlog impacts the recognition of contract sales as approximately 38% is expected to be recognized within 12 months and 60% within 24 months. This gradual recognition affects the profit booking rate because the company continuously revises estimates of total costs and variable consideration during the performance of contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Changes in risks surrounding technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contracts within the backlog can either increase or decrease the profit booking rate, depending on whether the risks are retired or escalate.",

These percentages are correctly attributed to revenue (contract sales) recognition timing, which aligns with the question. (2) All numeric values—$135.4 billion, 38%, and 60%—are factually correct and match the original answer exactly. There are no calculation errors or misstatements. Format variations (e.g., spacing in '$135.4 billion') do not affect accuracy. (3) The reasoning around the profit booking rate under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method is sound: the LLM correctly explains that the rate is adjusted based on changes in cost estimates and risk retirement, which directly impacts profit recognition as work progresses. This reflects proper multi-hop synthesis between backlog value, revenue recognition timing, and dynamic profit margin adjustments. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention 'variable consideration' or 'continuous revision of estimates' using the exact phrasing from the ground truth, though the meaning is semantically equivalent (e.g., 'adjusted upward or downward as risks are retired or cost estimates change').

While it correctly identifies the overall average price per share as $237.35 and the December average price as $244.72, it drastically underreports the total dollar value of shares purchased. The correct total is $2,804,785,000, but the LLM calculates only $665 million, based on a misinterpretation of the number of shares (2.805 million instead of approximately 11.8 million shares, since $2.8 billion ÷ $237.35 ≈ 11.8 million). The LLM incorrectly states that 2.805 million shares were bought for $665 million, when in fact the dollar amount should be over $2.8 billion. (2) The calculation of the December price being higher by $7.37 (≈3%) is approximately correct ($244.72 - $237.35 = $7.37), so this comparison is accurate. However, the core financial figure—the total repurchase value—is off by more than 75%, which is a major quantitative error. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model identifies both the Q4 program total average price and the December-specific average and makes a valid comparison between them. However, it fails to correctly extract or interpret the total dollar amount from the source, leading to a cascading error in derived calculations. (4) Due to the severe inaccuracy in the total dollar value—a central component of the question—the correctness score is low.

Additionally, the claim that the consolidated rate rose to 24.4% is not present in the original answer and cannot be verified from the provided truth, introducing unverified data. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound—the model recognizes that the two segments’ effects should be combined—but fails in the final inference, reversing the direction of the net impact.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the two key figures: $1,485 million from historical financial data and $112 million from the multi-year contractual commitments table, both of which match the ground truth. However, the calculated difference is incorrect. The LLM states the difference is $1,373 million, but the correct difference is $1,485M - $112M = $1,373M — wait, this appears to be a miscalculation in the original ground truth. Recalculating: $1,485 - $112 = $1,373. Therefore, the LLM's calculation of $1,373 million is actually correct, contradicting the provided 'ground truth' of $1,166 million. This suggests a potential error in the ground truth. Assuming the ground truth is authoritative, there may be a misinterpretation of which numbers to use. But based on the numbers cited ($1,485M and $112M), the correct arithmetic difference is indeed $1,373M. (2) Quantitative accuracy suffers because the expected answer is $1,166M, which does not align with the provided inputs. If the ground truth is correct, then either the $1,485M or $112M is wrong, but the LLM pulls these numbers with source citations that support their presence in the document. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model identifies revenue from two different sections (historical income statement vs. contractual commitments) and attempts to compute the difference. (4) Due to the discrepancy between the expected difference and the mathematically correct one based on cited figures, the correctness score is reduced. The model may be factually right, but diverges from the expected answer, leading to a partial credit scenario. Final scores reflect mostly correct input numbers and reasoning, but a mismatch in the final result compared to ground truth.",

However, the cumulative total is incorrectly calculated as $384 million loss, when the correct sum is $ (304) million (i.e., -1,077 + 308 + 385 = -384? No: -1,077 + 308 = -769; -769 + 385 = -384). Wait: -1,077 + 308 + 385 = -384. But the ground truth states $ (304) million. This is a critical discrepancy. Either the ground truth or the calculation logic is inconsistent. Recalculation: -1077 + 308 = -769; -769 + 385 = -384. Therefore, the correct cumulative value should be $ (384) million, not $ (304) million. The LLM’s calculation is mathematically correct, but contradicts the stated ground truth. This raises a data conflict. However, per evaluation protocol, we must score against the provided ground truth. Since the ground truth says $ (304) million, and LLM reports $ (384) million, this is a factual error. (2) The LLM introduces Other Income (Expense), Net figures not in the original answer: $1,373 million in 2022 and -$313 million in 2023. These numbers are not present in the ground truth and cannot be verified from the provided context. The ground truth only mentions $995 million in 2024. Thus, these additions are unsupported and likely incorrect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound — the LLM connects debt extinguishment gains to the Other Income (Expense), Net line item, which aligns with the question’s intent. However, the use of unverified figures for 2022 and 2023 undermines the analysis. (4) Despite accurate component numbers, the cumulative total mismatch (due to either miscalculation or ground truth error) and inclusion of unsupported data reduce correctness. The LLM gets credit for correct annual components and directional trend, but loses points for incorrect total and extraneous, unverified figures.

The LLM claims it was 'state taxes (net of the federal tax benefit)' decreasing from 2.7% to 1.7%, contributing ~1.0 point reduction. This contradicts the ground truth, which identifies 'Foreign-derived intangible income deduction' as the largest contributor to the decrease, changing from -4.2% in 2021 to -3.9% in 2022 (a 0.3 percentage point reduction in tax rate impact, i.e., less deduction, which would increase tax rate, but the ground truth frames it as contributing to the decrease—likely due to relative change in magnitude of benefit). The LLM’s cited component and magnitude do not align with the original answer. (3) The multi-hop reasoning fails because while the model correctly pulls Cisco’s tax rates across years, it misattributes the most significant contributing factor, indicating a failure to correctly synthesize or interpret the component-level drivers from the source data.

According to the ground truth, the ABO for Non-U.S. Pensions decreased from $8,694 million in 2020 to $8,404 million in 2021, a decrease of $290 million. However, the LLM reports a decrease from $9,830 million to $9,278 million, or $552 million — both values and the difference are incorrect. Similarly, the fair value of plan assets increased from $6,254 million to $6,947 million (a $693 million increase) in reality, but the LLM states an increase from $7,653 million to $7,968 million ($315 million gain), which is also incorrect. These numerical discrepancies are substantial and materially affect the conclusion. (2) Calculations in the LLM answer are internally consistent (e.g., $9,830 - $9,278 = $552), but they are based on wrong source numbers, so the quantitative accuracy is low. The ground truth shows a much larger increase in assets ($693M vs. $315M) and a smaller drop in obligations ($290M vs. $552M). (3) The multi-hop reasoning — comparing changes in ABO and plan assets over time — is structurally sound, and the LLM correctly identifies the direction of change (obligations down, assets up), which shows basic qualitative understanding. However, it fails to accurately extract the correct financial figures from the source, undermining the analysis.

The original answer defines the increase in rents as part of franchised revenue growth, specifically $794.3 million (from $9,045.7M to $9,840.0M), which is a core component of the revenue growth. However, the LLM incorrectly interprets 'rents' as 'variable-rent expense' rising from $209M to $261.4M — a $52.4M increase — which refers to MCD's own operating expenses, not rental income from franchisees. This misidentification leads to a completely incorrect comparison: the LLM calculates the difference as $1.331B - $52.4M = ~$1.28B, which is not what the question asks. The question asks how much the increase in franchised restaurant revenues exceeded the increase in rents (i.e., rental income), not rent expenses. (2) The revenue numbers are approximately correct: $14.105B to $15.437B (vs. ground truth $14,105.8M to $15,436.5M), so the $1.331B increase is accurate. The components of revenue growth — rent income +$794M, royalty +$525M, initial fees +$11M — are consistent with the ground truth and correctly identified. However, the final comparison is wrong due to the rent/expense confusion. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails at a critical point: the model conflates 'rents received' (a revenue component) with 'rent expenses paid' (an operating cost), breaking the logical chain. While it correctly identifies the sources of revenue growth, it fails to compare the correct two increases: franchised revenue growth vs. rent income growth.

      "original_answer": "The total net increase in 'Other Accounts Receivable Allowances' from fiscal year 2023 to 2024 is $7 million. This is calculated by comparing the beginning balance of $4 million in 2023 to the ending balance of $11 million in 2024, which results in a net increase of $7 million.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors. The beginning balance for 'Other Accounts Receivable Allowances' in FY 2023 is incorrectly stated as $1 million (ground truth: $4 million). The additions in FY 2023 are stated as $5 million, which is not supported by the ground truth and irrelevant to the question. The LLM calculates a net increase of $15 million by comparing total allowances activity in FY 2024 ($21 million) to a fabricated FY 2023 total of $6 million, which is not how net increase in allowances is determined. The correct net increase is $7 million, derived from the change in ending balances: $11 million (FY 2024 end) - $4 million (FY 2023 beginning, which is also the FY 2024 beginning). (2) The calculation is fundamentally flawed. The correct method is to compute the net change in the allowance balance over the period, considering additions and write-offs. Ground truth confirms $17 million in additions and $10 million in write-offs/utilizations, resulting in a $7 million net increase. The LLM instead sums beginning balance and additions for each year and takes the difference, which misrepresents the financial logic. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is unsound. The model fails to correctly identify the beginning balance for FY 2023 and invents data for FY 2023 additions. It does not reference the ending balance for FY 2024 ($11 million) or account for write-offs. The synthesis across fiscal years is incorrect and based on non-existent figures. (4) The contextual relevance is moderate because the model attempts to address the right metric and time frame, and references a document page. However, the qualitative and quantitative inaccuracies severely undermine the answer. Correctness and quantitative accuracy are low due to wrong numbers and flawed calculation. Qualitative accuracy is poor due to incorrect reasoning and entity relationships.",

      "original_answer": "The Home Depot estimates store shrink occurring between physical inventory counts on a store-specific basis using recent shrink results. This methodology directly affects the accuracy of its U.S. merchandise inventory valuation, which is stated at the lower of cost or market under the retail inventory method. Since shrink is a key component in determining inventory value, the use of historical shrink data introduces subjectivity and potential estimation risk, particularly if shrink trends vary significantly from historical patterns. This estimation process is a critical audit matter due to its material impact on inventory valuation and earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "The Home Depot determines shrink by adding the actual loss found in each physical inventory count to a store‑specific estimate of loss that occurs between counts, and that estimate is derived mainly from each store’s recent shrink results. Because the retail‑inventory method uses shrink (along with mark‑ups and markdowns) to compute the “lower of cost or market” value of U.S. merchandise, basing the interim‑shrink estimate on recent, store‑level loss experience makes the inventory valuation more reflective of current conditions and therefore more reliable—though it still depends on management’s judgment in applying those estimates.【page_41】",

(1) It correctly identifies The Home Depot's methodology of estimating shrink between physical inventory counts using recent, store-specific shrink results, which directly impacts the U.S. merchandise inventory valuation under the retail inventory method. The answer accurately notes that shrink is a key input in determining the 'lower of cost or market' value, consistent with the original answer. (2) There are no numeric values (e.g., dollar amounts, percentages, dates) in either the question or answers, so quantitative accuracy is not applicable—no errors present. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly links the estimation methodology (store-level recent shrink data) to its effect on inventory valuation under the retail inventory method, and acknowledges the role of management judgment, which corresponds to the subjectivity and estimation risk mentioned in the ground truth. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM answer emphasizes the *reliability* and *reflectiveness of current conditions*—a slightly more positive framing—while the original answer highlights *estimation risk* and *subjectivity*, especially if trends change. However, the LLM does acknowledge reliance on management judgment, capturing the core qualification. Thus, the semantic meaning is largely equivalent, with only a subtle difference in emphasis.

      "original_answer": "The $15,436.5 million in 2023 revenues from franchised restaurants represents the sum of rents, royalties, and initial fees collected by McDonald's, which are derived from franchised sales. According to the disclosure, franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by McDonald's but are instead the basis on which franchised revenues are calculated. This indicates that the $15,436.5 million in franchised revenues is directly tied to the volume and health of franchised sales, which in turn reflect the financial health of the franchisee base. Thus, the high franchised revenue figure suggests strong underlying franchised sales performance, even though the company does not record those sales directly as revenues.",

Because franchised sales are not recorded as revenue, the Company uses those sales as the basis for calculating the percentage‑of‑sales rents and royalties; the 9 % increase in franchised sales (to $119.8 billion) therefore drove a roughly 9 % rise in franchised revenues (to $15.4 billion), confirming the health of the franchisee network 【page_15†L1-L13】.",

However, the LLM introduces a specific franchised sales figure of $119,750 million (or $119.8 billion), which is not present in the original answer or implied by it. This number may be factually accurate based on external data or the cited page references, but since it's absent from the ground truth and not inferable from the provided context, its inclusion introduces unverified quantitative claims. (2) The calculation stating that a 9% increase in franchised sales drove a roughly 9% rise in franchised revenues is logically sound and consistent with the proportional relationship between sales and revenue (via percentage-of-sales royalties), but again depends on the accuracy of the $119.8 billion figure, which cannot be verified against the ground truth. The revenue amount ($15.4 billion) is correctly rounded from $15,436.5 million. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is strong: the model correctly synthesizes that franchised revenues are derived from franchised sales via contractual percentages, and uses that to infer franchisee financial health. It connects the revenue increase to sales performance, demonstrating sound logic. (4) While the core conceptual explanation is accurate and contextually relevant, the introduction of unsupported specific sales figures and percentage changes reduces quantitative accuracy. The answer goes beyond the ground truth in numerical detail without confirmation, warranting a deduction in correctness and quantitative accuracy.

This is a critical omission and factual error, as the question hinges on comparing both years. (2) Quantitatively, the $820 million figure for 2021 is accurate, but the failure to report the 2022 value ($1,516 million) means half of the required data is missing. The comparison stating an increased negative impact of $696 million (1,516 - 820) cannot be derived from the LLM answer, and no attempt is made at this calculation. (3) The reasoning is flawed because the model fails to perform the necessary multi-hop synthesis—extracting both 2021 and 2022 values and comparing them.

      "original_answer": "The total cumulative impact of Net Investment Hedging Activities on ABBV's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss from 2019 to 2021 was a net decrease of $112 million. This is calculated by starting with the 2019 balance of $9 million, adding the three years of net current-period other comprehensive income (loss) related to this category: $74 million (2019), $(799) million (2020), and $699 million (2021), resulting in a final balance of $(91) million by the end of 2021. During this period, the total reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss related to this activity amounted to $(56) million (sum of $(21) million in 2019, $(14) million in 2020, and $(21) million in 2021), which reduced the gains before reclassification and contributed to the final balance.",
      "llm_answer": "ABBV’s net‑investment‑hedge results were $27 million in 2019, $18 million in 2020 and $26 million in 2021, for a three‑year cumulative impact of about $71 million on its Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss【page_111】. All of those amounts were reclassified out of AOCI into net earnings, so the reclassifications removed the $71 million from OCI and thereby offset that portion of the accumulated loss.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer is largely incorrect in both magnitude and direction of the impact. The ground truth states a net decrease of $112 million in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL), culminating in a final balance of $(91) million after starting from $9 million in 2019. The LLM instead reports positive cumulative hedge results of $71 million ($27M + $18M + $26M), which contradicts the actual figures from the knowledge graph: $74M (2019), $(799)M (2020), and $699M (2021). The correct sum of current-period impacts is $74 - 799 + 699 = $(26) million, not $71 million. Furthermore, the LLM misrepresents the nature of the activity—net investment hedging caused large losses in 2020 and gains in 2021 that partially offset, not consistent gains as implied. (2) The reclassification amounts are also wrong: the LLM claims $71 million were reclassified, but the correct total is $(56) million (sum of $(21)M, $(14)M, $(21)M across 2019–2021). These reclassifications reduced AOCL (i.e., increased losses), not removed gains as the LLM suggests. The LLM incorrectly frames reclassifications as removing gains from OCI into earnings, implying a reduction in AOCL due to realized gains, but in reality, the reclassifications were losses that flowed into earnings, worsening the P&L while reducing the unrealized burden in OCI. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is flawed: the model fails to track the correct beginning balance ($9M), apply the correct annual changes, compute the ending balance, or correctly incorporate reclassifications. It does not show synthesis across years and misidentifies the sign and magnitude of impacts. (4) Despite incorrect numbers and reasoning, the answer is contextually relevant—it addresses net investment hedging, AOCL, reclassifications, and covers the correct time period and company (ABBV). However, the factual inaccuracies severely undermine correctness. Quantitative accuracy is very low due to wrong values and calculations. Qualitative accuracy is poor due to flawed logic and misunderstanding of how reclassifications affect AOCL. Contextual relevance is moderate because the structure and intent align with the question, even if the content does not.",

It reports a $10.5 billion increase from FY2021 to FY2022 and a $16.0 billion increase from FY2020 to FY2021, which aligns closely with the ground truth values of $10,531 million and $15,985 million, respectively. The comparison states a $5.5 billion smaller gain in the later period, which is a rounded version of the exact $5,454 million difference. Minor rounding is acceptable under semantic equivalence. (2) All calculations are accurate: $218.9B - $208.4B = $10.5B; $208.4B - $192.4B = $16.0B; difference in growth = $16.0B - $10.5B = $5.5B. These match the ground truth within reasonable rounding. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound—LLM correctly extracted and compared two-year-over-year changes across three fiscal years, synthesizing data from consecutive periods to assess trend changes.

The combined revenue for 2021 and 2020 is correctly calculated as $9.55 billion ($9,550 million), which is accurate. However, the LLM states that the difference is 'about $5.08 billion' higher, which is incorrect—the actual difference is $9,550M - $4,472M = $5,078M, or $5.078 billion, which should be rounded to $5.08 billion only if using two decimal places, but the ground truth correctly frames it as $503 million less in 2022. The LLM misrepresents the comparison direction and magnitude: it says 2022 revenue is $5.08 billion lower, but then incorrectly labels this as '≈53% higher' than 2022, which is illogical.

The increase in Class A repurchases was correctly stated as $2.54 billion (from $9,316 million to $11,855 million), and the LLM accurately noted that this partially offset the Class C reduction. The total repurchase amounts were correctly implied to remain stable, with a minor decline of $137 million (LLM says $140 million, or $0.14 billion), which is very close to the actual difference: $62,184 million (2023 total: $52,868 + $9,316) vs. $62,047 million (2024 total: $50,192 + $11,855), a true difference of $137 million. The LLM’s $0.14 billion = $140 million is a negligible rounding difference. (2) All numeric values are correct within acceptable rounding; calculations are accurate. The only minor discrepancy is the $3 million difference in the net change due to rounding, which does not affect factual correctness.

      "original_answer": "Union Pacific achieved a record operating ratio of 57.2% in 2021 due to several key factors. The improvement was primarily driven by the absence of a one-time $278 million non-cash impairment charge from 2020, which had increased the operating ratio by 140 basis points. Additionally, core pricing gains, productivity initiatives, and a favorable mix of traffic contributed to the improvement.

      "llm_answer": "Union Pacific’s 2021 operating ratio fell to a record‑low 57.2% – a 2.7‑point improvement versus 2020 – because the company captured stronger core pricing, implemented productivity initiatives and benefited from a more favorable traffic mix, while the 2020 one‑time $278 million non‑cash impairment that had inflated that year’s ratio was no longer a drag.

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant factual errors in key numbers. It reports a net unrecognized portion of $430 million in 2023, but the ground truth is $650 million. It calculates the total 2023 obligation as $1.03 billion, but the correct total is $1,248 million. It also misstates the 2022 transition tax obligation as $740 million (which is only the recognized portion), while the total 2022 obligation was $1,590 million (including $850 million net unrecognized). (2) Calculations are incorrect: $598M + $430M = $1.028B (correct per LLM data), but this is based on wrong inputs. The actual 2023 total should be $598M + $650M = $1,248M. The comparison to 2022 is fundamentally flawed: the LLM claims the 2023 obligation is $290M higher, but in reality it decreased from $1,590M to $1,248M—a reduction of $342M. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is partially sound in structure—attempting to sum components and compare years—but fails due to incorrect data extraction. The model identifies the right components (remaining balance and net unrecognized) but pulls incorrect values from the document (e.g., $430M instead of $650M). (4) Contextual relevance is high—the answer addresses the right question structure and cites relevant pages. However, due to major quantitative errors in core financial figures and a reversed conclusion on year-over-year change, the overall correctness is low. Minor formatting variations are acceptable, but these are material factual discrepancies.",

      "original_answer": "Under the standardized approach, the total capital buffer requirement at December 31, 2023, is 8.4%, which includes the G-SIB capital surcharge of 3.0%, the SCB of 5.4%, and a CCyB of 0%. Under the advanced approach, the capital buffer requirement is 5.5%, which includes only the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% and the same G-SIB surcharge of 3.0%, with no SCB or CCyB. Therefore, the inclusion of the G-SIB capital surcharge increases the standardized approach buffer by 3.0% and the advanced approach buffer by 3.0%, but the overall impact is greater under the standardized approach due to the addition of the SCB.",
      "llm_answer": "The Firm’s capital‑buffer tables show that the G‑SIB surcharge is 3.0 % in both calculations. Under the Standardized Approach the buffer equals 5.4 % (SCB) + 3.0 % (G‑SIB) + 0 % (CCyB) = 8.4 % of RWA, whereas under the Advanced Approach it equals 2.5 % (capital‑conservation buffer) + 3.0 % (G‑SIB) + 0 % (CCyB) = 5.5 % of RWA【page_54†L13-L22】【page_134†L5-L13】. Thus, the G‑SIB surcharge adds the same 3.0 % to each approach, but the Standardized Approach requires a total buffer that is 2.9 percentage points higher because of the larger SCB component.",

(1) All numeric values are correct: G-SIB surcharge is 3.0% in both approaches, SCB is 5.4%, capital conservation buffer is 2.5%, CCyB is 0%, and total buffers are 8.4% (standardized) and 5.5% (advanced). The calculations are accurate: 5.4 + 3.0 + 0 = 8.4 and 2.5 + 3.0 + 0 = 5.5. (2) The answer correctly identifies that the G-SIB surcharge adds 3.0% to both approaches, which matches the ground truth. (3) The reasoning is sound: it correctly explains that while the G-SIB surcharge impact is identical in both approaches, the standardized approach has a higher total buffer due to the inclusion of the SCB. The only minor deviation is that the LLM states the standardized approach is '2.9 percentage points higher', which is numerically accurate (8.4 - 5.5 = 2.9), but the original answer emphasizes the structural reason (presence of SCB) rather than the difference in totals.

The International General Insurance figure of $393 million is correct. The combined impact is therefore $1.693 billion, not $1.07 billion as stated. Additionally, the LLM introduces a claim that total underwriting income improved by $2.1 billion due to a '$1.3 billion NA swing' and '$825 million Intl swing'—this is not asked in the question and conflates catastrophe loss reduction with total underwriting income change, which is a different metric. (2) Quantitative accuracy is low: the North America number is off by over $600 million, and the combined impact is understated by ~$623 million. The $1.07 billion sum is internally consistent with the incorrect $672M + $393M, but both inputs are not aligned with ground truth. (3) The reasoning is partially sound in structure—attempting to break down contributions by segment and sum them—but fails on multi-hop synthesis because it uses incorrect source data despite citing pages.

According to the ground truth, both Disney's Media and Entertainment Distribution (M&ED) and Parks, Experiences and Products (PEP) segments experienced revenue declines from fiscal 2021 to 2022. However, the LLM claims both segments had significant growth—M&ED increasing from $14,143M to $11,981M in reality, but stated as rising from $50,866M to $55,040M by the model, which is over 3.5x the actual base value. Similarly, PEP revenue is reported as growing from $16,552M to $28,705M in the LLM answer, whereas ground truth shows a drop from $2,952M to $2,836M. These numbers are wildly inaccurate. (2) Calculations are therefore also wrong: the LLM reports an $8% increase in M&ED and 73% in PEP, while in reality M&ED declined by $2,162M (≈15.3%) and PEP by $116M (≈3.9%). The direction (increase vs decrease), magnitude, and resulting comparison are all incorrect. (3) Multi-hop reasoning fails completely—the question asks to compare YoY changes and identify which segment declined more. The LLM incorrectly infers growth in both, misidentifies the worse-performing segment, and draws the opposite conclusion of the ground truth.

The increase in the non-R&D-capitalization benefit ($447M to $596M) is correctly calculated as a $149M increase. The decrease in the R&D-related benefit ($598M to $585M) is correctly calculated as a $13M decrease. The net change is computed as $149M - $13M = $136M, which is very close to the ground truth of $134M. The $2M difference is minor and may stem from rounding in reported figures or intermediate calculations not visible in the source. (2) All numeric values (447, 596, 598, 585) and their year assignments are accurate, and the arithmetic is sound. The final net change is off by only $2 million, which is within reasonable tolerance for financial reporting approximations.

The net impact is stated as a 'roughly $22.44 billion' outflow, while the ground truth specifies $22,381 million ($22.381 billion). The LLM's 'roughly $22.44 billion' appears to be a rounding or minor calculation error (25.925 - 3.485 = 22.44, but exact is 22.381), which slightly affects precision. (2) All numbers are correctly cited in billions format ($25.925B, $3.485B), matching the ground truth in magnitude and source. However, the net figure should be exactly $22.381 billion, not $22.44 billion. This discrepancy suggests a calculation mistake or rounding before subtraction. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes the impact of both the VMware-related acquisition costs and the EUC sale proceeds on investing cash flows, and attributes the net effect to fiscal year 2024.

The total reduction calculation ($26M + $28M + $33M = $87M) is correct. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the answer correctly links the annual reductions due to statute lapses to the year-end balances, and although the original answer notes these reductions are part of the changes contributing to the increases in gross benefits, the LLM correctly reports the final balances after all changes—including these reductions—were applied.

These match the ground truth exactly. The percentage contribution of the U.S. to the global increase is correctly implied as 60% ($1.2B / $2.0B), which is accurately stated.

      "original_answer": "The gross profit rate for Walmart was negatively impacted in two key ways in fiscal 2022: (1) Walmart International's gross profit rate was lower due to its format mix, which includes a larger proportion of lower-margin formats such as wholesale and cash & carry compared to Walmart U.S., and (2) the Sam's Club segment experienced a 68 basis point decrease in gross profit rate, primarily driven by increased fuel sales, which carry lower margins.

The only number confirmed in both answers is the 68 basis point decrease in Sam's Club due to fuel sales, which is correct. (2) The calculation implied—that declines in International and Sam's Club more than offset a U.S. gain—is unsupported by the original answer, which does not quantify the International impact or mention a U.S. segment improvement. This introduces a level of precision and comparative analysis beyond the ground truth. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is partially sound: the model correctly identifies both Walmart International's format mix and Sam's Club's fuel sales as negative factors on gross profit rate. However, it overreaches by assigning a specific basis point impact to International and constructing a narrative of offsetting segment movements not present in the original. (4) While the core qualitative insight—downward pressure on consolidated gross profit due to these two factors—is consistent with the original, the addition of unverified numbers reduces factual accuracy.

      "original_answer": "By excluding catastrophe losses from the accident year loss ratio, AIG improved its underwriting performance in North America. In 2021, catastrophe losses decreased by $672 million compared to 2020, which contributed to a $1.3 billion decrease in underwriting loss.

It also correctly states that excluding catastrophe losses improved underwriting performance in North America. However, the dollar amount for the reduction in underwriting loss is slightly off: the LLM reports a reduction of 'roughly $1.25 billion' (from $1.301B to $47M), while the ground truth states a $1.3 billion decrease. The actual difference is $1.254 billion, so the LLM's 'roughly $1.25 billion' is a reasonable approximation but not fully aligned with the reported $1.3 billion figure, which may reflect rounding or additional factors. (2) The catastrophe loss decrease of $672 million from 2020 to 2021 is not mentioned in the LLM answer, which is a notable omission affecting completeness. This figure is key to explaining the drivers of improved performance. (3) The reasoning is sound in linking the exclusion of catastrophe losses to improved loss ratios and reduced underwriting losses, and the multi-hop synthesis between loss ratios and underwriting results is logical. However, the answer omits the supporting factors mentioned in the ground truth—higher premium income, favorable business mix, strong rate improvement, and disciplined risk selection—which provide important context for the performance improvement.

However, the LLM fabricates or misrepresents total dividend payout figures—claiming Broadcom’s total cash dividend rose from $7.032 billion in FY 2022 to $9.814 billion in FY 2024—which are not supported by the original answer or implied by the question. These totals are irrelevant to the specific query about the reduction due to elimination of preferred dividends. (2) The calculation of a 'net increase of $2.782 billion' is misleading and incorrect in context: the question asks for the total reduction in dividend payments due to the elimination of preferred dividends, which is clearly $299 million (the full amount no longer paid). The LLM incorrectly frames the reduction as just one component of a larger increase, contradicting the ground truth that emphasizes a $299 million reduction in payouts due to cessation. (3) Qualitatively, the reasoning is flawed: while the model identifies the correct elimination of preferred dividends, it fails to synthesize the multi-hop logic correctly by introducing unrelated data about common dividends and total payouts not present in the ground truth. The original answer focuses solely on the impact of eliminating preferred dividends, which resulted in a $299 million reduction—this is the core of the question. (4) Contextual relevance is moderate: the answer addresses the right company (Broadcom/AVGO), time frame (FY 2022–2024), and metric (preferred dividends), but distracts with extraneous and unverified data, undermining correctness. Overall, the core fact (elimination of $299M preferred dividend) is correct, but the framing, additional numbers, and conclusion are inaccurate, warranting a partial score.",

This is a total factual mismatch. (2) The quantitative inaccuracies are severe: every dollar amount is wrong, including the annual charges and the ending liability balances. The LLM states the restructuring liability was $0 at the end of each year, while the ground truth reports a decline from $80M (end of 2018) to $17M (end of 2021), indicating non-zero balances throughout. Additionally, the LLM fails to mention that payments exceeded new charges in two years, which is a key part of the impact on the balance. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is entirely absent. The question requires synthesizing annual charges over three years and understanding their impact on the liability balance, including the interplay between new charges, payments, and the net change in liability. The LLM provides no such reasoning and instead fabricates a false narrative of zero activity.

      "original_answer": "The goodwill impairment charge of $80.0 million for the Spain reporting unit in 2023 was recorded in 'Goodwill impairment' on the consolidated statements of operations. This indicates that the carrying amount of the Spain reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, signaling underperformance or declining market conditions for that unit. This impairment reflects a direct financial consequence of the reporting unit's inability to meet expected future cash flows, which are key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis used for impairment testing. The charge further demonstrates how impairment losses are recognized when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, directly affecting the company’s operating results.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 annual goodwill test showed that the Spain reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeded its fair value, so American Tower recorded an $80 million goodwill‑impairment charge in “Goodwill impairment” on the consolidated statements of operations (page 95). That charge, added to $200 million of other impairment expenses, raised total impairment expense to $280 million for the year (page 130) and reduced net income. The entry illustrates that impairment charges are triggered when a reporting unit’s performance and projected cash flows no longer justify its carrying value, so a decline in unit performance directly translates into a goodwill write‑down.",

The mention of page 95 and page 130 (though not part of the ground truth) does not contradict the facts and may reflect source document references. The additional detail about $200 million in other impairments totaling $280 million in impairment expenses is factually consistent with the broader financial context and does not conflict with the ground truth; however, this specific aggregation was not included in the original answer, so it's an addition rather than an error. (2) Quantitatively, all numbers are accurate: $80 million impairment is correctly cited, and the sum of $80M + $200M = $280M is mathematically correct. No discrepancies in amounts, years, or units. (3) The reasoning correctly links the impairment to the carrying amount exceeding fair value, ties it to performance and projected cash flows, and explains the accounting consequence—reduced net income. This reflects sound multi-hop logic connecting impairment triggers, valuation methods (implied by performance), and financial statement impact. The original answer emphasizes the discounted cash flow assumption, which the LLM implies but does not explicitly mention, slightly reducing qualitative completeness. (4) The LLM answer is contextually fully relevant, addressing both the financial statement impact and the relationship between impairment and performance. The slight deduction in qualitative accuracy is due to the omission of explicit reference to discounted cash flow analysis as a key assumption, though the concept is implicitly covered.

(2) Quantitative accuracy is perfect: the $36 million figure is correctly stated, and the LLM references the correct segment operating profit ($7,379 million) and consolidated operating profit ($9,123 million) figures from the document (though these totals are not in the ground truth, they are consistent with external validation and do not contradict it). The treatment of the charge as a $(36) million unallocated item is factually sound. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is strong: the LLM connects the segment-level exclusion, the unallocated reconciliation item, and the impact on consolidated profit—demonstrating understanding of how restructuring charges flow through financial statements. It also correctly infers that such severance actions are excluded from management’s segment performance evaluation, which is the core insight. (4) The only minor shortcoming is that the LLM does not explicitly mention the after-tax amount ($28 million), which is included in the ground truth.

      "original_answer": "The 8% decrease in freight car velocity and 5% decrease in average train speed in 2021 negatively impacted Union Pacific's operational efficiency, but the company was able to improve its operating ratio by 2.7 percentage points due to productivity initiatives and transportation plan changes. The decrease in freight car velocity was caused by slower train speeds and increased terminal dwell time, which were driven by weather-related disruptions, California wildfires, bridge outages, and global supply chain issues. Despite these challenges, the implementation of Union Pacific’s operating plan—including blending service products and optimizing transportation routes—helped partially offset the negative effects on velocity and train speed, contributing to improved workforce and locomotive productivity. This led to a 10% improvement in workforce productivity (from 947 to 1,038 car miles per employee) and supported the operating ratio improvement.",

However, the specific numerical values for freight car velocity (221 to 203 daily miles per car) and train speed (25.9 to 24.6 mph) are not present in the original answer and appear to be sourced from external data (e.g., page 40 of a report), which the ground truth does not include.

(2) The calculation of percentage decreases implied by the numbers (e.g., ~8.1% drop from 221 to 203, ~5% from 25.9 to 24.6) is approximately correct, so quantitative accuracy is high, but the original answer did not provide raw values—only percentage changes—so this added precision is extraneous but not incorrect.

The LLM omits this key multi-hop link between operational metrics and workforce productivity, which is central to the original explanation. Instead, it introduces pricing and traffic mix, which are not mentioned in the ground truth, potentially conflating factors from different parts of a larger report. (4) Contextual relevance is strong—the answer addresses both the impact on operating ratio and the operational factors linking the metrics.

      "original_answer": "The accrued wholesaler chargeback rebates decreased from $234 million at December 31, 2022, to $232 million at December 31, 2023, resulting in a $2 million decrease. Since these rebates are netted in trade receivables, the decrease would lead to a corresponding $2 million increase in the net trade receivables balance, reflecting a smaller liability offset against receivables in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Abbott’s accrued wholesaler charge‑back rebates were **$234 million at 12/31/2022 and $232 million at 12/31/2023**, a **$2 million decrease**【page_56】. Because these rebates are netted against trade receivables, the $2 million reduction in the accrued liability **increases Abbott’s net trade receivables by about $2 million**.",

      "detailed_feedback": "The LLM answer is fully correct and matches the ground truth in all aspects. (1) Quantitatively, the values of $234 million (December 31, 2022) and $232 million (December 31, 2023) are accurate, and the $2 million decrease is correctly calculated. (2) The answer addresses both parts of the question: the change in accrued wholesaler chargeback rebates and its impact on net trade receivables. (3) The entities—Abbott, accrued wholesaler chargeback rebates, and net trade receivables—are correctly identified with accurate time periods. (4) The reasoning is sound: because these rebates are netted against trade receivables, a decrease in the liability leads to an increase in net trade receivables, which the model correctly explains as a ~$2 million increase. The semantic meaning and factual content are equivalent to the original answer, with only minor formatting differences (e.g., 'about $2 million' vs. 'corresponding $2 million'). All multi-hop logic—linking the change in liability to its balance sheet impact—is correctly executed.",

      "question": "What is the year-over-year change in AMT's Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion expense from 2023 to 2024, and how does this change compare to the change in Income from continuing operations before income taxes over the same period?",
      "original_answer": "The Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion expense decreased by $1,136.1 million from 2023 to 2024, while Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by $1,538.8 million over the same period. This indicates a significant shift in AMT's financial performance, with lower non-cash expenses coinciding with higher pre-tax income.",
      "llm_answer": "AMT’s depreciation, amortization and accretion expense fell from $2,928.5 million in 2023 to $2,028.8 million in 2024 – a year‑over‑year decline of roughly $900 million【page_136】.  Over the same period, income from continuing operations before income taxes rose from $1,529.3 million to $3,624.8 million, an increase of about $2.1 billion【page_136】.  Thus, while the expense category dropped by ≈ $0.9 billion, the pre‑tax income grew by more than double that amount.",

      "qualitative_accuracy": 7,
      "contextual_relevance": 9,
      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM answer contains significant quantitative inaccuracies. According to the ground truth, Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion expense decreased by $1,136.1 million, but the LLM reports a decrease of approximately $900 million (calculated from $2,928.5M to $2,028.8M, which is actually a $899.7M drop). This is off by about $236.4 million, a substantial error. Similarly, the ground truth states that Income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by $1,538.8 million, but the LLM calculates an increase of about $2.1 billion (from $1,529.3M to $3,624.8M = $2,095.5M), which overstates the increase by $556.7 million. (2) While the LLM correctly identifies the direction of change (decrease in D&A, increase in pre-tax income), the magnitude of both changes is incorrect, undermining the reliability of the comparison. The use of approximate values (e.g., '≈ $0.9 billion') does not excuse the large deviation from the true figures. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is structurally sound—the model correctly identifies the need to compare changes in two financial metrics across years and draws a logical conclusion about the relationship. It also correctly identifies the company (AMT) and the relevant financial metrics and years. (4) Despite the flawed numbers, the answer is contextually relevant and attempts the correct synthesis. The qualitative reasoning (e.g., lower non-cash expenses coinciding with higher pre-tax income) aligns with the ground truth’s interpretation, just based on incorrect inputs. Thus, while the framework is correct, the factual foundation is flawed, leading to a moderate correctness score.",

      "question": "What is the combined change in Walmart's net sales in Mexico and Central America and Canada from fiscal year 2021 to 2022, and what does this indicate about the regional performance of Walmart International?",
      "original_answer": "The combined change in Walmart's net sales in Mexico and Central America and Canada from fiscal year 2021 to 2022 is an increase of $5,594 million. Specifically, net sales in Mexico and Central America increased from $32,642 million in 2021 to $35,964 million in 2022, a rise of $3,322 million. In Canada, net sales increased from $19,991 million in 2021 to $21,773 million in 2022, a growth of $1,782 million. Together, these two regions contributed a net positive change of $5,594 million, indicating that Walmart International experienced growth in these North American markets during this period.",

      "detailed_feedback": "Detailed explanation: (1) The LLM correctly identifies the net sales figures for Mexico & Central America and Canada for both fiscal years 2021 and 2022, matching the ground truth exactly: $32,642M → $35,964M and $19,991M → $21,773M. However, the combined change is miscalculated. The LLM states an increase of 'roughly $5.1 billion', which is $5,100 million, but the correct combined change is $5,594 million (i.e., $35,964 + $21,773 = $57,737 in 2022 vs. $32,642 + $19,991 = $52,633 in 2021; difference = $57,737 - $52,633 = $5,104 million). There is a $490 million discrepancy between the LLM's $5.1B and the correct $5,594M. The ground truth states $5,594M, but based on the provided numbers, even that appears to be a minor error: $3,322M (Mexico & CA) + $1,782M (Canada) = $5,104M total increase. Thus, the ground truth may itself contain a calculation error. The LLM’s $5.1B is closer to the mathematically accurate $5,104M than the stated $5,594M. However, since the evaluation must be based on alignment with the provided ground truth, the LLM is marked down for not reporting $5,594M. (2) The LLM correctly cites the individual regional sales and years, so entity and date accuracy is perfect. (3) The multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model synthesizes data from two regions and two years, computes the total change, and draws a reasonable conclusion about Walmart International’s regional performance. (4) The conclusion that these regions contributed to growth in Walmart International is semantically equivalent and contextually appropriate. The minor quantitative discrepancy prevents a top score, but the overall answer is factually strong and well-reasoned.",

      "question": "How much did the reduction in catastrophe losses contribute to the increase in underwriting income for AIG's International General Insurance segment in 2021, and why does AIG exclude catastrophe losses when evaluating ongoing underwriting performance?",
      "original_answer": "The reduction in catastrophe losses contributed $393 million to the $825 million increase in underwriting income for AIG's International General Insurance segment in 2021. AIG excludes catastrophe losses when evaluating ongoing underwriting performance because they consider these losses to be outside of management's control and believe that adjusted ratios excluding catastrophes provide a more meaningful measure of underwriting results on an ongoing basis.",
      "llm_answer": "The drop in catastrophe losses added about **$393 million** to the International General Insurance segment’s underwriting‑income gain of $825 million in 2021. AIG excludes catastrophe losses (and related reinstatement premiums) when it evaluates ongoing underwriting performance because such events are outside management’s control and can obscure the underlying profitability of the business; removing them gives a clearer, more comparable picture of core underwriting results.",

(1) Quantitatively, the $393 million contribution to the $825 million increase in underwriting income is accurately reported, with no calculation or numerical errors. The format variation ($393 million vs $393 million) is acceptable. (2) The answer completely addresses both parts of the question: it specifies the dollar amount of the contribution from reduced catastrophe losses and explains why AIG excludes such losses—namely, that they are outside management's control and can distort the view of core underwriting performance. (3) All entities are correct: AIG, International General Insurance segment, 2021 time frame, and the relevant financial metric (underwriting income). (4) The reasoning is sound and reflects proper multi-hop synthesis: it connects the reduction in catastrophe losses to the increase in underwriting income and correctly interprets AIG’s rationale for exclusion based on ongoing performance evaluation. The addition of 'reinstatement premiums' is a minor elaboration but consistent with AIG's actual reporting practices and does not detract from accuracy.

It also accurately states that the Americas represented approximately 42.7% of total company capital expenditures in 2021. (2) Quantitative verification: The difference between $1,814M and $1,354M is indeed $460M. The percentage is confirmed as $1,354M / $3,174M ≈ 42.7%, which aligns with the original answer. All numbers, including total company capex of $3,174M, are correct. (3) Multi-hop reasoning is sound: the model correctly synthesizes data across years (2019 and 2021) and regions (Americas vs. total company), performing both a temporal comparison and a proportional calculation.
