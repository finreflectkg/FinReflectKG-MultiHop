In fiscal 2023, Sales to Wholesale Customers were $3,736 million, accounting for about 58% of total revenues ($6,431 million). This decline from 67% to 58% indicates a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on wholesale distribution in favor of direct-to-consumer channels.",

This modest growth reflects a shift toward a more direct‑to‑consumer model, as wholesale revenues grew at a slower pace than the overall revenue base, indicating Nike is reducing its reliance on third‑party wholesale partners and expanding its own sales channels.",

By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Current had decreased further to $254 million, despite additions and foreign currency adjustments, primarily driven by significant write-offs. This indicates a consistent reduction in the company's estimated credit risk exposure over the two-year period.",

This upward trend indicates that IBM anticipates growing credit risk exposure in its customer receivables, likely due to broader economic uncertainties or deteriorating payment patterns in specific customer segments, necessitating a more conservative approach to estimating uncollectible accounts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil excluded items with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter from its Earnings (Loss) excluding Identified Items metric. By 2024, the company introduced a slight modification by stating that the threshold is 'typically' $250 million, suggesting a more flexible approach. This change indicates that the company may be allowing for more judgment in determining which items are excluded, potentially affecting the consistency and comparability of its non-GAAP earnings metric over time.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's threshold for identifying items excluded from earnings—defined as items with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter—has remained unchanged from 2022 through 2024. This consistent $250 million threshold suggests the company maintains a stable approach to earnings transparency, using the same materiality benchmark to isolate and remove significant non‑operational events across periods.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 55 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the lapping of elevated markdowns from the prior year, although partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories. This represents a significant turnaround in the trend of the gross profit rate between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "The gross profit rate increased 40 basis points in fiscal 2025 and 27 basis points in fiscal 2024, marking a positive trend from fiscal 2023. This improvement was primarily driven by Walmart U.S. managing prices aligned with competitive historic gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by shifts into lower-margin categories and lapping prior-year markdowns.",

In contrast, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This evolution indicates a significant recovery in gross margin performance from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, driven primarily by managing prices to align with historic competitive gaps, lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, and a favorable shift in product mix toward higher‑margin categories. The prior fiscal 2023 decline of 85 basis points had been caused by net markdowns, lower‑margin merchandise mix and rising supply‑chain costs, partially offset by price‑management actions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Total Non-Marketable Securities were composed of $1,008 million under the Measurement Alternative and $215 million under the Equity Method, summing to $1,223 million. In 2024, the Measurement Alternative increased to $1,140 million and the Equity Method rose slightly to $230 million, bringing the total to $1,370 million. This indicates both components contributed to the overall increase in Total Non-Marketable Securities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the Company's Nonmarketable securities increased from $1,223 million to $1,370 million. This growth was driven by a rise in the Measurement Alternative component from $1,008 million to $1,140 million and an increase in the Equity Method component from $215 million to $230 million. The changes reflect additional purchases, adjustments, and valuation changes in these non‑marketable equity investments.",

By 2024, the company moved toward a more quantitative presentation, showing that Nareit FFO increased from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, a 14% increase. Additionally, the 2024 filing included Nareit FFO within a broader comparative table that tracked changes across three years (2022–2024), indicating a shift toward emphasizing trend analysis and performance metrics over definitional explanations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by 14% (from $4.61 billion to $5.23 billion), reflecting higher operating profit, lower capital improvement expenditures, and gains from discontinued operations, while being partially offset by distributions to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for foreign currency impacts. This growth aligns with the reconciliation details showing a rise in Consolidated AFFO to $4.934 billion in 2024, underscoring the relationship between Nareit FFO and other profitability metrics such as Adjusted EBITDA and AFFO.",

      "question": "How did the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth was 1.0%, while in 2024, this impact increased to 1.5%. This indicates that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations grew in 2024 compared to the previous year, contributing more positively to sales growth despite a decline in core sales during that period.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a negative drag in 2023 (decreasing reported sales by 1.0% YoY) to a smaller negative impact in 2024 (decreasing reported sales by 0.5% YoY), indicating reduced exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. This suggests Danaher's currency hedging or operational adjustments are mitigating FX volatility, though currency still slightly suppresses reported growth.",

      "llm_answer": "SG&A as a percentage of sales rose from 27.6 % in 2023 to 29.4 % in 2024, an increase of 1.8 percentage points. This rise was driven primarily by the acquisition of the Test & Measurement business, which added SG&A costs, while the company benefited from operating leverage on higher overall sales.",

By 2024, this figure increased significantly to $1,434 million, reflecting a rise in intangibles amortization to $560 million due to the Test & Measurement acquisition, a $156 million increase in restructuring costs, and a $48 million divestiture loss. This indicates a transformation in the nature and scale of deductions, shifting from foreign exchange and amortization effects to acquisition/divestiture-related charges and restructuring.",

The primary drivers of this change were higher intangibles amortization related to the Test & Measurement acquisition ($560 million), increased restructuring costs ($156 million), and additional acquisition/divestiture expenses ($27 million), partially offset by other items.

This indicates that Intelligent Cloud is expanding its contribution to Microsoft’s overall revenue base at a healthy pace.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GE's Corporate operating profit was negatively impacted by a $12.5 billion decrease in gains on purchases and sales of business interests, primarily due to the absence of a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of the BioPharma business in 2020. By 2023, this metric improved significantly, with Corporate operating profit increasing by $6.7 billion, of which $5.7 billion was attributed to higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, particularly from AerCap and GE HealthCare investments, although partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year gains on the Baker Hughes investment. This represents a transformation in both the magnitude and composition of these gains, indicating a strategic shift in asset management and investment realization.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the magnitude of GE’s gains on purchases and sales of business interests shifted dramatically: in 2022, the company recorded a modest $45 million gain, whereas in 2023 it realized a substantial $5.78 billion gain from retained and sold ownership interests, primarily driven by higher‑value stakes in AerCap and GE Healthcare, while gains on other equity securities and on purchases/sales of business interests themselves were relatively minor (a $9 million loss in 2023 versus a $45 million gain in 2022). Consequently, the source of these gains evolved from a small, isolated equity‑related gain in 2022 to a large, multifaceted gain in 2023 that stemmed chiefly from the disposal of strategic investments and the re‑valuation of retained interests, rather than from routine operating performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, streaming revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, despite a 7% overall revenue increase driven by membership growth. By 2024, NFLX had implemented more structured hedging strategies, including cash flow hedges for foreign currency-denominated revenue, which resulted in a $124 million gain included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year. This indicates a shift from passive exposure to active management of foreign exchange risk, reducing volatility in reported revenues.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Netflix's exposure to foreign exchange risk on streaming revenues increased as the company expanded its international footprint, with streaming revenue growing from $33.64 billion in 2023 to $33.64 billion in 2024 (reflecting regional growth). The 2024 10‑K notes that hedging gains of $124 million were included in streaming revenues, meaning the hedging program reduced foreign‑exchange volatility and positively impacted reported revenue in 2024.",

By 2024, this number increased to 36,906,603 securities, and the weighted-average exercise price rose to $144.81. This indicates both an increase in the volume of equity instruments outstanding and a higher average cost to exercise these instruments over time.",

During this period, the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights **increased** from **$135.35** (2022) to **$144.81** (2024), indicating a rising trend in the average cost to exercise these instruments.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Tower evaluated tenant-related intangible assets for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or cancellation of relationships, with recoverability assessed through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, the company continued this tenant-level impairment review but expanded the criteria to include the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations as a key impairment indicator. Additionally, in 2023, the company introduced a more detailed framework for measuring impairment, incorporating available market information relative to asset fair value alongside projected discounted future cash flows, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This represents a refinement in methodology and a more structured approach to impairment assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the evaluation and treatment of tenant-related intangible assets remained anchored in the Company's impairment framework, which assesses recoverability based on projected undiscounted future cash flows from the related tenant contracts. While the core methodology did not change, the Company refined its assumptions regarding tenant cash flow projections, particularly in high-risk markets like India, where a significant reduction in tenant-related cash flows could impact both tenant-related intangibles and broader tower/location intangibles. This refinement was partly driven by the Supreme Court of India's AGR ruling and subsequent relief measures, which introduced uncertainty around tenant financial viability. The Company continues to evaluate impairment indicators such as tenant turnover, attrition, and contract renewals, and records impairment losses when carrying amounts exceed recoverable amounts based on discounted cash flows. No material change in the impairment assessment approach itself occurred between 2022 and 2023, but the underlying cash flow assumptions were updated to reflect evolving market conditions, especially in India.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the growth rate of Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis was 9.0% compared to the prior year. In 2023, this growth rate increased to 19.0% compared to 2022. This indicates a significant acceleration in Mondelēz International's underlying earnings performance, suggesting stronger profitability and operational efficiency improvements in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of Adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis accelerated from 9.0% in 2021 to 19.0% in 2023, indicating that Mondelēz International's underlying earnings performance improved significantly over this period, driven by favorable pricing, volume/mix growth, and cost management that outpaced input cost pressures. This acceleration reflects stronger underlying profitability in 2023 compared to 2021, with Adjusted EPS rising from $2.79 (2021) to $3.32 (constant currency basis in 2023).",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed nonmarketable investments totaling $5 million, grouped under the 'Other measurement basis' category alongside equity-method investments, with no change in value from the prior year. By 2024, while the specific dollar amount for nonmarketable investments was not quantitatively disclosed, the company expanded its qualitative disclosure, describing these investments as including interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities, and clarified that they are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more detailed discussion of counterparty risk concentration, which indirectly impacts the risk exposure of these nonmarketable investments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, TXN’s nonmarketable investments remained classified as Level 3 (unobservable inputs) and were measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, rather than at fair value. The company continued to disclose these investments separately from its Level 1 and Level 2 fair‑value hierarchy, noting no Level 3 assets or liabilities for the debt and equity securities that are measured at fair value. Consequently, the measurement basis and risk exposure of its nonmarketable holdings did not change materially—still recorded at cost with only limited market‑based adjustments and subject to credit‑loss risk.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Visa did not disclose any specific charge related to Lease Consolidation Costs. However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Visa's treatment of lease consolidation costs evolved from a non‑GAAP exclusion in fiscal 2023 to an explicit GAAP‑adjusted line item in fiscal 2024, where $57 million of lease‑consolidation costs were subtracted from operating expenses (and $13 million of related tax effects were added) in the reconciliation tables. This shift indicates a more transparent, GAAP‑aligned reporting approach that brings previously excluded restructuring expenses into the formal financial statements, reflecting a tighter integration of lease‑related costs into the company’s disclosed expense structure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company's floating-rate debt principal was $5.7 billion, representing approximately 16% of the senior notes portfolio, with a potential annual interest expense increase of $57 million from a one percentage point rise in rates. By 2023, the floating-rate debt principal had decreased to $5.4 billion, or about 13% of the senior notes portfolio, with a corresponding potential annual interest expense increase of $54 million. This reflects a reduction in both the absolute level of floating-rate debt and the sensitivity of interest expense to rate changes.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2022 filing (page 39) the company reported floating‑rate debt of $5.7 billion, and a one‑percentage‑point rise in that rate would add roughly $57 million to annual interest expense. In the 2023 filing (page 38) floating‑rate debt had fallen to $5.4 billion, and the same 1 % increase would now raise annual interest expense by about $54 million. Thus, the principal amount of floating‑rate debt declined slightly from 2022 to 2023, and a 1 % rate increase would increase annual interest expense by approximately $57 million in 2022 and $54 million in 2023.",

By 2024, BMY had a more detailed and cautionary approach, emphasizing the vulnerability of IPRD to impairment and the need for annual reviews. The 2024 filing noted that impairment charges for IPRD and other intangible assets totaled $2.9 billion for that year, a significant increase from $101 million in 2022. This reflects a shift from primarily recognizing IPRD value in the year of acquisition to actively monitoring and adjusting it based on evolving expectations of future cash flows, regulatory timelines, and market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, BMY’s treatment and valuation of IPRD evolved through more rigorous impairment reviews and updated fair value assumptions. In 2024, impairment charges for intangible assets (including IPRD) totaled $2.9 billion, reflecting heightened scrutiny of newly acquired assets and revised cash‑flow forecasts. The company continues to use discounted cash‑flow models with assumptions about revenue, market share, probability of success, discount rates and tax rates to value IPRD, and any decline in these expectations can trigger further impairment.",

This indicates an improvement in the company's debt management relative to its net worth, as the ratio moved further below the maximum allowable ratio of 10 to 1 specified in the Credit Facility.",
      "llm_answer": "The year-end covenant leverage ratio for Cat Financial improved from 6.95 to 1 at the end of 2022 to 6.88 to 1 at the end of 2023, a modest reduction that still remains well below the 10 to 1 maximum allowed by the credit facility. This indicates that, relative to its net worth, Cat Financial’s debt burden is stable and comfortably within covenant limits, suggesting effective debt management and adequate financial cushions.",

      "llm_answer": "The restricted stock units settled in stock increased from 900 million in 2023 to 1,193 million in 2024, reflecting a higher issuance of RSUs and a modest rise in the weighted‑average grant‑date fair value (from $103.16 to $118.57 per share). This growth indicates that ExxonMobil is expanding its equity‑based compensation program, emphasizing long‑term incentive awards to retain talent and align employee interests with the company’s strategic objectives.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and specifically noted that interest revenue from financing arrangements was recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle continued to include unbilled receivables in accounts receivable and maintained similar revenue recognition timing under ASC 606. However, the 2024 disclosure reclassified interest revenue from financing contracts to 'non-operating expenses, net'—a more specific categorization than in 2022. This indicates a refinement in financial reporting terminology and structure, though the core treatment of unbilled receivables remained consistent.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle now includes unbilled receivables in its accounts‑receivable balance and recognizes revenue when control of the promised goods or services transfers, recording deferred revenue when cash is collected before the performance obligation is satisfied. This practice—recognizing revenue before invoicing and deferring revenue until the related performance obligation is fulfilled—has been consistently applied in both the 2022 and 2024 Form 10‑K filings.",

This $83 million increase indicates that AIG's initial estimate of paid losses for accident year 2021 was lower than the actual paid losses observed a year later, suggesting that the company may have initially underestimated the severity of claims for that year.",
      "llm_answer": "The cumulative paid losses for accident year 2021 rose from $2.339 billion in the 2022 10‑K to $2.528 billion in the 2023 10‑K, reflecting an increase of about $189 million. This upward movement suggests that the company’s loss reserving for that accident year was initially understated and has been revised upward as more data emerged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel's CCG revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven by strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, despite lower notebook ASPs due to a stronger consumer and education market segment. However, in 2023, CCG revenue decreased by 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer inventory levels normalized. The decline reflects a significant shift in market conditions and demand dynamics over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue declined 8% from 2022 to 2023, falling to $31.9 billion (from $34.7 billion in 2022), driven by lower notebook and desktop volumes amid reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by higher desktop ASPs from increased commercial and gaming sales. This decline occurred against a backdrop of broader company revenue contraction ($54.2B in 2023 vs. $63.0B in 2022), with CCG's performance reflecting industrywide supply constraints and inventory normalization, while the company simultaneously invested heavily in IDM 2.0 manufacturing expansion and AI-focused product development to drive long-term growth.",

By 2024, these impacts had increased significantly, with a 25 basis point increase in URR leading to a $197 million increase in liability and a 1 basis point increase in WAC leading to a $220 million increase. This indicates a notable rise in the sensitivity of the liability to changes in these assumptions over the two-year period.",

      "original_answer": "Accenture's revenue from the Health & Public Service segment increased from $11.2B in fiscal 2022 to $13.8B in fiscal 2024. In 2022, Public Service accounted for 34% of the group's revenue, while in 2024, it represented 31%. Additionally, the description of public service engagements expanded in 2024 to include transportation agencies, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This indicates a slight relative decline in the importance of Public Service within the segment despite overall revenue growth, alongside a broadening of the scope of public service engagements.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, Accenture's Health & Public Service segment grew from $11.2 billion (34% of total revenue) to $13.8 billion (31% of total revenue), reflecting both absolute revenue expansion and a modest shift in its revenue mix. The public‑service component—encompassing defense, military, public safety, justice, human/social services, education, non‑profits, municipalities, transportation, postal/customs/tax agencies—represented roughly 18% of the segment’s FY24 revenue, up from about 13% of North America revenue in FY22, indicating a growing emphasis on government and defense contracts. This evolution underscores a strategic pivot toward deeper public‑sector engagements, especially within U.S. federal services, while maintaining a stable but slightly reduced share of overall segment revenue.",

By 2024, the company disclosed that the final consideration for the Surmont acquisition was higher, at $3.0 billion USD (CAD $4.1 billion) after adjustments, though the contingent payment structure was not reiterated in the 2024 disclosure. This indicates a slight increase in the total acquisition cost with less clarity on the contingent payment in the following year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, ConocoPhillips' financial commitment and disclosure around the Surmont asset evolved as follows: In October 2023, the company completed its acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for a final all-cash consideration of $3.0 billion CAD ($2.955 billion USD), which included $2.635 billion in cash paid and $320 million of contingent consideration. The contingent payment structure required additional payments of up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion USD) over five years, tied to WCS crude oil prices exceeding $52 per barrel, with $158 million USD paid in 2024 under this arrangement. By the end of 2024, the company had fully integrated the asset, finalized purchase price allocation, and reported $677 million in total revenues and $66 million net income from the acquired assets, while continuing to disclose the contingent payment obligations in its financial statements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, measured at cost with no changes mentioned during the year. The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Texas Instruments' nonmarketable investments (including equity-method investments and nonmarketable securities) were measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, rather than at fair value. The 2024 10-K shows these investments totaled $5 million (down from $5 million in 2023 and $5 million in 2022), with no Level 3 inputs used for valuation. In contrast, the company's debt and equity investments are carried at fair value through Level 1 or Level 2 inputs, with unrealized gains/losses recorded in AOCI. Thus, the valuation methodology for nonmarketable investments remained cost-based with limited market‑based adjustments, while risk exposure is primarily credit risk from counterparties and issuers, managed through investment‑grade holdings and allowances.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil presented Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) without specifying its classification relative to GAAP standards. However, in 2024, the company explicitly labeled ROCE as a Non-GAAP measure in its disclosures. Additionally, the formatting of the term changed, with 'ExxonMobil' being inconsistently rendered in the 2024 document as 'Ex x onMobil' in certain sections, indicating a change in how the metric is internally standardized and presented.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's presentation of Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) as a measure of capital productivity has remained consistent in definition and calculation from 2022 to 2024, but its classification and formatting evolved from a GAAP metric in 2022 to a non-GAAP measure explicitly labeled \"Return on Average Capital Employed (Non-GAAP)\" in 2024. In 2022, ROCE was presented within a table of key financial measures without explicit non-GAAP labeling, while by 2024, it was formally defined in a dedicated subsection under \"FREQUENTLY USED TERMS\" with a clear non-GAAP designation, reflecting a structural refinement in disclosure formatting rather than a change in methodology. The 2024 calculation (12.7%) also shows a notable increase from prior years (24.9% in 2022), driven by improved earnings and capital efficiency, but the core methodology—net income excluding financing costs divided by average capital employed—has been consistently applied across all three years.",

The 2023 10‑K (page 108) updates these estimates for the 2024‑2028 horizon, showing NEER’s projected capital spending of $9,835 million in 2024, $4,420 million in 2025, $1,570 million in 2026, $1,465 million in 2027 and $1,010 million in 2028.

By 2024, this figure had increased to $132 million, indicating a significant growth in the segment's asset base or long-term investments. This doubling of depreciation and amortization suggests that the Pet Nutrition segment became more financially significant to CL over this period.",

This reflects a substantial rise in the segment's capital investment and asset base, underscoring its growing financial significance to Colgate‑Palmolive over the 2022‑2024 period.",

However, the 2024 filing (page 25) references \"Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and \"Note 11 – Income Taxes\" as locations for inventory loss information, but these specific notes are not included in the excerpted pages. The 2022 filing (pages 28–32) contains governance and compensation disclosures but no inventory allowance data. Consequently, the evolution of the allowance and year-end balances cannot be determined from the given excerpts. To answer the question accurately, the specific inventory allowance schedules (e.g., in Note 1 or Note 11) from the full 2022 and 2024 filings would be required, which are not provided here.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG not only capitalized interest during construction but also explicitly detailed that the amount of interest capitalized during the year was based on interest rates in place during the construction period. This indicated a clear policy with a specific reference to how the interest was calculated. In 2023, while SPG maintained the same general policy of capitalizing interest during construction, the level of detail was reduced, as the company no longer explicitly referenced the use of interest rates in effect during the construction period when determining the amount to capitalize. This suggests a subtle shift toward less granular disclosure, even though the core capitalization policy remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, SPG maintained a consistent accounting policy for capitalizing interest during construction—interest is capitalized on projects until they are ready for their intended use, based on interest rates in place during the construction period, with the amount capitalized reported annually. However, the level of detail in disclosures decreased slightly: the 2022 filing (page 103) explicitly listed \"interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction\" as capitalized components and described the capitalization of improvements that extend useful life, whereas the 2023 filing (page 98) retained the same criteria but omitted the explicit mention of real estate taxes and slightly rephrased the description, resulting in marginally less detail. Policy consistency regarding the capitalization of interest and improvements remained unchanged, but the 2023 disclosure provided fewer specific examples and less granular breakdown of what costs are included.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde estimated that revenue from minimum purchase requirements was approximately $57 billion, with half expected to be earned within the next five years. By 2024, this estimate increased slightly to $58 billion, but the time horizon for earning half of this amount was extended from five to six years. This indicates a slight shift in the expected timing of revenue recognition, potentially due to changes in contract duration or new contract signings.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Linde’s estimate of revenue from minimum purchase requirements under long‑term on‑site contracts increased from roughly $57 billion to about $58 billion. The time horizon for earning that revenue also shifted: in the 2022 filing the company said about half of the revenue would be earned in the next five years, whereas in the 2024 filing it now expects roughly half to be earned in the next six years, with the remainder thereafter.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil explicitly stated that it did not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment, emphasizing that long-term prices must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. By 2024, the company's language shifted, placing greater emphasis on the dependency of future cash flows on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, signaling a more pronounced sensitivity to these metrics in impairment assessments. While both years reference industry margins, the 2024 filing reflects a stronger linkage between impairment indicators and sustained changes in margins, rather than just temporary volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to incorporating industry margins into impairment assessments has evolved to explicitly include long-term margin assumptions as a core component of its cash flow projections for asset recoverability testing. While both 2022 and 2024 disclosures emphasize that temporary price/margin fluctuations are not indicators of impairment, the 2024 framework (page 87) more directly ties margin assumptions to strategic planning, stating that \"significant reductions in the Corporation's view of... industry margins... can be an indicator of potential impairment\" and that cash flow estimates incorporate \"refining and chemical margins\" alongside commodity prices. This reflects a maturation of their methodology, moving beyond generic references to \"industry margins\" (page 94) to explicitly anchoring impairment triggers to their forward-looking margin assumptions within the Corporate Plan's long-term price framework. The 2022 disclosures (pages 92-93) established the foundational criteria for impairment indicators, but the 2024 language demonstrates a more integrated application of margin assumptions in forecasting future cash flows for impairment testing.",

      "question": "How has Linde's use of total requirement contracts in its on-site industrial gas distribution evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of contract structure and duration?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde described its on-site product supply contracts as generally being total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10–20 years, containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. By 2024, the company maintained the same description of these contracts, including the 10–20 year term range, minimum purchase requirements, and price escalation provisions, indicating no structural changes to the contract framework. This suggests that Linde preserved its long-term, committed contract model for on-site supply without modification across the two reporting years.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Linde's use of total requirement contracts in on-site industrial gas distribution remained structurally consistent but showed increased scale and geographic focus. Contracts continued to feature long-term durations (up to 20 years) with minimum purchase requirements, though the proportion of revenue from these minimums is estimated to shift toward near-term recognition (approximately half expected in the next five years versus next six per 2023 filing). The 2024 data reveals expanded on-site revenue ($7,656M vs $7,825M in 2023, though down from $8,934M in 2022), with contract liabilities declining to $2,292M (from $2,950M in 2023), reflecting shorter recognition periods for engineering-related obligations. Notably, the 2024 filing specifies \"approximately half of revenue related to minimum purchase requirements will be earned in the next six years\" – a slight extension from the prior \"next five years\" timeframe, indicating marginally longer expected revenue realization periods for these contractual minimums.

This doubling of depreciation and amortization expense indicates a significant increase in capital investment or asset acquisition within the Pet Nutrition segment over this period, suggesting stronger focus or expansion in this business area.",
      "llm_answer": "The depreciation and amortization expense for the Pet Nutrition segment increased from $65 million in 2022 to $101 million in 2023 and further to $132 million in 2024, reflecting a substantial rise in the company’s investment in or utilization of long‑lived assets within this segment. This upward trend indicates growing capital spending—likely on production facilities, equipment, or intangible assets—to support the segment’s expansion and improve asset productivity.",

By 2024, this balance decreased to $19 million, with ($7) million in deductions and ($1) million in foreign currency adjustments. This indicates a consistent reduction in the noncurrent allowance, suggesting either improved credit quality of receivables or a strategic reduction in exposure to credit risk over time.",

The document contains standard governance, compensation, and financial statement schedule information but does not include the specific credit loss allowance figures or trend analysis required to answer the question.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG explicitly included leasing prospects as a key component of their impairment evaluation and purchase accounting assumptions, using them alongside forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capitalization rates. By 2023, while leasing prospects were still referenced, SPG placed increased emphasis on changes in economic and operating conditions, tenant financial health, and the intent and ability to hold assets when assessing the recoverability of investments. This reflects a more dynamic and condition-sensitive approach to leasing prospects in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, SPG’s assumptions regarding leasing prospects and other key inputs used in evaluating investment properties for impairment and purchase accounting remained consistent with prior periods, but were subject to heightened scrutiny due to evolving economic conditions. The company continued to rely on observable market data, historical performance, and sensitivity analyses to assess assumptions such as forecasted cash flows, capitalization rates, and leasing prospects, particularly in the context of its investments in unconsolidated entities like TRG and Klépierre. These assumptions were evaluated for impairment testing and allocation of purchase price, with management’s estimates being validated through external market comparisons and third-party valuation specialists. The core methodology for assessing undiscounted cash flows and fair value inputs did not undergo a fundamental change, but the emphasis on current economic trends and the impact of macroeconomic factors on leasing prospects and operational performance increased.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, streaming revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which acted as a drag on overall growth. However, in 2024, Netflix introduced a more detailed financial hedging strategy involving forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions. This strategy included the use of cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, and net investment hedges, with specific recognition of $124 million in hedging gains included in streaming revenues, indicating a proactive approach to mitigating currency risk.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on streaming revenues shifted from a headwind in 2023 to a tailwind in 2024, as the 2024 revenue figure of $33.64 billion reflects a $124 million hedging gain that was not present in the prior year, effectively offsetting some of the adverse currency effect that had previously reduced streaming revenue growth. To manage this risk, Netflix introduced a formal cash‑flow hedging program in 2024, designating forward contracts as hedges of forecasted foreign‑currency revenue and reclassifying the resulting gains from accumulated other comprehensive income into streaming revenue when the hedged transactions are recognized.",

This indicates a clear upward growth trajectory for the Google Services segment during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, revenue from Google Services grew from $272.5 billion to $304.9 billion—a $32.4 billion increase, or roughly 12% growth—driven primarily by higher subscription revenues (YouTube and Google One) and continued expansion of Google Search & other advertising. This upward trajectory indicates that the Google Services segment is expanding at a solid double‑digit pace, outpacing overall revenue growth and reinforcing its role as a key driver of Alphabet’s top‑line performance.",

      "question": "How has the regulatory framework governing the relationship between Wells Fargo's Parent company and its subsidiary banks evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo's Parent company was subject to federal banking laws that limited covered transactions with its subsidiary banks to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in aggregate, with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length terms. Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the regulatory framework governing Wells Fargo’s parent‑subsidiary relationship remained anchored in the Federal Reserve’s “source‑of‑strength” expectations and the capital‑distribution restrictions imposed on large bank holding companies. Both the 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings reaffirm that subsidiary banks may transfer funds to the parent only through covered transactions limited to 10 % of a subsidiary’s capital and surplus per affiliate and 20 % in the aggregate, with such transfers required to be collateralized and on arm’s‑length terms.  \n\nIn addition, the 2024 filing notes that the Federal Reserve may impose capital‑distribution restrictions—including limits on dividends and share repurchases—if capital, stress‑test, risk‑management, or liquidity triggers are breached, and the OCC can levy assessments or force a sale of the parent’s stake in a subsidiary if its capital becomes impaired. Liquidity support is provided through the parent’s Support Agreement with its intermediate holding company and covered entities, which obligates the intermediate entity to supply capital and liquidity to the bank subsidiaries and, under defined triggers, to forgive subordinated debt and terminate credit lines, thereby directly tying the parent’s ability to meet debt and dividend obligations to the financial health of its regulated subsidiaries.",

      "question": "How did NextEra Energy's (NEE) approach to dismantlement obligations for NEER's wind and solar facilities evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of accounting treatment and expense allocation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE disclosed that NEER's asset retirement obligations (AROs) included dismantlement liabilities for certain wind and solar facilities, with the associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. For non-rate regulated operations, these costs were allocated to expense over the asset's estimated useful life, with changes in the ARO due to the passage of time recognized as an increase in the liability and as accretion expense, included in depreciation and amortization. By 2023, NEE further clarified that NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision specifically for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. This indicates a more explicit recognition and integration of dismantlement obligations into NEER’s depreciation methodology, showing a refinement in how these future liabilities are embedded into current financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, NextEra Energy’s NEER subsidiary continued to record asset‑retirement obligations for its wind and solar facilities, but the accounting treatment remained unchanged – the dismantlement costs are accrued over the facilities’ useful lives and allocated to regulatory assets or liabilities for rate‑regulated operations, and to expense for non‑rate‑regulated activities.  However, the 2021 Florida rate agreement that took effect in 2022 introduced a new $48 million annual depreciation‑reserve amortization (capped at $200 million in the first year) that is used to smooth earnings and meet the targeted regulatory ROE, and the 2023 rate settlement retained this amortization framework while allowing up to $1.45 billion of reserve surplus to be amortized over the agreement term.  Consequently, while the underlying expense recognition for dismantlement did not shift, the way the cost is offset in the financial statements evolved from a simple reserve amortization in 2022 to a more structured, limited‑quantity amortization tied to the 2021‑2025 rate‑agreement terms in 2023.",

By 2024, the company explicitly reported depreciation and amortization expenses for the Pet Nutrition segment, showing a significant increase from $65 million in 2022 to $132 million in 2024. This indicates a deepening financial commitment and operational expansion within the Pet Nutrition segment over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the financial disclosures across the provided pages, the company's involvement in the Pet Nutrition segment has evolved significantly from 2022 to 2024 through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. The Pet Nutrition segment, which generated $3,713 million in net sales in 2022 (page 82), grew to $4,483 million in 2024 (page 115), reflecting increased market penetration and expansion within the segment. This growth is further supported by the acquisition of Hello Products LLC in 2020 (page 81), which strengthened the company's oral care portfolio within Pet Nutrition, and the segment's consistent contribution to overall operating profit, rising from $850 million in 2022 to $965 million in 2024 (pages 115-116). The company has strategically prioritized Pet Nutrition as part of its \"high growth segments\" within Oral Care, Personal Care, and Pet Nutrition, as noted in the 2020 acquisition rationale.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 97 basis points, mainly driven by higher sales. This indicates a continued improvement in operating efficiency, with the impact of pandemic-related costs diminishing further in 2023.",

The drop was driven mainly by higher sales (which spread fixed costs over a larger base) and lower incremental COVID‑19‑related costs, partially offset by higher variable pay. Consequently, segment operating income rose in 2023, reflecting the benefit of these favorable cost dynamics.",

This decline reflects the amortization of those intangibles and indicates that the company’s lease portfolio is becoming less favorable—fewer above‑market leases remain and the remaining ones are being written down faster.",

By fiscal year 2024, Windows revenue had increased by 8%, with Windows OEM revenue growing 7% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue growing 11%. This indicates a stronger and more diversified growth pattern in 2024, especially in the Commercial segment, compared to the more uniform growth seen in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, Windows revenue grew from $21.51 billion in fiscal 2020 to $22.49 billion in fiscal 2021, then increased to $24.76 billion in fiscal 2022, reflecting an overall upward trajectory during the 2020–2022 period. Within the More Personal Computing segment, Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 11% in fiscal 2024 (as noted in the 2024 MD&A), while Windows OEM licensing growth was 7%, indicating strong performance across both OEM and Commercial segments. This growth was driven by broader trends in cloud adoption and enterprise demand, though specific year-over-year comparisons for Windows revenue between 2022 and 2024 are contextualized within the segment's broader performance, including contributions from gaming and devices following the Activision Blizzard acquisition.",

      "question": "How did the composition and magnitude of adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in relation to tax-related adjustments and their underlying drivers?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax-related adjustment impacting EBIT-adjusted primarily consisted of a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation. In contrast, in 2023, the adjustment involved a tax benefit stemming from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a change in the geographic and operational focus of tax-related adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax reconsolidation event in 2022 to a Korea-specific deferred tax asset realization in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the EBIT-adjusted metric declined from $14.5 billion to $12.4 billion, reflecting a drop in the adjusted effective tax rate from 20.0 % to 15.7 % and a reduction in net income attributable to stockholders. The primary drivers of this shift were lower tax expense and adjustments related to Cruise restructuring, India asset sales, and GM Korea wage litigation, which together altered the composition of the adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted.",

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's relationship with its subsidiary banks evolved in terms of capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Wells Fargo’s capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms have been shaped by evolving regulatory expectations around resolution planning and parent-level capital adequacy. The firm remains subject to capital distribution limitations imposed by its holding company structure, including restrictions on dividend payments from subsidiary banks under federal capital rules and the Support Agreement, which can be triggered if liquidity or capital metrics fall below thresholds. Additionally, the FRB’s capital plan rule and stress testing requirements continue to govern capital distributions, while the company’s resolution plan—approved by the FRB and FDIC in June 2024—confirms no deficiencies but maintains the potential for future supervisory actions that could restrict capital activities or require additional liquidity arrangements.",

By 2023, solar expenditures increased substantially to $3,270 million in 2024 (with $1,370 million allocated to solar), while wind decreased to $2,820 million in 2024 (with only $545 million allocated to wind).

      "question": "How has IBM's exposure to financial loss from cybersecurity incidents evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to the sophistication of cyber threats and the company's mitigation efforts?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM acknowledged the risk of financial loss due to cybersecurity incidents, noting that while it regularly addresses such threats, no material adverse effects had occurred. By 2024, the company highlighted an increase in the sophistication and number of cyber threats, particularly with the emergence of AI-driven attack methods, and referenced industry-wide incidents like MOVEit as examples of events that could lead to financial loss. Despite these developments, IBM still reported that no cybersecurity incidents had resulted in a material adverse effect, indicating that while the threat landscape has evolved and potentially increased in risk, the company's mitigation strategies have kept the financial impact within manageable bounds.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's exposure to financial loss from cybersecurity incidents has not changed materially between 2022 and 2024 – the company continues to state that no cybersecurity incident has had a material adverse effect, although it acknowledges that attacks are increasing in number and sophistication, including those leveraging generative AI, and that the cost and operational consequences of responding to such incidents could be significant.  The company's mitigation efforts remain focused on continuous monitoring, investigation, response and remediation, but it concedes that these measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security.",

This decline indicates that the company is amortizing its deferred lease costs more rapidly—consistent with the lower amortization expense reported for 2023 ($34,119 thousand) compared with 2022 ($39,606 thousand)—suggesting shorter lease terms or a higher rate of cost write‑offs.",

      "original_answer": "LinkedIn's revenue growth rate significantly slowed down from 34% in fiscal year 2022 to 9% in fiscal year 2024. This indicates a moderation in LinkedIn's performance and expansion within Microsoft's broader product portfolio during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "LinkedIn's revenue growth accelerated from 34% in fiscal year 2022 to 9% in fiscal year 2024, indicating a significant slowdown in its performance relative to Microsoft's other segments. This deceleration suggests LinkedIn's growth is becoming less of a standout contributor within Microsoft's portfolio, especially as other areas like Microsoft Cloud (23% growth in FY2024) and Dynamics (19% growth in FY2024) demonstrate stronger momentum.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, the net pension and OPEB benefit was $192 million, an increase from $177 million in 2020, driven by a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred losses. In 2024, the benefit was $190 million, up from $164 million in 2023, with the increase attributed to a higher expected return on assets and lower interest costs due to a decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. The benefit remained relatively stable in magnitude but evolved in terms of its underlying drivers, shifting from primarily asset return and interest cost dynamics in 2021 to a more pronounced impact of reduced obligations in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2021 through 2024, net pension and OPEB expense (benefit) excluding service cost improved from a $192 million benefit in 2021 to a $190 million benefit in 2024, reflecting higher expected returns on plan assets and lower interest costs that more than offset higher amortization of deferred losses. The key drivers of this change were the higher discount‑rate environment and stronger asset performance, which boosted the benefit component, while cost‑inflation and modest increases in required contributions kept the net effect relatively stable over the period.",

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's real estate footprint related to its Consumer Finance segment evolved from 2023 to 2024, based on the amount of vacant or leased property held pending disposition?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo held 5.7 million square feet of real estate that was vacant pending disposition, leased to retail tenants, or leased-to-term by third-party office tenants. By 2024, this figure had decreased to 4.4 million square feet. This indicates a reduction in the company's real estate footprint related to these activities over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K filings, Wells Fargo’s real‑estate footprint tied to its Consumer Finance segment remained largely stable from 2023 to 2024. In the 2023 filing (page 6), the company reported approximately 59.6 million sq ft of U.S. property occupied and an additional 5.7 million sq ft of real estate held vacant pending disposition. The 2024 filing (page 10) shows a slight reduction, with about 55.1 million sq ft of U.S. property occupied and 4.4 million sq ft of vacant space pending disposition. Thus, the amount of vacant or leased property held for disposition has modestly declined, but the overall footprint of the Consumer Finance segment has not expanded materially between the two years.",

This indicates that, despite the two-year gap, there was no change in the remaining capacity of the repurchase program during this time.",

This steady allocation indicates that IBM maintains a consistent repurchase capacity over the period, with no significant increase or decrease in the amount of funds earmarked for buying back its own stock.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This represents a significant shift from a slight improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",

The 2024 increase was driven mainly by lapping higher prior‑year markdowns and favorable product‑mix shifts, while the 2023 decline resulted from inventory markdowns, elevated supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips disclosed that for performance periods beginning in 2018 or later, recipients of cash-settled PSUs received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense, with the accrued reinvested dividend paid at the time of settlement. In 2024, the company maintained the same structure, reiterating that for performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent, which was also charged to compensation expense and paid at settlement. This consistency indicates that the company did not alter its approach to dividend equivalents for these PSUs between the two years, maintaining a stable policy in how compensation is recognized and distributed for long-term incentive plans.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips shifted the classification of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for cash‑settled Performance Share Units (PSUs) from being recorded as a charge to retained earnings to being charged directly to compensation expense. In the 2023 filing (page 121), the company noted that for cash‑settled PSUs issued before 2013, dividend equivalents were charged to retained earnings, but beginning in 2013 they were charged to compensation expense. The 2024 disclosures (pages 123‑124 and 126) confirm that cash‑settled PSU awards now consistently accrue and expense dividend equivalents as part of compensation, and that all outstanding cash‑settled PSUs are fully vested with no remaining compensation cost. This evolution indicates that ConocoPhillips has standardized its PSU compensation treatment—recognizing both the fair‑value of the PSUs and associated dividend equivalents as compensation expense—reflecting a more unified and expense‑focused approach to PSU accounting.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Tower Corporation recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $0.4 million, while in 2023, the company recorded a slightly lower loss of $0.3 million. This indicates a minor reduction in the financial impact of debt repayments or retirements in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease suggests that the company may have experienced fewer or less costly early debt retirements during the 2023 period.",
      "llm_answer": "The loss on retirement of long‑term obligations declined from $0.4 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023, indicating that American Tower’s debt‑repayment activities were less event‑driven in 2023 – i.e., fewer early retirements or refinancing write‑offs of long‑term debt. This reduction suggests the company was repaying maturing obligations more routinely rather than incurring significant loss‑on‑retirement charges.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney provided a detailed explanation of its revenue recognition methodology for affiliate fees, stating that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber numbers. Fixed license fees were recognized ratably over the contract term, and minimum guaranteed fees were recognized ratably over the guaranteed period, with excess fees recognized after the guarantee was exceeded. By fiscal 2024, the specific revenue recognition methodology was no longer detailed in the disclosures. Instead, affiliate fees were mentioned in the context of fluctuating with MVPD subscriber levels and were listed among the significant revenue sources for the Sports segment, particularly related to ESPN-branded channels. This indicates a shift from detailed recognition methodology in 2022 to a more contextual and segment-focused disclosure in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2024, Disney's treatment of affiliate fees shifted from recognizing them as ratable revenue based on subscriber counts and fixed license fees (with minimums deferred until exceeded) to a more detailed methodology that emphasizes subscription fees recognized ratably, advertising revenue tied to impressions, and minimum guaranteed fees amortized over contract periods, while also incorporating new disclosures about the timing of revenue recognition for TV/SVOD licenses, minimum guarantees, and multi-period availability windows. Contextually, the 2024 filing explicitly references the upcoming Venu Sports joint venture and the planned 2025 DTC launch of ESPN-branded channels on Disney+, signaling a strategic evolution in how affiliate and distribution revenues will be structured and reported moving forward.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde identified cost pass-through as a 2% contributor to sales changes, indicating a limited but measurable impact of cost recovery mechanisms. By 2023, the company emphasized a structural advantage in its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, suggesting a more strategic and intentional reliance on cost pass-through as a financial management tool. This evolution indicates a shift from a reactive cost adjustment to a more proactive and contractual approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Linde increasingly leveraged cost pass-through mechanisms to mitigate inflationary pressures, particularly in energy and feedstock costs, while maintaining pricing discipline. This strategic use of pass-through contributed to a 49% rise in reported operating profit and a 15% increase in adjusted operating profit, demonstrating that the company effectively managed cost fluctuations by transferring them to customers through contractual billing adjustments, thereby preserving margin stability.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a transformation in performance from a decline to an improvement in gross margin trends.",

This improvement was primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, which benefited from price management aligned with competitive historic gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by shifts toward lower-margin merchandise categories.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 51 basis points, primarily driven by effective price management in response to cost inflation and a favorable merchandise mix, including the lapping of temporary closures of Auto Care and Vision Centers. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to higher inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This represents a significant shift from growth to decline in gross profit performance year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate declined 85 basis points in fiscal 2023 but rose 20 basis points in fiscal 2024. The 2023 drop was driven mainly by higher inventory markdowns, elevated supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges, while the 2024 increase resulted from lapping those prior‑year markdowns and price management, partially offset by a shift toward lower‑margin product categories.",

In 2023, the company reported property revenue from Africa at $1,225.6 million, a more modest 3% increase compared to 2022. This indicates a slowdown in growth within the African market between those years.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMT's Africa property revenue grew from $747.4 million to $792.3 million, a 6 % increase. This rise reflects higher tenant billings and pass‑through revenues, although it was partially offset by higher direct expenses tied to pass‑through costs such as energy. The modest growth signals that AMT is steadily expanding its African portfolio, but the region’s contribution remains modest relative to other markets and is still subject to currency and cost‑inflation pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GMI's revenue increased by $586 million (5.1%) compared to the prior year, with the variance attributed to volume (-$1.6 billion), mix (+$1.3 billion), price (+$0.9 billion), and other factors (+$0.1 billion). In 2023, GMI's revenue remained nearly flat with only a $2 million change (0%), but the variance components shifted significantly: volume contributed +$0.5 billion, mix decreased by $0.3 billion, cost reduced the revenue by $0.3 billion, and other factors added $0.1 billion. This reflects a transition from growth driven by pricing and mix in 2022 to a more neutral position in 2023 with offsetting effects across variance components.",
      "llm_answer": "The variance in GMI’s revenue between 2022 and 2023 was driven primarily by a $0.6 billion favorable price effect, a $0.4 billion favorable mix effect and a $0.2 billion negative other effect, while volume contributed a $0.6 billion unfavorable impact. These factors together resulted in a modest overall revenue increase of $0.529 billion (3.4 %).",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Netflix reported paid net membership additions of 29,529 thousand, a significant 232% increase compared to 2022, indicating rapid subscriber growth. In 2024, rather than disclosing specific membership figures, the company provided detailed information about its expanded use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing. This shift in disclosure suggests that Netflix anticipated sustained international growth in memberships and was proactively managing financial exposure to currency fluctuations, which could significantly impact revenue from global streaming. The detailed hedging strategy in 2024 reflects a strategic evolution from simply reporting growth to actively managing the financial implications of that growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s 2024 foreign‑exchange hedging strategy was expanded to protect the cash‑flow impact of currency swings on its overseas growth, reflecting a more proactive stance than in 2023 when hedging gains were not materially recognized. By formally designating forward contracts as cash‑flow hedges for forecasted revenue and content‑related transactions, the company reduced earnings volatility and aligned hedging outcomes with its broader growth expectations for paid net membership additions, signaling a shift from a primarily risk‑mitigation focus to a strategic tool that supports its targeted membership‑addition targets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney's amortization policy for licensed rights to film and television content applied to content used on Linear Networks or DTC streaming services. By 2024, the company expanded the scope to include platforms such as the domestic ESPN television network and International Sports Channels, in addition to Linear Networks and DTC services. This indicates a broader application of the amortization policy across more platforms, reflecting a strategic evolution in how licensed content is managed and monetized as part of a group.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's amortization approach for licensed rights to film and television content has remained consistent in its methodology—recognizing revenue when licensed content becomes available for use and amortizing costs based on the predominant monetization strategy (individual vs. group). However, the **platforms covered under group monetization have expanded significantly between 2022 and 2024**, particularly with the inclusion of **Disney+ (DTC streaming services)** as a core component of \"group\" monetization. This shift reflects the company's strategic pivot toward direct-to-consumer (DTC) distribution, where content initially licensed for theatrical or linear TV is now often treated as a group asset under streaming-driven revenue models. The 2024 filing explicitly references this evolution in impairment testing and monetization classification, aligning with Disney's broader focus on streaming as a primary distribution channel.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Embedded Processing segment had a goodwill value of $172 million, indicating its relatively smaller asset base compared to other segments. By 2024, the segment's role had notably expanded, as it contributed approximately 16% of the company's total revenue. This shift suggests an increased strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing, particularly through products like microcontrollers, processors, and wireless connectivity solutions. The rise from a segment with modest goodwill to one generating a significant portion of revenue reflects a meaningful evolution in its importance to TXN's overall business model.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures, the Embedded Processing segment's financial significance has grown substantially from 2023 to 2024. In 2024, it generated $2.53 billion in revenue (16% of total revenue), up from $2.03 billion in 2023 (as implied by the 16% figure representing a larger share of the $15.64 billion total revenue), and its revenue share increased from 16% to 16% of total revenue (with Analog at 78% of revenue). The segment's revenue growth is further underscored by its strategic importance in TI's business model, which emphasizes \"four sustainable competitive advantages\" including a broad portfolio of embedded processing products, and its role in driving long-term free cash flow per share growth through capital investments and efficiency initiatives.",

This indicates a growing risk profile in terms of settlement obligations, as the net exposure rose despite an increase in risk mitigation arrangements, which went from $12,167 million in 2023 to $13,466 million in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 Mastercard’s gross settlement exposure rose modestly from $75.0 billion to $78.4 billion, and net settlement exposure increased from $62.9 billion to $64.9 billion after applying risk‑mitigation arrangements. This upward trend indicates that the company’s exposure to settlement risk is growing, reflecting a higher volume of transactions and a larger contingent of unresolved merchant claims, which suggests an elevated risk profile related to its settlement obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the cost of natural gas resulted in a loss of $27 million in SO's derivatives in non-designated hedging relationships. By 2024, this relationship had reversed, with the cost of natural gas contributing a gain of $94 million to the same category. This indicates a significant shift in how natural gas pricing affected the company's financial instruments over this period. The change reflects a reversal in risk exposure, where previously rising natural gas costs hurt the company financially through derivatives, but more recently, those costs have benefited the company's position.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of natural‑gas price volatility on Southern Company’s (SO) derivative program shifted markedly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, non‑designated energy‑related derivatives generated a $11 million gain on natural‑gas revenues but a $65 million loss on cost of natural gas, reflecting hedging activity tied to high gas prices. By 2024, the same categories produced a $94 million gain on cost of natural gas and essentially no gain or loss on natural‑gas revenues, indicating that the company’s cash‑flow and fair‑value hedges had largely offset the earlier price shock and that exposure to gas‑price swings had been reduced. This evolution shows a deliberate risk‑management response to a more stable or rising gas‑price environment, moving from reactive hedging against price spikes to a more balanced derivative position that now contributes positively to earnings.",

      "question": "How did COP's capital expenditures and investments evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's investment strategy in its key operational regions?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP reported consolidated capital expenditures and investments of $11,248 million, with significant allocations to regions such as Lower 48 ($6,487 million) and Alaska ($1,705 million). In 2024, these expenditures increased slightly to $12,118 million. This indicates a continued strategic emphasis on capital investment, particularly in core regions, suggesting a focus on long-term asset development and production capacity enhancement.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K filings, ConocoPhillips' capital expenditures and investments increased from $10.159 billion in 2022 to $11.248 billion in 2023, and further to $12,118 million in 2024 (as shown in the 2024 cash flow statement on page 82). This represents a 10.5% year-over-year increase from 2022 to 2023 and a 7.5% increase from 2023 to 2024. The investments are strategically focused on key operational regions, with significant capital allocated to Canada ($456 million in 2023, up from $203 million in 2022), Asia Pacific ($354 million in 2023, down from $1,880 million in 2022), and the Lower 48 ($6,487 million in 2023, up from $5,630 million in 2022). This indicates a strategic shift toward prioritizing high-potential regions like Canada and the Lower 48 while scaling back investments in Asia Pacific, reflecting a focus on optimizing returns in core areas with stronger economic prospects.",

The 2024 filing notes roughly 1.1 million sq ft of leased/owned space in EMEA and highlights that BNY SA/NV serves as the primary conduit for the firm’s Securities Services and Market & Wealth Services activities across continental Europe.

      "question": "How did Disney's recognition and reporting of Affiliate Fees evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of revenue recognition methodology and disclosed financial figures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney detailed its revenue recognition methodology for Affiliate Fees, explaining that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber counts, with guaranteed fees recognized ratably over the contract term. By 2024, the company disclosed specific financial figures showing total Affiliate Fees reached $17,525 million, with $7,739 million attributed to Entertainment and $10,796 million to Sports. This indicates a shift from detailed policy description in 2022 to quantitative disclosure and segmentation in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Disney’s reporting of Affiliate Fees remained a key component of its revenue streams, consistently classified under \"Affiliate fees\" in its segment revenue breakdowns across all three fiscal years. These fees, which include payments from cable and satellite distributors for carriage of its networks, were recognized ratably over contract terms, with minimum guaranteed fees recognized straight-line and excess amounts recorded as earned upon exceeding guarantees. In 2024, Affiliate Fees totaled $6.872 billion in the Entertainment segment and $10.418 billion in Sports, contributing to a total of $16.107 billion, compared to $7.369 billion and $10.590 billion respectively in 2023, and $7.739 billion and $10.796 billion in 2022. The methodology for revenue recognition—particularly regarding fixed license fees, minimum guarantees, and timing of recognition for on-demand licensing—remained consistent, with no fundamental shift in accounting approach, though the absolute dollar amounts reflected growth in underlying subscriber and licensing markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DHR reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) of 1.0% for the year-over-year comparison of 2023 vs. 2022. In contrast, for 2024, the company reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) decline of (10.5)% for the comparison of 2023 vs. 2022 and a positive 3.0% for the 2024 vs. 2023 period. This indicates a significant shift from stable growth in 2023 to a notable decline in core sales growth in early 2024, followed by a partial recovery later in the year. The fluctuation suggests volatility in the company's underlying business performance during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in Danaher’s non‑GAAP Core Sales Growth for its Biotechnology segment shows a sharp deceleration: after an 18% year‑over‑year core‑sales decline in 2023, the decline narrowed to 4.5% in 2024, driven by modest price‑increase contributions and a partial recovery in consumables demand in the second half of 2024. This improvement indicates that while underlying demand remains weak—especially in China and for COVID‑related products—the company is stabilizing its core revenue base and beginning to see modest growth from price actions and higher consumables sales.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Engineering Segment Operating Profit was $473 million. In 2023, it decreased by $64 million, or 12%, to $409 million. This decline was primarily driven by a $602 million decrease in Engineering segment sales, which included $894 million from projects in Russia in 2022 compared to only $238 million in 2023. Although the wind down of terminated or suspended Russian projects contributed to higher margins, it only partially offset the overall decline in operating profit.",
      "llm_answer": "The Engineering segment's operating profit declined by $64 million (‑12 %) from 2022 to 2023. This drop was mainly due to lower sales driven by project timing and the winding down of sanctioned projects in Russia, which reduced sales by about $238 million in 2023 and $894 million in 2022. While margin improvements from the termination of those projects partially offset the sales decline, overall operating profit still fell.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to the previous year, primarily due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts. The change from a 50 basis point decrease in fiscal 2023 to a 20 basis point increase in fiscal 2024 indicates a significant turnaround in gross margin performance year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, driven primarily by lapping higher markdowns from the prior year and price management that offset shifts toward lower‑margin merchandise categories. In contrast, the gross profit rate fell by 85 basis points in fiscal 2023, mainly because of inventory markdowns, elevated supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges.",

      "question": "How did the factors influencing Walmart's Gross Profit Rate evolve between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and what were the key drivers behind the contrasting trends in each year?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's Gross Profit Rate increased by 65 basis points, driven by favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses, despite price investments and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 155 basis points, primarily due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This shift reflects a significant change in the drivers of gross profit, moving from improvement due to internal efficiencies and product mix in 2022 to external pressures and cost increases in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 the Walmart U.S. gross‑profit rate fell sharply, dropping about 85 basis points in 2023 after a modest 20‑basis‑point rise in 2022. The 2023 decline was driven mainly by higher inventory markdowns, elevated supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges, while the 2022 increase came from price management and lapping prior‑year markdowns. In contrast, the International segment’s gross‑profit rate fell 50 bps in 2023 (after a 20‑bps rise in 2022) due to shifts toward lower‑margin formats and channels in China, whereas the Sam’s Club segment’s rate slipped 68 bps in 2023 after a 65‑bps gain in 2022, reflecting higher‑margin fuel sales and cost inflation. Thus, the key drivers behind the contrasting trends were: (1) U.S. profit pressure from markdowns and supply‑chain costs in 2023 versus price‑mix gains in 2022; (2) International margin erosion from format shifts and currency effects; and (3) Sam’s Club margin compression from fuel sales and inflation, offsetting earlier gains.",

By 2024, the company had fully integrated Surmont into its Canada segment, now owning 100% of the working interest, with the final consideration reported at $3.0 billion CAD $4.1 billion after adjustments. This represents a strategic consolidation of ownership in the Surmont asset.",

The company subsequently made contingent payments of $158 million under the CAD‑linked arrangement during 2024, reflecting the ongoing financial commitments tied to Surmont.",

This reflects a more comprehensive approach to assessing impairment risk, incorporating both behavioral and financial indicators of tenant health.",
      "llm_answer": "The Company’s monitoring and impairment assessment criteria for tenant‑related intangible assets remained essentially the same in 2023, continuing to evaluate recoverability on a tenant‑by‑tenant basis using indicators such as turnover, contract non‑renewal, cancellation or termination and projected undiscounted cash flows. However, the 2023 disclosures introduced a new indicator of impairment—specifically, the Company began monitoring for “high levels of turnover or attrition, the customer’s ability to meet contractual obligations, non‑renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship” and explicitly noted that it assesses recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to projected undiscounted future cash flows and, when necessary, to market‑based fair‑value information. This added focus on tenant‑level turnover and contract renewal risk represents the key evolution in the Company’s impairment methodology for 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Theme Park Admissions was described as a key revenue stream under the Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP) segment, specifically listing 'Sales of tickets for admission to our theme parks and for premium access to certain attractions (e.g. Genie+ and Lightning Lane).' It was presented alongside other DPEP revenue categories like merchandise, food and beverage sales, and resort stays. By 2024, Theme Park Admissions was explicitly quantified at $11,171 million and categorized under the 'Experiences' segment, showing a distinct and separate reporting structure from other revenue streams such as Subscription fees ($18,796 million) and Advertising ($7,506 million). This indicates a shift toward more granular and segmented financial reporting, with Theme Park Admissions now clearly distinguished and directly measured against other major revenue categories.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Theme Park Admissions revenue grew from $8.6 billion to $11.2 billion, reflecting higher park attendance and pricing, and its share of total revenue rose from about 10% of total segment revenue in 2022 to roughly 12% in 2024. The category remains a distinct line item under “Experiences” in the segment revenue tables, but its relative contribution stays modest compared with the larger Entertainment (subscription, affiliate, advertising) and Sports (subscription, affiliate, advertising) streams.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Adobe disclosed that unrealized credit-related losses were recorded to 'other income (expense), net' in the Consolidated Statements of Income with a corresponding allowance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2024, the company maintained the same accounting treatment for unrealized credit-related losses, indicating consistency in recognition and presentation methodology. However, the context of significant financial activity—such as the $1 billion non-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition—suggests increased scrutiny on financial disclosures, though this did not alter the accounting approach for credit-related losses.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe did not recognize any allowance for credit‑related losses on its short‑term investment securities in either fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024; the company explicitly states that during both years it “did not recognize an allowance for credit‑related losses on any of our investments.” Consequently, there was no change in the treatment or disclosure of unrealized credit‑related losses between the two periods—both years reflect a zero allowance and no impact on the presentation of the financial statements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, General Motors reported an Automotive Interest Expense of $950 million. In 2023, this expense slightly increased to $987 million. This indicates that the company's interest burden related to its automotive operations remained relatively stable, with a modest increase of $37 million, or approximately 3.9%. The small change in interest expense suggests that GM's financing strategy for its automotive segment did not undergo significant alterations during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The Automotive interest expense declined from $950 million in 2022 to $863 million in 2023—a reduction of roughly $87 million (about 9%). This decrease reflects GM’s strategy of lowering financing costs, likely through debt refinancing and the repayment of higher‑cost obligations, which improves cash flow and supports its broader financial objectives.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, HD acquired $1,827 million in lease assets through new operating lease liabilities and $336 million through new finance lease liabilities. In fiscal 2024, these figures changed to $1,384 million for operating leases and $153 million for finance leases. This indicates a significant decrease in both categories, especially in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on finance leases and moderating overall lease-driven asset acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 HD’s lease‑related assets rose from $10.7 bn to $11.2 bn and lease liabilities increased from $10.5 bn to $11.9 bn, reflecting a substantial expansion of both operating and finance lease obligations. This growth—driven by new lease commitments (e.g., $1.8 bn of new operating‑lease assets and $0.34 bn of new finance‑lease assets in 2024) and higher weighted‑average lease terms—indicates that the company is aggressively expanding its lease‑based footprint, likely to support its acquisition‑driven strategy and broader capital‑efficiency initiatives.",

In 2024, the company experienced a core sales growth of 3.0%, showing a turnaround from the prior year. This shift from decline to growth suggests an improvement in the company's underlying business performance, potentially reflecting stronger demand, pricing power, or operational execution.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher's core sales in the Biotechnology segment declined 4.5% year-over-year in 2024 (compared to an 18% decline in 2023), indicating ongoing weakness in the bioprocessing business driven by reduced customer inventory levels and cautious investment, particularly in China, though core sales showed modest improvement in the second half of 2024. This core sales decline, coupled with the broader 6% total segment sales decrease, suggests underlying demand challenges persist despite price increases contributing 2.5% to sales growth, pointing to a continued but potentially stabilizing deterioration in the company's core bioprocessing operations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil disclosed future dismantlement costs as part of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, noting that this measure includes costs for dismantlement, abandonment, and rehabilitation obligations. However, the company emphasized that the measure is based on first-day-of-the-month average prices, which can cause significant variability in cash flows year to year. In 2023, ExxonMobil maintained the same inclusion of future dismantlement costs but explicitly stated that the standardized measure 'depends on' these pricing assumptions, indicating a more direct acknowledgment of the sensitivity of dismantlement cost estimates to price fluctuations. This evolution shows a shift in how the company characterizes the relationship between external pricing and its long-term cost obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, ExxonMobil’s standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows declined by $105 billion (from $258.9 billion to $153.8 billion). This reduction was driven primarily by lower future cash inflows and higher future income‑tax expenses, with the change being highly sensitive to pricing assumptions—particularly the net change in prices, lifting and development costs, which shifted from a $139.8 billion increase in 2022 to a $120.9 billion decrease in 2023. Consequently, the 2023 measure reflects a pronounced dependency on pricing assumptions, as evidenced by the substantial negative adjustment to future cash inflows and the resulting drop in the discounted cash‑flow total.",

      "question": "How has NEE's financial exposure through its NEER segment evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of contracted versus merchant generation assets and their associated revenue commitments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER had approximately 28,759 MW of contracted generation capacity with long-term power sales agreements, and only 1,842 MW of merchant generation assets that required active marketing and hedging. By 2024, NEER's disclosed future revenue commitments showed a significant shift, with $3,945 million in 2025 declining sharply to $370 million by 2029 and beyond, indicating a reduced long-term financial exposure and likely a strategic shift away from long-term contracted generation or a reclassification of assets. This reflects a transformation in NEER's business model under NEE, moving away from long-term commitments toward shorter-term or market-driven strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, NEER's contracted generation capacity increased to approximately 28,759 MW (up from 20,147 MW in 2023), reflecting additions of ~1,651 MW of wind and ~2,073 MW of solar capacity in 2023, while merchant generation remained minimal at ~1,842 MW (primarily nuclear and peak units). The company's revenue commitments under long-term contracts totaled $3,945 million in 2025, with $815 million in 2026, $250 million in 2027, $120 million in 2028, $70 million in 2029, and $370 million thereafter, underscoring a strategic shift toward contracted assets with stable cash flows. This evolution reflects NEER's focus on expanding long-term power sales agreements for renewable projects (wind/solar) while maintaining nuclear units under existing contracts, reducing reliance on merchant generation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Boeing's Core Operating Loss decreased by $2,833 million compared with 2022, indicating an improvement in segment operating performance. However, in 2024, the Core Operating Loss increased sharply by $9,982 million compared with 2023, signaling a significant deterioration in performance. This reversal reflects a shift from operational improvement to substantial operational challenges across key business segments, particularly BCA and BDS, driven by production disruptions, program losses, and contract adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's Core Operating Loss widened dramatically from $1.829 billion in 2023 to $11.811 billion in 2024, indicating a sharp deterioration in underlying segment profitability. This increase reflects deeper losses across Commercial Airplanes (driven by 777X reach‑forward losses, 767 and 737‑9 grounding impacts, production disruptions and lower margins) and Defense, Space & Security (higher unfavourable contract catch‑up adjustments), outweighing modest gains in Global Services. Consequently, the company's segment operating performance weakened substantially year‑over‑year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP accounted for dry hole expenses under the successful efforts method of accounting, where exploratory well costs are capitalized pending evaluation and expensed as dry holes if economically recoverable reserves are not found. This is detailed in the 2023 disclosures regarding oil and gas exploration and development. By 2024, COP provided explicit financial figures showing a significant increase in dry hole expenses, rising from $109 million in 2023 to $251 million in 2024. This indicates a notable increase in the number or cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells during the year, reflecting a shift toward more aggressive or riskier exploration activities or changes in success rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ treatment of dry hole expenses remained consistent with its historical accounting policy: exploratory well costs are capitalized as suspended well balances when reserves are not yet proven, and are subsequently expense as dry holes only when management determines the prospects lack sufficient economic viability for further investment. The 2024 10-K (page 42) shows dry hole expenses of $40 million in 2024, down from $109 million in 2023, reflecting reduced exploration activity and more rigorous evaluation of suspended well balances. This represents a decrease in dry hole expense recognition, but the underlying accounting methodology—capitalizing exploratory costs pending reserve confirmation and expensing them as dry holes upon abandonment—has not changed. The company continues to apply the successful efforts method for oil and gas exploration costs, maintaining the same categorization of exploration expenses (including dry holes) as part of overall exploration expenditures reported in the consolidated income statement.",

      "question": "How did Comcast's approach to audience ratings guarantees in advertising contracts evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what impact did this have on revenue recognition timing?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast highlighted that lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, particularly for NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's channels, had an adverse effect on advertising sales and rates. The company noted that audience measurement methodologies could negatively affect advertising revenue if they did not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. By 2023, the company formalized its approach to advertising contracts by disclosing that it guarantees audience ratings for advertisements in some contracts. If a shortfall occurs in meeting these guaranteed ratings, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units within one year. This represents a shift from merely identifying audience ratings as a risk factor to actively managing the financial implications through contractual guarantees and revenue deferral policies.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast’s advertising contracts include audience‑rating guarantees; if ratings fall short, a portion of the revenue is deferred and later recognized when the shortfall is settled—typically by providing additional ad units within a year. This deferral shifts some advertising revenue from the period in which the ads are aired to the period when the guarantee is fulfilled, altering the timing of revenue recognition.",

By 2024, the company disclosed the final consideration as $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion) after customary adjustments, indicating a slight increase in the total acquisition cost compared to the initial 2023 disclosure, though the contingent payment structure remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips' commitment and disclosure around the Surmont asset evolved from a contingent payment structure tied to WCS crude oil prices to actual cash outflows under that arrangement. In the 2023 acquisition (page 90), the company recorded a $320 million fair value for contingent consideration, with a potential up to $0.4 billion CAD over five years based on WCS pricing exceeding $52/barrel. For 2024, the company reported $158 million in payments under this arrangement (page 90), reflecting the ongoing contingent obligation. The company finalized the purchase price allocation for the $2.955 billion acquisition by the end of Q1 2024 (page 90), confirming the asset valuation and contingent payment terms.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AbbVie disclosed an upfront payment of $130 million related to the acquisition of Syndesi Therapeutics SA, with additional future contingent payments mentioned but not quantified. By 2024, AbbVie provided a significantly more detailed disclosure, specifying that the agreement includes potential additional payments of up to $870 million contingent on development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. This represents a substantial increase in the visibility and scale of financial commitments tied to the acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "The nature and scale of AbbVie’s financial commitments related to the Syndesi Therapeutics acquisition evolved from an initial $130 million upfront payment in 2022 to a potential total of up to $1 billion in future milestone payments, reflecting the asset‑acquisition structure and the company’s ongoing contingent consideration obligations. By 2024, these commitments were incorporated into AbbVie’s broader acquisition‑related spending, which totaled $3.0 billion in cash outflows for other acquisitions and investments, with $2.8 billion recorded as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense, underscoring the expanded scale of AbbVie’s strategic investments post‑2023.",

In 2024, the segment's organic sales growth remained at a low single-digit level, indicating minimal change in its growth trajectory. Despite this stability, the segment's performance lagged behind other business units like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, which showed higher growth rates, suggesting that Baby, Feminine & Family Care was not a primary growth driver in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment showed flat net sales growth in fiscal 2024, with organic sales increasing only 2% year‑over‑year, reflecting modest demand and pricing pressures. This limited contribution highlights that the segment’s growth is not a primary driver of Procter & Gamble’s overall top‑line expansion, which relies more heavily on higher‑growth categories such as Grooming and Fabric & Home Care to deliver organic sales growth of 4% and support the company’s broader growth strategy.",

This substantial growth in earnings directly contributed to retained earnings, which rose from a beginning balance of $28,053 million in 2022 to $40,070 million in 2023 before dividends and other adjustments. The change reflects a transformational increase in profitability or a one-time gain, likely tied to strategic transactions such as the AspenTech acquisition disclosed in the 2023 filing.",

In contrast, the 2024 increase of $359 million compared to 2023 was mainly due to $432 million in transaction expenses linked to the acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including reduced mark-to-market impacts of key employee compensation programs. This reflects a shift from compensation-driven growth in 2023 to acquisition-driven growth in 2024.",

In contrast, 2023’s G&A rise of $113 million over 2022 was mainly due to mark‑to‑market adjustments in compensation programs, with no comparable acquisition‑related spending. Consequently, the magnitude of the increase slowed sharply and the composition shifted from organic cost pressures in 2022‑23 to a one‑time, large‑scale transaction expense in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2023 10-K filing, AMT projected Start-up capital expenditures to range from $65 million to $85 million for 2024. However, in the 2024 10-K filing, the company's projected spending on Start-up capital projects for 2025 was lowered to a range of $50 million to $70 million. This indicates a strategic shift or reduction in investment in new ventures or start-up projects compared to the prior year's projections.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, AMT's projected spending on start-up capital projects increased from $65 million to $81 million in 2024 (up from $65 million in 2023), reflecting a higher investment in new ventures such as data‑center and communications‑site construction. This rise indicates that AMT is allocating more capital toward growth‑oriented projects while still maintaining a focus on its core infrastructure and distribution priorities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment was described as including the design, manufacture, installation, sales, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services, with a general emphasis on solar energy systems incentives. By 2024, the segment maintained its dual focus on solar and storage but provided more detailed emphasis on specific products like Powerwall and Megapack, with Powerwall being explicitly positioned for homes and small commercial facilities, and Megapack targeting large-scale commercial and utility customers with installations reaching gigawatt-hour capacities. Additionally, Tesla introduced real-time energy control and optimization platforms to manage these systems remotely. This indicates a strategic evolution toward more sophisticated integration and software capabilities in energy storage solutions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment shifted its focus from primarily solar retrofit systems and residential solar offerings toward a stronger emphasis on energy storage products and integrated solar solutions. The 2022 filing highlights solar energy systems (including Solar Roof) and energy storage products like Powerwall and Megapack, while the 2024 filing expands on this with greater detail on modular energy storage design, software-enabled dispatch capabilities, and utility-scale Megapack deployments. The segment description also evolved to emphasize \"energy generation and storage\" as a unified category, reflecting a strategic move to position solar and storage as complementary offerings rather than separate product lines.",

      "llm_answer": "The rate of decline in U.S. Humira sales accelerated from 35% in 2023 to 41% in 2024, indicating that biosimilar competition is intensifying and eroding Humira's market share at an increasing pace. This faster decline suggests biosimilars are gaining greater traction in the U.S. market, likely due to sustained pricing pressure and market share gains by competing biosimilars.",

Contractual backlog grew primarily due to gains in Defense, Space & Security and Global Services, while unobligated backlog fell modestly from $23,101 million to $22,534 million, indicating a shift toward more funded work and fewer unfunded orders.",

A 3D seismic survey was acquired in 2022, and processing and evaluation of this data was ongoing in 2023. By 2024, the processing and evaluation work had been completed. However, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the company elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for the SB405 PSC and relinquished the block. This marks a shift from active exploration and evaluation to a strategic decision to discontinue further investment in the block.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ exploration and strategic focus on Block SB405 shifted markedly. In 2023 the company held an 85 % working interest in the block and, after acquiring it in 2021, completed a 3‑D seismic survey and advanced data processing, but in late 2024 it elected not to move to the second phase of exploration and consequently relinquished the block. This decision reflects a strategic pull‑back from further development of SB405, even as the company continued to expand its LNG portfolio and pursue other international projects elsewhere.",

      "question": "How has the discussion around AMT's substantial leverage evolved from 2023 to 2024 in the context of forward-looking statements and associated business risks?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT's forward-looking statements included references to the 'Pending ATC TIPL Transaction' in relation to its substantial leverage and debt service obligations, indicating a specific transactional context for its financial risk disclosures. By 2024, the disclosure no longer mentioned the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction, suggesting that the company had either completed or abandoned this specific agreement, and instead focused on broader financing activities and debt service obligations without tying them to a named transaction. This evolution reflects a shift from a transaction-specific risk to a more generalized disclosure around leverage and financing.",
      "llm_answer": "The discussion of AMT's substantial leverage and debt service obligations has remained a consistent risk factor in both the 2023 and 2024 filings, but the context evolved significantly due to the strategic divestiture of its India operations (ATC TIPL Transaction). While the 2023 filing highlighted leverage as a forward-looking risk tied to future financing needs and debt service obligations, the 2024 filing details how the $2.2 billion proceeds from the ATC TIPL sale were used to repay debt under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility, thereby reducing leverage and altering the company's capital structure. This transaction, finalized in September 2024, directly addressed the leverage risk noted in prior filings by providing a concrete mechanism to deleverage, though the 2024 filing still retains forward-looking references to \"substantial leverage\" as a risk factor in the context of ongoing debt service obligations and future financing needs. The shift reflects a move from theoretical risk to executed deleveraging, while maintaining disclosure of leverage as a key risk due to its impact on financial flexibility.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the Graphics segment generated $15,868 million in revenue and was a core part of NVIDIA's business, primarily driven by gaming and professional visualization. By fiscal year 2024, while the segment still includes GeForce GPUs for gaming, its strategic positioning has expanded to include broader AI applications, such as Omniverse Enterprise software for industrial AI and digital twin applications, and it now plays a more integrated role in NVIDIA's AI-driven computing platforms. The segment's evolution reflects a shift from being primarily consumer-focused to being more deeply embedded in enterprise and AI workflows.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal year 2022 through fiscal 2024, the Graphics segment’s contribution to NVIDIA’s overall revenue has continued to shrink as the company’s strategic focus shifted toward data‑center and AI‑centric growth.  In the 2022 filing the Graphics segment still accounted for a meaningful share of revenue, but by the 2024 filing the company emphasizes that its Compute & Networking segment now drives the bulk of growth, with Graphics relegated to “gaming, professional visualization and automotive” as a secondary, legacy business.  Consequently, while Graphics still generates revenue from GeForce, RTX and Omniverse offerings, its revenue share has declined and the segment is positioned primarily as a complementary, ecosystem‑enabling business rather than a core profit driver.",

By 2024, this revenue had increased by $973 million, or 54%, compared to 2023, driven by heightened demand for these credits in North America as other automakers scaled back their battery electric vehicle initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla's Automotive Regulatory Credits revenue increased from $1.79 billion in 2023 to $2.76 billion in 2024—a 54% rise—driven by heightened demand for emissions credits as other automakers scale back their electric‑vehicle plans. This growth offset a modest decline in overall automotive sales revenue, which fell 8% to $72.48 billion, primarily due to lower average selling prices and reduced Model 3/Y deliveries, partially mitigated by higher Cybertruck volume and $596 million of FSD revenue. Consequently, the regulatory‑credit segment’s contribution to total automotive revenue expanded, helping to soften the overall revenue dip and supporting the company's broader financial performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP capitalized appraisal drilling costs as part of its successful efforts method of accounting, suspending exploratory well costs on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of economically recoverable reserves. If appraisal drilling and seismic work continued to indicate potential, these costs could remain capitalized for several years. By 2024, COP disclosed that appraisal drilling was complete in certain areas, with costs now being incurred to assess development, while additional appraisal wells were still planned in other areas. This indicates a shift from capitalizing uncertain exploration costs to actively evaluating development feasibility, reflecting a more mature phase in those projects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment of appraisal drilling costs remained consistent under the successful efforts method, with exploratory well costs capitalized as long as sufficient progress was made toward assessing reserves and economic viability. In 2024, $163 million of such costs were capitalized for more than one year (down from $184 million in 2023), and $33 million for one year or less, reflecting a continued practice of suspending costs pending appraisal results. The 2024 disclosures in Note 6 detail the aging of these costs, including $30 million suspended since 2017 or prior and $19 million since 2021–2023, with no material change in capitalization policy. Dry hole expenses were recognized when reserves were not found, and costs were expensed upon abandonment, maintaining consistency with prior years. The company did not alter its capitalization threshold or reporting practices for suspended wells, though the ending balance of capitalized exploratory costs declined due to reclassifications, dry hole charges, and spending.",

      "question": "How has NEE's use of equity units and associated debt instruments through NEECH evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of structure and scale of financing commitments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE had significant commitments tied to natural gas transportation agreements and joint venture obligations, including $415 million in 2022 for firm commitments related to Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, and $610 million in joint obligations between NEECH and NEER. By 2024, NEE had transitioned toward a more structured and larger-scale use of equity units and debentures through NEECH, issuing $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in equity units in June and October 2024, respectively, and later selling $4.5 billion in fixed-rate and $500 million in floating-rate debentures in February 2025. This reflects a strategic shift from project-based commitments to more complex capital market instruments involving NEECH as a financing vehicle.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, NEECH evolved its use of equity-linked financing through structured equity units and associated debt instruments, scaling commitments from $1.5 billion in Series J Debentures (2022), $2.5 billion in Series K Debentures (2023), and $2.0 billion in Series L Debentures (2023), to $5.5 billion in Series M, N, and O Debentures tied to new equity unit offerings in 2022, 2024, and 2024 respectively, while also issuing $1.0 billion in exchangeable senior notes in March 2024. These instruments, initially part of September 2019, February 2020, and September 2020 equity units, involved NEECH issuing undivided beneficial ownership interests in debentures that were guaranteed by NEE and pledged to secure stock purchase obligations, with reset interest rates ranging from 4.255% to 6.30% and maturities extending to 2027–2029. The scale of financing commitments grew significantly, with $2.0 billion in equity units sold in September 2022, $1.5 billion in October 2024, and $2.0 billion in June 2024, each tied to specific debenture series and structured to allow remarketing proceeds to satisfy stock purchase contracts, reflecting a strategic expansion in leveraging debt-backed equity financing to fund capital needs while maintaining NEE’s guarantee support.",

This change was primarily driven by worsening losses in key segments, especially Commercial Airplanes, which faced forward losses on major programs, production disruptions, and grounding-related costs. Defense, Space & Security also experienced increased losses due to unfavorable contract adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "The Core Operating Loss widened dramatically from $1.829 billion in 2023 to $11.811 billion in 2024, reflecting a steep increase in the GAAP loss from operations (from $773 million to $10.707 billion). This surge is driven by reach‑forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, lower aircraft deliveries, production disruptions (including the IAM 751 work stoppage), higher research and development expenses, and unfavorable contract catch‑up adjustments, outweighing modest gains in Global Services. Consequently, the deteriorating Core Operating Loss signals a significant weakening of the company’s underlying operational performance over the 2023‑2024 period.",

      "question": "How has the impact of content amortization on cost of revenues evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Netflix's content investment strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, content amortization was $14,197,437 thousand, and in 2024, it increased to $15,301,517 thousand. This indicates that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, as the cost of amortizing its content library grew year-over-year. The increase in content amortization suggests that Netflix is either producing or licensing more high-cost content, or extending the availability windows of existing content, which results in higher ongoing amortization expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Netflix’s content amortization expense rose from $14.20 billion to $15.30 billion—a $1.10 billion increase. This jump reflects a faster amortization schedule for its growing library of licensed and produced titles, indicating that the company is front‑loading its content spend to secure new productions and maintain a pipeline of fresh programming. Consequently, the higher amortization signals an aggressive investment strategy aimed at expanding its content slate and sustaining subscriber growth.",

This represents a deterioration of 3 percentage points over the two-year period, suggesting weakening demand or operational challenges in the core business despite stable currency impacts and increased acquisitions.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, DHR's Core Sales Growth declined sharply from a 10.0% decrease in 2023 to a 1.5% decrease in 2024, indicating a meaningful improvement in underlying business performance after a severe downturn in 2023. This trend suggests the company is recovering from the pandemic-driven demand collapse (particularly in bioprocessing and diagnostics) and stabilizing its core operations, though growth remains negative.",

This represents a $1.0 billion reduction in exposure to market-based commodity contracts year-over-year. The slight decline suggests a more cautious or strategic adjustment in procurement commitments, potentially reflecting a shift toward more stable or long-term agreements, or a response to market volatility and pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's exposure to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases increased from $13.0 billion of purchase obligations in 2023 to $16.8 billion in 2024, reflecting a higher reliance on third‑party agreements to secure commodity supplies. This rise indicates that ConocoPhillips is expanding its procurement strategy through external market contracts to ensure stable access to commodities amid evolving price and supply conditions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE's equity units carried total annual distribution rates of 4.872% and 5.279%, with debenture interest rates of 2.10% and 1.84%, respectively. By 2024, the distribution rates had increased significantly to 7.299% and 7.234%, with corresponding debenture interest rates rising to 5.15% and 4.635%. This indicates a notable shift in the financial structure of these instruments, reflecting potentially higher financing costs or altered market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, NEE’s equity units (Corporate Units) evolved with distinct debenture terms and distribution rates. In 2022, the Series M debentures carried a 4.60% interest rate, yielding a total annual distribution of 6.926% (4.60% interest + 2.326% stock purchase contract payment). By 2024, the newly issued Series N and O debentures (sold in June and October 2024) featured lower interest rates of 5.15% and 4.635%, respectively, resulting in slightly reduced total annual distributions of 7.299% and 7.234% (combining interest and stock purchase contract payments). The interest rates on these debentures are reset periodically (e.g., Series N resets after December 1, 2026; Series O after May 1, 2027), reflecting market conditions at the time of remarketing. Earlier series, such as Series J (reset to 4.255% in August 2022) and Series K (reset to 6.051% in March 2023), demonstrated prior adjustments to interest rates, but the 2024 issuances marked new benchmarks with lower coupon rates compared to 2022–2023. Thus, while distribution rates remained near 7.2%, the underlying debenture interest rates declined slightly, and structural terms (e.g., maturity dates, reset triggers) were updated to reflect NEECH’s latest financing strategy.",

      "question": "How has AbbVie's treatment of business valuation costs in relation to business combinations evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about their acquisition strategy or accounting practices?",
      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, AbbVie consistently expensed business valuation costs as incurred in connection with business combinations. However, the 2024 disclosure includes a more detailed emphasis on the treatment of contingent consideration liabilities, noting that 'subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.' This evolution in disclosure suggests a more transparent or refined approach to communicating the financial impact of post-acquisition adjustments, potentially indicating a shift toward more complex acquisitions with greater contingent payment structures.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s approach to business valuation costs in relation to business combinations has remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with no material change in how it accounts for acquisition-related expenses. Both years continue to expense business valuation costs, such as due diligence, legal, and advisory fees, as incurred under the acquisition method of accounting, rather than capitalizing them. This reflects a stable accounting practice where such costs are treated as operating expenses, not part of the acquired asset values. The company’s acquisition strategy, particularly its recent purchases like ImmunoGen (February 2024) and Cerevel Therapeutics (August 2024), appears to be executed with a focus on strategic pipeline expansion rather than altering core accounting for acquisition costs. The consistent treatment of these costs underscores a disciplined approach to M&A integration, prioritizing transparency in expense recognition over potential short-term balance sheet impacts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Data Centers segment reported a negative gross margin of $196.0 million, indicating a loss-making position. By 2024, the segment gross margin improved significantly to $487.1 million, showing a turnaround of nearly $683.1 million year-over-year. This indicates that the segment successfully implemented a turnaround strategy, shifting from a cost center to a profit contributor within a single year.",
      "llm_answer": "The year‑over‑year change in AMT’s Data Centers segment gross margin was an increase of $42.5 million (from $487.1 million in 2022 to $534.0 million in 2023), representing a roughly 10 % rise. This improvement in margin signals that the Data Centers segment is progressing with its turnaround strategy, as higher gross margins reflect better cost control and revenue growth that can support future profitability and operational restructuring.",

By 2023, the company's variable-rate debt had shifted significantly to $200 million maturing in 2024, with no debt scheduled for 2025 onward, and the average interest rate increased to 6.0% for 2024. This indicates a substantial reduction in variable-rate debt exposure and a rise in borrowing costs in the later year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, CMCSA’s variable‑rate debt was essentially unchanged in amount ($0.2 billion in 2024) and carried a fixed average interest rate of about 6.0 %. The only new variable‑rate exposure disclosed for 2023 is a $5.2 billion variable‑rate term loan that was fully repaid in December 2023, after which no further variable‑rate principal remains outstanding. Consequently, the composition of variable‑rate debt shifted from a small $0.2 billion balance in 2022 to essentially zero in 2023, with the average rate remaining near 6 % for the period it was outstanding.",

      "llm_answer": "ABBV's investment in R&D as a percentage of net revenues increased significantly from 11% in 2023 to 23% in 2024, reflecting a strategic shift toward innovation. This elevated R&D spending (up 67% year-over-year) demonstrates AbbVie's commitment to advancing its pipeline, particularly in key growth areas like Skyrizi, Rinvoq, and Venclexta, while also funding major acquisitions such as ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics. The increased R&D intensity underscores a clear strategic focus on sustaining long-term growth through scientific innovation rather than relying on legacy products like Humira.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the residual growth rates for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were aligned with brand operating plans and approximated expected long-term category market growth rates. By 2024, the residual growth rates remained conceptually similar but were now explicitly stated to depend on additional factors such as grooming habit changes and sustained deceleration in category growth. This evolution in assumptions reflects increased sensitivity to market dynamics, which contributed to the $1.3 billion impairment charge recorded in 2024 due to a higher discount rate, currency devaluation, and restructuring impacts. The 2024 analysis also introduced a more explicit sensitivity to a 25 basis-point decrease in residual growth rates, indicating a heightened risk of future impairment.",
      "llm_answer": "The assumptions for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset remained largely consistent between 2023 and 2024, with the key changes being a higher discount rate and weaker foreign currencies (particularly in Argentina and Nigeria) that reduced the estimated fair value. This led to a $1.3 billion non-cash impairment charge in 2024 (reducing the carrying value to $12.8 billion), driven by adverse macroeconomic conditions and a new restructuring program. The impairment risk persists, as future declines in residual growth rates, further currency devaluation, or market contraction could trigger additional impairments.",

This indicates a deliberate and consistent strategy to enhance shareholder returns through a growing ordinary dividend as part of its three-tier capital return framework. The upward trajectory in dividend payments aligns with the company's commitment to delivering value to shareholders through a more structured and progressive dividend policy.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, ConocoPhillips increased its ordinary dividend per share from $1.89 to $2.52, reflecting a deliberate upward trend in shareholder returns. This progression, coupled with the company's $9 billion capital return framework and ongoing share repurchases, indicates a strategic emphasis on returning cash to shareholders while maintaining flexibility through mechanisms such as the Variable Return of Capital (VROC).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the net carrying amount of acquired trade secrets and processes was $0.3 million, while by 2024 it had decreased to $0, indicating that the full gross carrying amount of $27.6 million was completely amortized by 2024. This shows that Starbucks fully amortized this asset over the two-year period, suggesting a consistent and complete write-down of this finite-lived intangible asset.",
      "llm_answer": "The net carrying amount of acquired trade secrets and processes declined from $0.3 million (Oct 2 2022) to $0 million (Oct 2 2023) and remained $0 million as of Sep 29 2024, indicating that the intangible asset was fully amortized and no remaining balance exists. This reflects Starbucks’ practice of amortizing such finite‑lived trade secrets and processes over a short period, resulting in complete expense recognition within a year of acquisition.",

      "question": "How has Duke Energy's financial commitment to Piedmont evolved between 2022 and 2024, based on changes in lease terms and remaining performance obligations?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had an operating lease with Piedmont with a weighted average remaining lease term of 5 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.6%. By 2024, Duke Energy disclosed that its total remaining performance obligations for Piedmont amounted to $405 million, with $64 million due in 2025 and decreasing annually until $151 million in 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from a short-term lease-based relationship to a more structured, multi-year financial commitment with defined performance obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Duke Energy’s financial commitment to Piedmont has declined materially over the three‑year period.  In the 2022 10‑K, Piedmont’s operating‑lease payment schedule shows $5 million in 2022, $5 million in 2023 and $5 million in 2024, while the 2024 filing reflects only $5 million in 2025 (and $5 million thereafter), indicating that the company’s remaining lease obligations tied to Piedmont have been reduced to a single $5 million payment in 2025 and no further commitments thereafter.  Correspondingly, the consolidated VIE disclosures show Piedmont’s retained interest in sold receivables falling from $150 million (2023) to $208 million (2023) and then to $‑ (no balance) in 2024, and the “Remaining Performance Obligations” table for Piedmont drops from $64 million (2025) and $51 million (2026) in 2023 to $‑ (no amounts listed) in the 2024 schedule.  These trends demonstrate a clear reduction in both lease exposure and remaining performance obligations for Piedmont between 2022 and 2024.",

      "question": "How did Mondelēz International's treatment and disclosure of contingent consideration adjustments evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of their inclusion in non-GAAP financial measures and specific financial impact in 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Mondelēz explicitly excluded contingent consideration adjustments from its non-GAAP financial measures, noting in the footnotes that these adjustments were added to the non-GAAP definitions starting in the third quarter of 2021 to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance. By 2024, the company not only continued to exclude these adjustments from non-GAAP metrics but also provided a concrete financial figure—$60 million in contingent consideration adjustments were excluded in 2023 as part of the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. This shows that while the policy of exclusion remained consistent, the company evolved its reporting by quantifying the impact of these adjustments in 2024, offering greater transparency into their financial effect.",
      "llm_answer": "Mondelēz International began including acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments in its non‑GAAP Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS measures starting in 2022, and continued this treatment through 2023. In 2023, these items contributed a $0.14 per share increase to Adjusted EPS and added $0.09 million (or $0.09 billion) to Adjusted Operating Income, reflecting their growing impact on the company’s disclosed non‑GAAP financial results.",

By 2024, this amount had increased to $48 million, indicating a significant growth in the financial benefits derived from the licensing arrangement.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AFFO (common stockholders) was defined as Consolidated AFFO excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in Consolidated AFFO. By 2024, the definition of AFFO (common stockholders) expanded to include adjustments for discontinued operations, in addition to noncontrolling interests, indicating a broader reconciliation that now incorporates the impact of discontinued operations on both Nareit FFO and the corresponding adjustments. This reflects a shift in how the company accounts for structural changes in its operations when presenting AFFO to investors.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the Company’s AFFO (common stockholders) has been presented as a subset of Consolidated AFFO that excludes the impact of noncontrolling interests, while Consolidated AFFO includes those interests in its calculation. The definition of AFFO (common stockholders) remains consistent with the prior periods – it is Consolidated AFFO adjusted for noncontrolling interests – but its presentation now explicitly isolates the equity‑holder portion, making the relationship between AFFO (common stockholders) and Consolidated AFFO clearer. Consequently, while the underlying methodology for AFFO has not changed, its disclosure now more directly ties the metric to the common‑stockholder level by removing noncontrolling interest effects.",

This represents an increase of over $1.1 billion in amortization costs year-over-year.

      "llm_answer": "The company’s content amortization expense increased from $14.2 billion in 2023 to $15.3 billion in 2024, reflecting a higher pace of content spending and a faster amortization schedule (the assets are typically amortized over 4 years on an accelerated basis). This rise indicates that Netflix is accelerating its investment in new titles and front‑loading the expense to capture early viewership, while also monetizing its library through longer‑term licensing and production commitments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast used its three Cable Communications divisions as the unit of account for testing the impairment of cable franchise rights and performed either qualitative or quantitative assessments annually or more frequently if there were substantive changes in circumstances. By 2024, the company continued to perform annual impairment testing as of July 1 and maintained the use of qualitative assessments first, but placed more emphasis on periodic quantitative assessments to support qualitative conclusions. Additionally, in 2024, the company explicitly referenced the discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and also considered earnings multiples from comparable companies and recent transactions, suggesting a more detailed and market-informed approach compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 Comcast’s cable‑franchise‑rights intangibles have been evaluated primarily with **qualitative** impairment reviews. The 2022 quantitative test (performed roughly every four years) showed fair values well above carrying amounts, and the 2023‑2024 assessments relied on those prior quantitative results together with updated cash‑flow forecasts, market conditions, discount‑rate changes and macro‑economic trends to conclude that impairment testing was unnecessary. Consequently, **no quantitative assessment was required in 2023 or 2024**, and the company continues to use the same qualitative‑first approach for its cable‑franchise rights.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment of $(3) million, indicating a slight negative adjustment. However, in 2024, this figure shifted significantly to $(28) million, showing a much stronger negative impact on the company's financials. This indicates that AIG's claims management or reserving practices may have faced unforeseen challenges in 2024, leading to a larger-than-expected increase in loss adjustment expenses from prior years.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior‑year development improved markedly from 2023 to 2024, falling from **$57 million** in 2023 to **$13 million** in 2024. This reduction signals that the company’s claims‑management and reserving practices are becoming more efficient, as the amount of unallocated loss adjustment expense required to settle prior‑year claims is declining.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Danaher evaluated the collectability of receivables based on a combination of financial and qualitative factors, including customers' financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, and credit bureau information. By 2024, the company maintained a similar framework but placed a more explicit emphasis on 'past payment experience' as a core component of its credit risk assessment, suggesting a strategic refinement in prioritizing historical payment behavior in determining creditworthiness. This shift indicates a more focused approach on behavioral data in managing credit risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2023 and 2024 SEC 10-K filings, Danaher's methodology for evaluating accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts has remained consistent in its core approach but shows increased emphasis on forward-looking economic monitoring. The company continues to assess customer credit risk using a combination of financial and qualitative factors—including financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, historical payment experience, and credit bureau information—to estimate expected credit losses. While the 2023 filing (page 67) notes the allowance reflects \"best estimate of expected future losses\" and requires ongoing monitoring of economic conditions, the 2024 filing (page 65) explicitly states the allowance \"reflects the Company's best estimate of the expected future losses for its accounts receivable; however, these estimates may change and future actual losses may differ\" and emphasizes that the Company \"will continue to monitor economic conditions and will revise the estimates... as necessary.\" This indicates an evolution toward more proactive, condition-responsive adjustments rather than a fundamental methodological shift.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and disclosure around definite-life intangible assets evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly regarding impairment testing and amortization policies?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ disclosed that definite-life intangible assets were evaluated for impairment in the same manner as other long-lived assets and that amortization occurred over their estimated useful lives. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include specific details about impairment testing, such as performing undiscounted operating cash flow analyses at the lowest identifiable asset group level and calculating impairment losses as the excess of an asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows or expected proceeds less disposal costs. This evolution indicates a more detailed and structured approach to impairment evaluation in 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the treatment of definite‑life intangible assets remained consistent: they are amortized on a straight‑line basis over their estimated useful lives and tested for impairment whenever conditions indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable, using undiscounted cash‑flow analyses and fair‑value estimates based on discounted cash flows, royalty‑relief or excess‑earnings methods. The key evolution is the increased reliance on quantitative impairment testing for these assets and the more detailed disclosure of the valuation techniques (e.g., relief‑from‑royalty, excess‑earnings, excess‑margin) used to estimate fair value, reflecting a tighter linkage between impairment reviews and the company’s ongoing assessment of market conditions and forecasted cash flows.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Veralto Distribution contributed approximately $2.6 billion in cash to Danaher, a portion of which was used to redeem certain outstanding indebtedness. By 2024, the distribution had a residual impact on accumulated comprehensive income, with a reported $974 million credit to the Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) account as part of the comprehensive income reconciliation. This indicates that while the immediate liquidity benefit was realized in 2023, the 2024 figures reflect the ongoing financial restructuring and capital optimization effects of the distribution, particularly in terms of balance sheet adjustments and long-term investment positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the Veralto Distribution on Danaher's comprehensive income shows a significant shift: the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component related to Veralto was $974 million at the end of 2023, but by the end of 2024 it had been fully reclassified to earnings and reduced to $0 in the consolidated balance sheet, reflecting that the distribution's comprehensive income effects were fully recognized in 2023 and no longer impact future periods. This indicates that the long‑term financial implications of the distribution are now settled, with no residual comprehensive income exposure remaining and only ongoing operational impacts (such as tax rate changes) affecting future earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had a $400 million unsecured debt issuance linked to Piedmont. By 2024, this relationship had transformed from a debt-based connection to one involving performance obligations, with Duke disclosing a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations related to Piedmont, spread across 2025 through 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from direct debt financing to contractual performance-based financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed debt maturities and performance commitments across the 2022–2024 filings, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont has evolved through increased long-term debt obligations and structured performance commitments. Specifically, Piedmont's remaining performance obligations under its natural gas contracts total $405 million (spanning 2025–2029+), with $64 million remaining in 2025 alone, reflecting sustained contractual commitments. Concurrently, Duke Energy's debt maturities show Piedmont's portion of long-term debt declining from $45 million in 2022 to $205 million in 2025 (as per page 176), while its subsidiaries (e.g., Duke Energy Ohio and Indiana) executed new term loan facilities in 2021 to manage liquidity, indirectly supporting Piedmont's financial structure through shared credit arrangements and receivables sales programs. The data indicates a strategic shift toward longer-term, regulated performance obligations for Piedmont, aligned with Duke Energy's broader debt refinancing and revenue recognition practices.",

This tripling of financial resources indicates a significant shift in strategic focus toward the segment, highlighting its growing importance in the company's portfolio and suggesting an intent to expand its capabilities or market presence.",

This increase reflects a deliberate expansion of cost‑reduction initiatives within the segment, underscoring that the Measurement & Analytical business was viewed as a strategic priority for operational efficiency and margin improvement during the period.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, mainly due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This reflects a significant reversal in the trend, moving from a modest improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate declined 85 basis points in fiscal 2023 but rose 20 basis points in fiscal 2024. The 2023 drop was driven mainly by inventory markdowns, higher supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges, while the 2024 increase resulted from lapping prior‑year markdowns and price management that offset shifts toward lower‑margin product mixes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DD&A expenses had a negative impact on COP's earnings, primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions resulting from increased costs and higher overall production volumes. This contributed to a net income (loss) decrease of $7,723 million. By 2024, DD&A expenses were reported at $9,599 million, up from $8,270 million in 2023, indicating a continued rise in these costs. While the explicit negative impact was not reiterated in 2024, the increase in absolute dollar terms suggests that DD&A remained a growing pressure point for the company, likely tied to sustained high production volumes and ongoing reserve adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) on ConocoPhillips’ financial performance evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024, reflecting both higher production volumes and updated reserve valuations. In 2024, DD&A expenses increased by $1,329 million compared to 2023, primarily due to higher volumes in the Lower 48 and Canada segments, higher DD&A rates in Alaska and the Lower 48 from downward reserve revisions, and the acquisition of Marathon Oil. This rise in DD&A, alongside a $1,058 million increase in production and operating expenses and a $1,963 million decline in purchased commodities due to lower commodity prices, contributed to a $1,396 million decrease in total sales and other operating revenues. Despite these pressures, the company maintained production growth of 9% year-over-year (1,987 MBOED in 2024 vs. 1,826 MBOED in 2023), driven by new wells and strategic acquisitions. The upward trend in DD&A thus signals a cost structure increasingly burdened by reserve depreciation amid lower commodity prices and expanded operations, while also highlighting the company’s reliance on volume growth to offset price headwinds.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast primarily used a discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and market participant estimates of future cash flows, supported by internal forecasts, to estimate fair value for impairment testing of owned content. By 2024, the company continued to assess fair value using Level 3 inputs, but with a more detailed emphasis on market participant estimates of future cash flows and a more structured approach to impairment assessments, including evaluating content either individually or in identified film groups depending on monetization strategy. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced explanation of impairment triggers, including events or changes in circumstances known or knowable as of the balance sheet date, and clarified the treatment of abandoned content, which is now recorded as substantively abandoned in programming and production costs. This represents a moderate transformation in methodology and specificity.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Comcast’s impairment testing for owned content remained focused on evaluating fair value on an individual title basis for the substantial majority of owned content, with licensed content generally tested at the channel, network, or platform level (except broadcast networks and local stations, which use dayparts). The methodology for estimating fair value consistently relied on Level 3 inputs, particularly discounted cash flow analyses incorporating market participant estimates of future cash flows and internal forecasts, though the documentation does not indicate a material change in this approach. The level of specificity in assessments stayed aligned with prior practice: owned content was assessed individually or in identified film groups, while licensed content was tested at broader distribution or platform levels, with no significant evolution in the basis for fair value estimation observed across the 2022–2024 filings.",

      "question": "How did Starbucks' approach to restructuring and impairments evolve between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, particularly in terms of financial impact and strategic focus?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Starbucks recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to its Reinvention Plan, which focused on increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Additionally, the company had completed a prior restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 that included $155.4 million in restructuring and impairments, primarily from store closures and lease-related costs. By fiscal 2024, Starbucks reported no restructuring and impairments charges, in contrast to fiscal 2023, which had a $1.1 million charge. This indicates a reduction in impairment activity and a stabilization of restructuring efforts following the earlier strategic changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2024, Starbucks’ restructuring and impairment approach shifted from significant, pandemic-related store closures and asset impairments in 2021–2022 (e.g., $155.4M in restructuring/impairments in 2021) to a more strategic, growth-focused model emphasizing operational efficiency and reinvention rather than large-scale impairments. While fiscal 2024 saw no major impairment charges tied to restructuring (unlike the $53.1M store asset impairment and $89.5M lease acceleration in 2021), the company continued to manage costs through targeted investments in wages, technology, and store optimization, with impairment evaluations now primarily tied to store-level cash flow projections and long-lived asset recoverability. Financially, this evolved into a focus on capital allocation for growth (e.g., $2.7B invested in fiscal 2024 vs. $2.3B in 2023) and shareholder returns ($2.6B dividends/repurchases in 2024), while maintaining sufficient liquidity through $3B credit facilities and $3.8B cash reserves. The strategic shift reflects a move from reactive cost-cutting to proactive investment in core operations and international expansion, with minimal goodwill or asset impairments anticipated absent major market disruptions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT amortized its acquired intangible assets, including tenant-related intangibles, on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of 15 years. By 2024, the company extended the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, aligning them more closely with the 30-year estimated useful life of tower assets. This change in accounting estimate, effective January 1, 2024, led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $730 million for the year. The evolution reflects a strategic shift in how the company accounts for and values tenant-related intangibles in relation to long-term tower asset utilization.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, AMT revised its accounting for tenant-related intangibles by extending the estimated useful lives of tower assets from a shorter of lease term or residual value to a full 30-year straight-line depreciation (and amortization for related intangibles), reflecting over 20 years of operating history. This change, effective January 1, 2024, increased the right-of-use asset and reduced depreciation/amortization expense, with the company stating the extension was based on historical operating experience and resulted in a $730 million ($649 million after tax) decrease in amortization expense for 2024. The amortization methodology remains straight-line, but the asset life assumption was lengthened.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that deferred cloud implementation costs were amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected hosting arrangement term once the software was placed into service, with amortization reflected alongside associated cloud hosting fees in other operations and maintenance expenses. These costs were included in other deferred charges and assets on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2024, the company noted that amortization of these costs was immaterial for Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of accounting treatment in 2022 to a more specific, quantitative assessment of materiality across subsidiaries by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Southern Company began deferring cloud‑implementation costs in 2023 and, by the end of 2024, reported $321 million of such costs (down from $325 million in 2023), which are amortized straight‑line over the remaining hosting‑arrangement term and reflected in other operations‑and‑maintenance expense; Alabama Power and Georgia Power disclose amortization of $17 million and $22 million respectively for 2024, while Mississippi Power, Southern Power and Southern Company Gas show immaterial amounts.  The treatment is consistent across subsidiaries—costs are capitalized, amortized on a straight‑line basis over the expected term (including renewal options), and disclosed in the balance‑sheet line “Deferred cloud implementation costs, net of amortization,” with the amortization expense disclosed in the statements of income.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ excluded contingent consideration adjustments from their Adjusted Operating Income as part of a list of exclusions that also included items like Simplify to Grow Program impacts and intangible asset impairments. By 2024, the company began disclosing specific contingent consideration adjustments within their Adjusted EPS reconciliation, with a reported impact of $(60) million in 2023 related to acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. This represents a shift from general exclusion to explicit quantification and inclusion in adjusted financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MDLZ's treatment of contingent consideration adjustments shifted from being excluded from Adjusted EPS calculations in 2022 (as shown in the 2022 10-K on page 75, where \"Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments\" reduced Adjusted EPS by $0.02) to being explicitly included as a component of Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS metrics in 2023 and 2024 disclosures (e.g., page 47 of the 2024 10-K, where \"Acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments\" contributed $0.14 to Adjusted EPS in 2023 and $0.05 in 2022, with constant currency Adjusted EPS increasing by $0.54 in 2023). This evolution reflects a consistent inclusion of these adjustments in non-GAAP metrics to enhance comparability of underlying operating performance, with contingent consideration adjustments now regularly factored into both Adjusted Operating Income (as a $112 million driver of constant currency growth in 2023) and Adjusted EPS (contributing to the $0.41 increase in Adjusted EPS from 2022 to 2023).",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This reflects a significant shift in the trajectory of the Gross Profit Rate, moving from a period of improvement in 2022 to a decline in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points in fiscal 2024 (from 23.5 % to 23.7 %) after a decline of 85 basis points in fiscal 2023, meaning the 2024 rate is higher than the 2023 rate. The key drivers were: for 2024, price management that aligned with competitive historic gaps and the lap‑up of higher prior‑year markdowns, partially offset by a shift toward lower‑margin product categories; for 2023, elevated inventory markdowns, higher supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges drove the decrease.",

This significant increase suggests a stronger emphasis on leveraging U.S.-based production for international markets, aligning with the company's broader strategy of capitalizing on global growth opportunities, particularly in emerging markets across Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East/Africa.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson's U.S. exports grew 26% year-over-year in 2024, rising from $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion, and represented a key driver of its 15% overall sales increase, with underlying international destination sales up 9% and U.S. exports up 26% compared to 2023. This growth reflects the success of Emerson's international sales strategy, particularly in emerging markets, and underscores the strong performance of its global operations, including the integration of the Test & Measurement acquisition which contributed significantly to international sales expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, which increased to 37% in fiscal 2024. This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on cloud-based offerings and aligns with Oracle's corporate strategy of providing customer choice in deployment models. The increase suggests a successful pivot toward cloud adoption, with customer demand for Oracle Cloud Services rising and a corresponding decline in reliance on traditional revenue streams such as hardware and on-premise licenses.",
      "llm_answer": "The proportion of Oracle's cloud services revenues relative to total revenues increased from 25% in fiscal 2022 to 32% in fiscal 2023 and further to 37% in fiscal 2024. This upward shift indicates that Oracle is successfully expanding its cloud‑based offerings and expects the trend to continue, positioning cloud as an increasingly larger driver of overall revenue growth. Strategically, the company is allocating more resources to cloud infrastructure and R&D, aiming to capture higher‑margin recurring revenue streams and sustain long‑term profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, CMCSA recognized licensed content costs by capitalizing them when the license period began, the content was made available for use, and the costs were known, with amortization occurring as the associated programs were broadcast. Additionally, licensed content was tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network, or platform basis, except for broadcast networks and local stations, which were tested on a daypart basis. By 2024, the company maintained the capitalization criteria but refined the amortization methodology by incorporating 'estimated viewing patterns' into the process. Also in 2024, CMCSA explicitly classified licensed content as noncurrent assets under 'film and television costs' and clarified that production costs incurred in advance of airing are included in licensed content. The 2024 filing also introduced more detailed descriptions of co-financing arrangements and tax incentives, which were absent in 2022. These changes indicate a more nuanced and structured approach to licensed content asset management and cost recognition over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the treatment and recognition of Licensed Content Costs evolved in the following ways: (1) Licensed content is now capitalized when the license period begins and the content is made available for use, with amortization based on estimated viewing patterns rather than a fixed window; (2) The amortization methodology shifted to use individual title or channel/platform-based assessment for impairment testing, with licensed content tested primarily on a channel, network, or platform basis (except broadcast networks tested on a daypart basis); (3) The classification of licensed content remains within \"film and television costs\" as a noncurrent asset, but amortization is now tied to usage patterns and relative value of deliverables (e.g., sports rights recognized as executory contracts without impairment); (4) Capitalized licensed content amortization is reported in programming and production costs, with impairment charges recorded against unamortized costs if fair value declines below book value, using Level 3 inputs like discounted cash flows. These changes reflect a more granular, usage-driven approach to amortization and impairment assessment compared to the 2022 methodology.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed that its expected long-term rate of return assumptions were based on future expectations for returns by asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. By 2024, the company clarified that it actively rebalances the plans' investments specifically when they fall outside the target allocation ranges, indicating a more defined and action-oriented approach to asset management. This reflects a shift from a general disclosure of rebalancing practices to a more prescriptive and rule-based strategy tied directly to the target ranges.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures, the role of Target Allocation Ranges in managing defined benefit plan investments remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with no indication of structural change in the ranges themselves. The 2024 ranges (60%-75% fixed income/cash for U.S. plans, 75%-85% for U.S. retiree health, 60%-100% fixed income for non-U.S.) closely mirrored the 2023 ranges (65%-80% fixed income for U.S., 75%-85% for retiree health, 60%-100% for non-U.S.), reflecting a continued strategy to align asset allocation with liability sensitivity through periodic rebalancing when investments fall outside these targets. The weighted average allocations as of December 31, 2024, (61% fixed income, 39% equity for U.S. plans; 77% fixed income, 23% equity for non-U.S.) remained within the specified ranges, demonstrating that the Target Allocation Ranges functioned as intended to guide and maintain disciplined investment mixing without deviation.",

In 2024, this figure changed significantly to a negative impact of $28 million. This represents a substantial reduction in the magnitude of prior year development, suggesting that AIG's reserving practices may have become more accurate or that claims settlements for prior years were more favorable than previously estimated.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior‑year development improved markedly from a $57 million outflow in 2023 to only $13 million in 2024, indicating that the company’s claims‑management and reserving practices are becoming more efficient and that the need for additional reserve releases is declining.

However, this consistency occurred in the context of a significant shift in total sales growth performance—implying a growing relative influence of currency effects as overall growth slowed. In 2023, the company experienced total sales growth of 1.5%, with currency exchange rates contributing positively at 1.0%. In contrast, by 2024, total sales growth turned into a decline of 2.0%, while the currency impact remained unchanged at 1.0%. This suggests that despite the company's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations remaining constant, the importance of this factor in the broader context of sales performance increased as overall growth weakened.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth was 1.5% in 2024 (compared with –% in 2023), indicating that foreign‑exchange movements contributed positively to sales growth in 2024 after being neutral the prior year.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported $2.3 billion in structural cost savings realized during the year, contributing to a cumulative total of $9.7 billion since 2019. These savings were attributed to increased operational efficiencies, reduced staffing costs, and initiatives such as supply chain optimization and improved maintenance. By 2024, the company formalized 'Structural Cost Savings' as a defined earnings driver, explicitly incorporating it into its financial reporting framework to provide greater transparency into its cost management performance. This shift indicates that XOM elevated structural cost savings from an internal efficiency metric to a strategic financial reporting category, aligning it with other key earnings drivers like advantaged volume growth and base volume. The change reflects a broader strategic emphasis on sustaining cost discipline as a core component of earnings power.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's structural cost savings accelerated from $2.3 billion realized in 2023 to an estimated $12.1 billion cumulative savings by 2024, reflecting sustained operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and divestment‑related cuts that are now embedded in its cost base. This progression demonstrates a deliberate, long‑term cost‑management strategy that prioritizes disciplined expense control and efficiency gains to enhance earnings resilience across volatile commodity cycles.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's relationship with Piedmont was characterized by an allocation of 4% of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets, indicating a relatively minor role in the company's pension and post-retirement benefit structure. By 2024, Piedmont had a significantly different profile in Duke Energy's disclosures, with a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations attributed to it, showing a growing financial commitment or operational involvement with Piedmont. This evolution reflects a shift from a minor stakeholder role in retirement funding to a more substantial contractual obligation.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont evolved through its allocation of assets and performance obligations within the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. In 2021, Piedmont was allocated approximately 4% of the Trust's assets (Page 225), and by 2024, its share of the target asset allocation remained consistent at 4% for the \"Years ending December 31\" schedule (Page 225), indicating stable but minimal involvement. The Trust's shift to a 60% liability-hedging and 40% return-seeking asset allocation effective January 1, 2022 (Page 228), further structured Piedmont's proportional exposure to these asset classes, though Piedmont's specific performance obligations were not detailed beyond its minor share of the overall portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company amortized tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with a weighted average amortization period of 15 years as of December 31, 2023. These intangibles were directly tied to tenant contracts and relationships at the time of acquisition. By 2024, the company's disclosures expanded to emphasize a more detailed impairment review process for tenant-related intangibles, assessing them on a tenant-by-tenant basis for indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or customer financial instability. The company also began determining recoverability based on projected undiscounted future cash flows and measuring impairment losses using discounted cash flows or market data. This marks a shift from a purely amortization-focused approach to a more dynamic model involving periodic impairment assessments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the Company refined its assessment of tenant-related intangibles by extending the estimated useful lives of tower assets and related intangibles from 20 to 30 years (effective January 1 2024) and revising asset‑retirement‑obligation settlement dates based on 20 years of operating history, which increased the recorded obligations and reduced accretion expense. Additionally, impairment reviews for tenant‑related intangibles continue to be performed on a tenant‑by‑tenant basis, using projected undiscounted cash flows to test recoverability and measuring any impairment loss against discounted cash flows or fair‑value estimates.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the change in fair value of contingent consideration for Skyrizi reflected higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. By 2023, the change in fair value again reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales, but this was driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time in combination with lower discount rates. This indicates a more favorable outlook for Skyrizi sales in 2023 compared to 2022 due to improved market dynamics and a decrease in discount rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Skyrizi's estimated sales increased by 84% in 2021 and 84% in 2022 (reflecting strong market share growth and uptake), but the provided financial documents do not include specific sales figures for 2023. However, the document indicates that Skyrizi's net revenues increased 51% in 2023 (as stated in the product performance discussion on page 61), driven by continued strong market share uptake and market growth across all indications, partially offset by unfavorable pricing. This growth occurred despite the broader context of Humira's decline due to biosimilar competition, suggesting Skyrizi's market outlook remained robust but faced pricing pressures.",

This significant drop indicates a reduction in operational efficiency or increased costs relative to sales, despite growth in total sales from $3,648 million in 2023 to projected $5,399 million in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The Adjusted EBITA margin improved from 24.6 % in 2022 to 25.4 % in 2023—a 0.8‑percentage‑point increase—indicating that the company’s operations became more efficient, generating a higher proportion of earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization relative to sales.

In 2024 the company continued to invest in Surmont, reporting $81 million of bitumen production and advancing development plans such as first production from Pad 104 in 2025, while also recognizing $158 million of contingent consideration payments under the acquisition‑related arrangement.  The company’s financial commitment to Surmont was further underscored by its $3.0 billion cash outlay (including $320 million of contingent consideration) and the subsequent allocation of $3,082 million to oil‑and‑gas properties, as disclosed in the 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that its regional office leases had termination dates ranging from 2023 to 2028. By 2024, the company reported that the termination dates for these office leases now extend from 2025 to 2034. This indicates a multi-year extension in lease commitments, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term occupancy agreements for office spaces.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, SPG's fixed annual rental payment obligations under office leases are projected to increase annually through 2029. Specifically, future minimum lease payments for office leases are $36,358 in 2025, $36,372 in 2026, $36,401 in 2027, $36,427 in 2028, $36,458 in 2029, and $923,037 thereafter (totaling $1,105,053 excluding discounting). The weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases is approximately 32 years, with a weighted-average discount rate of 5.32% as of December 31, 2024. These obligations are part of the company's operating lease commitments, which include fixed annual rental payments for ground and office leases extending through 2090, with escalation clauses applying to some agreements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde stated that environmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant and anticipated that future annual expenditures would remain similar to 2021 levels unless there were significant regulatory changes. By 2024, the company reiterated that environmental protection costs for that year were not significant and expected future expenditures to remain consistent with 2024 levels, barring major regulatory shifts. This indicates that Linde's approach to environmental compliance has remained stable over the three-year period, with no substantial increase in spending anticipated despite growing global emphasis on climate change mitigation and stricter environmental regulations in key markets like the EU, U.S., and China.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde’s reported environmental protection costs remained relatively modest and were not quantified as a distinct line item, but the company consistently characterized such expenditures as “not significant” and anticipated they would remain comparable to prior‑year levels.  In its 2022 filing, Linde noted that environmental protection costs were not material and that future annual outlays would be “similar to 2021” subject to regulatory changes, while the 2024 filing reiterated that environmental expenditures are not expected to have a material adverse effect on financial position or results of operations.  This indicates that Linde treats environmental compliance spending as a routine, manageable cost—monitoring it closely, integrating it into long‑term planning, and expecting it to stay relatively stable rather than escalating sharply.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $8.50, which decreased to $7.64 in 2023—a drop of $0.86 or 10%. This decline occurred alongside a constant currency adjustment of -6% in 2023, suggesting that foreign exchange rates were not the primary driver of the drop. Instead, the decrease indicates a deliberate shift in pricing strategy, potentially to attract more subscribers in emerging markets where affordability is a key factor. This aligns with Netflix's broader strategic pivot toward global expansion and subscriber growth over short-term revenue per user, as evidenced by the significant increase in paid net membership additions from 5,391 thousand in 2022 to 7,315 thousand in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Netflix’s average monthly revenue per paying membership from 2022 to 2023 reflects a modest 1% decline in ARPU, driven primarily by a higher proportion of new members in lower‑priced international markets and limited price increases, even as overall membership growth accelerated. Constant‑currency analysis shows that, after adjusting for foreign‑exchange effects, ARPU actually rose about 6% year‑over‑year, indicating that the core pricing strategy remained stable while the revenue mix shifted toward higher‑growth but lower‑priced regions.",

By 2024, this figure had changed to -$28 million, indicating a significant negative adjustment. This shift from a small positive adjustment to a substantial negative one suggests that AIG may have revised its prior estimates downward in 2024, reflecting either improved claims resolution or a reassessment of loss reserves that year.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior‑year development improved markedly from 2023 to 2024, falling from $57 million (page 209) to $13 million (page 158). This reduction signals that AIG’s claims‑management and reserving practices are becoming more efficient, with lower development on prior‑year unallocated loss adjustment expenses.",

By 2024, this decline had improved substantially to (1.5)%. This marks a notable improvement in the company's core sales trend, suggesting stabilization or recovery in its primary business operations during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The core sales decline improved markedly from a steep 10.0% drop in 2023 to a much smaller 1.5% decline in 2024, indicating that Danaher's underlying business performance is stabilizing after a period of significant contraction. This improvement suggests that the company is emerging from the weak demand and inventory corrections that drove the 2023 decline, particularly in its Biotechnology segment, and is beginning to see modest core revenue stability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Properties, Plant and Equipment had a net deferred tax liability value of $20,303 million, showing an increase from $18,295 million in 2022, indicating a growing asset base. By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted focus from quantitative values to a more qualitative discussion around impairment risks and dependencies on uncertain assumptions. Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized the sensitivity of Properties, Plant and Equipment valuations to volatile factors such as future commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes. This reflects a strategic shift from reporting stable asset growth to highlighting increased exposure to external risks and uncertainties, particularly in the context of the energy transition and potential impairments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the treatment of Properties, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) in the tax context shifted toward greater reliance on deferred tax liabilities tied to PP&E, which rose from $18,295 million (2022) to $20,303 million (2023), reflecting increased tax bases for those assets. Impairment considerations were highlighted in the 2024 discussion of PP&E, noting that impairment reviews are triggered by events such as significant reserve reductions, commodity‑price declines, or regulatory changes, and that any impairment charge would be recorded when carrying value exceeds recoverable amounts. Valuation of PP&E for tax purposes remains dependent on assumptions about future cash flows, commodity prices, carbon costs, and the pace of the energy transition, all of which influence both impairment testing and the recoverability of associated deferred tax assets.",

By 2024, the relationship evolved from a simple stake to a more significant contractual and performance-based obligation, with Duke Energy disclosing a total remaining performance obligation related to Piedmont of $405 million. This indicates a substantial deepening of the financial relationship, shifting from a minor equity stake to a major contractual commitment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed metrics in the provided 10-K pages, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont evolved from 2023 to 2024 as follows: Piedmont's severance-related expenses increased from $2 million in 2022 to $2 million in 2023 (with a $1 million provision/adjustment in 2023), while its remaining performance obligations under contracts totaled $405 million as of 2024, reflecting ongoing contractual commitments in its natural gas and infrastructure operations. Additionally, Piedmont's net assets were reported at $101 million as of December 31, 2023, and $15 million as of December 31, 2024, indicating a stable but modest financial footprint within Duke Energy's consolidated structure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group emphasized that premium revenues from risk-based products comprised nearly 80% of total consolidated revenues, with Optum Health negotiating value-based arrangements where it received a fixed percentage of third-party payers' premiums to cover defined portions of medical costs. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, noting that value-based arrangements at Optum Health involve receiving per-patient per-month premiums under single performance obligations, where revenues are recognized as health care services are made available. This evolution indicates a more structured and service-linked approach to value-based premium revenue recognition over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group’s premium revenue composition shifted toward value‑based arrangements, with premiums from risk‑based contracts still representing roughly 80% of total revenue but increasingly driven by per‑member per‑month payments tied to outcomes. The company’s medical‑cost payable estimates and related risk assumptions were refined each period using actuarial trend factors and completion‑factor adjustments, reflecting a continued emphasis on managing medical‑cost exposure within its value‑based and risk‑adjusted contracts.",

By 2024, the company exceeded this target, reporting an Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity of 105%. This evolution suggests an improvement in the company's ability to generate cash relative to its net earnings, surpassing its own long-term benchmark. The increase from the targeted 90% to an actual 105% reflects enhanced efficiency in converting earnings into cash, despite the inclusion of significant non-cash charges such as the Gillette intangible asset impairment and foreign currency translation losses.",
      "llm_answer": "Procter & Gamble’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity rose from 105% in fiscal 2024 to 93% in fiscal 2022 (the only years with explicit productivity figures disclosed), indicating that the company’s cash generation is increasingly covering its net earnings after adjusting for the non‑cash Gillette impairment and foreign‑currency translation charges.

      "question": "How did the valuation methodology and disclosure around Texas Instruments' nonmarketable investments evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to reporting these assets?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, reported under 'Other measurement basis' in the investment table. By 2024, the company no longer provided a specific dollar value for nonmarketable investments but instead elaborated on the valuation methodology, stating that these investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. This shift indicates a move from quantitative disclosure to qualitative explanation without updating the specific value, suggesting a more opaque but methodologically clarified approach to reporting these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "The valuation methodology for Texas Instruments' nonmarketable investments remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with both years classifying such investments as \"nonmarketable\" measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and disclosed in the \"Other investments\" section of the financial statements. However, the 2024 10-K filing (page 42) shows a notable shift in presentation: nonmarketable investments were explicitly listed as a separate line item under \"Other measurement basis\" with a total of $5 (compared to $5 in 2023), while the 2023 filing (page 40) grouped them under \"Nonmarketable investments\" with a total of $5 but included them in a broader table of \"Other measurement basis\" items. This structural change indicates a more explicit disclosure of nonmarketable investments as a distinct category in 2024, though the underlying measurement approach and disclosure content (e.g., no fair value, cost-based with impairment adjustments) remained unchanged. The evolution reflects a minor enhancement in presentation clarity rather than a fundamental shift in accounting policy, suggesting Texas Instruments is maintaining consistency in its approach to reporting these assets while improving transparency in the balance sheet line item structure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that it accrues fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over lease terms when it believes substantially all lease income, including straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. The company also described specific conditions under which lease income would be recorded on a cash basis, such as when receivables are deemed not probable of collection. By 2024, SPG provided concrete financial figures showing fixed lease income increased from $3,858,592 in 2022 to $4,145,288 in 2023, and further to $4,365,734 in 2024, indicating a consistent upward trend. This evolution reflects both continuity in accounting methodology and a measurable growth in fixed lease income over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, SPG’s reporting of fixed lease income remained consistent in presentation, continuing to disclose fixed lease income as part of total lease income in its consolidated financial statements. In 2022, total lease income was $4,905,175 (thousands), with fixed lease income at $3,858,592; by 2024, total lease income increased to $5,389,760, and fixed lease income rose to $4,365,734, reflecting growth in fixed lease collections despite broader market shifts. The methodology for recognizing fixed lease income—accrued on a straight-line basis when collectability is probable—has not changed materially over the period, though the amount recognized has increased, likely due to portfolio expansion and improved lease structures. Disclosures in the 2024 10-K (page 133) continue to detail fixed lease income separately within total lease income, maintaining consistency in accounting methodology while showing higher financial figures year-over-year.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Xbox content and services revenue increased by 50%, with 44 percentage points of growth attributed to the net impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. In fiscal year 2024, Xbox content and services revenue again increased by 50%, and the acquisition continued to be a key driver, specifically noted as contributing 44 percentage points of net impact due to the shift of Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party. This indicates that the acquisition remained central to sustaining the same high growth rate in this segment year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth in Xbox content and services revenue was 50% in fiscal year 2024, driven by 44 points of net impact from the Activision Blizzard acquisition, compared to a 50% increase in fiscal year 2023 (which also included the acquisition impact). The acquisition contributed 6 points of growth to Gaming revenue in fiscal year 2024 (as noted in the \"Sales and marketing expenses\" section), while the document does not specify a separate contribution to Xbox content and services growth beyond the 44-point net impact in fiscal year 2024. Thus, the acquisition significantly accelerated growth in fiscal year 2024, but the growth rate itself was comparable to the prior year's 50% increase.",

This indicates a notable slowdown in the rate at which the company was reducing its asset retirement obligations, suggesting either an increase in new obligations or a strategic decision to defer certain retirement activities.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s ARO reduction/(build) shifted from a $1.3 million reduction in 2023 to a $0.3 million reduction in 2024 (as shown in the “Total cost incurred” reconciliation on page 105). This smaller reduction indicates that the company is building fewer new asset‑retirement obligations—reflecting either fewer new decommissioning liabilities or a more conservative estimate of existing obligations—suggesting a more stable or potentially lower future liability outlook for its upstream assets.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant shift from a positive trend in 2022 to a negative impact in 2023, indicating a reversal in the trajectory of gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The gross profit rate increased by 55 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared with fiscal 2023, and it fell by 155 basis points in fiscal 2023 versus fiscal 2022. The 2024 increase was driven mainly by lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, while the 2023 decline stemmed from inventory markdowns, elevated supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM Financial indicated that used vehicle prices were expected to decrease relative to 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. It also stated that no impairment indicators were present in the leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. By 2023, the company quantified the financial impact of a 1% relative change in estimated residual values at year-end, showing that such a shift could directly affect depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio. This evolution indicates a shift from a qualitative assessment of residual value risk in 2022 to a more quantitative and scenario-based analysis in 2023, suggesting a more refined risk management approach.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 GM Financial’s exposure to residual‑value risk declined materially: the estimated residual value of its leased‑vehicle portfolio fell from $29.1 billion at the end of 2021 to $22.7 billion at the end of 2023, and a 1% relative increase in those residuals would have raised depreciation expense by only $227 million across all future years (about $158 million in 2024).  This reduction in the residual‑value base, together with the company’s practice of periodically reassessing and adjusting residual estimates and only recording impairment when market‑price weakness is evident, shows that GM Financial manages this risk through conservative residual‑value assumptions, regular impairment testing, and the ability to increase depreciation or recognize impairments if used‑vehicle prices weaken.",

In 2024, however, the total revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased to $17,766 million from $15,563 million in 2023. This growth was driven by increases in both asset management fees (from $12,002 million to $13,875 million) and brokerage fees (from $3,561 million to $3,891 million). Thus, the segment shifted from a decline in 2023 to a significant recovery and growth in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased by $5.1 billion (from $41,650 million in 2023 to $46,766 million in 2024), driven primarily by higher fees and commissions—particularly asset‑management fees (+$1,873 million) and brokerage fees (+$330 million)—as well as a rise in investment‑banking fees (+$1,445 million). These gains offset modest declines in service‑charge and other income components, resulting in a net uplift in the segment’s revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DHR reported a core sales decline of (10.0)%, indicating a significant contraction in sales from existing businesses, excluding acquisitions and currency effects. By 2024, the core sales decline had improved to (1.5)%, showing a substantial reduction in the rate of decline. This evolution suggests that the company's underlying business performance strengthened significantly year-over-year, with core operations stabilizing and nearing growth. The improvement from (10.0)% to (1.5)% indicates a positive shift in demand, pricing, or unit sales, despite the broader market or economic challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "The core sales decline of 1.5% in 2024 (compared to 2023) indicates that Danaher's underlying organic growth remained weak, driven by significant core sales declines in the Biotechnology segment (4.5% decline) and Life Sciences segment (2.0% decline), partially offset by growth in Diagnostics. This persistent core sales weakness, coupled with flat total sales due to acquisitions offsetting the declines, suggests that Danaher's underlying business trends are characterized by modest organic contraction in key segments, particularly in high-growth markets like China, rather than broad-based revenue growth.",

However, in 2024, Refined Product Sales slightly declined from 1,287 thousand barrels per day (MBD) to 1,286 MBD. This indicates a shift from growth to near stability in downstream sales performance between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's Refined Product Sales volume increased from 1,287 MBD in 2023 to 1,286 MBD in 2024 – essentially flat, with a slight decline of 1,000 bbl/day (≈0.1 %). This modest change indicates that downstream operational performance remained stable, showing no significant growth in refined product volume despite higher margins being offset by lower realized prices and higher operating expenses.",

This represents a decline of 6.7 percentage points, indicating a weakening in the company's profitability relative to revenue. The drop suggests that operating costs grew faster than revenue during this period, or that the company faced challenges such as lower pricing power, increased competition, or higher input costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit margin declined from 41.8% in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024, representing a 6.9 percentage point decrease. This shift indicates weakening profitability, driven by lower revenue, higher manufacturing costs from capacity expansions, and reduced factory loadings that spread fixed costs over smaller output volumes.",

In 2024, the same factors—core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—continued to positively influence the gross margin percentage, again contributing a combined 35 basis points, despite the same offsetting pressure from increased 2% rewards. This indicates a consistent upward trend in gross margin performance from these areas, with no material change in the magnitude of their contributions.",
      "llm_answer": "The Canadian segment’s gross‑margin percentage rose in 2024, driven primarily by higher core‑merchandise margins and ancillary‑business contributions (e‑commerce and gasoline), while the impact of 2% rewards and other factors offset part of the gain.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the CAS pension cost was $1,725 million, and the FAS pension service cost was $65 million, resulting in a total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment of $1,660 million. In 2024, the CAS pension cost decreased to $1,684 million, while the FAS pension service cost was $60 million, leading to a total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment of $1,624 million. This reflects a decrease in both the CAS pension cost and the operating adjustment, indicating a reduction in pension-related financial pressure on operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The CAS pension cost increased from $1,725 million in 2023 to $1,684 million in 2024, while the FAS pension income (expense) shifted from $378 million in 2023 to $2 million in 2024. This resulted in a total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment of $1,624 million in 2024 (down from $1,660 million in 2023), contributing to a lower consolidated operating profit of $7,013 million versus $8,507 million in 2023.",

By 2024, the company clarified that fixed lease income included both fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM reimbursements recorded on a straight-line basis. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward stabilizing revenue streams by emphasizing predictable income components such as fixed minimums and CAM reimbursements, while reducing reliance on variable tenant-sales-based income.",

This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward securing more stable, predictable revenue streams through long-term, fixed-lease structures—reducing reliance on variable tenant sales-based income and emphasizing operational stability amid evolving retail conditions.

      "question": "How has the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue evolved between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Installed Base Growth was explicitly stated as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue alongside average revenue per user expansion and the shift from on-premises Office to Office 365. In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever. This suggests that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue evolved from being a primary growth lever to being integrated with broader expansion into new markets and AI-enabled value-adds. While installed base growth remained a key factor affecting Office Commercial revenue—alongside average revenue per user and the shift to Office 365—its impact was amplified by Microsoft's focus on reaching new users in growth markets, frontline workers, and small-to-medium businesses, as well as enhancing core offerings with AI capabilities like Copilot for Microsoft 365. This strategic shift underscores a transition from relying solely on base growth to leveraging it as a foundation for monetizing new user acquisition and AI-driven service adoption.",

      "question": "How did Netflix's streaming revenue growth rate and paid net membership additions evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's growth trajectory?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix's streaming revenues grew by 7% compared to the prior year, with paid net membership additions totaling 8,903 thousand. By 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained stable at 7%, but paid net membership additions surged dramatically, increasing by 232% to reach 29,529 thousand. This indicates a significant improvement in user acquisition in 2023 despite a similar revenue growth rate, suggesting more efficient scaling or successful new market penetration.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s streaming revenue growth slowed to 7% (from $31.5 bn to $33.6 bn), while paid net membership additions surged by 232% to 29,529, indicating a shift from strong subscriber growth to modest revenue expansion driven by a slight decline in average revenue per member. This suggests the company is transitioning toward a more mature growth trajectory, relying on incremental subscriber gains rather than rapid revenue increases.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Corporation had unfunded capital contributions of $7.2 billion related to affordable housing and other projects, with additional investments not expected to be significant. By 2024, the unfunded capital contributions increased to $7.5 billion, continuing the pattern of manageable expected commitments. This indicates a relatively stable investment strategy in affordable housing, with no significant escalation in contingent obligations despite an increase in total equity investments from $15.8 billion in 2023 to $16.7 billion in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The Corporation’s potential obligation to invest additional amounts in affordable‑housing projects has not changed materially between 2023 and 2024 – the 2024 disclosures continue to describe the same “potential obligation” language and the same range of possible additional investments, indicating that the company’s strategy remains focused on modest, opportunistic contributions rather than a shift toward larger or mandatory commitments. This consistency suggests the firm is maintaining its current approach to affordable‑housing investments, using them as a supplemental, tax‑credit‑driven component of its broader investment portfolio.",

      "question": "How has Chevron's approach to reducing oil production GHG intensity evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of capital allocation and strategic alignment with its long-term net zero goals?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Chevron disclosed an oil production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO₂e/boe and had spent $6.5 billion of its planned $10 billion lower-carbon capital spend through 2028, with $2 billion allocated to reducing carbon intensity in oil and gas operations. By 2024, Chevron maintained the same GHG intensity target of 24 kg CO₂e/boe but had increased its total lower-carbon investments to $7.7 billion since 2021, indicating a continued commitment to its 2028 targets and broader 2050 net zero upstream production aspiration. Additionally, in 2024, Chevron placed more emphasis on external dependencies like technology development and policy incentives to achieve its long-term goals, signaling a strategic shift toward integrating external enablers into its GHG reduction pathway.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s capital allocation has shifted toward lower‑carbon growth while maintaining a focus on reducing upstream GHG intensity. In 2024 the company continued its $10 billion‑through‑2028 lower‑carbon investment program—about $2 billion earmarked for cutting the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations and roughly $8 billion for renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon‑capture projects—building on $7.7 billion spent up to 2023, including the $2.9 billion acquisition of REG. This spending aligns with its 2050 net‑zero upstream aspiration and 2028 targets (oil‑production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO₂e/boe, gas intensity of 24 kg CO₂e/boe, methane intensity of 2 kg CO₂e/boe, flaring intensity of 3 kg CO₂e/boe, and a portfolio carbon‑intensity goal of 71 g CO₂e/MJ). Thus, between 2023 and 2024 Chevron has increased capital directed at emissions‑reduction initiatives and refined its strategy to meet long‑term net‑zero goals while still allocating resources to upstream production.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group estimated risk adjustment premium revenues based on submitted diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician treatment settings, with these data being subject to government review and audit by regulators. By 2024, the company maintained a similar estimation methodology but placed increased emphasis on the completeness and accuracy of data submitted to CMS, reflecting a more mature and refined process for capturing risk adjustment data. The 2024 disclosure also specifically highlights the role of both the company and healthcare providers in collecting, capturing, and submitting the necessary data within prescribed deadlines, suggesting a more collaborative and systematic approach to data submission compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's approach to estimating risk adjustment premium revenues has evolved significantly between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of data submission processes and regulatory oversight. In 2022, the Company described its risk adjustment methodology as relying on data submitted to CMS within prescribed deadlines, with estimates based on submitted and expected data, subject to government review and audit (including CMS audits). By 2024, this process was refined to emphasize that risk adjustment data is \"subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators,\" and the Company explicitly noted that \"risk adjustment data for the Company's plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators\" (UNH_10k_2024.pdf, p. 47). This indicates a heightened focus on regulatory compliance and audit readiness. Additionally, the 2024 filing (p. 47) confirms that the Company \"estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS,\" reflecting a more structured and proactive approach to data management and validation compared to the 2022 description, which did not explicitly reference audit processes. The evolution underscores increased regulatory scrutiny and the need for robust data governance to ensure accurate premium revenue estimation under CMS's risk adjustment methodology.",

This $10 increase in tax benefit led to a smaller net stock-based compensation expense, which remained at $645 in 2024 despite a rise in gross stock-based compensation expense from $774 to $818. The growing tax benefit offset the increase in gross expense, keeping the net expense unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM reported $356 million in unrecognized tax benefits that could favorably affect its future effective tax rate. In 2023, this amount increased to $386 million. This represents a $30 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, suggesting a slight upward trend in the company's potential tax savings in the future, though the company noted that it is still not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change in these benefits over the next twelve months.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GM’s unrecognized tax benefits declined from $520 million to $585 million? Actually the table shows 2023 ending balance $585 million versus $520 million in 2022 (the “Balance at end of period” row in the “Uncertain Tax Positions” table for 2023). This reduction reflects releases of valuation allowances and settlements, which may lower future tax expenses. Consequently, the company’s effective tax rate could decrease if these unrecognized benefits are recognized, potentially reducing the overall tax burden going forward.",

In 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained consistent at 7%, while the operating margin improved to 21%. This indicates that despite a similar pace of revenue growth, Netflix enhanced its profitability through better cost management or operational efficiencies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's streaming revenue growth slowed to 7% (from 19% in 2021), while operating margin expanded to 21% (up from 18% in 2022). This indicates a trajectory of decelerating top-line growth but improving profitability efficiency, suggesting the company is achieving better cost control and margin expansion despite slower revenue growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron stated it had increased its planned capital spend to approximately $10 billion through 2028 for lower-carbon initiatives, with $2 billion allocated to reducing the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and $8 billion for investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and offsets. By 2023, Chevron had already spent $6.5 billion on lower-carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022. This indicates significant progress toward its 2028 target and suggests an acceleration in implementation, particularly in scaling lower-carbon business lines such as renewable fuels.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's lower‑carbon capital spending plan remains anchored to its $10 billion target through 2028, but the focus of that spending has shifted. In 2022 the company allocated roughly $2 billion to cut the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations and $8 billion to renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon‑capture projects; by 2023 it had already spent $6.5 billion on lower‑carbon investments, including the $2.9 billion acquisition of REG, and it continued to fund the same two‑track approach—about $2 billion for emissions‑intensity reductions in upstream and downstream assets and $8 billion for growth in renewable fuels, hydrogen and offsets. The company reports progress toward its 2028 portfolio‑carbon‑intensity goal of 71 g CO₂e/MJ and its 2050 net‑zero upstream aspiration, while noting that actual spending may vary with market conditions, technology advances and regulatory changes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group listed 'medical costs payable' as a key component of its short-term cash requirements, indicating it was a primary liability to be settled within twelve months through cash flows from operations and available cash. The company emphasized that it expected to meet these obligations using operational cash flows and did not foresee liquidity issues due to its strong capital position. By 2024, the treatment of medical costs payable shifted to being a central focus in the company's accounting estimates and judgments, specifically under 'Use of Estimates' in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Here, medical costs payable was described as one of the most significant estimates requiring complex assumptions due to its inherent uncertainty and likelihood of change over time. The 2024 disclosure also highlighted that changes in estimates for medical costs payable were recognized in earnings during the period of adjustment, indicating a more dynamic and potentially volatile nature compared to the more static view in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group’s medical costs payable declined from $4,053 million in 2022 to $2,503 million in 2024, reflecting more mature claim data and the application of updated completion‑factor and medical‑cost‑trend assumptions that reduced prior‑year estimates of incurred but unreported claims. This reduction lowered the cash outflow tied to medical liabilities and eased pressure on operating cash, while the company continued to apply the same actuarial methods—using recent trend factors for the two most recent months and historical completion factors for earlier periods—to estimate its medical costs payable.",

By 2024, the company exceeded this target, achieving an adjusted free cash flow productivity of 105%. This indicates that the company's cash generation improved relative to its net earnings, showing stronger cash conversion capabilities beyond its earlier guidance.",
      "llm_answer": "From FY 2022 to FY 2024, Procter & Gamble’s adjusted free‑cash‑flow productivity rose from roughly 93 % to 105 %, indicating that the company is generating more cash per dollar of earnings after removing the non‑recurring Gillette impairment and foreign‑currency translation charges. This improvement shows that cash generation is increasingly outpacing reported net earnings, underscoring stronger underlying cash flow relative to profitability.",

In 2023, the Company entered into a new $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility in February 2023, which replaced the May 2018 facility. The terms remained largely consistent, with no financial covenants, unsecured status, and multiple interest rate alternatives. Again, fees to maintain the facility were disclosed as immaterial. While the facility was renewed with the same capacity, the timing of the renewal shifted from May to February, indicating a potential adjustment in the company's financial planning or negotiation cycle.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed a 2% increase to sales, reflecting higher costs being transferred to customers. By 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of 1% on sales, indicating a reversal in this dynamic. This shift suggests that LIN experienced a change in its cost structure or pricing strategy, where rising costs were no longer fully recoverable through pricing adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of cost pass-through on sales evolved from a modest positive contributor in 2022 (3% of sales growth in the Americas, with minimal direct impact on operating profit) to a more pronounced but still secondary factor by 2024, where it modestly reduced sales growth (e.g., a 1% drag in the Americas segment in 2024) while pricing and volume remained primary drivers. This indicates that LIN's pricing dynamics have increasingly been shaped by proactive price hikes to offset inflation and margin pressures, rather than relying on cost pass-through mechanisms, suggesting a strategic shift toward pricing power as a core lever for sustaining profitability amid evolving cost structures.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 41,033 thousand, representing a 44% growth, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership dropped to $7.64, a decrease of 20%. Despite the decline in per-user revenue, the significant increase in average paying memberships contributed to a $193,506 thousand rise in total revenue from $3,266,601 thousand in 2022 to $3,763,727 thousand in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, average monthly revenue per paying membership declined slightly (e.g., from $11.63 in 2022 to $11.64 in 2023 in the U.S. and Canada, and from $8.50 in 2022 to $8.66 in 2023 in the LATAM region), while average paying memberships grew significantly (e.g., from 69,518 in 2022 to 76,126 in 2023 in the U.S. and Canada, and from 40,000 in 2022 to 42,802 in 2023 in LATAM). This growth in memberships more than offset the modest revenue per membership decline, driving a 7% increase in total streaming revenue and contributing to an overall improvement in operating margin despite higher operating expenses.",

However, in fiscal 2024, these costs surged by 157.4% in dollar terms, rising from $20.2 million to $52.0 million. This indicates that while the company was able to manage these costs effectively in 2023, it faced significant cost pressures in 2024, undermining earlier efficiency gains.",
      "llm_answer": "Starbucks' product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenue declined 80 basis points from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher sales from pricing and reduced supply chain costs. However, store operating expenses increased 140 basis points as a percentage of total net revenue (and 140 basis points as a percentage of company-operated store revenue), driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits, deleverage, and increased promotional activity, partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies. This indicates that while cost management in product and distribution improved, overall cost pressures in labor and promotions contributed to margin contraction, revealing that the company's cost management effectiveness was mixed—gains in some areas were offset by higher operational costs in key segments.",

This expansion reflects a deliberate strategy to increase the number of household cards (60,600 → 60,600 → 56,900) and total cardholders (136,800 → 127,900), indicating that Costco is focusing on acquiring and retaining more members to fuel sales growth.",

By 2024, this figure had increased by $162 million, or 8%, indicating a positive upward trend in sales performance for the segment. However, despite the sales growth, operating profit for the Engineering segment decreased by $81 million, or 16%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher margins in the prior year from the wind-down of sanctioned Russian projects. This suggests that while sales grew, profitability was negatively impacted by the absence of those prior-year benefits.",
      "llm_answer": "Engineering segment sales increased 8% from $2,160 million in 2023 to $2,322 million in 2024, driven primarily by project timing, while engineering operating profit fell 16% to $410 million due to lower margins from prior‑year benefits on sanctioned projects. This pattern shows that although the engineering business is growing modestly in revenue, its profitability is under pressure, indicating a mixed performance trajectory.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM's net warranty expense was $2,592 million, composed of $2,593 million in warranties issued and assumed, $-261 million in supplier recoveries, and $260 million in adjustments and other. In 2023, this figure increased significantly to $4,778 million, driven by a substantial rise in warranties issued and assumed (from $2,593 million to $3,282 million) and a dramatic increase in adjustments and other (from $260 million to $1,493 million). The supplier recoveries also shifted slightly from a negative $261 million in 2022 to a positive $3 million in 2023, indicating a reversal in net recovery position. This represents a significant transformation in GM's net warranty expense.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GM’s net warranty expense rose sharply from $2.592 billion to $4.778 billion. The increase was driven by higher warranties issued and assumed in the period ($3.282 billion in 2023 versus $2.593 billion in 2022) and a modest rise in supplier recoveries ($3 million versus a $261 million recovery in 2022), while adjustments and other items also added to the expense. Consequently, the net warranty expense grew by roughly $2.186 billion over the year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DHR's SG&A expenses accounted for 30.7% of sales, while in 2024, this percentage increased to 32.5%. This indicates that the company's selling, general, and administrative costs grew at a faster rate than its sales, suggesting a potential decline in cost management efficiency over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, DHR's SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 30.7% to 32.5% (an 180 basis point rise), driven by $265 million of intangible‑asset impairment charges, $56 million from the loss on termination of a commercial arrangement, and acquisition‑related costs, while the company also recorded $87 million of acquisition costs and $64 million of intangible‑asset impairments in 2023 that partially offset the increase. This upward shift in SG&A intensity signals that DHR’s cost‑management efficiency deteriorated in 2024, as it had to absorb higher fixed and amortization expenses despite modest sales growth.",

By 2024, the total paid membership grew to 76,200, with Gold Star members increasing to 63,700 and Business members rising slightly to 12,500. This indicates a shift in composition where the percentage of Gold Star members increased from approximately 82.8% in 2023 to about 83.6% in 2024, while the Business segment saw a smaller proportional increase from 17.2% to 16.4%.",

In 2024, Business members (including affiliates) totaled 12,500 thousand, representing 16.4% of total paid members (76,200 thousand), up from 12,200 thousand (17.2%) in 2023. Meanwhile, Gold Star members increased to 63,700 thousand (83.6% of total paid members) from 58,800 thousand (82.8%) in 2023. Thus, the share of Business members declined slightly in absolute terms but grew as a percentage of the total paid membership base, while Gold Star members remained the dominant segment but saw a modest increase in both absolute numbers and relative share.",

      "question": "How did the impact of cost pass-through mechanisms on Linde's sales evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's pricing dynamics?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through was described as a positively impacting factor due to Linde's long-term contracts that allowed for the transfer of energy and feedstock cost fluctuations to customers, contributing to stable cash flow. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact, contributing to a (1)% change in sales. This shift indicates a change in the effectiveness or direction of cost pass-through mechanisms, possibly due to market conditions or contract renegotiations, affecting Linde's pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through mechanisms on Linde’s sales shifted from a **1% increase in 2022** (driving sales growth alongside volume and price/mix factors) to a **1% decrease in 2024** (as noted in the 2024 vs. 2023 sales analysis). This shift indicates that while cost pass-through contributed positively to sales growth in 2022, it became a drag in 2024 due to lower energy cost variances being billed to customers. However, the overall sales remained flat in 2024 (compared to 2023), with growth driven by **higher pricing and productivity initiatives** that more than offset cost inflation and currency headwinds. The decline in cost pass-through’s contribution reflects a strategic shift toward **pricing power and operational efficiency** as primary levers for margin expansion, rather than relying on pass-through mechanisms to offset rising costs. This suggests Linde is increasingly able to manage cost pressures through contractual pricing adjustments and productivity gains, signaling stronger control over pricing dynamics in a volatile cost environment.",

In 2024, this recognition method remained consistent; however, the company placed increased emphasis on the month-to-month nature of these overage fees, reinforcing that they are recognized only when the customer actually uses the service beyond the plan's allowance. While the core revenue recognition principle remained unchanged, the 2024 disclosure provided more explicit language around the timing and conditions of overage fee recognition, indicating a subtle refinement in how the company communicates its policy, rather than a substantive accounting change.",
      "llm_answer": "Verizon continues to recognize revenue from overage usage on postpaid wireless plans when customers exercise their incremental service options on a month‑to‑month basis, but the timing of revenue recognition for that overage usage has not changed materially between 2023 and 2024. The company still allocates the transaction price between service and equipment based on standalone selling prices and records the overage fees as revenue when the usage occurs, consistent with its prior practice.",

      "question": "How did the company's characterization of unamortized ITCs within regulatory liabilities change between 2022 and 2024, based on the specific language used in the disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company stated that regulatory liabilities were 'primarily attributable to' unamortized ITCs, indicating a direct and defined relationship. In 2024, the company instead stated that unamortized ITCs 'impact' regulatory liabilities, suggesting a broader, potentially more indirect influence rather than a primary attribution. This shift reflects a change in how the company describes the role of unamortized ITCs in its tax-related regulatory liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures, the company's characterization of unamortized ITCs within regulatory liabilities shifted significantly between 2022 and 2024. In the 2022 filing (page 275), unamortized ITCs were explicitly listed as a component of regulatory liabilities under \"Regulatory assets and liabilities\" with no separate disclosure of their amortization status. By 2024, the language in the \"Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\" note (page 238) clarified that regulatory liabilities include \"unamortized ITCs\" as a distinct line item within the broader regulatory liability category, and specifically noted that these ITCs are subject to amortization over the life of the underlying projects (e.g., Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4), with utilization expected to conclude by 2028–2035. The 2024 disclosure also emphasized that the amortization of ITCs is tied to specific projects and tax credit utilization timelines, reflecting a more detailed and project-specific characterization compared to the 2022 broader regulatory liability grouping. This evolution reflects a shift from a general classification to a precise, amortization-aware disclosure of ITCs within regulatory liabilities.",

However, in 2023, the company disclosed restructuring and related costs totaling $10 million, signaling a shift toward active restructuring efforts. This change suggests that the company initiated cost optimization or strategic realignment initiatives in 2023 that were not present in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, restructuring and related costs rose sharply from $68 million to $85 million—a 25 % increase—driven primarily by higher expenses in the Measurement & Analytical and Discrete Automation units. This uptick signals that the company is investing more in cost‑reduction and operational realignment efforts, likely to support its growth initiatives and margin‑improvement goals during the transition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed 2% to the year-over-year sales growth, indicating that rising costs were at least partially transferred to customers. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on the year-over-year sales comparison, suggesting that either cost pressures eased or LIN was less able to pass through cost increases to customers. This shift reflects a reversal in the company's cost pass-through dynamics, moving from a supportive factor to a slight drag on sales growth.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost pass‑through on sales shifted from a 3 % contribution to sales (and neutral effect on operating profit) in 2021 to a 1 % drag on sales in 2024, reflecting tighter pass‑through mechanisms as pricing and productivity gains increasingly offset inflation. This evolution indicates that Linde’s cost‑management dynamics have moved from relying on pass‑through to mitigate cost inflation toward a greater emphasis on price‑driven growth and productivity improvements to sustain margin expansion.",

By 2023, the proceeds further declined to $13,033 million.

      "llm_answer": "Based on the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity (pages 62 and 63), GM’s proceeds from the termination of leased vehicles increased from $14.2 billion in 2021 to $13.0 billion in 2022 and then to $13.0 billion in 2023, reflecting a decline of $1.2 billion from 2021 to 2022 and a modest rebound of $0.8 billion from 2022 to 2023. The overall trend shows a downward trajectory in proceeds from leased‑vehicle terminations over the 2021‑2023 period.",

      "original_answer": "Visa's Total Nominal Payments Volume increased from $11,464 billion in 2022 to $12,087 billion in 2024, representing a 5% growth. However, the growth rates for specific segments changed over time. In 2022, the Consumer Credit segment grew by 17% globally, while in 2024, this growth rate slowed to 6%. Similarly, the Commercial segment saw an increase in growth rate, from 29% in 2022 to 12% in 2024 globally. This indicates a moderation in the expansion of Consumer Credit and a sustained but slower growth in Commercial payments volume.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K filings, Visa's Total Nominal Payments Volume grew from $5,546 billion in 2022 to $6,387 billion in 2024 (a 15% increase from 2022 to 2023 and an additional 6% increase to 2024). Within this total, the Consumer Credit segment rose from $2,047 billion in 2022 to $2,355 billion in 2024 (approximately 15% growth over the two‑year period), while the Commercial segment expanded from $882 billion in 2022 to $1,042 billion in 2024 (about 18% growth). Both segments therefore showed double‑digit growth rates globally over the 2022‑2024 timeframe.",

This represents a more than threefold increase in dry hole costs year-over-year. The substantial rise in dry hole expenditures suggests that CVX experienced a notable increase in unsuccessful exploration activities in 2023 compared to the prior year, indicating a higher exploration risk profile during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "CVX's current-year dry hole expenditures declined sharply from $83 million in 2022 to $326 million in 2023 (a reduction of roughly 60 %), indicating that the company trimmed its exploration spending and placed less emphasis on high‑risk, dry‑hole projects during 2023.

      "question": "How did Pfizer's relationship with the Upjohn Business evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its financial reporting structure and strategic positioning?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer's Upjohn Business was still referenced in the context of historical spin-off activities, with its financial results reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, Pfizer noted that approximately 75% of the expected $700 million in separation costs had been incurred by the end of 2021. By 2023, the Upjohn Business was formally defined in the glossary as 'Pfizer's former global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business,' which had been spun-off on November 16, 2020, and combined with Mylan to create Viatris. This shift indicates a move from active financial tracking and cost reporting to a more historical and definitional reference, suggesting the integration and separation process had largely concluded by 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer's relationship with the Upjohn Business evolved significantly between 2022 and 2023 as part of its strategic transformation. The Upjohn Business, which represented Pfizer's former global off-patent branded and generics business (including well-known brands like Lipitor, Lyrica, Norvasc, Celebrex, and Viagra), was spun off in November 2020 and combined with Mylan to form Viatris. By 2023, Pfizer had fully transitioned to operate as a single, focused biopharmaceutical company under its new structure, with the Upjohn Business no longer part of its financial reporting. This strategic shift allowed Pfizer to concentrate on its core innovative medicines and vaccines portfolio, as reflected in its 2023 Form 10-K which details the reorganization of commercial operations into two segments (Biopharma and PC1), with Biopharma being the sole reportable segment. The document confirms that the Upjohn Business was spun off in 2020 and its financial results were reported as discontinued operations through 2021, with no remaining operational or financial integration into Pfizer's ongoing business by 2023.",

By 2023, this revenue decreased to $5,466 million, and its percentage contribution dropped to 13.9%. This indicates a decline in both the absolute revenue and relative importance of the APJC region to Cisco's overall product revenue during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Cisco’s APJC product revenue fell from **$5.854 billion to $5.466 billion**, a **$390 million (13 %) decline**, and its share of total product revenue dropped from **15.4 % to 13.9 %**. This reduction signals that the APJC region is becoming a smaller contributor to Cisco’s overall product sales, suggesting that the company is placing relatively less strategic emphasis on that market compared with other regions.",

By 2023, Automotive Interest Expense decreased to $911 million, but Automotive Financing - GM Financial Interest Expense rose sharply to $4,685 million, resulting in a total interest expense of $5,596 million. This shift shows that the proportion of interest costs attributed to GM Financial increased significantly, suggesting a greater reliance on financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 10‑K (Notes 13 and 14) we see that GM’s total interest expense rose to **$5,596 million in 2023** from **$3,868 million in 2022**.  The increase is driven almost entirely by a jump in GM Financial’s interest expense, which climbed from **$2,881 million in 2022 to $4,685 million in 2023**.  Consequently, the share of “Automotive Financing – GM Financial interest expense” in the consolidated interest bill grew markedly, indicating that GM’s debt‑financing structure is becoming more leveraged through GM Financial’s borrowing and securitization activities.  This shift reflects a heavier reliance on structured financing to fund vehicle inventories and dealer receivables, which increases the company’s exposure to interest‑rate and liquidity risk.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the cost of wireless equipment was $4,959 million, reflecting a decrease of $403 million compared to 2022. In contrast, by 2024, the cost of wireless equipment surged to $26,100 million, with $21,259 million attributed to the Consumer segment and $4,841 million to the Business segment. This significant increase of over $21 billion indicates a major shift in strategy, likely tied to increased investment in or sales of wireless equipment.",
      "llm_answer": "The cost of wireless equipment declined from $25,134 million in 2023 to $21,259 million in 2024, reflecting a lower volume of devices sold and a shift toward higher‑priced equipment. This reduction signals that Verizon is curbing its equipment outlays—likely to preserve cash and improve margins—while still maintaining a focus on premium device offerings.",

This indicates a significant moderation in the rate of credit volume growth over the two-year period.",

This indicates a clear slowdown in the growth trajectory of Visa's credit volume over the two-year period, suggesting that while credit volume continued to grow, the pace of expansion significantly moderated in the most recent fiscal year compared to the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's Other Income and Expense, Net increased primarily due to lower non-service pension costs and gains on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund. By 2023, the net figure for Other Income and Expense was $392 million, which included contributions from various components such as interest income ($27 million), AFUDC equity ($197 million), post-in-service equity returns ($34 million), and nonoperating income, other ($134 million). This indicates a shift in the composition of the net income, with AFUDC equity and nonoperating income, other playing significant roles in 2023 compared to the 2022 drivers.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K pages, Duke Energy's \"Other Income and Expense, Net\" increased from $392 million in 2022 to $598 million in 2023. The primary components driving this increase were $238 million in interest income, $198 million from AFUDC equity, $39 million in non‑operating income, and $78 million in other income and expense, net, as detailed on page 227.

By 2023, the definition changed to exclude amortization of intangible assets instead of purchase accounting for acquisitions, along with acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. This indicates a shift in the nature of adjustments being emphasized in the metric's calculation.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer's Adjusted Cost of Sales definition has remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, excluding amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items (including restructuring charges, asset impairments, and gains/losses on equity securities). The key evolution is that beginning in 2022, Pfizer explicitly excluded \"certain acquisition-related items\" from Adjusted results for financial performance metrics (like Adjusted diluted EPS used in incentive compensation), but continued to exclude them from Adjusted income calculations as part of its non-GAAP measure. The 2023 filing confirms this treatment remains unchanged, with Adjusted Cost of Sales still defined as \"Cost of sales... before the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, discontinued operations and certain significant items.\"",

Specific brands like Copenhagen and Skoal experienced notable declines, with Copenhagen dropping from 23.5% to 19.1%, and Skoal from 9.3% to 7.6%. While on! saw an increase from 6.8% to 8.3%, it was not enough to offset the overall decline.",

This share erosion occurred despite growth in the broader oral nicotine pouch segment (which grew to 42.9% of the oral tobacco category), as MO's traditional MST brands (Copenhagen, Skoal) saw share declines of 4.4 and 1.7 percentage points respectively. The company's adjusted OCI margin for oral tobacco products remained stable at 67.8% in 2024 (vs. 67.4% in 2023), suggesting pricing power partially offset the volume weakness, but the retail share decline signals increasing competitive pressure from rivals gaining market share.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx's pension plan assumptions included future salary increases as a key component in calculating the projected benefit obligation, which stood at $28.7 billion. By 2024, while the company continued to disclose pension plan assumptions, it emphasized a strategic shift by closing its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees starting 2020 and introducing an enhanced 401(k) plan with an 8% company match. This indicates a reduced emphasis on defined benefit plans and a shift toward defined contribution plans, suggesting a moderation in long-term salary-linked pension liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, FedEx revised its pension assumptions upward: the discount rate used for benefit obligations rose from 4.25% (2022) to 5.58% (2024), and the rate of increase in future compensation levels grew from 5.11% (2022) to 5.29% (2024). This reflects a strategic shift toward higher long-term compensation expectations and improved funding assumptions, signaling confidence in sustaining long-term pension liabilities amid evolving economic conditions.",

However, by 2024, the company clarified that recipients of stock-settled PSUs authorized beginning in 2013 receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense, rather than retained earnings, and these are paid at the time of settlement. This reflects a shift in both the timing and accounting treatment of dividend equivalents for newer PSU grants.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of dividend equivalents for stock‑settled performance share units (PSUs) has remained consistent between 2023 and 2024: recipients receive a cash payment of a dividend‑equivalent (or an accrued reinvested dividend‑equivalent) while the PSUs are unvested, and this amount is charged to retained earnings (or to compensation expense for performance‑share awards). Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants vest upon settlement after the three‑year performance period, and the accrued reinvested dividend is paid at settlement, but the timing of the equivalent payment and its accounting have not changed.",

This significant decrease suggests a major shift in Netflix's pricing strategy or a change in the geographic or demographic composition of its subscriber base, such as a greater proportion of users in lower-priced tiers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s average monthly revenue per paying membership declined from $8.50 to $7.64, a 10% decrease. This drop indicates that pricing strategy adjustments (such as limited price increases and shifts in plan mix toward lower-priced tiers in certain regions) and market dynamics (including higher membership growth in lower-revenue regions and unfavorable foreign exchange rates) outweighed any price hikes, leading to reduced revenue per user despite growth in total membership.",

By 2024, the outlook had narrowed significantly to a range of $48.63 to $57.53 per BOE with an average of $53.38. This indicates a substantial downward adjustment and reduced volatility in COP's expectations for future commodity prices, likely reflecting a more pessimistic or stabilized market outlook.",

In the 2022 filing (page 118), the fair value estimate for contingent consideration used a commodity price outlook range of $45.48–$63.04 ($57.45 average), while in the 2024 filing (page 111), the range narrowed to $48.63–$57.53 ($53.38 average). This downward shift in the expected commodity price outlook indicates ConocoPhillips anticipates lower future energy prices, reflecting a more cautious view of market conditions compared to 2022.",

This suggests that the company has either generated more tax losses that can be carried forward to offset future taxable income or has revised its estimates regarding the utilization of these carryforwards.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial disclosures, FedEx's net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards increased from $1.149 billion in 2022 to $1.306 billion in 2024. This growth indicates an expanding deferred tax asset position, though the company maintains valuation allowances for portions of these carryforwards. The NOLs, primarily consisting of foreign and state tax losses, are subject to expiration and require ongoing assessment of realizability, which the company believes will ultimately be sustained through future taxable income generation.",

In 2024, the company explicitly disclosed that PUDs continued to represent 35% of total proved reserves, consistent with the prior year. However, it also revealed that $9.4 billion in costs were incurred during the year for the development of PUDs. Additionally, 2024 included detailed geographic breakdowns of PUD development timelines, noting that 88% of PUDs were scheduled for development within five years, with specific mention of the Lower 48, Canada, Alaska's Willow project, and an equity affiliate in Australia. This indicates a shift from merely defining PUDs in 2023 to providing detailed disclosures on investment, development timelines, and geographic focus in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BK's Other Segment included corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments, and certain business exits. By 2024, the segment continued to include corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, and certain business exits; however, 'renewable energy' was replaced with 'tax credit investments' as a highlighted component. This indicates a strategic shift in the types of corporate investments being emphasized within the Other Segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The composition of BK's Other Segment remained focused on leasing assets, corporate treasury activities (including the securities portfolio), derivatives and trading, bank‑owned life insurance, tax‑credit and other corporate investments, and certain business exits, with no material shift reported between 2023 and 2024. The segment continued to be reported as part of the \"Other\" category in both the 2023 and 2024 filings.",

      "question": "How did AMD's provisions during the period evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's financial commitments or liabilities over time?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD's provisions during the period were $106 million, while in 2024, they increased significantly to $213 million. This indicates a doubling of provisions over the two-year period, suggesting that AMD faced greater financial commitments or anticipated higher liabilities in 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "AMD's lease and purchase commitments show a clear upward trend in financial obligations from 2022 to 2024. Operating lease liabilities increased from $348 million (2022) to $491 million (2024), while total unconditional purchase commitments surged from $9.066 billion (2021) to $4.968 billion (2024) – though the latter reflects a significant reduction from the 2021 peak due to updated reporting periods. This indicates growing long-term financial commitments, primarily driven by expanded data center infrastructure (evidenced by longer lease terms and higher future payments) and increased semiconductor supply chain obligations, reflecting both strategic investments and heightened operational scale. The consistent rise in lease expenses ($118M → $127M → $147M) further underscores escalating capital commitments to physical infrastructure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the income tax expense (benefit) on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using applicable tax rates in relevant jurisdictions and included both current and deferred tax amounts. The rationale for excluding purchase accounting impacts focused on the merger of equals structure, geographic management approach, and the need for comparability across segments and with peers. By 2024, the company retained the same technical explanation for the tax impact but added specificity to its rationale by referencing the 2018 business combination explicitly, reinforcing the long-standing nature of the merger and its ongoing influence on financial reporting. This evolution indicates a more detailed contextualization of the merger's lasting effects on financial disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "The company has consistently excluded the current and deferred income tax impacts of purchase accounting adjustments—specifically the fair‑value step‑up of assets and related amortization—from its non‑GAAP pre‑tax metrics. It argues that these tax effects are not indicative of ongoing operating performance, are non‑cash, and vary across geographies, so removing them provides a more comparable view of its underlying profitability and margin trends from 2022 through 2024.",

This indicates that while the rental car segment continued to grow during the recovery period, the pace of growth slowed down significantly in the second year, suggesting a potential stabilization or moderation in demand recovery.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of Rental Car Days booked through BKNG accelerated markedly from 30.7% in 2021‑2022 to 26%‑31% year‑over‑year growth in 2022 versus 2021, reflecting a faster recovery in the rental‑car segment as travel demand rebounded post‑COVID‑19. This surge indicates that the rental‑car business is outpacing overall travel recovery and is a key driver of the company’s revenue rebound.",

However, in 2023, the company experienced a strong rebound with paid net membership additions rising to 4,298 thousand, representing a 147% increase from 2022. This turnaround indicates a substantial improvement in Netflix's subscriber growth trajectory over the two-year period.",

This rebound, driven by global expansion and recovery from pandemic-related production delays, signals a renewed upward trajectory in the company’s subscriber base, though average revenue per membership faced minor pressure due to pricing dynamics and regional mix.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, American Tower recorded a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit due to a strategic review that indicated the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. Additionally, the carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $344.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with tower portfolio and network location intangible assets valued at $916.2 million and $243.6 million, respectively. By 2024, the Company finalized a review of estimated useful lives of its tower assets, extending the depreciation period from 20 to 30 years, which led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year. This change in accounting estimate reflects a shift in the long-term valuation and treatment of the India reporting unit's assets.",

Additionally, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test on its India reporting unit in 2023, concluding that the unit’s carrying amount exceeded its fair value and recording a $322 million goodwill impairment charge; no further goodwill impairments were identified in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD benefited from the FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) tax benefit, which contributed $147 million to its income tax provision. By 2024, the impact of FDII had evolved due to a change in U.S. tax regulations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures instead of deducting them as incurred. This change increased taxable income in 2024 and 2023, which in turn increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit, indicating a growing influence of FDII on AMD's tax position despite no direct benefit amount being disclosed for 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of the FDII tax benefit on AMD's taxable income evolved such that it became a larger source of tax benefit as the company's U.S. taxable income increased, particularly due to the capitalization of R&D expenses under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act requiring amortization of R&D costs. This change, combined with the acquisition-related deferred tax adjustments and the restructuring of international tax incentives (like the Singapore DEI), contributed to the evolution of the FDII benefit's effect on taxable income between 2022 and 2024. The key regulatory change enabling this evolution was the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which mandated the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenditures, thereby increasing taxable income eligible for the FDII deduction.",

In 2023, the growth rate increased significantly to 10% (from 41,699,000 to 45,997,000). This indicates a substantial acceleration in Netflix's membership acquisition momentum year-over-year.",

This sharp decline suggests the company is facing increasing difficulty in adding new subscribers at the same pace as the prior year, potentially signaling market saturation or heightened competition.",

By 2023, Total PMI Net Revenues increased to $35.174 billion, with combustible products contributing $22.334 billion and smoke-free products contributing $12.840 billion. This represents a shift in the company's revenue mix, with smoke-free products showing significant growth in their contribution compared to combustible products.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the share of PMI’s total net revenue coming from smoke‑free products grew markedly – from about 32 % of total revenue in 2022 (10,190 ÷ 31,762 ≈ 32 %) to roughly 36 % in 2023 (12,840 ÷ 35,174 ≈ 36 %).  This increase was driven by a substantial rise in smoke‑free net revenues (up from $9,919 million to $12,840 million), while revenue from combustible tobacco products also expanded modestly (up from $21,572 million to $22,334 million), but the faster growth of the smoke‑free category raised its relative contribution within the overall portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense. This applied particularly to PSUs with performance periods beginning before 2018, where recipients received dividend equivalents only after the performance period ended and until settlement. For PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received accrued reinvested dividend equivalents, which were paid at the time of settlement. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted to stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs), where most recipients received either a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to retained earnings. Additionally, the grant date fair market value of RSUs that did not receive a dividend equivalent was adjusted to reflect the net present value of estimated dividends not received. This represents a shift from cash-settled to stock-settled instruments with distinct implications for dividend equivalent treatment and financial accounting.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of dividend equivalents shifted from being charged directly to retained earnings for most RSUs and PSUs prior to 2013 to being charged to compensation expense (and, for newer awards, to accrued reinvested dividends) beginning in 2013, reflecting a change in how dividend equivalents are accounted for in the company’s equity‑based compensation programs.  Consequently, the financial impact of dividend equivalents on share‑based compensation expense has evolved such that they now affect the income‑statement expense line rather than retained earnings, altering the net cost recognized for these awards between 2023 and 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BNY Mellon's forward-looking statements included expectations about performance results, expenses, nonperforming assets, products, regulatory, technology, market, economic or accounting developments, and their impacts on the company's businesses. By 2024, BNY expanded the scope of these forward-looking statements to include more specific references to capital plans (including dividends and repurchases), strategic priorities, acquisitions and integration activity, transition to a platforms operating model, efficiency savings, and interest rate and net interest income sensitivities. This indicates a broader and more strategic framing of future results in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, BNY’s forward‑looking disclosures shifted from a broader set of risk‑factor language in the 2023 MD&A (which listed many generic “risk factors” such as operational errors, cyber incidents, regulatory changes, etc.) to a more concise, targeted set of forward‑looking statements in the 2024 filing. The 2024 version narrows the scope to specific expectations about capital returns, credit‑rating impacts, liquidity management, new business initiatives and ESG/climate risks, while still retaining the standard disclaimer that forward‑looking statements are uncertain and subject to change. This evolution reflects a tighter focus on the most material forward‑looking expectations for investors.",

This growth was driven by higher segment operating profits, which rose from $7,176 million in 2022 to $9,720 million in 2024. Additionally, the impact of cost reduction programs and other charges decreased significantly, from a deduction of $273 million in 2022 to $145 million in 2024. The purchase accounting impacts from LindeAG also declined, from $1,919 million in 2022 to $940 million in 2024, further contributing to the overall improvement in operating profit.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $8,024 million to $8,635 million, reflecting a $611 million rise. The growth was driven by higher operating profit in the Americas (+$306 million), EMEA (+$294 million) and APAC (+$112 million), offset by a decline in Engineering profit and modest increases in Other. Reconciling items showed a $145 million reduction from cost‑reduction programs and other charges and a $940 million impact from purchase accounting adjustments, which together shifted reported operating profit from $8,024 million in 2023 to $8,635 million in 2024.",

This indicates that membership growth accelerated significantly year-over-year (from 11% growth in 2021 to 8% in 2023), but revenue per member remained flat, suggesting the company is prioritizing subscriber expansion over price increases.

In 2024, the company disclosed that it had implemented foreign exchange hedging strategies that directly impacted its streaming revenues. Specifically, hedging gains of $124 million were included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year ended December 31, 2024. This indicates that while the core streaming revenue growth trajectory remained positive, the company actively managed foreign exchange risk in 2024, which contributed an incremental $124 million to its reported streaming revenues.",

The 2024 increase was partially offset by foreign‑exchange headwinds, as noted in the hedging disclosures, which resulted in a net impact of approximately $124 million of hedging gains being included in streaming revenues for the year.",

By fiscal 2024, this impact increased significantly to a pre-tax income of $177 million, driven by additional realized gains on contingent consideration. This indicates that the company continued to benefit financially from post-sale arrangements tied to the performance or milestones related to the Canadian retail business after the initial sale in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact from the Canadian retail business transaction shifted from a $63 million pre‑tax gain recognized in fiscal 2023 to a $177 million pre‑tax gain recognized in fiscal 2024, reflecting the contingent consideration realized from the sale. This increase indicates that the contingent consideration gains contributed positively to earnings, boosting adjusted diluted earnings per share despite the overall decline in net earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron described crude oil liftings as a factor that 'impacted' its forward-looking statements, indicating an external influence among many others. By 2024, the company shifted its language to state that its forward-looking statements 'depend on' crude oil liftings, placing it among a narrower group of critical factors affecting outcomes. This change in phrasing indicates a more direct and central framing of crude oil liftings in relation to the company's projections, though the document does not quantify or elaborate on the extent of this dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s forward‑looking statements have consistently been framed around “timing of crude oil liftings” as a specific risk factor, but the language describing that risk has evolved. In the 2022 filing the forward‑looking section listed “timing of crude oil liftings” among the enumerated risks that could affect results, using the same phrasing as earlier years. By the 2024 filing the wording was expanded and integrated into a broader set of forward‑looking disclosures, positioning the timing of liftings as part of a larger suite of operational and market risks (e.g., production quotas, supply‑chain constraints, and energy‑transition initiatives) and adding more explicit references to how liftings relate to the company’s strategic objectives and risk‑management focus. Thus, while the core risk remains, the 2024 version presents it within a more comprehensive, strategically contextualized narrative.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, gasoline costs were described as a negative impact on Costco's business, with rising energy prices contributing to adverse effects on demand, cost of inventory, and operational expenses. The company expressed concerns about its ability to pass on these cost increases without negatively affecting consumer demand. By 2024, however, the framing shifted: gasoline cost fluctuations were described as a factor influencing comparable sales growth, indicating that Costco had begun to treat gasoline price volatility not just as a cost burden, but as a lever affecting sales performance and potentially pricing strategy. This evolution shows that gasoline costs became a more integral, strategic variable in Costco's financial dynamics, rather than solely a risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, gasoline costs became a more significant driver of Costco’s financial performance, as evidenced by the company’s explicit discussion of gasoline’s impact on net sales, gross margin, and SG&A expenses in its 2024 filing (pages 21‑25). Rising gasoline prices boost net sales growth but depress gross‑margin percentages, while falling prices have the opposite effect, making the business highly sensitive to fuel price fluctuations. This indicates that Costco’s profitability is increasingly dependent on, and reactive to, changes in gasoline prices.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP reported $70,621 million in proved property for the Lower 48 and $10,923 million in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region under consolidated operations. By 2024, these figures increased to $88,461 million for the Lower 48 and $11,274 million for the Asia Pacific/Middle East, indicating a significant increase in investment concentration in the Lower 48 and a modest increase in the Asia Pacific/Middle East. This reflects a strategic shift towards expanding domestic operations while maintaining a steady presence internationally.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided data, the distribution of COP's proved property investments across geographic regions evolved as follows between 2023 and 2024:\n\n1.  **Lower 48:** Proved property investments (capitalized costs) increased significantly from **$70,621 million (2023)** to **$88,461 million (2024)**, representing a substantial rise in focus on this region.\n2.  **Asia Pacific/Middle East:** Proved property investments rose from **$10,923 million (2023)** to **$11,274 million (2024)**, showing modest growth. This region also saw a notable increase in equity affiliate activity (proved property: $11,159M in 2023 vs. $11,691M in 2024), though the core proved property investment growth was smaller than in the Lower 48.\n3.  **Other Regions:** The data shows stable or minor changes in Canada, Europe, Africa, and Alaska, with no significant shifts in their relative investment proportions compared to the major changes observed in the Lower 48 and Asia Pacific/Middle East. The total consolidated proved property investment increased from $134,394M (2023) to $155,364M (2024), driven primarily by the Lower 48 growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Lowe's completed the sale of its Canadian retail business, which included 232 company-operated stores and 210 dealer-owned stores, and began accounting for contingent consideration related to the transaction. By 2024, Lowe's no longer had an ownership stake in the Canadian retail business and instead recognized $177 million in pre-tax income from realized gains on the contingent consideration related to that sale, indicating a full transition from operational involvement to post-sale financial settlement.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Lowe's completed the sale of its Canadian retail business (operating 232 stores) in February 2023, which generated contingent consideration that was later realized as a $177 million pre-tax gain in fiscal 2024 (recorded in SG&A expense). Financially, Lowe's maintained strong liquidity with $1.8 billion cash and $4.0 billion undrawn credit capacity as of January 2025, while continuing to manage debt repayments and shareholder returns. Strategically, the company divested its Canadian operations to focus on its U.S. home improvement market, emphasizing long-term growth through initiatives like its Total Home strategy and investments in supply chain productivity, despite near-term market pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BMY reported IPRD-related impairment charges of $136 million, primarily due to discontinuation of development for certain investigational compounds. By 2024, these impairment charges surged to $2.9 billion, indicating a significant increase in the write-down of intangible assets, particularly IPRD. This evolution reflects a more aggressive reassessment of asset valuations, likely due to changing market conditions, regulatory challenges, or internal strategic shifts. The increase from $136 million to $2.9 billion shows a substantial change in how BMY evaluated the recoverability of its IPRD assets within a single year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, BMY’s approach to IPRD-related impairment charges shifted markedly: in 2023 the company recorded only $136 million of intangible‑asset impairment (primarily for discontinued development programs), whereas in 2024 it recognized $2.9 billion of impairment charges—largely tied to write‑downs of newly acquired intangibles such as Augtyro and other pipeline assets. This escalation reflects a more aggressive stance in reassessing the recoverability of its intangible assets, signaling that BMY is actively managing and, when necessary, writing down the value of its pipeline‑related intangibles in response to changing clinical, regulatory, or market conditions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MA's net settlement exposure was $62,856 million, and by 2024, it increased to $64,919 million. This indicates that despite an increase in gross settlement exposure from $75,023 million to $78,385 million, the company applied more risk mitigation arrangements, increasing them from $12,167 million to $13,466 million. However, the net settlement exposure still rose, suggesting that the growth in gross exposure outpaced the additional risk mitigation.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard's net settlement exposure increased from $62,856 million in 2023 to $64,919 million in 2024, reflecting a rise in gross settlement exposure to $78,385 million from $75,023 million and modest growth in risk‑mitigation arrangements. This upward trend indicates that the company's risk‑management controls are effectively limiting losses—historically low despite higher exposure—suggesting that its current practices remain robust, though the growing exposure warrants continued monitoring.",

      "original_answer": "Salesforce's gross profit margin for Subscription and Support Revenue increased from 81% in 2023 to 82% in 2024. This margin expansion was driven by a reduction in the cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues, which decreased from 19% in 2023 to 18% in 2024. The cost of Subscription and Support Revenue fell from $5,821 million in 2023 to $6,177 million in 2024, but grew at a slower rate than revenues, contributing to the improvement in gross margin.",
      "llm_answer": "The year‑over‑year change in Salesforce’s gross profit margin for Subscription and Support Revenue was driven by a decline in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue – falling from 19 % in fiscal 2023 to 18 % in fiscal 2024 – which expanded the gross margin. This reduction in cost‑of‑revenues share was mainly attributable to lower relative employee‑related costs (including stock‑based compensation) and reduced third‑party expenses, even as absolute cost of revenues rose modestly. Consequently, the gross profit margin improved, reflecting the favorable shift in cost structure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a decrease in paid net membership additions of 1,738 thousand compared to the prior year, continuing a downward trend from 7,140 thousand in 2021. However, in 2023, the company saw a significant turnaround with a 147% increase in paid net membership additions, adding 4,298 thousand new memberships compared to 2022. This indicates a strong recovery and positive shift in the company's growth trajectory after a period of membership stagnation and decline.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s paid net membership additions surged from 8,903 to 29,529, a 232% increase, indicating a significant acceleration in subscriber growth. This strong addition, combined with a 7% rise in total revenues and a 23% increase in operating income, demonstrates that Netflix is experiencing a robust recovery and expansion phase, shifting from the slower growth observed in 2022 to a more aggressive global membership acquisition strategy.",

This represents a **decrease of 13,938 stockholders** over the three-year period. The trend reflects a **consolidation in shareholder base**, likely driven by factors such as stock repurchases (though the repurchase program was suspended in 2019), changes in institutional ownership, or other market dynamics, though the document does not explicitly state the cause of the decline. The decrease is consistent with the company's historical pattern of managing its shareholder count through strategic actions, though the exact reason for the reduction is not detailed in the provided excerpts.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Converse's direct to consumer revenues increased by 22%, driven by strong digital demand, while wholesale revenues decreased by 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China and global supply chain constraints. By fiscal 2024, both channels experienced declines: direct to consumer revenues decreased by 14% on a currency-neutral basis, mainly due to reduced traffic in North America and Western Europe, and wholesale revenues fell by 16%, driven by declines across all geographies. The shift from growth to decline in direct to consumer and the deepening of the wholesale decline reflect changing market dynamics and increased promotional activity that reduced ASP by 3% in fiscal 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Converse’s direct‑to‑consumer (DTC) revenue grew sharply—up 22 % in fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021 and then fell 14 % in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023—while wholesale revenue declined 5 % in fiscal 2022 and 16 % in fiscal 2024, reflecting ongoing marketplace dynamics in China and broader supply‑chain constraints. The key drivers of these changes were (1) a 12 % increase in Converse’s reported EBIT in fiscal 2022, driven by gross‑margin expansion and higher DTC sales, and (2) a 30 % drop in reported EBIT in fiscal 2024, caused by gross‑margin contraction, lower full‑price ASPs, higher product‑cost pressures (freight, duties, logistics) and reduced wholesale volumes, especially in North America and Western Europe.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's treatment and estimation of medical costs payable evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its financial assumptions and risk management approach?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group highlighted its cash and investment balances, including $21.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and emphasized that fluctuations in asset values would not materially impact liquidity due to strong operating cash flows and access to credit facilities. Medical costs payable were part of the short-term obligations expected to be covered through operational cash flows and available liquidity. In 2023, the company placed greater emphasis on the estimation methodology for medical costs payable, noting that these estimates require complex assumptions and are inherently uncertain, often changing in subsequent periods. The 2023 disclosure also explicitly tied changes in estimates directly to earnings in the period they are adjusted, signaling a more dynamic and risk-sensitive approach to financial reporting around medical liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, UnitedHealth Group refined its medical costs payable estimation approach by shifting from relying primarily on historical completion factors for older periods to applying observed medical cost trend factors to the most recent two months of data, supplemented by near-term completion factor reviews. This evolution reflects a more dynamic risk management strategy, incorporating real-time cost trends to improve the accuracy of liability estimates, while still using completion factors for prior periods to project ultimate incurred claims. The change resulted in a $1.971 billion decrease in the net unrealized gain component of equity (from $807 million in 2022 to $1,971 million in 2023) and contributed to a more stable medical costs payable balance of $3,482 million in 2023, reflecting improved actuarial modeling of claim development.",

This indicates a positive evolution in the company's future contract outlook, reflecting growth in potential future revenue from unexercised options and IDIQ contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filing pages, the estimated potential contract value in General Dynamics' defense segments increased from $35.9 billion at year-end 2022 to $37.9 billion at year-end 2023, representing a $2.0 billion increase. This growth indicates a strengthening outlook for future defense contracts, driven by significant awards in segments like Combat Systems and Marine Systems, including major contracts for munitions, submarine programs, and vehicle upgrades, which suggest continued demand and potential for further contract awards in the coming years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), transitioning from a partial owner to full ownership. This marked a significant shift in strategic involvement, as disclosed in the 2024 filing. The acquisition was funded through new debt issuance of $2.7 billion, increasing total debt from $16.6 billion in 2022 to $18.9 billion by the end of 2023. This reflects a transformation from a shared-operational model to full control, which likely influenced capital allocation decisions, including the planned $9 billion return of capital in 2024, signaling confidence in the company’s post-acquisition financial positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips shifted from a joint‑venture stake to full ownership of the Surmont asset, completing the acquisition of the remaining 50 % working interest in October 2023 and paying a $3 billion cash consideration (plus up to $0.4 billion of contingent payments tied to WCS price). This move gave the company 100 % ownership of Surmont’s proved and unproved properties, which were valued at roughly $3.0 billion in net identifiable assets. To fund the purchase, ConocoPhillips issued $2.7 billion of new long‑term debt and refinanced existing obligations, increasing total debt to $18.9 billion by year‑end 2023, while also using cash on hand and equity‑linked financing. The acquisition reshaped its capital structure by adding significant debt but also consolidating a high‑value asset under a single‑owner framework, supporting its broader capital‑return framework and shareholder‑return commitments.",

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with current content liabilities remaining unchanged at $4.5 billion, but non-current content liabilities decreased to $2.6 billion.

Of this amount, the portion recorded on the balance sheet as current content liabilities stayed roughly the same (about **$4.5 billion** each year), while the non‑current content liability portion dropped from **$3.1 billion** in 2022 to **$2.6 billion** in 2023.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Converse revenues stood at $2,346 million, showing a 6% increase compared to the previous year. However, by fiscal 2024, Converse revenues had decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This decline was primarily attributed to drops in North America and Western Europe, with combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales down 12%, driven largely by a decrease in wholesale. Additionally, average selling price (ASP) fell by 3%, mainly due to increased promotional activity in the direct-to-consumer channel.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Converse’s revenue trajectory shows a clear decline: reported revenue fell 15% in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023 (from $2,427 M to $2,082 M), and the currency‑neutral drop was 15% as well, with unit sales down 12% and average selling price down 3% due to heavier promotions. Gross margin contracted by roughly 130 basis points, driven by unfavorable foreign‑currency effects, lower full‑price ASP and higher other costs, while operating overhead fell only slightly, leading to a 30% plunge in earnings before interest and taxes (from $676 M to $474 M). The primary factors behind this downturn are weakening demand in North America and Western Europe, reduced wholesale shipments, and a shift toward lower‑margin direct‑to‑consumer sales, all of which eroded both top‑line growth and profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron announced a planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 for lower carbon investments, with $2 billion allocated to reducing carbon intensity in traditional oil and gas operations and $8 billion directed toward renewable fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and offsets. By 2024, the company had already spent $7.7 billion on lower carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022, reaffirming its commitment to the same $10 billion total target through 2028. This indicates that Chevron has maintained its long-term capital commitment to lower carbon initiatives, while accelerating spending in the early years, particularly through strategic acquisitions that support its broader decarbonization goals.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's planned capital allocation for lower carbon investments has increased significantly from $10 billion through 2028 (announced in 2021) to an updated target of $10-15 billion in asset sales over five years ending in 2028, with $7.7 billion already spent on lower carbon investments through 2024 including $2.9 billion for the REG acquisition. The company maintains its $10 billion through 2028 lower carbon capital spending target, allocating approximately $2 billion to reduce oil and gas carbon intensity and $8 billion for renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture, while also targeting $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by 2026 to fund these initiatives. This evolution demonstrates a strategic focus on reducing carbon intensity through both operational efficiency and growth in lower carbon businesses, while maintaining flexibility to adapt to policy and market changes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power had $26 million in derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes, split between $11 million current and $15 million non-current. By 2024, this amount increased significantly to $110 million total liabilities, with $69 million current and $41 million non-current. This indicates a substantial increase in Alabama Power's risk exposure tied to regulatory hedging instruments over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "Alabama Power's derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes decreased from $87 million in 2023 to $84 million in 2024, reflecting a modest reduction in its hedging obligations. This decline suggests a slight easing of its exposure to commodity price and interest‑rate risks that are managed through regulatory‑approved hedging programs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific expanded its Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment through the acquisition of CorEvitas, LLC, a provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence solutions aimed at improving drug development efficiency. This signaled a strategic move to enhance decision-making tools in biopharma services. By 2024, the segment's revenues increased slightly from $23.041 billion to $23.157 billion, indicating a continuation and consolidation of prior strategic initiatives, though no new major acquisitions were disclosed for that year. This reflects a shift from active expansion through acquisitions in 2023 to a more stable growth phase in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 Thermo Fisher’s Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment saw only modest revenue growth (up 1 % overall, essentially flat on an organic basis) as gains in research‑and‑safety and clinical‑research sales were offset by lower demand for COVID‑19‑related vaccines and therapies.  The segment’s operating margin fell sharply (from 14.6 % in 2023 to 13.3 % in 2024), reflecting an unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, although productivity gains partially mitigated the decline.  The company continued to expand the segment through targeted acquisitions—most recently CorEvitas in August 2023 and Olink in July 2024—while maintaining a strong cash position to fund these initiatives.",

In 2023, the company's strategy shifted significantly, with wind expenditures decreasing to $2,820 million and solar expenditures increasing substantially to $3,270 million. This indicates a strategic pivot from wind toward solar energy investments.",

In 2023, NEER allocated $3,270 million to solar projects (including solar plus battery storage) and $2,820 million to wind projects, compared to $1,370 million and $545 million respectively in 2022. This represents a substantial increase in both solar ($2,370 million more) and wind ($2,275 million more) capital spending, with solar receiving significantly higher investment relative to wind in 2023. The total NEER capital expenditure for wind, solar, and related clean energy projects rose from $4,420 million in 2022 to $9,835 million in 2023, reflecting a strategic shift toward greater solar and battery storage investments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Tire Installation was listed among other warehouse ancillary services, but it was embedded within a broader list that included gasoline, pharmacy, optical, and food court services. By 2024, Tire Installation was explicitly called out as a distinct category under warehouse ancillary services, indicating a more deliberate emphasis on its importance. This evolution suggests that Costco may have elevated the strategic positioning of Tire Installation, potentially aligning it more closely with core member services to drive traffic or enhance the value proposition for members.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco has progressively elevated tire installation from a peripheral ancillary service to a core warehouse offering, integrating it within its “Warehouse Ancillary” category and expanding its presence across U.S. and international locations. By 2024, tire installation was positioned alongside other member services (e.g., gasoline, pharmacy, optical) to drive traffic and increase basket size, reflecting a strategic emphasis on high‑margin, member‑focused services that complement its low‑price merchandise model. This evolution underscores a continued focus on leveraging member services to boost engagement and sales.",

This growth, driven by international wheeled vehicle programs and U.S. military vehicle contracts, indicates a strategic shift toward expanding its market position in land-based combat systems, particularly through export opportunities and modernization of platforms like the Ajax and Pandur vehicle families.",

This decrease signals that the company is winding down its workforce‑reduction and site‑transition initiatives, with the remaining repositioning liabilities now largely accrued ($188 million severance, $91 million exit costs) and expected to be settled in future periods.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, Linde plc reported income from equity investments at $119 million, with an adjusted figure of $231 million, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in APAC effective January 1, 2021. By 2024, the reported income from equity investments had stabilized at $170 million, with values of $167 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022. This represents a decrease from the adjusted 2021 level but shows relative stability in recent years. The earlier increase in 2021 was partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge in the third quarter of that year related to an APAC joint venture, while the more recent figures suggest a normalization following the structural change in 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's income from equity investments remained relatively stable over the period, with reported income of $170 million in 2024, $167 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022 (as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income). The composition of this income is reflected in the “Income from equity investments” line of the statement, which represents earnings from the company's equity‑investment holdings.",

By 2023, Booking Holdings reclassified these indirect taxes into 'Sales and other expenses' to align with a presentation that reflects costs more closely tied to revenue changes. This reclassification affected the composition of the metric, although it did not impact previously reported Revenue, Operating income, Income before income taxes, or Net income for 2022 or 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "The presentation of Sales and Other Expenses was updated in 2023 to reclassify certain indirect taxes (such as digital services taxes) from General and Administrative expenses into Sales and Other Expenses, reflecting a more revenue‑linked expense classification; this reclassification increased Sales and Other Expenses by $168 million in 2022 and $98 million in 2021, while reducing General and Administrative expenses by the same amounts. The underlying composition of the expense categories remained otherwise unchanged, with Sales and Other Expenses still comprising variable costs such as payment processing fees, third‑party service fees, and indirect taxes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported $21.8 billion in total content obligations, consisting of $4.5 billion in current content liabilities, $3.1 billion in non-current content liabilities, and $14.2 billion in off-balance-sheet obligations. In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with $4.5 billion in current content liabilities, $2.6 billion in non-current content liabilities, and $14.6 billion in off-balance-sheet obligations. This reflects a minor shift in the composition of obligations, with a small decrease in non-current liabilities offset by a slight increase in off-balance-sheet commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix’s streaming content obligations remained roughly flat at about $21.7 billion, with the portion recorded on the balance sheet (current and non‑current content liabilities) staying near $7.6 billion, while the undisclosed off‑balance‑sheet commitments stayed around $14 billion. The company continues to carry large multi‑year fixed‑cost commitments that are not fully reflected in liabilities, limiting its flexibility to adjust spending if cash flows weaken. Consequently, the evolution of these obligations did not shift substantially between the two years, but the fixed‑cost nature and the size of the off‑balance‑sheet commitments continue to constrain liquidity.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the table summarizing derivative assets and liabilities covered the periods ending December 31, 2023 and 2022. By 2024, this table was updated to cover the periods ending December 31, 2024 and 2023. This reflects a forward progression in the reporting periods included for derivative instruments, maintaining a two-year comparative structure but shifting the most recent year from 2022 to 2023 in the comparison.",
      "llm_answer": "The presentation of derivative liabilities within “Changes in Other Liabilities” remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, continuing to be reported net of master‑netting and collateral offsets. In the 2023 tables (page 182), total derivative liabilities were shown as $2,932 million before netting adjustment and $2,335 million after the netting adjustment; in the 2024 tables (page 194), the corresponding figures are $2,032 million gross and $1,728 million net after offsetting, reflecting the same netting methodology but with updated amounts. Thus, while the net amount reported in “Changes in Other Liabilities” decreased from $2,335 million (2023) to $1,728 million (2024), the categorization and offset treatment of derivative liabilities stayed unchanged.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' geographic focus for Total MBOED production change from 2022 to 2023, and what was the corresponding change in overall output volume?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips reported Total MBOED production exclusively from the Australia Pacific LNG project, which stood at 113 MBOED. By 2023, the company no longer disclosed production from Australia and instead focused entirely on domestic U.S. assets, including the Delaware Basin (537 MBOED), Eagle Ford (226 MBOED), Midland Basin (182 MBOED), Bakken (106 MBOED), and Other (16 MBOED), totaling 1,067 MBOED. This represents a complete geographic shift from international to U.S.-focused production and an increase in total output by approximately 846%.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, ConocoPhillips shifted its geographic focus for Total MBOED production from Canada to the Lower 48, as evidenced by the 2023 data showing the Lower 48 contributing 1,067 MBOED (64 % of consolidated liquids and 76 % of consolidated natural gas) versus Canada’s 104 MBOED (7 % of liquids and 3 % of gas). Consequently, overall output volume declined from 1,171 MBOED in 2022 to 1,171 MBOED in 2023, reflecting a net reduction in production driven by the reduced share from Canada and the relative growth of the Lower 48 segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Life Sciences Solutions segment reported $105 million in earnings, while in 2024, this figure decreased to $69 million. This indicates a decline in the segment's financial performance year-over-year. The drop from $105 million to $69 million suggests a reduced contribution to the company's consolidated results, signaling a potential challenge or strategic shift affecting this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Life Sciences Solutions segment’s revenue fell 26 % to $9.98 billion in 2023, driven by a sharp decline in COVID‑19‑related sales, and its operating margin dropped from 41.2 % to 34.3 %. This contraction reduced the segment’s contribution to overall company revenue and profitability, pulling down consolidated revenues (down 5 % to $42.86 billion) and operating income (down 18 % to $6.86 billion). Consequently, the segment’s performance is a key factor behind the company’s weaker consolidated results for the year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Honeywell detailed a specific methodology for estimating asbestos-related liabilities, including the use of average resolution values over a defined look-back period for both pending and future claims projected through 2059. The company also recorded probable insurance recoveries, factoring in the solvency status of insurers, and acknowledged the uncertainty in projections due to variables like future claims filing rates and disease classifications. By 2024, the disclosure became more generalized, focusing on the unpredictability of litigation outcomes and contingent liabilities without specifying the same detailed methodology. The 2024 filing emphasized broader uncertainties, including the potential impact of new developments, settlement strategies, and evidentiary requirements, but omitted the detailed actuarial assumptions present in the 2023 report.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Honeywell’s asbestos‑related liability disclosures shifted from a more generic statement of uncertainty (2023 pages 46‑50) to a detailed description of the methodology used to estimate future claims and the associated insurance recoveries. In the 2024 filing (pages 36‑39), the company explains that it accrues for pending Bendix asbestos claims using average resolution values from a defined look‑back period and projects future claims through 2059 based on historical filing and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and anticipated resolution values. It also records probable insurance recoveries, but notes that the amount is subject to considerable uncertainty because of potential changes in liability projections, insurer solvency, and evolving coverage interpretations. Consequently, while the 2023 discussion highlighted the inherent unpredictability of asbestos litigation, the 2024 text provides a more specific, quantitative framework for estimating both the liability and the probable insurance recoveries, emphasizing the ongoing reassessment of assumptions and the potential for material variance.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' ownership stake and financial commitment to the Surmont asset in the Canada segment evolve between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), bringing its ownership to 100%. By 2024, there was no indication of any divestiture or change in ownership of Surmont; however, the company disclosed plans to sell noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for approximately $400 million. This highlights a strategic contrast: while COP was acquiring core assets in Canada like Surmont in 2023, it was planning divestitures in other, noncore segments in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips' ownership stake in the Surmont asset in the Canada segment evolved from a 50% working interest to 100% ownership following its October 2023 acquisition of the remaining half from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. The transaction, completed for a total consideration of $3.0 billion (including $2.635 billion cash and $320 million fair‑value contingent consideration), gave ConocoPhillips full control of Surmont’s proved and unproved properties, valued at approximately $2.9 billion and $0.2 billion respectively. The company also settled foreign‑exchange forward contracts to purchase CAD and recognized a $112 million loss on those contracts, while the acquired assets contributed $572 million of revenue and $119 million of net income for the period through December 31, 2023. Subsequent to the acquisition, ConocoPhillips has been finalizing the purchase‑price allocation, with the fair‑value of identifiable assets (oil and gas properties net of asset retirement obligations) amounting to $2.955 billion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde excluded purchase accounting impacts from its non-GAAP measures, emphasizing that these adjustments were critical for investor understanding due to their uneven geographic impact and the fact that management and variable compensation were assessed based on results excluding these impacts. By 2024, purchase accounting impacts were explicitly included in the company's definition of segment operating profit, indicating a shift in how these impacts are communicated and evaluated internally and externally. This evolution reflects a more integrated approach to reporting these adjustments within segment performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Linde's purchase accounting disclosures evolved to explicitly isolate and exclude merger-related impacts—particularly from the Linde AG acquisition—from segment operating profit calculations. By 2024, the company defined segment operating profit as \"operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, cost reduction program and other charges, and items not indicative of ongoing business trends,\" directly shaping management's performance evaluation. This adjustment ensured that reported segment profits (e.g., Americas' 7% operating profit growth to $4,550M in 2024) reflected underlying operational performance rather than accounting effects from the merger, thereby providing a clearer basis for assessing regional business results and allocating resources. The 2024 disclosures also detailed how these exclusions mitigated distortions from fair value step-ups in assets and intangibles, which had previously inflated segment margins in earlier years.",

By 2024, the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment reported $6,030 million in performance obligations, reflecting a measurable financial commitment to this area. This suggests that the company elevated both the strategic and operational emphasis on Energy and Sustainability Solutions through leadership changes and increased contractual financial obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Honeywell’s Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment (including UOP and Advanced Materials) saw its remaining performance obligations grow to $6.03 billion, up from $5.5 billion in 2023, reflecting increased demand for sustainable aviation fuels, carbon‑management technologies, and low‑global‑warming‑potential refrigerants.  The company’s leadership structure was reshaped with Vimal Kapur becoming CEO in June 2023 and Ken West appointed President of Energy and Sustainability Solutions in January 2024, positioning the segment for continued expansion.  Financially, the segment reported $2.14 billion of revenue in 2024 (up from $2.07 billion in 2023), and contract liabilities rose modestly to $4.22 billion, indicating stronger cash‑flow commitments tied to these sustainability contracts.",

By 2024, the Total Non-Marketable Securities increased to $1,370 million, driven by a rise in the Measurement Alternative to $1,140 million and a slight increase in the Equity Method to $230 million. This shows both components contributing to the overall growth in Non-Marketable Securities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the total value of Non‑Marketable Securities rose from $1,223 million to $1,370 million. This growth was driven primarily by the Measurement Alternative component, which increased from $1,008 million to $1,140 million, while the Equity Method component grew modestly from $215 million to $230 million. Consequently, the overall composition shifted toward a larger share of Measurement Alternative investments, with the Equity Method share remaining relatively stable.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power was listed as a Southern Company subsidiary with a capital investment of $2,746 million, but no specific disclosures were made about derivative liabilities or hedging instruments. In 2024, Alabama Power had specific disclosures showing $26 million in total derivatives designated for regulatory purposes, with $42 million in non-current liabilities and $23 million net recognized liabilities on the balance sheet. The 2024 disclosures also included a breakdown of current and non-current portions of these derivatives, indicating a more detailed regulatory reporting structure compared to the general segment reporting in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Alabama Power’s regulatory‑hedge energy derivatives shifted from a $6 million liability (2023) to a $30 million liability (2024), reflecting a $24 million increase in the balance‑sheet liability. The net amounts recognized in its balance sheet also rose from $5 million (2023) to $7 million (2024), indicating a higher net liability position after accounting for offsets. This evolution shows a clear upward trend in both the gross and net liability balances for its hedging program.",

In 2024, Operating Income Excl. increased by 25.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing and volume/mix driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. However, lower manufacturing costs were largely offset by higher marketing, administration, and research costs, and a favorable comparison to the prior year was noted due to the South Korea indirect tax charge of $204 million in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was described as being driven by demand for volume licensing, Software Assurance, and advanced security offerings such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on the number of information workers in enterprises rather than PC sales. By 2023, the revenue categorization expanded to include 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services,' explicitly listing Windows cloud services as a component alongside volume licensing. The inclusion of 'cloud services' in the 2023 breakdown indicates a strategic shift toward integrating cloud-based offerings into the Windows Commercial portfolio. This evolution suggests that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, as part of the broader cloud services, became more embedded within a diversified set of commercial offerings, aligning with the company's emphasis on cloud transformation and subscription-based models. The 2023 filing also introduced a formalized growth metric for this revenue segment, signaling a more structured approach to tracking and expanding this part of the business.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Windows Commercial revenue grew primarily due to increased demand for volume licensing and advanced security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, which are part of its commercial cloud services.

      "original_answer": "The estimated potential contract value in Gulfstream's defense segments increased from $35.9 billion in 2022 to $37.9 billion in 2023, indicating a modest growth in future revenue visibility. This suggests that Gulfstream has seen an expansion in the value of unexercised contract options and unfunded work under IDIQ contracts, which contributes to longer-term revenue potential despite the uncertainty around future funding.",
      "llm_answer": "The estimated potential contract value in Gulfstream's defense segments increased from $35.9 billion at the end of 2022 to $37.9 billion at the end of 2023, reflecting a modest rise in backlog and potential future work. This growth suggests improving revenue visibility for the defense business, as the company anticipates continued funding and option exercises across its combat systems, technologies and marine programs.",

By 2024, the segment experienced a 33% decline in net revenue, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion in 2024, primarily due to customer inventory normalization. Additionally, in 2024, AMD expanded its adaptive computing portfolio with the launch of the new Versal™ Series Gen 2 devices, including the Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs, which focused on end-to-end acceleration of AI-driven embedded systems.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, AMD's Embedded segment revenue declined 33% to $3.6 billion, as customers normalized inventory levels, while the segment's product focus shifted toward higher‑performance embedded CPUs (EPYC, Ryzen Embedded), GPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoCs for markets such as automotive, industrial, and data‑center edge applications. This transition was underscored by new product launches (e.g., Ryzen Embedded 7000 series, Versal Gen 2 devices) and strategic investments to expand AI‑ready embedded solutions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, American Tower recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $402.0 million related to the India and Spain reporting units, with a significant portion attributed to the India reporting unit. In 2024, the company recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million specifically for the India reporting unit as of September 30, 2023. This indicates a continued deterioration in the financial health of the India reporting unit, as its carrying amount still exceeded its estimated fair value even after the prior year's impairment, signaling ongoing challenges in this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The goodwill impairment charge related to the India reporting unit was $322 million for the year ended December 31 2023, as disclosed in the 2023 filing (page 41). In the 2024 filing, the only remaining goodwill associated with India is reflected in the discontinued‑operations balance sheet, and no additional impairment charge is reported for 2024 (page 141). This indicates that the unit’s carrying value was fully written down in 2023, and by 2024 the unit no longer contributes any goodwill to the consolidated balance sheet, signaling that its financial health had deteriorated to the point of being divested.",

In 2024, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix mainly from higher HTU volume, but partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a shift in growth drivers from broad pricing and volume gains across both product lines in 2023 to a more HTU-focused volume/mix benefit in 2024, with some moderation in pricing impact.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $631 million, increased by $201 million, and ended the year at $658 million. In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, increased by $122 million, but after write-offs of $199 million and adjustments for foreign currency, ended at $577 million. This indicates a shift in inventory risk exposure, with a notable reduction in the allowance balance by the end of 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting either improved inventory management or a strategic reduction in inventory holdings.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses increased from $631 million at the end of 2023 to $658 million at the end of 2024, reflecting additions of $201 million and write‑offs of $183 million during the year. This rise indicates that IBM is maintaining a larger reserve for potential inventory obsolescence or excess, suggesting heightened vigilance and a proactive approach to managing inventory‑related risk.",

In 2024, the company maintained a similar level of investment, with plans to spend approximately the same amount during fiscal 2025. This indicates a consistent investment strategy in infrastructure expansion, as evidenced by the opening of 30 new warehouses, including one relocation, in 2024. The capital allocation remained stable, suggesting a deliberate and sustained focus on warehouse development.",

This expansion reflects a strategic focus on infrastructure growth to support future revenue and operational capacity, as evidenced by the company's intention to spend a similar capital expenditure amount in fiscal 2025 as in 2024 ($4.71 billion), primarily financed through operating cash flows and existing liquidity sources.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil reported additional investments and advances of $3.1 billion, while in 2023 this figure slightly decreased to $3.0 billion. However, in 2024, the company increased its additional investments and advances to $3.299 billion. This trend indicates a return to higher strategic investment activity in 2024 after a slight reduction in 2023, suggesting a renewed emphasis on growth-oriented investments.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's additional investments and advances declined slightly from $3.0 billion in 2022 to $0.1 billion in 2023, reflecting a modest reduction in new capital outlays. This downward trend indicates a more restrained investment posture, with the company prioritizing cash preservation and returning capital to shareholders over aggressive expansion during the 2022‑2024 period.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 42,802 thousand, while the average monthly revenue per membership rose slightly to $8.66. This indicates that Netflix experienced both subscriber growth and a modest increase in pricing, likely reflecting a combination of successful market expansion and strategic price adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s average paying memberships grew from 210.8 million to 240.9 million (an ~14% increase), while average monthly revenue per paying membership slipped slightly from $11.67 to $11.64 (a ~1% decline). This modest revenue‑per‑member dip reflects a shift toward lower‑priced plans and higher growth in price‑sensitive regions, even as the subscriber base expanded rapidly. Consequently, the company’s subscriber growth was strong, but pricing pressure limited revenue growth per membership.",

This significant growth indicates an expanding role for the company in government-sponsored healthcare programs, particularly at the state level, suggesting a strategic emphasis on this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's Community & State segment revenue grew from $63.8 billion in 2022 to $75.0 billion in 2023—a 18% increase—driven by higher enrollment and increased premium pricing in Medicaid and other government‑sponsored programs. This expansion underscores the company's strong positioning in public health‑care initiatives, highlighting its growing share of government‑funded coverage and its reliance on these programs for revenue growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe was 30.3%, down from 31.1% in 2022, reflecting a decline of 0.8 percentage points. In 2024, the cigarette market share remained unchanged at 30.3% compared to the prior year, indicating that the rate of decline slowed to zero. This suggests a potential stabilization in PM's cigarette business in Europe, which may reflect strategic adjustments or competitive responses to market pressures, including competition from heated tobacco products which saw continued growth in market share.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe declined slightly from 31.1% to 30.3% (a 0.8-point decrease), while its heated tobacco (HTU) share rose from 7.8% to 9.1% (a 1.3-point increase), contributing to a modest overall regional market share growth of 0.5 points to 39.4%. This shift indicates that while PMI's overall market share is holding steady due to strong growth in the higher-growth HTU category, its core cigarette share is eroding, suggesting a competitive positioning that is increasingly reliant on smoke-free products to offset declines in traditional cigarettes. The accelerating HTU growth (1.3 points in 2023 vs. 1.5 points on an adjusted basis in 2024) signals that PMI's smoke-free strategy is gaining traction in Europe, but the underlying cigarette volume weakness highlights ongoing competitive pressure in the traditional market.",

      "question": "How has IBM's characterization of the relationship between client spending budgets and its business performance evolved between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM described its business as 'depending on' client spending budgets, highlighting that a downturn in economic environment and client spending could impact its revenue and profit. In 2024, the company shifted its framing, describing the relationship as being 'impacted by' client spending budgets and economic conditions. This indicates a more passive but still significant sensitivity to external spending trends, suggesting a strategic reframing of how client budgets influence IBM's business outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM’s view of the link between client spending and its own performance shifted from a broad, growth‑oriented framing in 2023 to a more cautious, risk‑aware emphasis in 2024. In the 2023 filing the company highlighted that “a downturn in economic conditions and client spending budgets could impact the company’s business,” but framed it as one of several strategic challenges. By 2024, the same risk is presented as a direct, material threat that could “impact the company’s revenue and profit,” and it is tied more explicitly to unpredictable client‑budget fluctuations and the uncertainty of emerging AI‑related spending models. This evolution reflects a tighter, more explicit acknowledgment that client‑budget volatility now has a concrete potential to affect IBM’s financial results.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Mastercard classified its net revenues into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions, with the payment network primarily generating revenue from fees based on GDV (including both domestic and cross-border volume) and for providing switching and other network-related services. By 2024, the company consolidated its reporting into a single reportable operating segment called 'Payment Solutions,' which derives revenue from a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers, including access to the continuous payment network and value-added services either integrated or sold standalone. This evolution indicates a shift from a dual classification of revenue sources to a more unified segment reporting approach, where all activities are considered interrelated and supportive of each other.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard’s payment‑network segment continues to be reported as a single operating segment (“Payment Solutions”) in both 2023 and 2024, with the same revenue‑classification approach used in prior years.  The 2024 filing shows the segment’s net revenue of $28.167 billion (up from $25.098 billion in 2023) and the same breakdown of expenses and performance‑based compensation metrics, indicating that the way the segment’s revenue is measured and disclosed has not changed materially between the two periods.  The only evolution is the continued expansion of the segment’s disclosures around hedging activities and derivative accounting, but the classification of the payment‑network revenue itself remains consistent.",

      "question": "How has the use of deal structure data in underwriting consumer loans evolved between 2022 and 2023, based on the specific credit score metrics disclosed for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company underwrote consumer loans using proprietary models that included deal structure data, and Table 21 provided credit score distribution details for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2023, the company continued to incorporate deal structure data into its underwriting process, but Table 21 was updated to reflect credit score distribution metrics as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. This indicates that while the use of deal structure data remained consistent, the underlying credit score metrics used in underwriting evolved to reflect more recent borrower risk profiles.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the use of deal structure data in underwriting consumer loans remained consistent in its reliance on borrower credit scores as a key input, particularly for subprime classification and portfolio segmentation. However, the specific credit score metrics disclosed for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios show a modest shift in score distribution: the proportion of auto loans with FICO scores greater than 660 increased from 50% in 2022 to 53% in 2023, while the share of credit card loans with scores above 660 remained nearly stable at 69% to 68%. This suggests a gradual improvement in credit quality for auto lending but no significant change in underwriting reliance on credit scores year-over-year. The core underwriting framework—using credit scores alongside deal structure data—was unchanged, though the updated industry classification system in 2023 (replacing NAICS with regulatory loan classifications) may have refined how loan segments were reported, without altering the underlying credit risk assessment methodology.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT evaluated strategic alternatives for its India operations, receiving third-party indications of value that were lower than the carrying value of the India reporting unit. This information was used as a significant input in determining the fair value of the unit during the goodwill impairment test, although no impairment was explicitly recorded in that year. By contrast, in 2024, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, leading to a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This marks a shift from a potential strategic exit with uncertain impairment implications to a concrete recognition of value loss.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the India reporting unit on AMT evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024, marked by a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge recorded in September 2023 due to declining value indicators and third-party assessments of the India unit’s fair value. This impairment preceded the sale of the India operations (ATC TIPL) in September 2024, which generated $2.1 billion in proceeds and resulted in a $1.2 billion loss on sale, reflecting the cumulative translation adjustment and the unit’s exit from the market. The impairment and subsequent divestiture underscore the unit’s deteriorating financial position, with no remaining goodwill or assets retained post-sale.",

By 2023, Amgen's disclosures revealed a shift in the composition and sourcing of these rights, noting that developed-product-technology rights now included assets acquired through the Horizon and ChemoCentryx acquisitions. This marks a change from 2022, where no such specific acquisitions were cited in the description of these rights. The inclusion of these new acquisitions in 2023 suggests a strategic expansion in Amgen’s portfolio of developed-product-technology rights, likely influencing the valuation and structure of these assets.",

Acquisition activity shifted toward larger, strategic purchases—most notably the $1.1 bn IPR&D and associated finite‑lived intangibles from the Teneobio deal in 2021 and the $783 m impairment of AMG 340 in 2023—while lease‑related financing remained stable, with total lease liabilities rising to $810 m (2023) from $695 m (2022) and weighted‑average lease terms extending to 9.7 years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 11.2%, driven by favorable volume/mix primarily from higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume and unfavorable smoke-free product mix, along with favorable pricing variance. In 2024, this growth slowed to 8.6%, still driven by favorable pricing variance and volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, with lower cigarette volume as a partial offset. The decline in growth rate from 11.2% to 8.6% indicates a moderation in the rate of expansion despite continued strength in HTU volume.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions grew by 8.6% in the EA, AU & PMI DF segment and by 19.3% in the Americas, driven primarily by favorable pricing and volume/mix gains—especially higher heated tobacco unit (HTU) volumes—partly offset by lower cigarette volumes. Operating income growth mirrored this trend, rising 25.1% in EA, AU & PMI DF and declining 41.1% in the Americas due to higher marketing, administration, and research costs and restructuring charges.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums could negatively impact its financial results, particularly outside the United States, due to the potential for significant premium increases driven by the insolvencies of unrelated companies. However, in 2024, the company expanded its discussion to include more detailed context on how it manages broader financial risks, such as currency and financing risks, which may indirectly influence the impact of these premiums. Despite this broader framing, there was no explicit quantitative change in the disclosed exposure related to pension insolvency insurance premiums between the two years, indicating a stable risk profile for this specific item.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on IBM's 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, there is no indication that pension insolvency insurance premiums have had a material financial impact on the company's results of operations in either year. The disclosures specifically note that premium increases for mandatory pension insolvency insurance outside the U.S. could be significant due to insolvencies of unrelated companies, but they do not report any actual premium costs or material impacts on results of operations for 2023 or 2024. The company's pension-related risks are described as potential future exposures, not realized financial impacts.",

      "question": "How did UPS's Transformation Strategy Costs evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic investment focus during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, UPS reported Total Transformation Strategy Costs of $118 million, primarily driven by increases in Forwarding ($68 million) and Logistics ($48 million). By 2024, these costs decreased to $77 million, with Transformation 2.0 initiatives such as 'Spans and Layers,' 'Business Portfolio Review,' and 'Financial Systems' accounting for $47 million in 2023 and $20 million in 2024. This indicates a strategic shift from broader transformation efforts to more targeted efficiency and network optimization initiatives like 'Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined' in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, UPS's Transformation Strategy Costs declined sharply from $435 million to $322 million—a reduction of $113 million (about 26%). This decrease reflects the winding down of earlier phases (Transformation 1.0 and the bulk of Transformation 2.0) and the transition toward newer initiatives such as Fit‑to‑Serve and the Network Reconfiguration/Efficiency Reimagined programs, which are now being funded separately. The declining transformation spend signals that the company is moving past large‑scale restructuring and is focusing its strategic investment on operational efficiency, network redesign, and growth‑oriented projects rather than further organizational overhauls.",

By 2024, Alphabet's involvement in Other Bets evolved into a more active investment and development approach, with a focus on 'using technology to solve big problems' across industries like transportation and health technology. The 2024 report also highlights that some Other Bets are 'already generating revenue and making important strides,' showing a shift from early-stage exploration to more mature, revenue-generating ventures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Alphabet’s strategic involvement in Other Bets shifted from a broad, R&D‑heavy portfolio toward a more focused, investment‑driven approach that emphasizes monetizable, high‑growth initiatives. While early‑stage “moonshots” remain, the company increasingly channels capital into businesses that can generate near‑term revenue—particularly health‑tech and internet services—while maintaining a long‑term horizon for frontier technologies such as AI and autonomous systems. This evolution reflects a tighter operational focus on scaling proven ventures and leveraging them for sustainable, diversified revenue streams.",

      "question": "How did Tesla's relationship with its Megafactory in Lathrop, California evolve between 2022 and 2023 in terms of facility ownership status and strategic implications?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Tesla began construction of its Megafactory in Lathrop, California, signaling a strategic commitment to expand its energy storage production capacity to meet high demand. By 2023, the facility was listed as 'Leased' in Tesla's primary manufacturing facilities table, indicating that while Tesla is still utilizing the site, it does not own the property outright, which may reflect a shift in capital allocation strategy or facility management approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, Tesla's relationship with its Megafactory in Lathrop, California evolved significantly between 2022 and 2023 in terms of ownership status and strategic implications. In the 2022 filing (page 30), the Megafactory was listed as a leased facility, with the company owning only the building and land use rights (treated as operating lease ROU assets). By the 2023 filing (page 31), the facility remained classified as leased, but its strategic importance was underscored as part of Tesla's broader energy storage expansion plans, explicitly tied to increasing production capacity for Megapack and addressing component constraints. This strategic shift is further contextualized in the 2023 \"Energy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\" section (page 34), which highlights the Megafactory as a critical component of Tesla's strategy to scale energy storage production, improve margins through volume, and support its goal of \"increasing capacity at our current manufacturing facilities and adding future facilities.\" The 2023 filing also notes that production at the Megafactory (and other facilities) was impacted by \"industry-wide semiconductor and other component shortages,\" requiring \"workaround manufacturing and production design solutions,\" indicating that the facility's operational success remained contingent on overcoming these challenges to meet demand. Thus, while ownership status remained leased (with land use rights), the strategic implications evolved from initial development (2022) to a recognized cornerstone of Tesla's energy storage growth strategy (2023), directly supporting its broader objective of scaling energy products and improving profitability through higher-volume manufacturing.",

In contrast, in 2024, the increase in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, was significantly higher at 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a substantial improvement in revenue performance from 2023 to 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, PM's net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions showed divergent regional trends: in the Americas, they rose 19.3% (driven by growth in ZYN nicotine pouches and favorable pricing), while in Europe, they increased 8.6% (led by higher HTU volume), and in SSEA, CIS & MEA, they surged 11.7% (boosted by pricing and volume/mix). However, the overall regional performance varied significantly, with the Americas showing strong growth but Europe and SSEA, CIS & MEA experiencing mixed results. The key drivers were favorable volume/mix (particularly from HTU and ZYN growth), favorable pricing variances, and regional market share gains, though these were partially offset by unfavorable mix in some regions (e.g., lower cigarette volume in the Americas and Australia) and higher costs in certain areas.",

By fiscal 2023, this reserve increased significantly by approximately $106 million, reaching $245 million as of February 2, 2024. This substantial increase indicates that LOW anticipated higher losses associated with inventory becoming obsolete, suggesting a shift in inventory risk exposure, possibly due to changes in consumer purchasing patterns or product quality concerns.",

This upward shift signals that Lowe’s is confronting greater inventory‑obsolescence risk—likely due to shifting consumer demand and supply‑chain pressures—prompting the company to bolster its reserve as a proactive measure to manage potential future impairments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT's property revenue from Africa was $1,192.5 million, reflecting a 13% increase from the prior year. In 2023, the company reported $1,225.6 million in property revenue from Africa, representing a more modest 3% increase compared to 2022. This indicates a slowdown in the growth rate of property revenue from Africa, suggesting a potential stabilization or maturation of the company's operations in the region after a period of rapid expansion.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Africa’s property revenue increased from $747.4 million to $792.3 million, a 6% rise. This growth reflects higher tenant billings and pass‑through revenues, though it was partially offset by rising direct expenses. The modest expansion suggests AMT is steadily consolidating its African portfolio, but the region’s contribution remains limited relative to its larger markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE reported that changes in non-qualifying hedge activity were primarily driven by fluctuations in forward power and natural gas prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates, with specific mention of $1,735 million in losses for 2021 being included in NEER's net income. By 2023, the change in non-qualifying hedge activity contributed a $2,986 million increase to net income compared to the prior year. This indicates a significant shift from a source of earnings volatility to a substantial earnings contributor, reflecting a reversal in the direction and magnitude of the impact from these activities.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of non-qualifying hedge activity on NEE's net income shifted dramatically from a $649 million loss in 2022 to a $2,986 million gain in 2023, contributing to a $3,273 million increase in net income attributable to NEE. This swing reflects heightened earnings volatility, as the gains and losses from these hedges are recorded directly in net income without offsetting adjustments, making earnings more sensitive to market price movements.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle described its Services Business as one of three operating segments, but the strategic positioning focused primarily on general enterprise IT environments with a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies. The Services Business was not explicitly tied to cloud adoption but rather positioned as a flexible offering across deployment models. By fiscal 2023, Oracle significantly evolved its strategic positioning of the Services Business, explicitly linking it to cloud adoption and customer support. The 2023 filing emphasized that customers could 'continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments.' This included integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and AI-enhanced offerings like Oracle Autonomous Database, which used machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions. The Services Business in 2023 was framed as a key enabler of cloud migration and customer retention, with a focus on supporting Oracle Cloud Services contracts and product enhancements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2023, Oracle shifted its Services Business strategy to emphasize cloud adoption and integrated support. In 2023, the company highlighted expanded cloud services and license support revenues (now representing 71% of total revenue) and introduced programs to help customers migrate existing workloads to Oracle Cloud, offering flexible deployment models (cloud, hybrid, on-premise) and subscription-based SaaS options. This reflects a strategic pivot toward cloud-centric customer support and migration, moving away from traditional on-premise license support toward cloud-based services as the primary growth driver.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported capturing $9.7 billion of structural cost savings compared to 2019, including $2.3 billion of savings realized specifically during that year. By 2024, the company continued to emphasize structural cost savings as a key earnings driver, incorporating it into its newly introduced earnings driver framework. While the 2024 disclosure does not provide a new cumulative savings figure, the explicit inclusion of structural cost savings as a defined earnings driver indicates a strategic shift to institutionalize cost efficiency as a recurring component of earnings performance. This evolution shows that XOM transitioned from achieving cost savings as a阶段性 initiative to embedding it as a core financial metric in its reporting and operational strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's structural cost savings accelerated from $2.3 billion realized in 2023 to an estimated $12.1 billion cumulative savings by 2024, reflecting ongoing workforce reductions, operational efficiencies and divestment‑related cuts that are now embedded in its cost base. This demonstrates a deliberate, sustainability‑focused cost‑management strategy aimed at preserving margins amid volatile commodity prices and inflationary pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, the Core Routing portfolio contributed to flat revenue in the routed optical networking segment, with growth specifically attributed to the Cisco 8000 series offerings and the webscale provider market. By fiscal 2023, the Core routing portfolio continued to grow, contributing to an overall 18% increase in the Networking product category. This growth was driven by Catalyst 8000 routers, SD-WAN, and IoT routing offerings. Therefore, the Core Routing portfolio evolved from maintaining stability in revenue during fiscal 2022 to actively driving growth in fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue performance of Cisco's Core Routing portfolio, as reflected in the Networking product category, declined by 15% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, decreasing by $5.3 billion. This decline was driven by reductions in campus and data center switching, particularly in the Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 series, as well as in wireless (WiFi-6 and Meraki) and routed optical networking. However, growth in SD-WAN offerings provided some offset. In contrast, fiscal 2023 showed an 18% increase in Networking revenue, primarily due to strong growth in Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000 series switches, Meraki offerings, and Catalyst 8000 routers, indicating a prior upward trend before the recent downturn.",

This indicates a significant decline in profitability relative to revenue, suggesting challenges in cost management or a shift in operational efficiency during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit margin declined from 48.8% of revenue in 2022 to 41.8% in 2023, reflecting weaker profitability. This shift indicates deteriorating cost management, as lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs (driven by planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings) pressured margins despite stable operating expenses. The decline suggests challenges in maintaining profitability amid shifting market demand and increased investment in infrastructure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One provided a comprehensive explanation of its net charge-off policies, including a detailed breakdown of charge-off methodologies by loan type and a historical table (Table 26) showing net charge-off amounts and rates for 2019 through 2021. By 2023, this level of detail was no longer included; instead, the company only provided a brief definition of net charge-off rates without historical data or specific loan category breakdowns. This represents a significant reduction in transparency regarding credit quality and charge-off practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Capital One significantly enhanced transparency in its allowance for credit losses disclosures by adding detailed policy explanations and contextual metrics across multiple sections of its 10-K. The 2023 filing (pages 96-100, 105-109) explicitly clarifies methodology for calculating net charge-off rates, nonperforming loan ratios, and the impact of accounting standard changes (ASU 2022-02), while also providing expanded narrative on how collection strategies, credit quality assessments, and loan modification practices (including TDRs and FDMs) directly influence allowance estimates. This contrasts with the 2022 filing (pages 105-109), which focused more on quantitative tables without the same depth of explanatory context around policy nuances and forward-looking estimates. The 2023 disclosures also detail the \"other changes\" component of allowance adjustments and explicitly link reserve methodology to loan portfolio risk profiles, demonstrating a marked improvement in transparency around credit quality and policy details.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle reported hardware expenses of $972 million, which decreased to $891 million in fiscal year 2023. This indicates a reduction in the costs associated with its hardware business, suggesting improved cost management or a strategic shift in operations. This change aligns with Oracle's broader focus on higher-margin offerings and optimization efforts in its hardware segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's hardware expenses declined from $891 million in fiscal 2023 to $891 million? Actually page_68 shows hardware expense $891 M in 2024, $1,040 M in 2023, $972 M in 2022. So hardware expense decreased from $1,040 M (2023) to $891 M (2024), indicating tighter cost control. This reduction reflects Oracle's focus on higher‑margin engineered systems and de‑emphasis of lower‑margin commodity hardware, contributing to improved profitability in its hardware segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil described the Specialty Products segment as part of its Product Solutions business, emphasizing its role in integration with Energy Products and Chemical Products to reduce risk from commodity price fluctuations. The segment was positioned within a long-term corporate planning framework supported by the Global Outlook and annual Corporate Plan. By 2024, the company elevated the strategic importance of Specialty Products by categorizing it under 'Advantaged Projects' and explicitly linking it to value creation through integration, higher-value product yields, and above-average returns. Additionally, in 2024, Specialty Products were tied to performance chemicals and lubricants, highlighting differentiation and customer value enhancement, a shift from the broader integrated business model focus of 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's Specialty Products segment has evolved from a standalone focus to being integrated within the broader Product Solutions business, reflecting a strategic shift toward value creation through integration. The segment's earnings (excluding identified items) grew from $2,807 million in 2022 to $3,065 million in 2024, driven by improved performance in specialty chemicals and lubricants, while its integration into the Product Solutions structure—aligned with the company's 2023 reorganization—enhances cross-segment synergies and capital allocation efficiency. This evolution underscores a strategic emphasis on leveraging specialty products as a high-margin growth engine within ExxonMobil's integrated value chain, particularly through initiatives like the Pioneer acquisition and targeted investments in lower-emission technologies.",

      "llm_answer": "Cisco's Observability revenue increased by $176 million (27%) from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, driven primarily by growth in ThousandEyes and the contribution from the Observability Suite and Splunk, as noted in the Management Discussion (page 41). This growth helped lift the Observability product‑category revenue to $837 million and contributed to a higher overall product gross margin, indicating strong performance and expanding market traction for Cisco's Observability portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Company monitored tenant-related intangible assets for impairment based on indicators such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. By 2023, the Company expanded its criteria to include an additional indicator: 'the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations.' This evolution reflects a more comprehensive approach to assessing potential impairments by incorporating financial performance indicators of tenants alongside existing operational and contractual indicators.",
      "llm_answer": "The Company’s monitoring and impairment assessment criteria for tenant‑related intangible assets remained largely unchanged from 2022 to 2023, continuing to evaluate recoverability on a tenant‑by‑tenant basis using indicators such as turnover, non‑renewal, or contract termination and projecting undiscounted future cash flows. In 2023, the Company introduced a new indicator of impairment tied to “high levels of turnover or attrition” and added a specific assessment of “the customer’s ability to meet its contractual obligations,” expanding the scope of its impairment testing beyond the prior year’s focus on lease‑related vacancy and expense excess.",

This increase was driven by several large contract awards, including a $1.7 billion award for munitions and ordnance with a maximum potential value of $3.2 billion, and a $1 billion award for 155mm projectile production with a potential value of $2.4 billion.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Cisco's APJC segment had a balance of $5,360 million. By fiscal year 2024, this balance increased to $5,382 million, reflecting a modest increase of $22 million. This change includes $16 million attributed to acquisitions and $6 million due to foreign currency translation and other adjustments. The overall change in allocation was minor, showing limited movement in investment focus for the APJC region between the two fiscal years.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K filings, Cisco's investment allocation for the APJC segment increased from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2024. The APJC segment's goodwill balance rose from $5,382 million at the end of fiscal 2023 to $8,208 million at the end of fiscal 2024, reflecting a $2,826 million increase. This growth was driven by $2,702 million of goodwill allocated to APJC from the Splunk acquisition (as detailed in the \"Goodwill\" section of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 74), along with additional $137 million from other acquisitions. The magnitude of this change is $2,826 million (or approximately 52.7% growth) in goodwill specifically attributed to the APJC segment.",

In 2022, the company reported $210.842 billion in total medical costs, with $206.577 billion paid out during the year, leaving a smaller increase in payable liabilities. In contrast, 2023 saw $241.894 billion in total medical costs and $238.556 billion in payments, indicating a larger buildup of unpaid liabilities compared to the prior year. This suggests that UNH's liability for medical costs grew more significantly in 2023, reflecting either higher incurred costs or a strategic shift in payment timing.",
      "llm_answer": "UNH's medical costs payable increased from $29,056 million at the end of 2022 to $32,395 million at the end of 2023, reflecting a $3,339 million rise driven by higher current‑year medical costs ($242,734 million in 2023 versus $211,252 million in 2022) and increased payments for prior‑year claims, while the beginning balance and prior‑year reserve development were relatively modest. This growth indicates that the company's liability for ongoing medical obligations expanded year‑over‑year, suggesting that current‑year claim inflows outpaced the resolution of prior‑year reserves, thereby tightening the short‑term liquidity position related to medical cost commitments.",

      "question": "How did the use of prior payment history in estimating U.S. rebate accruals evolve between 2023 and 2024, given the changes in the accrued balance for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D rebates?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the accrued balance for U.S. rebate accruals related to Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D was $2.3 billion, and the company used prior payment history as a key input in estimating the expected provision for rebates. In 2024, this accrued balance decreased slightly to $2.2 billion, and prior payment history continued to be used as a foundational element in the estimation process. The slight decrease in the accrued balance suggests a minor adjustment in expected rebate obligations, which may reflect either a refinement in the use of prior payment data or a shift in rebate claim trends. This indicates that while the methodology remained consistent, the underlying assumptions or data inputs based on prior payment history may have evolved slightly to reflect updated trends in rebate claims.",
      "llm_answer": "The use of prior payment history in estimating U.S. rebate accruals was retained but refined in 2024 to improve accuracy, as evidenced by the critical audit matter discussion in the 2024 filing. Management continued to rely on historical customer segment utilization mix, pricing information, inventory levels, and prior payment history—alongside other assumptions—to estimate rebate provisions, with the accrued balance for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D rebates remaining material at $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. The core methodology remained consistent, though the audit highlighted the significant judgment and subjectivity involved in these estimates.",

However, in 2024, the segment experienced a 9% decrease in revenue, dropping to $12,389 million from $13,583 million in the prior year. This shift from growth to decline indicates a negative trend in the segment's performance over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The percentage change in Resource Industries revenue between 2023 and 2024 was a decrease of 9%, as reported in the document. This decline was primarily driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization, indicating a downward trend in the segment's performance.",

      "question": "How did JPM's approach to accounting for tax-related assets and liabilities, particularly in relation to expected future tax consequences, evolve between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM disclosed that due to the complexities of its business and tax jurisdictions, significant judgments were required, and final tax-related assets and liabilities might differ from those currently reported. By 2024, JPM adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2024, for Investments in Tax Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method, applied under the modified retrospective method, signaling a specific procedural update in how tax consequences are accounted for. This indicates a shift from general acknowledgment of complexity and estimation risk to the implementation of a new structured accounting methodology for tax-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K disclosures, JPMorgan Chase's approach to accounting for tax-related assets and liabilities, particularly regarding expected future tax consequences, remained consistent in methodology but evolved in key details between 2023 and 2024. The core asset-and-liability method for deferred taxes (Note 25, page 287) continued to be applied, requiring deferred tax assets/liabilities to be measured using enacted rates expected at the time of realization, with a valuation allowance established if realizability is uncertain. However, the 2024 filings (page 299) explicitly note the adoption of updated guidance for tax credit investments (effective January 1, 2024, referenced in Note 25), which impacted the recognition of related deferred tax assets and liabilities. Additionally, the 2024 deferred tax asset balance ($17,600 million) showed a slight decrease from 2023 ($17,910 million), driven by a valuation allowance increase ($249 million vs. $183 million), primarily due to non-U.S. NOL carryforwards, while the net deferred tax asset position increased to $12,175 million from $10,148 million due to reduced deferred tax liabilities. The effective tax rate also rose to 22.1% in 2024 from 19.6% in 2023 (page 296), partly attributed to changes in tax credits and the First Republic acquisition's tax impact.",

This change signals that Mondelēz’s exposure to foreign‑currency‑denominated assets and liabilities is being managed, with the remeasurement effect gradually increasing its contribution to profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GD's Marine Systems segment contributed to revenue growth driven by U.S. Navy ship construction. By 2023, the segment's performance was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program. These challenges were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis-class (TAO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program in 2023. Additionally, GD highlighted increased risk in 2023 around variable consideration for long-term U.S. Navy contracts, particularly the Virginia-class submarine program, indicating a shift toward greater financial uncertainty compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GD's Marine Systems segment revenue grew from $11.04 billion to $12.46 billion, driven primarily by increased U.S. Navy ship construction—including progress on the Virginia‑class submarine and Arleigh Burke‑class destroyer programs—while operating margin slipped to 8.3% from 8.6% due to supply‑chain challenges affecting the Columbia‑class submarine schedule and cost growth on the DDG‑51 program, though these were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis‑class oiler. The segment’s backlog of $93.6 billion is expected to convert to roughly 40% of revenue in 2024 and an additional 40% by the end of 2026, underscoring continued reliance on long‑term Navy contracts.",

In 2024, the net revenue from the payment network rose to $17,335 million. This represents a significant increase from 2023, continuing the trend of growth in both the core payment network and associated customer incentives.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, net revenue from Mastercard's payment network increased by **10%** from 2023 to 2024, as reported in the 2024 Form 10-K (page 81), which states: \"Net revenue from our payment network increased 10%, on both an as reported and currency neutral basis, in 2023 versus 2022.\" However, the question asks for the evolution **from 2023 to 2024**, meaning the change between the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years. The document explicitly provides the 2023-to-2022 growth (10%), but does not state the 2023-to-2024 growth directly. The 2024 Form 10-K (page 81) shows payment network net revenue grew from **$15,824 million in 2023 to $17,335 million in 2024**, representing a **9.5% increase** (calculated as ($17,335 - $15,824) / $15,824 ≈ 9.5%). This aligns with the \"10% increase\" referenced in the 2023-to-2022 context but reflects the actual 2023-to-2024 change. Thus, the magnitude of change is approximately **10%**.  \n\n**Answer**: Net revenue from Mastercard's payment network grew by **10%** from 2023 to 2024, with the magnitude of change being **10%**.",

      "original_answer": "For the 10-year period ending December 31, 2023, the actual annualized total return was approximately 6.60% for U.S. plan assets and 4.90% for non-U.S. plan assets. In contrast, for the 10-year period ending December 31, 2024, the actual annualized total return increased to 7.20% for U.S. plan assets but decreased to 4.00% for non-U.S. plan assets. This indicates a positive performance trend for the U.S. plans, while the non-U.S. plans experienced a decline in performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial disclosures, the actual annualized total return for U.S. pension plan assets was approximately 6.60% for the 10-year period ending December 31, 2023, and is projected to be approximately 7.20% for the 10-year period ending December 31, 2024. For non-U.S. pension plan assets, the actual annualized total return was approximately 4.90% for the 10-year period ending December 31, 2023, and is projected to be approximately 4.00% for the 10-year period ending December 31, 2024. This indicates a modest improvement in U.S. plan performance (from 6.60% to 7.20%) but a slight decline in non-U.S. plan returns (from 4.90% to 4.00%), reflecting evolving investment strategies and market conditions that are being monitored to align with long-term liability management objectives.",

By 2023, the company expanded the detail of cost categories to include stock-based compensation and facilities expenses under personnel-related costs. This evolution indicates a more nuanced breakdown of internal cost drivers tied to content production and talent management.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, amortization of content assets grew modestly, rising from $17,332 million to $19,715 million—a 3% increase—driven largely by higher spending on new and existing titles. The 2023 disclosure placed greater emphasis on “other costs of revenues,” noting a $376 million rise in expenses tied to content acquisition, licensing and production, as well as streaming delivery and payment‑processing fees. No new cost categories were introduced; the added focus was on highlighting these ancillary cost drivers alongside the traditional content amortization.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a decrease of $428 million due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and expected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a strategic shift toward significantly reducing or eliminating postretirement medical costs over the medium term.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 Disney’s post‑retirement medical expense outlook shifted from a projected net benefit of $29 million in 2022 to a projected net benefit of $81 million in 2023—a $428 million decrease in expense, driven mainly by lower amortization of prior‑year losses, partially offset by higher interest costs. This reduction signals that the company expects these medical liabilities to continue declining over the long term, reflecting improved funding and cost‑management trends.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Merck recorded $190 million in pretax costs related to the upcoming 2024 Restructuring Program, which included facility shut-down expenses as a key component. By 2024, the company disclosed that the cumulative pretax costs for this restructuring program were estimated at $4.0 billion, with facility shut-down costs continuing to represent a significant portion of the cash outlays. This indicates a substantial increase in restructuring activity and signals an escalation in the execution phase of the program, aligning with the company’s plan to optimize its global manufacturing networks for both Human and Animal Health. The shift from initial costs in 2023 to broader implementation in 2024 reveals a deliberate scaling of restructuring efforts.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 Merck recorded $190 million of pretax facility shut‑down costs as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program, and the company later disclosed that it incurred $888 million of aggregate pretax restructuring costs in 2024 (including the $190 million already noted). This shows that the 2024 program moved from an initial reserve of $115 million at the start of 2023 to $115 million of reserves at year‑end 2023, with $190 million of expenses recognized in 2023 and further costs expected to be incurred through 2031, reflecting a multi‑year, multi‑billion‑dollar restructuring effort.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment faced significant operating cash flow challenges due to lower deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers, with net cash used by operating activities reaching $3.4 billion in 2021. The company had $16.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $58.1 billion in debt as of December 31, 2021, and anticipated continued negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramped up. By 2024, the Commercial Airplanes segment reported a contractual backlog of $498,802 million, up slightly from $497,094 million in 2023, indicating a gradual recovery in order book stability. While liquidity improved as the company moved past the worst of the 737 MAX and pandemic-related disruptions, the segment was still not fully back to pre-crisis financial health, though the trend suggests improvement.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment experienced significant operating cash flow challenges, with operating cash flow turning increasingly negative as losses widened. In 2024, the segment reported a $7,969 million loss from operations, driven by reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, lower deliveries, and production disruptions, despite $22,861 million in revenue (34% of total company revenue). The backlog value stood at $435,175 million in 2024, slightly down from $440,507 million in 2023, with contractual backlog at $498,802 million. While backlog remained stable, the segment's financial exposure intensified due to lower margins, higher research and development costs, and ongoing supply chain pressures, contributing to sustained negative operating cash flow until commercial deliveries recover.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that it did not include any estimated obligation for future titles beyond the known minimum amount but noted that these unknown obligations were expected to be significant. In 2023, the company reiterated this approach but added more emphasis on the significance of these unknown obligations, explicitly stating that 'the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.' This represents a qualitative evolution in the company's disclosure, signaling increased awareness or risk communication around future content liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix’s disclosure regarding obligations for unknown future content titles remained consistent in structure but reflected updated quantitative figures. In both years, the company noted that while certain license agreements involve obligations for unknown future titles—such as traditional film output deals or TV series with unspecified seasons—the ultimate quantity and fees are not determinable as of the reporting date. These unknown obligations are expected to be significant, though the company does not include estimated amounts beyond known minimums in its financial statements. The disclosed total content obligations increased from $21.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, to $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2023 (reflecting timing and translation adjustments), with $14.6 billion and $14.2 billion respectively representing unrecorded obligations due to unmet recognition criteria. The evolution shows continued reliance on non-recognition of future title commitments until availability, with no material change in the nature or estimation methodology between the two periods.",

      "question": "How did Disney's financial relationship with the Asia Theme Parks evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its management agreements and borrowing disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort) in its financial statements due to its management agreements, which granted its subsidiaries the power to direct the parks' day-to-day operations and strategic development, despite owning less than 50% equity. By 2023, the 10-K filing included specific financial disclosures showing that Disney reported $128 million in borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks for fiscal year 2025 and $1,164 million in borrowings thereafter. This indicates a shift from primarily qualitative consolidation justification in 2022 to more detailed quantitative disclosure of the financial obligations tied to the Asia Theme Parks in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Disney's management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong and Shanghai) remained in place, but the company continued to consolidate these entities in its financial statements due to its control through management companies. The 2023 10-K (page 102) confirms the ongoing consolidation of Asia Theme Parks borrowings, which totaled $1,292 million at September 28, 2024 (up from $1,308 million in 2023), with interest rates tied to floating benchmarks like HIBOR and cross-currency swaps. Borrowing disclosures (page 100) detail that these borrowings are excluded from the Company's bank facilities and covenants, with the Asia Theme Parks specifically excluded from financial covenants. The 2023 filing also notes that Shendi provided $8.6 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) in loans to Shanghai Disney Resort at 8% interest, maturing in 2036, and a $2.6 billion credit line at 8%, though no balance was outstanding as of September 28, 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.' The removal of 'home builders' could imply a strategic shift away from partnerships with home construction firms, potentially signaling a reduced emphasis on new home purchase financing or a refocusing of referral partnerships within the retail mortgage channel.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, JPMorgan Chase removed any specific reference to “home builders” as a borrower referral source in its Retail Mortgage Origination Channel description, shifting focus toward other channels such as direct borrower interaction and correspondent lending. This omission suggests a strategic pivot away from relying on home builders for mortgage acquisition, potentially signaling a broader reallocation of resources toward more direct or diversified origination pathways, possibly to mitigate dependence on the housing construction sector amid market volatility.",

The company's reserve development is highly sensitive to completion factors, as shown by a $880 million impact for a 0.75 % decrease in those factors and a $1,128 million impact for a 3 % increase in medical‑cost trend factors, illustrating that modest changes in these actuarial assumptions can materially affect the reported medical‑costs payable.",

By 2024, this impact was no longer present, and instead, AOCI decreased significantly, with a total balance of $ (3,218) million at the end of 2024, indicating a reversal or absorption of the prior-year adjustment related to Veralto.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the Veralto distribution on Danaher's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) shifted dramatically from a $1,748 million balance at the end of 2023 to a $3,218 million deficit by the end of 2024, reflecting a $1,470 million net decrease in AOCI that was driven primarily by the $983 million foreign‑currency translation adjustment and related tax effects recorded in 2024. This change represents a substantial deterioration in Danaher's AOCI position between 2023 and 2024.",

In 2024, inventory shrink is explicitly listed as a component of the cost of sales, indicating it is now formally recognized and accounted for as a direct cost of merchandise operations. This shift reflects a more structured financial acknowledgment of inventory shrink within the company's expense framework.",

The go-to-market strategy focused on a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies and systems integrators.\n\nBy fiscal 2024, Adobe expanded its differentiation by emphasizing natively embedded AI services and end-to-end content supply chain solutions within the Adobe Experience Cloud. These AI services included attribution, automated insights, customer journey management, and one-click personalization, all working with Adobe Experience Platform. The go-to-market strategy also evolved, with a stronger emphasis on C-suite partnerships, transformational accounts, and a scaled approach to customer acquisition and value realization. Additionally, Adobe highlighted strategic investments in expanding its ecosystem of partners and routes to market, aiming to drive continued revenue growth in the Digital Experience segment for fiscal 2025 and beyond.",

      "question": "How has the financial performance of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security segment evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the segment's operational trajectory?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment reported an operating loss of $3.544 billion. By 2024, the operating loss for the same segment had increased to $5.413 billion. This indicates a significant worsening in the financial performance of the BDS segment over this two-year period. While other segments like Global Services showed improvement, the BDS segment experienced growing losses, suggesting ongoing challenges or increased costs in defense and space programs.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 the Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment’s operating performance deteriorated sharply: loss from operations rose from $3,544 million in 2022 to $5,413 million in 2024, and core operating loss widened from $4,662 million to $11,811 million. This deterioration reflects higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch‑up adjustments on fixed‑price development programs, production disruptions, supplier constraints and rising costs, which have compressed margins and cash flow. Consequently, the segment’s trajectory points to continued earnings pressure and margin compression rather than recovery, indicating a challenging operational outlook despite stable demand for defense products.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil defined Structural Cost Savings as sustainable decreases in cash operating expenses (excluding energy and production taxes) compared to 2019 levels, with cumulative savings totaling $9.7 billion. The company emphasized internal stewardship to support management oversight over time. By 2024, Structural Cost Savings were reframed as an earnings driver, with a focus on after-tax earnings effects and inclusion of cash operating expenses related to divestments previously captured in volume/mix drivers. This shift indicates a broader integration of cost savings into financial reporting and performance analysis.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to Structural Cost Savings has evolved in definition and internal management between 2023 and 2024. In the 2023 filing (page 38), structural cost savings were described as cumulative savings from operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and divestment-related reductions, targeting $12.1 billion relative to 2019 levels, with $9.7 billion estimated by 2023. By 2024 (page 38), the target remained aligned with $12.1 billion cumulative savings but was contextualized within updated financial metrics, including revised expense components and sustainability assessments. Internally, the company emphasizes stewardship of these savings through disciplined expense management, integrating them into capital allocation and operational strategies, while refining methodologies to isolate sustainable reductions from transient market-driven cost fluctuations. This evolution reflects a more structured and measurable focus on long-term cost optimization, as detailed in the 2024 \"Structural Cost Savings\" section.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Payment Network contributed 11% to Mastercard's net revenue growth, reflecting its strong operational performance and a key role in driving revenue. By 2024, the Payment Network was fully integrated into the newly defined 'Payment Solutions' segment, which Mastercard now treats as its sole reportable operating segment. This shift indicates a strategic move toward unifying its payment network with value-added services under a single framework, emphasizing holistic payment solutions rather than distinguishing between core network operations and supplementary services. The consolidation of reporting and the repositioning of the Payment Network within a broader segment reflect a significant transformation in how Mastercard organizes and evaluates its core business performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard’s Payment Network contribution to net revenue growth accelerated modestly, rising 10% in 2023 versus 2022 (up from 9% in 2022 versus 2021) and driving overall net‑revenue growth of 13% in 2023, while its share of total net revenue remained stable at roughly 63% (15,824 ÷ 25,098).  Within the broader Payment Solutions segment, the network’s growth was complemented by a faster‑growing value‑added services and solutions line (18% growth in 2023), underscoring a strategic shift toward higher‑margin offerings.  Consequently, the network’s stronger contribution helped lift the segment’s overall performance and reinforced Mastercard’s positioning as a diversified payments platform rather than relying solely on core transaction fees.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the net interest expense was $200 million, calculated from $480 million in interest incurred on debt and other, partially offset by $197 million in interest income. By 2024, the net interest expense increased to $256 million, driven by a rise in interest incurred on debt and other to $555 million, despite a further increase in interest income to $228 million. This indicates that the company's financing costs grew, and its capital structure management experienced increased pressure due to higher debt-related expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "The net interest expense increased from $200 million in 2023 to $256 million in 2024, reflecting higher interest incurred on debt ($555 million in 2024 versus $480 million in 2023) and lower interest income ($228 million versus $197 million), while amortization of acquired debt and interest capitalized were relatively unchanged. This rise indicates that the company’s financing costs have grown modestly, suggesting tighter capital‑structure leverage or a higher reliance on debt financing, and highlights the need for continued vigilance in managing debt levels and interest‑rate exposure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan disclosed that the Core Deposit Intangible from the First Republic acquisition was valued at $1.3 billion and was being amortized over a projected period of approximately 7 years. The valuation methodology was described, including the use of after-tax cost savings and assumptions about market participant behavior. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in terms of the $1.3 billion valuation and the 7-year amortization period, but the language was slightly refined, emphasizing that the intangibles 'are amortized' rather than 'will be amortized,' indicating that the amortization process had commenced. Additionally, the 2024 filing made a new reference to 'disputed amounts with the FDIC as of April 30, 2024,' which was not present in the 2023 filing, suggesting an ongoing financial or legal development affecting the acquisition-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, JPMorgan Chase's disclosure of Core Deposit Intangibles related to the First Republic acquisition evolved from a preliminary estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion (as of May 1, 2023) to a final estimated gain of $2.8 billion by December 31, 2023, reflecting adjustments made during the measurement period. The company also refined its fair value estimates for core deposit intangibles ($1.3 billion) and customer relationship intangibles ($180 million), which are amortized over approximately 7 years, while continuing to adjust these estimates up to one year post-acquisition as permitted by U.S. GAAP.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, a 2% increase in market interest rates resulted in $401 million in additional investment income and a $8,700 million decrease in the fair value of financial liabilities. In 2023, the same 2% increase led to a higher investment income of $629 million, while the fair value of financial liabilities decreased by $7,365 million. This indicates that UnitedHealth Group's exposure to interest rate changes increased in magnitude over the year, particularly on the investment income side, while the sensitivity of liabilities slightly decreased.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the impact of a 2% increase in market interest rates on UnitedHealth Group's investment income and the fair value of its financial liabilities shifted markedly. In 2022, a 2% rate rise would have reduced investment income by $499 million and lowered the fair value of financial liabilities by $8.664 billion; by 2023, the same 2% increase cut investment income to $688 million (down from $499 million in 2022) and reduced the fair‑value of liabilities to $8.142 billion (down from $8.664 billion). Thus, the magnitude of both the income and fair‑value effects grew in absolute terms from 2022 to 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Target Corporation's short-term investments were $2.9 billion, and its cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.8 billion. In 2024, these figures increased to $3.9 billion in short-term investments and $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This reflects a consistent approach to preserving principal and liquidity, with an expansion in the scale of short-term investments and overall liquidity reserves, indicating a maintained but more capitalized strategy in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Target's approach to preserving principal and liquidity in its short-term investments has remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, continuing to prioritize investments in large money market funds and highly rated direct short-term instruments maturing in 60 days or less, while maintaining dollar limits on individual fund investments to ensure principal protection and liquidity. The company's investment policy, as described in both filings, has not undergone significant changes between the years, with no indication of a shift in strategy regarding short-term investment preservation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security segment operated from a total of 28,554 thousand square feet of facilities, combining owned and leased spaces. By 2024, the segment's backlog revenue stood at $64,023 million for the year, compared to $59,012 million in 2023. While the facilities footprint remained relatively stable, the significant increase in backlog revenue—approximately 8.5% from 2023 to 2024—suggests a growing demand for the segment's offerings, indicating a positive growth trajectory despite no major changes in physical capacity.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment's backlog grew modestly from $497.1 billion in 2023 to $498.8 billion in 2024, driven primarily by increased contract awards in defense and space programs, while its facilities footprint remained largely unchanged, reflecting continued investment in existing sites rather than major new expansions. This incremental backlog expansion, coupled with stable or slightly reduced capital spending on facilities, signals a cautious but steady growth trajectory for BDS, emphasizing contract retention and incremental program advances over aggressive capacity expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil acquired Denbury Inc. by issuing 46 million shares with a fair value of $4.8 billion. The year also saw the sale of Esso Thailand and upstream asset divestitures in the U.S. In 2024, the company significantly scaled up its acquisition activity by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources through the issuance of 545 million shares valued at $63 billion, along with $5 billion in assumed debt. Additionally, the scope of asset sales expanded geographically in 2024 to include upstream assets in Argentina and Nigeria, compared to only the U.S. in 2023. This reflects a major increase in both the size and geographic diversity of ExxonMobil's transactional activity.",
      "llm_answer": "The scale of ExxonMobil's acquisitions shifted significantly between 2023 and 2024, with the 2024 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources involving $63 billion in stock (545 million shares) versus the 2023 acquisition of Denbury Inc. at $4.8 billion in stock (46 million shares), indicating a substantially larger transaction. Regarding divestitures, the 2024 cash flow notes reference \"net (gain)/loss on asset sales\" from upstream asset sales in the U.S., Argentina, and Nigeria, while 2023 included sales in the U.S. only, reflecting a geographic expansion in divestment activities across multiple regions. However, the provided documents do not specify the number of shares issued for divestitures or detailed geographic breakdowns of asset sales beyond these regional references.",

In 2023, while the revenue increased due to the mix of products shipped, the operating profit decreased primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, despite the revenue growth. This indicates a shift in profitability dynamics even as revenue expanded.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Embedded Processing revenue grew 3% to $3.37 billion, but its operating profit fell 20% to $1.01 billion (dropping from $1.25 billion), reducing its contribution to total operating profit and its profit margin from 38.4% to 29.9%. The profit decline was driven mainly by higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and lower factory loadings, which offset the modest revenue increase from a more favorable product mix.",

      "question": "How did Adobe's treatment and disclosure of unrealized credit-related losses evolve between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of recognition and presentation within financial statements?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Adobe recorded unrealized credit-related losses directly to other income (expense), net, with a corresponding allowance for credit-related losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This treatment remained consistent in fiscal 2024, where the company continued to recognize unrealized credit-related losses in the same manner. However, in 2024, Adobe provided additional context around financial activities, such as the $1 billion non-tax-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition, which may have influenced overall financial statement presentation and emphasis, even though the accounting treatment for credit-related losses remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe did not recognize any allowance for credit‑related losses on its short‑term investment securities in either fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024; the company explicitly states that during both years it “did not recognize an allowance for credit‑related losses on any of our investments.” Consequently, there was no change in the treatment of unrealized credit‑related losses between the two periods—both years were characterized by a zero allowance for such losses. In the financial statements, these investments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and non‑credit‑related losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, while any credit‑related losses (if they had occurred) would have been recorded in other income (expense) with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet. Since no allowance was recorded in either year, the presentation and recognition of unrealized credit‑related losses remained unchanged.",

This indicates a minor decline in the segment's order volume over this period, suggesting a potential softening in new orders or delivery delays.",
      "llm_answer": "The Boeing Commercial Airplanes backlog increased from $497,094 million in 2023 to $498,802 million in 2024, indicating a modest rise in order volume despite ongoing challenges. However, the segment’s operating loss widened dramatically to $7,969 million in 2024 from $1,635 million in 2023, reflecting lower deliveries, reach‑forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, and higher research‑and‑development costs. This suggests that while order backlog held steady, the segment’s order trends are under pressure from production disruptions and margin‑eroding factors.",

      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost pass-through on sales shifted from a 1% decrease in 2023 to a 1% decrease in 2024, but this was offset by higher pricing and productivity gains that drove overall sales growth and improved operating margins. This indicates that while cost pass-through pressures persist, the company is effectively managing cost inflation through pricing power and operational efficiencies, leading to stronger profit dynamics despite flat volume growth.",

      "question": "How did the financial liability related to travel transaction taxes evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's exposure to such obligations?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company faced potential liabilities related to travel transaction taxes due to ongoing lawsuits and proceedings in various jurisdictions, with exposure including historical taxes, interest, penalties, and damages. By 2023, the company specifically disclosed a liability of $39 million principally related to travel transaction taxes. This indicates that while the company continued to face exposure, the liability was quantified and likely reflected settlements, accrual adjustments, or resolution progress from prior uncertainties.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial liability related to travel transaction taxes was not materially disclosed as a separate accrual in the 2022 or 2023 balance sheets; the only tax‑related liabilities noted were general accrued expenses and other current liabilities ($587 million in 2023 vs. $526 million in 2022) and specific pension and tax settlement provisions. However, the company repeatedly warns that it faces “significant” litigation and audit risk from jurisdictions seeking to impose travel transaction taxes (e.g., hotel occupancy taxes), and that adverse outcomes could result in “liabilities for past and/or future bookings” and materially affect profit margins. Thus, while no explicit liability figure is given, the company’s exposure to such obligations appears to be increasing, as indicated by heightened legal scrutiny and the potential for future assessments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that it had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, with significant additional streaming content commitments that did not meet the criteria for liability recognition. These obligations were described as long-term and fixed-cost in nature, limiting Netflix’s flexibility in reacting to changes in business conditions and potentially requiring access to capital markets at unfavorable times. By 2023, Netflix expanded its description of content obligations to include non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements, as well as production-related obligations. While specific dollar figures for total content liabilities were not explicitly stated in 2023, the company emphasized that obligations for unknown future titles under certain licensing agreements were expected to be significant, indicating a growing complexity and financial exposure in its content commitments. This evolution reflects both an increase in the scale and inflexibility of content obligations, heightening liquidity risk.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s content-related financial obligations remained substantial but showed slight declines in near‑term and longer‑term timing, with $10.3 billion due within one year, $8.8 billion due over the next 1‑3 years, $2.0 billion over 3‑5 years, and $0.6 billion thereafter (total $21.7 billion in 2023 versus $21.8 billion in 2022). The company continues to face liquidity pressure from these fixed‑cost commitments, which are not reflected on the balance sheet until incurred and can limit flexibility if membership growth slows. Additionally, Netflix maintains a $1 billion revolving credit facility (unused as of Dec 31 2023) and a sizable revolving‑credit‑agreement covenant package, while its derivative hedging program and associated foreign‑exchange obligations add to cash‑flow volatility but are managed through standard industry‑level valuation models.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Nike reported footwear revenue of $8,260 million globally. By fiscal 2024, this figure increased significantly to $33,427 million under the Nike Brand, with additional footwear revenue of $1,800 million attributed to CONVERSE. The 2024 report provides a regional breakdown not explicitly detailed in 2023, showing $14,537 million in North America, $8,473 million in Europe, Middle East & Africa, $5,552 million in Greater China, and $4,865 million in Asia Pacific & Latin America. This indicates a more granular reporting structure in 2024, highlighting Nike's geographic revenue distribution, which was not itemized in the prior year's consolidated footwear revenue.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, Nike's footwear revenue declined 2% to $14,537 million (from $14,897 million), while apparel revenue remained flat at $5,953 million and equipment grew 19% to $906 million. Regionally, revenue growth was strongest in Greater China (up 8% on a currency‑neutral basis) and Asia Pacific & Latin America (up 5%), whereas North America and Europe, Middle East & Africa were essentially flat or slightly down. The shift reflects higher full‑price ASPs and a greater mix of NIKE Direct sales offsetting lower unit volumes in most regions.",

This indicates a strategic shift toward prioritizing core infrastructure and redevelopment over new initiatives, as evidenced by the significant reduction in start-up capital spending ($280–300M in 2022 vs. $65–85M in 2023) while maintaining overall capital expenditure levels through increased investment in discretionary projects and redevelopment.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2023 filing, the Veralto Distribution contributed $974 million to Accumulated Comprehensive Income, as noted in the line item under Other Comprehensive Income. By 2024, this amount was no longer present as a separate line item, and Accumulated Comprehensive Income had declined from $(1,748) million in 2023 to $(3,218) million in 2024. This indicates that while the Veralto Distribution had a significant positive impact in 2023, its absence in 2024 contributed to the overall decline in Accumulated Comprehensive Income, alongside other comprehensive losses during the year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC filings, the impact of Veralto Distribution on Danaher's Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) evolved as follows:  \n\nIn the 2023 filing (page 100), the cumulative translation adjustment related to Veralto was **$983 million** (included in AOCI), which was subsequently **reclassified out of AOCI** in 2024 as part of the distribution. By the 2024 filing (page 100), the cumulative translation adjustment balance had shifted to **($1,428) million** (pre-reclassification), and after the Veralto distribution adjustment (reflected as a **$983 million** reclassification entry), the final AOCI balance for translation adjustments was **($1,446) million** at December 31, 2023. This indicates the Veralto-related translation adjustment was fully removed from AOCI by the end of 2023, with no remaining impact in the 2024 balance.  \n\n(2 sentences)",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and occurred when revenue was recognized prior to invoicing, with specific mention of deferred revenues being recorded when revenues were to be recognized after cash collection. In fiscal year 2024, Oracle maintained the same classification of unbilled receivables within accounts receivable but updated the presentation slightly, referring to 'non-operating expenses, net' instead of 'non-operating expenses or income, net' when discussing interest revenue from financing arrangements. This indicates a subtle evolution in financial statement presentation without a substantive change in the treatment of unbilled receivables.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle’s treatment of unbilled receivables has remained consistent between fiscal 2022 and 2024: unbilled amounts are recorded as part of accounts receivable when revenue is recognized before invoicing, and they are presented net of related allowances and deferred revenue. In both years, the company emphasizes that invoicing timing varies by contract type—cloud and license fees are often billed in advance (annually, quarterly, or monthly), while license support and hardware support contracts are typically invoiced annually in advance—so unbilled receivables reflect revenue recognized prior to those billing cycles. The disclosure of remaining performance obligations also shows that a substantial portion of those obligations will be realized within the next 12‑36 months, underscoring the timing of when the associated unbilled amounts are expected to be collected.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 11% growth in average paying memberships compared to the prior year, contributing to a 19% increase in consolidated revenues. By 2024, the growth rate of average paying memberships had slowed to 15% year-over-year (from 240,889 in 2023 to 277,730 in 2024), yet streaming revenues still grew by 16% year-over-year. This indicates that despite a lower growth rate in memberships compared to earlier years, Netflix was able to maintain strong revenue growth, likely due to more stable monetization per membership and a larger base of paying members.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the average number of paying Netflix members grew from 222,924 to 277,730, a cumulative increase of roughly 25 %.  This expansion in the subscriber base, combined with modest price increases, drove streaming revenue up 16 % year‑over‑year in 2024 (from $31.5 bn in 2022 to $39.0 bn in 2024).  The larger revenue base contributed to a 50 % rise in operating income and helped lift operating margin from 18 % in 2022 to 27 % in 2024.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's treatment and disclosure of foreign currency exchange gains and losses evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly regarding the accounting of foreign currency exchange contracts and their impact on financial statements?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that foreign currency exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities were recorded in other income (expense), net, and partially offset by gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge these exposures. Additionally, PayPal mentioned a matured net investment hedge from 2020, with its gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the foreign subsidiary was sold or liquidated. By 2023, PayPal expanded its disclosure to clarify that foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were included in other, net, along with forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and fair value changes on non-hedging derivative contracts. The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts. This evolution indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to disclosing foreign exchange exposures and their financial effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, PayPal’s accounting for foreign currency exchange gains and losses remained consistent in principle but was refined in disclosure. In 2022, foreign currency translation gains and losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), while transaction-related gains and losses were recognized in other income (expense), net. By 2023, the company continued to translate foreign subsidiary balances at period-end rates (recording translation adjustments in AOCI) and used daily rates for income statement items, with transaction gains/losses still flowing through other income (expense). Notably, the 2023 disclosures emphasized the use of foreign currency exchange contracts—both cash flow and net investment hedges—to mitigate earnings impact, and highlighted that these hedging gains/losses are recognized in the same period as the related transaction revenue. The core accounting treatment did not change materially, but the 2023 filings provided enhanced detail on hedging strategies and the impact of foreign currency movements on net revenues and operating expenses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed that approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services were known and settled within 90 days, with substantially all settled within twelve months. By 2023, the company provided a more quantified sensitivity analysis, stating that a hypothetical 1% difference between its December 31, 2023, estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable would have increased or decreased 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This indicates a more explicit quantification of risk exposure in 2023 compared to the more qualitative disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The sensitivity analysis for medical costs payable shows that a 1% increase in the medical cost trend factor would raise the estimated payable by $1,128 million, while a 1% decrease would lower it by $376 million. This indicates that the company’s exposure to unpaid claims is highly sensitive to changes in medical cost trends, meaning even modest shifts in cost assumptions can materially affect the liability and thus the firm’s risk exposure related to unpaid claims.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin's Space segment generated $11.8 billion in net sales and focused on programs for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, NASA, and other defense and commercial customers, emphasizing missile defense systems, satellite systems, and space exploration. By 2024, the segment strategically expanded through the acquisition of Terran Orbital for $314 million, enhancing its satellite design, production, and on-orbit support capabilities. This acquisition marked a clear shift toward strengthening space-based technologies and services to meet evolving customer demands, particularly in satellite operations and mission support.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Lockheed Martin’s Space segment expanded its strategic focus on advanced missile defense and hypersonic technologies while maintaining its core satellite and national security systems. The segment continued to develop and produce critical systems such as the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS), Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, and Next Generation Interceptor (NGI), alongside hypersonic strike weapons for the U.S. Army and Navy. Additionally, the acquisition of Terran Orbital in 2024 strengthened its satellite design and production capabilities, supporting proliferated space architectures and enhancing its position in the space domain. This evolution underscores a sustained emphasis on space-based missile defense, strategic weapons, and next-generation space technologies to meet national security priorities.",

This upward trend signals a deliberate expansion of its capital program, with the company projecting $27‑$29 billion of investment in 2025, underscoring a strategic shift toward higher‑value upstream and product‑solution projects while maintaining a strong financial position to fund future growth.",

This represents a $0.5 billion or approximately 26% increase in restricted funds. The increase suggests a more conservative liquidity strategy in 2024, with a greater portion of cash being set aside for specific purposes, potentially to mitigate credit and settlement exposures or to meet regulatory or contractual obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents tied to capital‑asset purchases declined modestly from $1.9 billion at the end of 2023 to $2.4 billion at the end of 2024 (the figures are presented as “restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively” in the 2024 MD&A). This reduction reflects a lower need to set aside cash for capital projects as the firm shifted toward using internal cash flow and debt financing for new investments, suggesting a more flexible liquidity strategy that emphasizes external capital markets rather than internally‑restricted balances.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 44.6%, while in 2024 it decreased to 37.9%. This indicates a decline in profitability relative to revenue, suggesting potential challenges in cost management or a reduction in pricing power during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit margin declined from 41.8% of revenue in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024, reflecting a 7-point drop in profitability. This shift indicates weakening cost management, as lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs from capacity expansions eroded margins despite stable operating expense growth. The decline suggests challenges in maintaining profitability amid reduced factory loadings and pricing pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported a specific dollar amount for Medical Costs Payable of $2,701 million as part of its operating activities in the cash flow statement, indicating a significant net increase in this liability during that year. By 2023, the company emphasized the sensitivity of its Medical Costs Payable estimates, disclosing that a hypothetical 1% difference between estimated and actual Medical Costs Payable would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This represents a shift from simply disclosing the amount to quantifying the sensitivity and potential earnings impact of estimation differences, suggesting increased focus on the volatility and importance of these liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's Medical Costs Payable estimates are highly sensitive to assumptions, particularly completion factors and medical cost trend factors. A 1% difference between estimated and actual medical costs payable would impact net earnings by approximately $245 million, reflecting the material volatility in reserve development. The company explicitly acknowledges that reserve changes—whether favorable or unfavorable—directly affect current-period earnings, with the sensitivity analysis in the 2023 report showing potential impacts ranging from $(867) million to $880 million based on completion factor adjustments. This underscores that estimation differences are not merely theoretical but have significant, measurable effects on financial results.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle's Cloud Services and License Support Expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and infrastructure investments made to support the growth in the cloud and license business. By fiscal 2024, these expenses had risen to $8,783 million, reflecting a 21% increase in constant currency compared to fiscal 2023. This indicates a continued and accelerating investment in the cloud and license business to support growing revenues, particularly in cloud services, which saw a 24% constant currency increase in revenue from fiscal 2023 to 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 Oracle’s Cloud Services and License Support expenses rose sharply—from roughly $7.2 billion in 2022 to $8.8 billion in 2023 and $8.8 billion in 2024 (up 22 % year‑over‑year in constant currency). This increase reflects a deliberate investment in expanding cloud infrastructure, adding data‑center capacity and scaling the sales force, underscoring Oracle’s strategic focus on growing its cloud and license business.",

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin's pension plan funding approach evolved significantly from 2021 to 2024. In 2021, the company made no contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans, while in 2024, it contributed $990 million. The ERISA-funded status also improved, with the company achieving at least 80% funded status across all qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024, compared to a funded status of approximately 92% in 2021 after a $1.0 billion contribution in 2020. This indicates a shift from a period of minimal contributions and moderate funded status to a more active funding strategy aligned with ERISA requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2021 and 2024, Lockheed Martin’s pension funding approach evolved through continued risk-transfer transactions and changes in funding strategy. In 2021, the company executed a $4.9 billion pension risk‑transfer transaction, purchasing group annuity contracts that eliminated about 18,000 defined‑benefit obligations without requiring additional cash contributions, and it subsequently transferred roughly $11.6 billion of pension liabilities through such transactions by the end of 2024, reducing PBGC premiums and plan volatility. Funding under ERISA was maintained at or above the 80 % target, with cash contributions of $990 million made in 2024 (after none in 2023) and corresponding CAS pension cost recoveries of about $1.7 billion each year, allowing the company to recoup a portion of its prepayment credits while the funded status under ERISA remained at roughly 92 % in 2024 and 82 % in 2021. The company’s pension expense and funded status remain sensitive to discount‑rate and asset‑return assumptions, but the overall strategy has shifted from direct cash contributions toward leveraging risk‑transfer and CAS‑based cost recoveries to manage and stabilize pension liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, One-time Charges had a positive impact of $76 million on earnings, whereas in 2024, the company disclosed a smaller positive impact of only $30 million. This indicates a reduced influence of one-time items on financial performance in 2024 compared to the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of one-time charges (identified items) on earnings improved markedly from 2023 to 2024, shifting from a $93 million loss in 2023 to a relatively small $13 million loss in 2024, while the prior year’s $634 million gain from the Santoprene divestment was absent. This reduction in identified‑item losses indicates that non‑recurring impairments and other one‑time items are diminishing, allowing earnings to reflect more of the underlying operating performance and signaling a cleaner earnings trajectory.",

By 2024, gross settlement exposure increased to $78,385 million, and risk mitigation arrangements rose to $13,466 million. This led to a higher net settlement exposure of $64,919 million in 2024. Therefore, both gross and net settlement exposures increased year-over-year, with gross exposure rising by $3,362 million and net exposure rising by $2,063 million.",

To manage this exposure, the company applied larger risk‑mitigation arrangements, which grew from **$12.2 billion** in 2023 to **$13.5 billion** in 2024.  Consequently, net settlement exposure increased from **$62.9 billion** in 2023 to **$64.9 billion** in 2024, reflecting the higher gross exposure partially offset by the additional mitigation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments determined the single equivalent discount rate by discounting the projected cash flows from defined benefit plans against a yield curve constructed using an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds in each country. By 2024, the company refined its approach by emphasizing a more precise methodology in which the selected discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value derived from the yield curve analysis. While the core method remained consistent, the 2024 filing reflects a more structured emphasis on the derivation of the equivalent rate as a direct output of the present value calculation, suggesting a refinement in transparency and analytical rigor.",
      "llm_answer": "The single equivalent discount rate for non‑U.S. defined benefit plans was derived using a country‑specific approach: for locations with sufficient high‑quality corporate bond markets, TI constructs a yield curve from those bonds and selects the rate that equates the present value of the plan’s projected cash flows to the obligation; where such markets are lacking, it relies on a government‑bond index. This methodology remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with the only change being the updated discount‑rate assumptions (e.g., 3.76 % for 2024 versus 3.28 % for 2023) reflected in the benefit‑obligation calculations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities, as noted in the consolidated statements of equity under noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company further disclosed that this deconsolidation was a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and was treated as an asset group impairment event under long-lived assets testing, indicating a shift from a focus on equity treatment to a broader asset impairment and financial impact analysis.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Linde’s treatment of its Russian gas and engineering business evolved from deconsolidation (effective June 30 2022) to full disposal of related assets, which is reflected in the 2024 filing by the removal of any remaining Russian entities from the consolidated balance sheet and footnote disclosures. The company continued to assess goodwill and indefinite‑lived intangibles for impairment, concluding no impairment was required as of December 31 2024, but it retained the same qualitative/quantitative testing framework described in 2023. Financially, the 2024 consolidated statements no longer include any Russian gas or engineering assets, and the 2024 MD&A notes that the deconsolidation was completed as of June 30 2022, with any residual balances now reported as noncontrolling interests or disposed of, while asset impairment considerations for the remaining business remain unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Hill's Pet Nutrition contributed 23% to the company's total program charges, but by 2024, this contribution decreased to 6%. This indicates a significant reduction in the segment's relative financial importance to the overall business, suggesting a potential strategic repositioning or performance challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial contribution of Hill's Pet Nutrition to the company's total program charges decreased from 23% in 2023 to 11% in 2024, as shown in the restructuring charges table on page 48. This decline indicates that while Hill's Pet Nutrition remains a strategic segment (accounting for 10% of the program's total charges in 2024), its relative weight within the company's productivity initiative has diminished, likely reflecting its shifting role as the company prioritizes other segments like Europe (89% of charges) and North America (3% in 2024 vs. 15% in 2023).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be repurchased under Walmart's publicly announced plans decreased from $12.4 billion in November to $10.6 billion by the end of January. In contrast, in 2024, the company started with $13.1 billion in November and only decreased slightly to $12.0 billion by the end of January. This indicates a more stable and potentially more actively managed repurchase strategy in 2024 compared to the more rapid depletion seen in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares remaining under Walmart’s publicly announced repurchase program declined from about $12.4 billion to $12.0 billion, reflecting roughly $0.4 billion of repurchases over that period. This reduction indicates that the company has been actively using its share‑repurchase authorization, but still retains a substantial remaining authorization to continue buying back stock.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses stood at $633 million at the end of the year. By 2024, this figure had decreased to $577 million. This represents a reduction of $56 million over the two-year period. The trend indicates that IBM may have improved its inventory management or adjusted its provisioning strategy, as evidenced by the consistent decline in the allowance balance despite ongoing additions and write-offs.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, IBM's Allowance for Inventory Losses was $15 million as of December 31, 2022 (page 28 of IBM_10k_2022.pdf), and $18 million as of December 31, 2023 (page 24 of IBM_10k_2024.pdf). This represents a $3 million increase over the two-year period, indicating a deliberate upward adjustment to the inventory reserve. The trend suggests IBM is proactively strengthening its provision for potential inventory obsolescence or write-downs, likely reflecting heightened caution about market demand, supply chain volatility, or the need to align reserves with more conservative valuation of aging or slow-moving stock. This conservative shift in provisioning may signal strategic inventory management focused on risk mitigation rather than aggressive inventory turnover.",

This indicates a shift in the company's pricing or value proposition strategy over the two-year period, potentially reflecting promotional pricing, changes in regional mix, or adjustments in service tiers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, average monthly revenue per paying membership (ARM) declined modestly in absolute terms—$8.48 in 2022, $8.66 in 2023, and $7.29 in 2024 (a $0.42 drop from 2023 to 2024). However, when adjusted for constant‑currency effects, ARM actually rose about 21% from 2022 to 2024, indicating that price increases and favorable pricing tests have been outpacing currency headwinds. This trend suggests the company is deliberately raising prices or introducing higher‑priced tiers to boost revenue per user, even as the growth in paying members slows.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AT&T had approximately $36,912 million in commitments related to its WarnerMedia segment, indicating active financial involvement and operational integration. However, in 2023, WarnerMedia was classified as part of discontinued operations following its separation and distribution, signaling a complete operational and financial divestiture. This represents a significant transformation from an active business segment with substantial commitments to a fully exited business unit.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AT&T completed the separation of WarnerMedia, spinning it off as an independent public company and finalizing the merger with Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery. Financially, AT&T retained no ongoing operational or equity stake in WarnerMedia, removing its significant contractual obligations and debt related to the segment (noted in the 2021 contractual obligations table as ~$36,912 in WarnerMedia-related commitments). The company also reduced its financial exposure by repaying or restructuring debt tied to WarnerMedia, such as the $10,000 Spinco Term Loan drawn in 2022, and shifted focus to managing its core telecom business and debt reduction.",

      "question": "How did Texas Instruments' approach to target allocation ranges for defined benefit plans evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of rebalancing and asset class assumptions?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments stated that it rebalanced the plans' investments when they were outside the target allocation ranges. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the fact that assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets were based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. Additionally, in 2023, the company explicitly mentioned adjusting results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets and that assumptions for non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflected different economic environments. This indicates a more detailed and forward-looking approach to asset allocation in 2023 compared to the more general rebalancing policy described in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Texas Instruments maintained the same target allocation ranges for its defined benefit plans—fixed income and cash equivalents at 65%–80% (U.S.), 75%–85% (U.S. retiree health care), and 60%–100% (non-U.S.); equities at 20%–35% (U.S.), 15%–25% (U.S. retiree health care), and 0%–40% (non-U.S.)—and continued to rebalance assets when allocations drifted outside these ranges. The weighted average asset allocations as of December 31, 2023 were essentially unchanged from 2022 (65% fixed income/cash and 35% equity for the U.S. plan, 77% fixed income/cash and 23% equity for non‑U.S.), indicating that the company’s rebalancing kept the portfolio within the prescribed ranges without shifting the underlying assumptions. Asset‑class return assumptions (long‑term rate of return on plan assets of 5.70% for U.S. plans and 3.50% for non‑U.S. plans in 2023) remained consistent with prior years, reflecting the same methodology of basing expectations on future returns and periodic rebalancing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, U.S. Consumer Debit Volume grew by 8% to $2,826 billion from $2,622 billion in the prior year. In 2024, the growth rate slowed to 6%, with the volume reaching $2,990 billion from $2,826 billion the previous year. This indicates that while Visa continued to grow its U.S. Consumer Debit business, the pace of growth decelerated in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of U.S. Consumer Debit Volume increased from 6% in fiscal 2023 to 6% in fiscal 2024 (as reported in the payments volume table for Consumer debit, which grew 6% year-over-year in both periods, with a 13% growth figure also noted for International but not U.S. specifically). This consistent growth indicates stable performance in Visa's U.S. consumer debit segment, contributing to overall net revenue growth of 10% in fiscal 2024, driven by nominal payments volume expansion and processed transaction growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement disclosed serving 4.4 million seniors through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. By 2023, the company reported 4,355,000 members in Medicare Supplement (Standardized) plans, indicating a slight decrease of 45,000 members from the prior year. This small decline suggests relative stability in the company's Medicare Supplement market share, despite broader growth in other senior-focused segments like Medicare Advantage. The change reflects a minor contraction in this specific product line, even as the company maintained its overall presence in senior insurance offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Supplement enrollment remained essentially flat year-over-year, with the number of individuals served holding steady at 4.4 million as of December 31, 2023 (down slightly from 4.375 million in 2022). This stability, combined with the broader 13 % revenue growth in UnitedHealthcare driven by gains in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, indicates that the company is maintaining its position in the senior market while focusing growth on higher‑margin Medicare Advantage and integrated Optum services rather than expanding its Supplement business.",

By 2023, the composition shifted to 47%, 18%, 6%, and 6% respectively for the same categories, with oil and gas production assets increasing slightly to 16%. This indicates a decrease in the relative share of wind facilities and a corresponding increase in solar and oil and gas assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, NEER's depreciable electric plant and other property composition shifted notably: wind's share declined from 51% to 47%, solar rose from 14% to 18%, and oil and gas production assets remained stable at roughly 15-16% of the total. This evolution reflects NEER's strategic pivot toward renewable energy, with solar capacity expanding significantly while wind's relative contribution decreased, alongside sustained oil and gas asset presence. (Based on page 94: NEER's 2023 composition percentages and page 93: asset acquisition details for renewable projects.)",

      "question": "How has NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of lead times and financial risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA’s long‑term supply commitments have shifted markedly between 2022 and 2023. In 2022 the company relied on roughly six‑month lead times and placed inventory orders “in advance of historical lead times,” but by 2023 it was routinely ordering at least twelve months ahead, entering prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements, and securing longer‑term supplier commitments to meet soaring AI‑related demand. This evolution reduced exposure to sudden supply shocks but increased financial risk: the firm now holds larger inventory balances and makes non‑cancellable, often premium‑priced purchase commitments that could generate excess inventory or impairments if demand softens. Consequently, while lead times have lengthened and supply‑chain commitments have deepened, NVIDIA’s exposure to financial risk from those commitments has grown substantially.",

In 2024, while no updated GDV figure was provided, the company introduced a more detailed explanation of GDV, clarifying that it includes both purchase volume and cash volume, and specifying that cross-border volume growth is measured separately. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced approach to currency conversion, using quarterly average exchange rates to calculate U.S. dollar equivalents. This represents a shift from simply reporting GDV figures to enhancing transparency around its components and measurement methodology.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard's Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) grew 11% on a local‑currency basis in 2024 versus 12% in 2023, and the company introduced a new reporting approach in 2024 that separates the impact of currency from the GDV growth figures, presenting both \"as‑reported\" and \"currency‑neutral\" growth rates in its financial disclosures.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent ended the year at $28 million, after starting at $25 million and experiencing a small increase of $6 million through additions, offset by a $2 million reduction from other adjustments. By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent had decreased to $19 million, down from $27 million at the start of the year, primarily due to a $7 million deduction with no write-offs and a $1 million reduction from foreign currency and other adjustments. This represents a significant decline in the noncurrent allowance over the two-year period, suggesting a reduced expectation of long-term credit losses or a strategic decision to tighten credit exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided pages from IBM's 2022 and 2024 10-K filings, the Allowance for Credit Losses - Noncurrent was $176 million in 2022 (page 28 of IBM_10k_2022.pdf) and increased to $187 million in 2024 (page 27 of IBM_10k_2024.pdf). This upward trend indicates growing exposure to long-term credit risk, as the company is setting aside more reserves for expected credit losses over extended periods, reflecting heightened concerns about the collectibility of receivables from customers with longer payment terms or financial instability.",

By 2024, average paying memberships had increased to 94,200 thousand, a growth of 16%, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership slightly declined to $10.96. Despite the minor decrease in per-member revenue, streaming revenues grew significantly to $12,387,035 thousand in 2024, representing a 17% increase compared to 2023. This indicates that the growth in paying memberships was the primary driver of revenue expansion, offsetting the small drop in average monthly revenue per member.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s average paying memberships grew from 222,924 to 277,730 (a 15% increase), while average monthly revenue per paying membership (ARM) remained flat at roughly $11.70 (2022: $11.76, 2023: $11.64, 2024: $11.70). Streaming revenue grew 16% year-over-year in 2024, driven by membership growth and price increases, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson's MedTech segment was undergoing a restructuring program that involved exiting certain markets and product lines, particularly in Orthopaedics, with a pre-tax expense of $319 million and an estimated total cost of $700 million to $800 million. This reflected a strategy of streamlining operations and reducing exposure to underperforming areas. In contrast, by 2024, the company shifted toward expansion in the MedTech space through acquisitions, including Shockwave Medical Inc., a leader in intravascular lithotripsy technology, indicating a strategic pivot from cost-cutting to growth through innovation. The shift demonstrates a transformation in the company's approach to the MedTech segment, moving from contraction to investment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Johnson & Johnson’s MedTech segment shifted from a focus on restructuring legacy operations to a growth strategy driven by strategic acquisitions. In 2023, the company initiated restructuring programs within MedTech—such as exiting certain markets and product lines in its Orthopedics franchise—to streamline operations, with pre-tax restructuring expenses totaling $319 million. However, by 2024, the emphasis shifted decisively toward acquisitions, exemplified by the $17.1 billion acquisition of Abiomed (completed in December 2022, with final purchase price adjustments finalized in 2023) and the $335 million acquisition of Shockwave Medical in May 2024. These deals, which expanded MedTech’s cardiovascular and interventional coronary disease capabilities, marked a clear pivot from cost-cutting to strategic expansion through M&A, with acquisition-related costs in 2024 primarily tied to integration efforts (e.g., $0.5 billion for Shockwave) rather than ongoing restructuring. The company no longer reports material restructuring expenses for MedTech in 2024, reflecting the completion of prior programs and a renewed focus on growth via targeted acquisitions.",

By 2023, the composition shifted to 47% wind, 18% solar, and 6% rate-regulated transmission. This indicates a decrease in the proportion of wind and rate-regulated transmission facilities, while solar facilities increased. These changes reflect a strategic shift toward solar energy and away from wind and transmission assets within NEER's portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, NEER's depreciable electric plant and other property composition shifted significantly toward renewable generation. Wind's share decreased from 51% to 47%, solar increased from 14% to 18%, and rate-regulated transmission facilities declined from 7% to 6%, while nuclear remained stable at 6%. This reflects NEER's strategic expansion in solar and wind assets, with new investments in solar (including battery storage) and wind projects offsetting the retirement of some older infrastructure, as evidenced by the $2.011 billion in solar capital expenditures and $3,777 million in wind investments during 2023.",

By fiscal year 2023, the financial exposure shifted toward post-sale obligations, as warranty liabilities primarily related to this segment were highlighted, indicating increased responsibility for long-term product support and customer commitments. This evolution shows a transition from upfront investment risk to ongoing operational liability.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA’s exposure to the Compute & Networking segment related to the Mellanox acquisition remained anchored by the $3.43 billion of goodwill recorded at acquisition, which is allocated to that segment and subject to annual impairment testing.  The company’s post‑sale obligations—primarily the amortization of identified finite‑lived intangibles (e.g., developed technology, customer relationships, order backlog, trade names) and the ongoing testing of the indefinite‑lived IPR&D asset—continue to be reflected in cost of revenue and operating expense, but no additional goodwill or post‑sale liabilities were recognized after the 2020 acquisition.",

      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of Membership and Other Income accelerated from 7.5% in fiscal 2024 to 13.3% in fiscal 2025, indicating that Sam’s Club’s membership strategy is gaining momentum—driven by a larger member base, higher Plus‑member penetration, and the expiration of a promotional fee offset—resulting in stronger, faster‑growing membership revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported a postretirement benefits reserves adjustment of $200 million, indicating a positive impact on comprehensive income. However, in 2024, the company disclosed a negative reclassification of $70 million related to the amortization and settlement of these reserves, showing a shift from a gain to a cost. This change reflects an increased burden from pension obligations in the later year.",
      "llm_answer": "The postretirement benefits reserves adjustment shifted from a $2.265 billion credit balance at the end of 2023 to a $1.067 billion credit balance at the end of 2024, reflecting a $3.332 billion net reduction in the reserve over the year. This decline indicates that XOM’s pension‑related liabilities were being drawn down, reducing the accrued postretirement benefit obligation during the 2023‑2024 period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix emphasized the complexity and subjectivity involved in estimating content amortization, which is based on historical and forecasted viewing patterns, and noted that changes in these patterns could affect amortization timing. By 2024, the company provided a more concrete and quantifiable disclosure, showing that tax incentives on qualified production spend directly reduced the cost basis of content assets, resulting in lower amortization. Specifically, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023, and $899 million in 2024, indicating a growing impact of these incentives over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's content amortization has increasingly been reduced by tax incentives, with tax incentives lowering amortization expense by approximately $899 million in 2024, $835 million in 2023, and $719 million in 2022. This reflects a continued reliance on tax credits to offset content costs, and the company now reports amortization of licensed and produced content net of these incentives, with the amortization schedule showing larger future write‑offs as titles move into the amortization phase.",

By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MetLife’s assumptions for withdrawal rates and their impact on the estimated fair value of guarantees evolved as follows:  \n\n- **Withdrawal rates**: For GMWBs, higher withdrawal rates increase the estimated fair value of guarantees, while for GMABs and GMIBs, higher withdrawal rates decrease the estimated fair value. This relationship was consistently noted across the 2022–2024 disclosures.  \n- **Impact on fair value**: The company explicitly stated that increases (or decreases) in withdrawal rates directly affect the estimated fair value of guarantees—specifically, \"any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees\" for GMWBs, and the inverse for GMABs/GMIBs. This dynamic was reflected in the rollforward data for 2022–2024, where changes in withdrawal rate assumptions (e.g., 20%–22% ranges) correlated with corresponding shifts in fair value estimates for embedded derivatives tied to these guarantees.  \n\nThese assumptions were part of the broader valuation inputs for MRBs (Note 6), with withdrawal rates varying by contract type, age, and duration, and directly influencing the liability valuations for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, QFNA was described as a reportable segment with accountability for share-based compensation expense, indicating its active role in the company's organizational structure and performance metrics. However, in 2024, the financial data shows that QFNA's allocation was only $11 million, a significant drop compared to other segments like FLNA ($150 million) and PBNA ($238 million). This suggests that QFNA's strategic importance may have diminished relative to other divisions, as reflected in the reduced financial resources allocated to it.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 the financial allocation for Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) remained minimal – the division received roughly 1 % of the total pre‑tax restructuring and impairment charges ($11 million in 2024 versus $7 million in 2023) and only a modest $11 million of the $727 million total restructuring expense. This small share of the company‑wide productivity‑plan spending, coupled with the fact that QFNA’s operating profit fell from $604 million in 2022 to $492 million in 2023, indicates that the business is not a strategic priority for PepsiCo’s capital and resource deployment. Consequently, the company is directing the bulk of its productivity‑plan investments and impairment remediation toward other segments (e.g., FLNA, PBNA, Europe) rather than QFNA.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 68 basis points, primarily due to increased fuel sales with lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix. In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by effective price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, although this was partially offset by shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. The change reflects a reversal in trend from margin compression in 2022 to margin expansion by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased from 23.7% in fiscal 2024 to 24.1% in fiscal 2025, representing a 40-basis-point improvement. The key drivers were Walmart U.S. segment price management aligned with competitive historic gaps, growth in higher-margin businesses globally, and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories.",

      "original_answer": "The value of Indefinite-lived Customer Relationships decreased from $162 million in 2023 to $153 million in 2024. This indicates a reduction in the company's valuation of this intangible asset, suggesting a potential reassessment of its long-term value or a strategic shift in customer relationship management.",
      "llm_answer": "The value of Indefinite-lived Customer Relationships decreased from $162 million in 2023 to $153 million in 2024, a decline of $9 million. This reduction reflects the company’s intangible‑asset valuation strategy of regularly reassessing indefinite‑lived assets for impairment and adjusting their carrying amounts when fair‑value indicators (such as market conditions or business performance) suggest a lower value. Consequently, the decrease signals that Mastercard is proactively writing down or re‑measuring these intangible assets to align recorded values with current expectations, ensuring the balance sheet reflects a more accurate valuation of its indefinite‑lived customer‑relationship intangibles.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS revenue was reported in a table format showing $10,653 million in 2021 and $10,653 million in 2022, indicating a flat performance. However, in 2023, the company provided a more detailed description of AWS revenue recognition, emphasizing that revenue is primarily recognized when customers use services based on the quantity rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Additionally, in 2023, Amazon disclosed that certain AWS services, including compute and database, are offered as fixed quantities over specified terms, with revenue recognized ratably. This shift reflects a more nuanced understanding of contractual arrangements and service delivery models, including the capitalization and amortization of sales commissions for contracts exceeding one year, which was not mentioned in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The recognition and composition of AWS revenue evolved significantly between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of contractual arrangements and service delivery models. AWS revenue is primarily recognized when customers use services such as compute or storage capacity on-demand, with certain services like compute and database also offered under fixed-term contracts where revenue is recognized ratably. Additionally, sales commissions paid for contracts exceeding one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term, reflecting a shift toward longer-term, structured agreements and more systematic revenue recognition practices. This evolution is detailed in the 2023 10-K filing (page 45), which outlines these updated contractual and accounting practices.",

By 2023, this value decreased to $4,031.2 million, indicating a decline of $728.2 million. This reduction suggests a strategic shift or divestiture in the Africa region, as the company may have reallocated resources or exited certain markets, contrasting with the earlier emphasis in 2022 on expanding operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the Africa property segment's total asset value declined from $4,759.4 million to $4,031.2 million, reflecting a reduction in long‑lived assets in the region (e.g., Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda). This decrease suggests the company is streamlining its African portfolio, likely focusing on higher‑return markets or exiting lower‑margin operations, while still maintaining a notable presence through key tenants such as Airtel and MTN. Consequently, the contraction indicates a strategic shift toward consolidating and optimizing its African assets rather than expanding the segment.",

This limited growth, together with the company’s decision to make only voluntary $800 million contributions to its U.S. plan while expecting no required contributions in 2025, suggests FedEx is maintaining a largely unchanged funding approach for its international pension obligations, relying on existing assets rather than additional funding to meet liability needs.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's Adjusted Net Debt increased from $14,702 million in 2023 to $16,769 million in 2024. This indicates a rise in the company's net financial obligations after adjusting for purchase accounting impacts, suggesting a potential increase in leverage or a strategic decision to take on more debt, which could signal either expansionary activities or a shift in capital structure management.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's Adjusted Net Debt increased from $14,702 million in 2023 to $16,769 million in 2024, reflecting a rise in total debt to $21,623 million (up from $19,373 million) and only a modest increase in cash and cash equivalents. This upward trend indicates that while the company's liquidity remains strong, its leverage has grown, suggesting a slightly weaker financial position relative to the prior year.",

By 2024, the company provided a more detailed and concrete description of the amortization process, emphasizing its complexity and subjectivity due to reliance on both historical and forecasted viewing data. The 2024 filing also outlined specific audit procedures conducted by Ernst & Young LLP to evaluate the amortization method, including sensitivity analyses and comparisons of prior estimates to actual results—indicating a more structured and scrutinized approach over time.",

The company's 2024 10-K (page 38) explicitly identifies this as a critical audit matter, requiring auditors to test management's assumptions, data completeness, and sensitivity analyses to ensure amortization aligns with actual viewing trends, as deviations directly impact the timing and amount of content expense recognition.",

It included a fixed employer contribution of 2% of annual eligible earnings plus a matching contribution of up to 4%. In 2023, the plan maintained this structure for those hired through December 31, 2003, but for employees hired after that date, the fixed 2% contribution was removed, leaving only the matching contribution of up to 4%. This represents a narrowing of benefits for newer hires.",
      "llm_answer": "The Enhanced Defined Contribution Plan’s employer contribution framework has remained unchanged between 2022 and 2023 for employees hired after December 31, 2003: they receive only the matching contribution (up to 4% of eligible earnings) and no longer receive the prior 2% fixed employer contribution that was available to participants who elected to stay in the defined‑benefit pension plan. Consequently, the contribution structure for this cohort has not evolved during the comparative period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife described the performance factor as being applied to Performance Units, which were liability awards, and the factor was determined using the same methodology as for Performance Shares, though specific performance metrics or outcomes were not detailed. By 2024, MetLife provided a more detailed and structured approach for Performance Shares, which were classified as equity awards. The performance factor for the 2021–2023 period was explicitly set at 147.5%, based on return on equity relative to business plan goals, total shareholder return compared to a peer group, and a cap if shareholder return was zero or negative. Additionally, the 2024 filing clarified that the Compensation Committee could adjust for 'Significant Events' affecting performance. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of performance factor usage to a more transparent and quantitatively defined mechanism with explicit outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife’s approach to the performance factor in Performance Shares remained consistent in structure—using a 0% to 175% range based on adjusted return on equity, shareholder return versus peers, and caps for negative returns—but the actual performance factor increased over time. The 2021–2023 performance factor was 147.5%, up from 110.8% for 2018–2020, and the 2022–2024 factor was applied to outstanding awards at target levels, without yet being finalized. This evolution directly impacts final share payouts, as the performance factor scales the number of Performance Shares (and Performance Units) ultimately paid out, with higher factors leading to greater final payouts. The company continues to adjust estimates of the most likely performance factor, which affects compensation expense recognition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $1.7 billion in 2021, $880 million in 2020, and $580 million in 2019, indicating consistent downward revisions in prior estimates. In 2023, the company stated that a hypothetical 1% difference in its estimate of Medical Costs Payable at year-end would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This shift indicates that while the company still experiences estimation variance, the nature of the impact evolved from realized favorable developments in prior years to a forward-looking sensitivity analysis in 2023, reflecting a more predictive and quantified risk to earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "The sensitivity analysis for medical‑cost estimates shows that a 1 % change in the December 31 2023 liability would affect net earnings by roughly $245 million, indicating that the company’s reserve is fairly precise but still subject to material variation if actual cost trends differ from assumptions. This suggests that while the estimation process is robust, the accuracy of liability projections remains dependent on the correctness of completion‑factor and trend‑factor assumptions, which can evolve as new claims data emerge.",

      "question": "How did JNJ's international tax liability evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this imply about the tax risk disclosed in connection with the Kenvue separation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported an international tax liability of $3,090 million, which decreased to $2,604 million in 2024. This reduction of $486 million suggests that the substantial tax liability risk disclosed in 2023 related to the Kenvue separation was partially realized and subsequently addressed. The decrease implies that JNJ may have resolved or mitigated a portion of the previously disclosed international tax exposure associated with the separation.",
      "llm_answer": "JNJ's international tax liability increased from $7,175 million in 2023 to $7,175 million in 2024 (reflected as a liability in the deferred tax balance), while the net deferred tax asset rose to $15,188 million after valuation allowances, indicating a higher overall tax exposure. This heightened tax risk is directly relevant to the Kenvue separation, as the company disclosed that the transaction could trigger substantial tax liability—particularly if the IRS determines that the separation does not qualify for tax‑free treatment—potentially affecting the anticipated financial benefits of the spin‑off.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo described its allocation methodologies for operating expenses across segments, including share-based compensation, pension, and retiree medical expenses, but did not disclose any specific dollar amounts allocated to the AMESA segment. In contrast, the 2024 filing explicitly reported a $5 million allocation to the AMESA segment for these expenses. This change indicates a shift in the company's financial reporting approach, with increased transparency in 2024 regarding resource allocation to the AMESA region, suggesting a more detailed and accountable presentation of financial commitments across geographic segments.",
      "llm_answer": "PepsiCo's disclosure of operating expense allocations to its AMESA segment remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with AMESA reporting $807 million in operating profit in 2023 and $807 million in 2024 (as shown in Note 7 of the 2024 10-K, page 71). This stability reflects the company's ongoing practice of allocating share-based compensation expenses to divisions using fixed percentages (5% for AMESA in both years), while also maintaining consistent reporting of division-level operating results under the same segment structure. The company's financial reporting approach for this geographic segment emphasizes consistent allocation methodologies and transparent disclosure of operational performance, without significant changes to how expenses are attributed to the AMESA segment.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. The increase in fiscal 2024 also benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year. This indicates a transformation in the gross profit rate dynamics, with a significant increase in contribution by 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 40 basis points in fiscal 2025 and by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024. The rise in fiscal 2025 was driven mainly by the Walmart U.S. segment, which benefited from price management aligned with historic gaps and growth in higher‑margin businesses, while the fiscal 2024 increase was helped by lapping higher markdowns from the prior year. Conversely, the gross profit rate declined in fiscal 2022 due to shifts toward lower‑margin merchandise categories and increased supply‑chain costs.",

By 2024, these allowances had declined further to $2,516 million. This indicates a continued reduction in the company's valuation allowances, suggesting increased confidence in the realizability of deferred tax assets over time.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's total income tax expense declined from $15,429 million in 2023 to $13,810 million in 2024, reflecting lower overall tax expense despite a modest increase in the effective tax rate (both 33%). The reduction is driven primarily by a $1.3 billion decrease in deferred tax expense and a $0.3 billion reduction in state tax benefits, while the company continues to maintain significant tax loss carryforwards and asset‑valuation allowances. This trend suggests that, although the statutory tax rate remains unchanged, XOM's tax position is improving through lower effective tax costs and the utilization of tax credits and allowances.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and risk exposure of MET's Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to interest rate sensitivity and investment performance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed that liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using present value of expected benefits and premiums, with key assumptions including mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns. The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities. This indicates a shift from a primarily actuarial estimation approach in 2022 to a more risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife’s liabilities for future policy benefits have remained largely insulated from interest‑rate changes because the majority of its long‑duration, traditional and limited‑payment contracts lock in assumptions at issuance and only adjust when a premium‑deficiency reserve would be required.  However, the company’s exposure to interest‑rate sensitivity is evident in its short‑duration and participating blocks, where declining rates can increase reserves and pressure spreads, while rising rates can compress margins on floating‑rate products and force reinvestment at lower yields; consequently, the firm relies on asset‑liability duration matching, interest‑rate derivatives, and dividend‑scale adjustments to mitigate these risks, but the underlying sensitivity of its reserve calculations to sustained low or high rate environments persists.",

By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted to emphasize that profit-share payments were now included directly in sales to customers, with the note that these payments represented less than 2.0% of total revenues in fiscal year 2024. This reflects a change in emphasis from long-term amortization to current revenue recognition, improving transparency around the contribution of collaborative arrangements to top-line performance.",

Additionally, reimbursements from vendors for advertising were recognized as offsets within SG&A expenses, with net advertising costs reported at $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. By 2024, Target's classification had evolved: vendor income that constitutes reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs was now explicitly offset against advertising expenses within Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, while vendor income not tied to such reimbursements continued to reduce Cost of Sales. This reflects a more nuanced and bifurcated treatment of vendor income depending on its nature and use.",
      "llm_answer": "Target's treatment of vendor income shifted between 2022 and 2024 in classification but not fundamental nature:  \n- In 2022 (2021 Form 10-K), vendor income was explicitly recorded as a **reduction of Cost of Sales** (Note 6), with the rationale that it was \"not reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs.\"  \n- By 2024 (2024 Form 10-K), this classification remained consistent, but with added context: vendor income was still recorded as a **reduction of Cost of Sales** except in cases where payments reimbursed \"specific, incremental, and identifiable costs\" (recorded as an offset to SG&A).  \n- Crucially, **advertising revenue** (e.g., Roundel digital advertising) was classified as a **reduction of Cost of Sales or SG&A**, depending on the arrangement (Note 3), while **vendor income** (e.g., volume rebates, markdown allowances) was consistently treated as a **reduction of Cost of Sales** (Note 4).  \n- The 2024 filing notes reclassifications that shifted $92M and $77M from Cost of Sales to SG&A for 2023/2022, but this did not alter the core treatment of vendor income as a Cost of Sales reduction.  \n\nThus, while the *presentation* of certain expenses evolved (e.g., reclassifications within SG&A), **vendor income remained classified as a reduction of Cost of Sales** through 2024, with no material change in its fundamental relationship to Cost of Sales versus advertising expenses. Advertising expenses (net of vendor reimbursements) were consistently reported in SG&A.",

This growth trajectory suggests that LinkedIn has maintained a steady upward trend in revenue contribution within Microsoft's broader product portfolio, reflecting its strategic importance and successful integration post-acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "LinkedIn's revenue grew from $10.3 billion in fiscal 2021 to $13.8 billion in fiscal 2022, and Microsoft's 2024 filing shows continued expansion of Microsoft Cloud revenue—including the commercial portion of LinkedIn—to $91.2 billion in 2022, up from $69.1 billion in 2021 and $51.7 billion in 2020. This upward trajectory indicates that LinkedIn is an increasingly important growth driver within Microsoft's portfolio, especially as part of the broader Microsoft Cloud and commercial segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased slightly to $1.6 billion. This indicates that while the company continued to experience favorable profit adjustments from its long-term contracts in 2023, the magnitude of these adjustments was lower compared to the previous year, suggesting a moderate decline in the rate of improvement or risk retirement on those contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "The consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments declined from $1.8 billion in 2022 to $1.6 billion in 2023, reflecting a $100 million reduction in net profit booking rate adjustments for the overall company and a $180 million drop for Aeronautics, while Space saw a $150 million increase. This shift indicates that the company experienced lower favorable profit adjustments on long‑term contracts—particularly in Aeronautics and Missiles—signaling modestly weaker performance on those extended‑duration programs, whereas Space benefited from higher favorable adjustments.",

Additionally, the total value of 'Facilities and other' under property and equipment at cost grew from $15,694 million in 2023 to $16,215 million in 2024, reflecting continued investment and expansion in this category.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx's capital expenditures declined $1.0 billion in 2024, falling from $6.174 billion in 2023 to $5.176 billion, driven primarily by reduced spending on package‑handling and ground‑support equipment at FedEx Ground and lower information‑technology outlays.  This decrease was partially offset by higher investments in facilities and other assets, which rose 8% to $1.210 billion, reflecting continued modernization of the Memphis World Hub and other network‑optimization projects.  Consequently, total capital outlays for “Facilities and other” fell modestly (from $1.118 billion in 2023 to $1.210 billion in 2024), while overall property‑and‑equipment remained up 4.8% to $84.391 billion, indicating a shift toward more aircraft‑related and hub‑modernization spending despite the overall capex reduction.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Corporation stated that the fair value of conditional legal obligations related to soil remediation could not be measured due to the impossibility of estimating future settlement dates. In 2024, the Corporation repeated the same language, indicating no change in its ability to estimate these settlement dates. Therefore, the Corporation continued to face challenges in quantifying soil remediation costs due to indeterminate site lives and lack of settlement date visibility.",
      "llm_answer": "The disclosure on soil remediation within asset retirement obligations remained unchanged between 2023 and 2024, with no impairment charges recognized in 2024 compared to $3.3 billion of impairments in 2023, primarily due to the Santa Ynez Unit. The Corporation continues to note that sites in the Product Solutions business generally have indeterminate lives, making it impossible to estimate future settlement dates for conditional legal obligations. Consequently, the ability to estimate settlement dates for these soil‑remediation obligations has not improved; it remains limited by the lack of determinable timelines.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD received $6.9 billion in net proceeds from long-term debt, while in fiscal 2023, this amount decreased to $2.0 billion. This significant reduction indicates a shift in HD's financing strategy, moving away from issuing long-term debt as a primary source of liquidity, possibly reflecting a more conservative financial stance or a reduced need for external financing during fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The net proceeds from long‑term debt increased sharply from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, rising from $6.9 billion to $2.0 billion of net proceeds (the 2023 figure reflects the $2 billion senior‑note issuance in November 2023, offset by repayments of $1 billion of senior notes and other debt). This shift signals that HD is relying less on large debt issuances and more on cash flow, equity‑based financing, and selective debt repayments to fund its capital‑expenditure and shareholder‑return programs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, foreign exchange gains were $403 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a $431 million non-cash gain from the remeasurement of Senior Notes in euros, partially offset by losses on cash and content liability positions. In contrast, by 2024, foreign exchange losses were $18 million (net of derivatives and hedging), with a $122 million non-cash gain from Senior Notes offsetting losses on cash and content liabilities. This marks a significant shift from a net gain in 2022 to a smaller net loss in 2024, with the Senior Notes' impact decreasing in magnitude and hedging playing a more prominent role in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, foreign‑exchange impacts on Interest and Other Income (Expense) shifted from a large non‑cash loss in 2022 (driven by euro‑denominated Senior Notes and related cash/content remeasurements) to modest net gains in 2023 and 2024, with the 2024 period showing a $122 million non‑cash gain from remeasurement of €5.17 billion of Senior Notes partially offset by currency‑related losses on cash and content liabilities; concurrently, interest expense rose modestly (≈3% YoY) as higher debt levels from new Senior Note issuances increased cash interest payments, while the overall magnitude of FX‑related gains/losses in the interest line remained relatively small compared with the earlier volatility.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Gigafactory Shanghai was listed as an active production location manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. By 2024, Tesla disclosed a formal agreement with the Shanghai local government that introduced new operational conditions tied to cumulative capital expenditure targets and annual tax revenue requirements starting in late 2023. Additionally, while incentives received in 2023 were deemed immaterial, Tesla continued to receive immaterial amounts in 2024, indicating that while the financial impact remained minor, the nature of the relationship evolved from operational to more formally structured with defined performance obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Tesla’s Gigafactory Shanghai continued to meet its cumulative capital‑expenditure and annual tax‑revenue targets set with the Shanghai municipal government, which underpins the land‑use rights and associated economic incentives for the facility. While the specific dollar amounts of the incentives remain immaterial, the ongoing compliance with these targets ensures that the tax‑benefit arrangements tied to the factory remain in force, supporting Tesla’s capital‑intensive expansion strategy in China.",

During the same period the net settlement exposure grew from roughly $62.9 billion in 2023 to $64.9 billion in 2024, which represents an increase of about 3.2 % in net exposure.

      "original_answer": "In the 2022–2023 period, Total Otezla revenue declined by 4% from $2,288 million to $2,188 million. In the subsequent 2023–2024 period, the decline continued but at a slower pace, with a 3% decrease from $2,188 million to $2,126 million. This indicates a worsening revenue trend in 2022–2023 followed by a slight moderation in the rate of decline in 2023–2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The year‑over‑year growth of total Otezla sales slowed markedly: it fell 4% in 2023 versus a 2% rise in 2022, and the 2024 decline deepened to about 3% (driven by lower net selling price and inventory, partially offset by modest volume growth). This pattern shows that Otezla’s revenue trajectory is now trending downward rather than continuing its modest prior‑year growth.",

In contrast, by 2023, the company recorded a significant net loss of $407 million from the disposal of businesses or assets. This sharp change indicates a notable shift in NextEra Energy's divestiture strategy, moving from limited asset sales with small gains to a more active divestiture approach involving larger transactions that resulted in a substantial net loss, possibly reflecting strategic portfolio realignment.",
      "llm_answer": "The gains on disposal of businesses or assets declined sharply from $407 million in 2023 to $4 million in 2022, reflecting a strategic shift away from large‑scale divestitures. This reduction indicates that NextEra Energy’s divestiture strategy moved from selling major business units (e.g., the 2021 $1.7 billion wind/solar portfolio sale) toward smaller, opportunistic transactions or no disposals in 2023, focusing instead on operational performance and growth initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, favorable items such as cost recoveries on severance and restructuring contributed to an increase in segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, the impact of such favorable items, including cost recoveries, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion. This indicates a slight decrease in the contribution from cost recoveries and similar items year-over-year, suggesting a minor reduction in the positive adjustments supporting operating profit.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost recoveries on segment operating profit shifted from a $1.8 billion increase in 2022 to a $1.6 billion increase in 2023, indicating that while recoveries continue to boost profitability, their contribution is moderating. This suggests that Lockheed Martin’s financial performance remains supported by cost recoveries, but the incremental benefit is diminishing, reflecting tighter margins or greater reliance on other profit drivers.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, fuel surcharge revenues were $3.0 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion from $3.7 billion in 2022, primarily due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and lower shipment volumes, although fluctuating fuel prices had a delayed impact on recoveries. By 2024, fuel surcharge revenues further declined to $2.6 billion from $3.0 billion in 2023, again driven by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lagged effect of price changes, partially offset by higher shipment volumes. This indicates a continued downward trend in fuel surcharge revenues over the two-year period, influenced by both pricing and volume dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "Freight revenues from fuel surcharge programs declined $0.7 billion in 2023 versus 2022 due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and lower volume, partially offset by the two‑month lag effect of price changes, and fell an additional $0.4 billion in 2024 as fuel prices dropped again and volumes shifted, while core pricing gains and volume increases in bulk, industrial and premium segments helped offset these declines. The key factors driving the change were fluctuating fuel prices, volume shifts (especially lower coal and rock shipments), and the timing lag in fuel surcharge recoveries.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil stated that its Corporate Plan assumptions included greenhouse gas emissions pricing as part of its economic evaluation for investments, developed annually based on its Global Outlook. By 2024, the company maintained this approach but emphasized that current policy trends and lower-emission solutions were not yet aligned with a net-zero pathway by 2050, indicating a more cautious stance on the pace of emissions reduction. This evolution suggests that while emissions pricing remains a consistent factor in planning, ExxonMobil is signaling that external policy support and technological advancements need to accelerate for the company to meet more aggressive emissions targets.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's Corporate Plan assumptions for greenhouse gas emissions pricing have remained consistent in approach—using a forward-looking, scenario-based framework that incorporates evolving policy and technology expectations—but the company has refined its application in the 2024 plan to better align with its long-term transition strategy. While both the 2023 and 2024 Corporate Plans rely on the Global Outlook for emissions pricing assumptions beyond 2030, the 2024 version explicitly integrates updated emissions pricing parameters into capital investment evaluations for lower-emission projects, emphasizing economic viability under projected policy stringency and technological advancement. This reflects a strategic shift toward prioritizing investments that are resilient to future carbon costs, signaling that ExxonMobil is increasingly treating emissions pricing as a core driver in its allocation of capital toward lower-emission opportunities, even as it maintains a baseline assumption of continued fossil fuel demand through 2050.",

By fiscal 2024, this figure had increased significantly, as the company reported a year-over-year rise in amortization expenses, attributing this growth directly to the acquisition of Splunk Inc. in March 2024. The Splunk acquisition, which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, also brought with it additional intangible assets that required amortization, marking a clear shift in Cisco's financial obligations tied to its acquisition-driven growth strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets increased from $73 million in fiscal 2022 to $313 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 46 % rise. This growth indicates that the company has been acquiring more intangible assets—most notably through its 2024 purchase of Splunk—thereby expanding its portfolio of acquired technologies and associated amortizable assets.",

In 2024, the number of owned refrigerated cars slightly decreased to 2,404, while the number of leased units dropped more significantly to 945, resulting in a total of 3,349 refrigerated cars. This reflects a decrease in both owned and leased refrigerated cars, with a more pronounced decline in leased units, indicating a shift toward reducing reliance on leased assets in this category.",

This represents a **decrease of 294 refrigerated cars** year-over-year, with the owned portion declining by 34 units (2,444 → 2,404) and the leased portion declining by 255 units (1,199 → 945).

      "question": "How did the impact of cost pass-through on Linde's sales evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's pricing dynamics?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde's long-term contracts enabled the company to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, positively impacting its business by ensuring stable cash flow. However, in 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on sales, indicating a shift in how these cost adjustments affected the company's revenue. This change suggests that rising costs could not be fully offset by customer pricing adjustments, potentially signaling tighter pricing conditions or increased cost pressures in the market.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, cost pass‑through – the contractual billing of energy‑cost variances to onsite customers – reduced reported sales by roughly 1 % (a $349 million decline in cost of sales) but had minimal impact on operating profit. This shift reflects a modest easing of cost‑pass‑through pressure, allowing higher price attainment and productivity gains to drive stronger operating profit growth. Consequently, the company’s pricing dynamics are becoming more effective at offsetting inflation, indicating improved ability to pass through cost changes while maintaining margin expansion.",

This downward trend indicates that the company is prioritizing spending on later‑stage clinical programs and marketed‑product support—especially those acquired through the Horizon transaction—over early‑stage discovery, reflecting a strategic shift to advance high‑impact assets toward commercialization while maintaining a more disciplined early‑pipeline budget.",

This represents a steady rise in the recognition of content-related costs over time. The increase suggests that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, with a growing portion of previously capitalized content assets being amortized as they were utilized over their expected viewing periods. This trend aligns with Netflix's strategy of expanding its content library to support global growth and member retention.",
      "llm_answer": "The amortization of content assets grew from $10.8 billion in 2020 to $12.2 billion in 2021 and to $15.3 billion in 2022, reflecting a steady increase in the amount of content being written off each year. This upward trend indicates that Netflix is expanding its content spend and accelerating the consumption of its library, underscoring a strategic focus on scaling original productions and licensing investments to drive subscriber growth.",

      "llm_answer": "From the 2022 10‑K (Note 17), the translation adjustment on net‑investment hedges was a loss of $175 million in 2020, which turned into a gain of $34 million by the end of 2021. The 2021 10‑K (page 67) shows that this gain continued into 2022, reaching $147 million before tax, and after tax it was $114 million. Thus, the net‑of‑tax impact grew from a $136 million loss (after tax) in 2020 to a $114 million gain (after tax) in 2022, reflecting a swing of roughly $250 million in net‑of‑tax terms over the 2022‑2024 period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reviewed its network location intangible asset for impairment using a cash flow modeling approach that incorporated tower location, demographics, timing of new tenants, lease rates, and ongoing cash requirements. Tenant-related intangible assets were assessed on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on turnover, contract non-renewals, or relationship terminations. By 2023, while the impairment review framework remained largely the same, the company added context around tenant risk by referencing a specific customer (VIL) in India that had made partial payments in 2022 and indicated it would not resume full contractual payments in 2023, signaling a shift in how tenant-specific risks were explicitly tied to impairment considerations.",
      "llm_answer": "The impairment analysis for the Network Location Intangible asset shifted from a qualitative assessment of tenant‑related risk and cash‑flow modeling in 2022 to a more detailed quantitative approach in 2023 that explicitly incorporated projected tenant cash‑flows, renewal assumptions and discount rates, while also reflecting heightened tenant‑related risk from VIL’s payment shortfalls and the resulting need for additional impairment reserves. Consequently, the 2023 analysis placed greater emphasis on cash‑flow forecasts and tenant‑risk factors, leading to a $322 million goodwill impairment charge for India and a reassessment of the tower‑portfolio and network‑location intangibles’ recoverability.",

In 2024, global Nplate sales decreased by 1%, but when excluding U.S. government orders ($128 million in 2024), sales increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 8% and higher net selling prices of 6%. This indicates a shift where organic growth offset the decline caused by reduced government orders.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in global Nplate sales shows a 1% decline in total sales for 2024, driven by a decrease in U.S. sales that included $128 million of U.S. government orders, while excluding those orders sales actually grew 12% due to volume and price increases. In contrast, 2023 saw a 13% increase in global Nplate sales, largely fueled by volume growth that included $286 million of U.S. government orders. Thus, U.S. government orders had a dampening effect on the 2024 sales decline but were a key contributor to the strong 2023 growth.",

      "question": "How did MDLZ's treatment and disclosure of war-related costs evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding their impact on operating results?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ excluded war-related costs associated with the conflict in Ukraine, including asset impairments, inventory losses, and allowances for uncollectible receivables, from non-GAAP operating results to facilitate comparisons of ongoing performance. By 2024, MDLZ disclosed a specific incremental cost of $4 million directly attributed to the war in Ukraine, which was included in operating results. This marks a shift from exclusion in 2023 to explicit recognition and quantification in 2024, indicating a change in how these costs were treated and communicated.",
      "llm_answer": "MDLZ’s war‑related costs continued to weigh on operating results in 2024, but the impact was markedly smaller than in 2023.  In 2023, higher raw‑material costs, unfavorable currency translation and incremental war‑related expenses (e.g., asset impairments, higher allowances for doubtful accounts) drove a $190 million drag on operating income and contributed to a 15.3% operating‑margin decline.  By 2024, those war‑related items were largely offset by higher net pricing, lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position, reduced acquisition‑integration costs and lower other SG&A expenses, allowing operating income to rise modestly (+$3 million) while the margin pressure from war‑related factors was largely removed.  Consequently, the 2024 results show a much lighter effect of war‑related costs on the bottom line compared with the substantial headwind seen in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs are capitalized in inventories if they relate directly to a specific contract or anticipated contract, with the determination that the contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources for performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable. Additionally, it specified that pre-contract costs were generally recognized as cost of sales upon receipt of the anticipated contract. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, emphasizing that these costs are incurred to enhance the ability to meet schedule and customer milestones, while maintaining the same core conditions for capitalization. The evolution reflects a more strategic framing of pre-contract cost incurrence without altering the financial treatment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin's disclosure of pre-contract costs remained consistent in its capitalization policy: costs incurred in advance of contract award are capitalized as work-in-process inventory only if they are directly related to a specific anticipated contract, the award is probable, and the costs are recoverable. This policy was reiterated in the 2023 \"Inventories\" note (page 79), which states that such pre-contract costs are generally recognized as cost of sales when revenue is recognized upon contract award, while all other pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred. The 2022 \"Inventories\" note (page 79) similarly described the same criteria for capitalizing pre-contract costs, confirming no change in the accounting policy between the years. The only notable shift was an increase in capitalized pre-contract costs to $989 million in 2023 (from $791 million in 2022), primarily driven by the Aeronautics segment's classified contracts, but the underlying conditions for capitalization—probable award and direct relation to anticipated contracts—remained unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Union Pacific had a total of 4,470 Flat Cars, consisting of 2,216 owned and 2,254 leased units. In 2024, this total decreased to 3,918 Flat Cars, with 1,966 owned and 1,952 leased units. This represents a reduction of 552 Flat Cars, or about 12.3%, over the year. The decline in both owned and leased Flat Cars suggests a reduced emphasis on this type of freight car in Union Pacific's fleet.",
      "llm_answer": "The total number of flat cars (both owned and leased) increased from 3,918 in 2023 to 3,918 in 2024, indicating no change in the count year-over-year. This suggests Union Pacific maintains a stable fleet size for flat cars, reflecting consistent reliance on this equipment type without significant expansion or contraction in capacity.",

By 2024, the company updated its projections, showing $356 million in expected payments for 2025, declining to $343 million by 2029, and a total of $1,752 million from 2030 to 2034. This indicates a slight increase in long-term obligations, particularly in the later years, despite a modest reduction in near-term payments.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, ExxonMobil's expected benefit payments under Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) remained flat at $356 million in 2025 and $344 million in 2026, with no material change indicated between 2023 and 2024. This stability suggests the company's long‑term OPEB obligations are relatively unchanged, implying that projected cash outflows for retiree health and life‑insurance benefits are expected to stay consistent over the near term.",

By fiscal 2023, the segment's revenue increased to $12.6B, and the percentage contribution of this segment to Accenture’s total revenues rose from 20% to 21%, indicating a growing emphasis on this industry group.

The segment's composition shifted toward higher growth, with HPS contributing 21% of total revenues in fiscal 2024 (up from 20% in fiscal 2022), driven by strong demand in healthcare providers, public safety, and government services, particularly within the U.S. federal government (which accounted for ~35% of HPS revenue in fiscal 2022).

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix described obligations for unknown future titles as part of its content obligations but did not specify whether these were expected to be significant. By 2024, the company explicitly stated that these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant,' indicating a more definitive acknowledgment of their material impact on future financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 Netflix’s disclosures shifted from describing its future content obligations as “significant” but “not estimable” and noting that “no amount has been accrued” (2022 language), to explicitly stating that the unknown obligations “are expected to be significant” and that the company now includes a detailed schedule of timing and amounts of those obligations in its 2024 filing. This change in language reflects a move from a vague, forward‑looking acknowledgment of material but unquantified liabilities to a more concrete, quantified disclosure of the expected payment schedule and magnitude of those future content commitments.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM identified 'Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets' as a key risk factor, indicating continued sensitivity to client budgets. However, in 2024, the company added a nuance by emphasizing a 'shift in client buying patterns' as a contributing factor to this risk, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2023. This evolution suggests that while the core risk remains stable, IBM is observing and highlighting changing dynamics in how clients allocate their budgets, potentially due to digital transformation trends or shifts toward cloud and AI investments.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings both highlight that a sustained decline in client spending budgets is a material risk, noting that reduced demand for its products and solutions—whether from broader economic conditions or shifts in client purchasing patterns—could directly depress IBM’s revenue and profitability. The company emphasizes that its growth strategy relies on continued investment in high‑value areas such as hybrid cloud and AI, and any slowdown in client spending would therefore significantly affect its financial results.",

This reduction signals that the company is shifting its capital‑allocation focus away from aggressive buy‑backs and toward preserving liquidity, funding growth initiatives, and supporting dividend increases.",

      "question": "How did the distribution of Card Member Loan balances between current and delinquent categories evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about American Express's credit risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, American Express reported $1,433 million in current consumer Card Member Loans and $103 million in 30-89 days past due, with $36 million in 90+ days past due. In 2024, these figures increased to $1,615 million in current loans, $110 million in 30-89 days delinquent, and $45 million in 90+ days past due. This indicates a moderate increase in both delinquency categories, suggesting a slight rise in credit risk exposure over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "The distribution of Card Member Loan balances shows that the current category increased from $2,863 million in 2023 to $2,863 million in 2024 (no change in absolute terms, but the proportion of the portfolio shifted), while the delinquent categories (30‑89 days past due and 90+ days past due) modestly declined from $220 million and $89 million in 2023 to $220 million and $89 million in 2024 respectively (essentially flat). This indicates that American Express’s credit risk exposure remained stable, with no significant rise in delinquencies and a continued predominance of loans classified as current.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the decline in ENBREL sales was attributed to three factors: lower net selling price, lower inventory, and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. By 2024, the decline was attributed solely to a lower net selling price, indicating that inventory and sales deductions were no longer significant contributors to the decline. Additionally, the company's expectations shifted from anticipating ENBREL to follow the historical quarterly sales pattern in 2024 with further price declines, to expecting relatively flat volumes with continued price erosion in 2025, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price set for 2026.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, ENBREL sales declined 10% driven by lower net selling prices, lower inventory and unfavorable sales‑deduction adjustments, while the company expects the decline to continue in 2025 as net selling prices fall further—reflecting heightened competition and the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price‑setting starting in 2026. Consequently, the company now projects relatively flat ENBREL volumes but continued downward pressure on pricing, shaping a more pessimistic outlook for future ENBREL performance.",

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's treatment and disclosure of pre-contract costs evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of capitalization and risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs were capitalized in inventory if they directly related to a specific anticipated contract, with the costs generally recognized as cost of sales upon contract award. The company also noted that start-up costs were expensed as incurred. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the strategic use of pre-contract costs in advanced procurement for a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment, with explicit mention of recoverability risks tied to the customer's decisions on future program phases. This reflects a shift from a general accounting policy to a more risk-focused disclosure involving specific programs and financial exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin’s approach to pre‑contract costs and the associated risk exposure shifted markedly toward greater capitalization and heightened scrutiny of recoverability. In the 2022 filing, pre‑contract costs were generally expensed as incurred, with only limited capitalization when recovery was deemed probable; the company disclosed that such costs could be written off if future performance issues or scope changes rendered them unrecoverable. By the 2023 filing, the firm began capitalizing certain advanced procurement and pre‑contract costs—particularly on programs like the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program and the Turkish Utility Helicopter Program—while explicitly warning that recoverability depends on achieving flight‑hour thresholds, contract restructuring, or customer decisions on future phases. This change reflects a higher tolerance for risk, as the company now records contract assets and liabilities for these capitalized costs and acknowledges that additional losses could arise if performance deteriorates or scope expands. Consequently, the evolution shows a move from expense‑recognition to capitalization of pre‑contract costs, coupled with larger contingent loss exposures tied to uncertain recovery.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MA reported a gross settlement exposure of $59,571 million and a net settlement exposure of $51,861 million after applying $7,710 million in risk mitigation arrangements. By 2024, the gross settlement exposure had increased to $78,385 million, and the net settlement exposure rose to $64,919 million after applying $13,466 million in risk mitigation arrangements. This indicates a significant increase in both gross and net exposures over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 the Company’s gross settlement exposure rose modestly, from about $75 billion to roughly $78.4 billion, while the risk‑mitigation arrangements (cash collateral, guarantees, etc.) also increased, reducing net settlement exposure from $62.9 billion in 2023 to $64.9 billion in 2024.  Consequently, the net settlement exposure grew slightly over the period, reflecting the larger gross exposure outweighing the modest gains from risk‑mitigation.",

By fiscal year 2023, this matter had been resolved during the fiscal year with no material impact on the company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.",
      "llm_answer": "The IRS transfer‑pricing adjustment investigation was fully resolved during fiscal 2023, leaving no material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Consequently, the adjustment had no material effect on the Company’s tax expense or related balances in fiscal 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ did not exclude the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from its Organic Net Revenue calculations, and Organic Net Revenue stood at $35.6 billion, reflecting a 14.7% increase driven by net pricing and favorable volume/mix. However, in 2024, due to the significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso in late 2023 and the potential distortion on constant currency growth measures, MDLZ decided to exclude pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year (classified as 'extreme pricing') from Organic Net Revenue and related non-GAAP metrics. This change was implemented prospectively starting in Q1 2024, with the impact of extreme pricing now being separately disclosed as part of 'currency-related items.' In 2024, extreme pricing in Argentina contributed $1,167 million (3.2 percentage points) to Organic Net Revenue growth, offsetting some of the unfavorable currency translation impacts. This indicates a strategic shift in how MDLZ accounts for and reports financial performance in hyperinflationary environments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment of extreme pricing in Argentina shifted from being included in Organic Net Revenue growth calculations to being excluded—beginning in Q1 2024, MDLZ removed pricing increases exceeding 26% year‑over‑year (the hyperinflation threshold) from its non‑GAAP growth metrics and offset this exclusion with currency‑translation adjustments. This change reflects MDLZ’s effort to isolate underlying volume and mix trends in its hyperinflationary Argentine market, signaling a more disciplined approach to measuring performance amid volatile price environments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that it would incur advanced procurement costs (precontract costs) to enhance its ability to meet the revised schedule and certain milestones on the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at the Aeronautics business segment. These costs were tied to the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program. By 2023, the company continued to incur these costs but shifted the terminology to 'pre-contract costs' and expanded the context to include ongoing monitoring of recoverability based on the customer's decisions about future phases. Additionally, while cumulative losses on the program increased from $225 million in 2022 to $270 million in 2023, the company maintained its focus on managing these advanced procurement costs in relation to program performance and future scope decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of advanced procurement (pre‑contract) costs related to the classified fixed‑price incentive fee contract was initially capitalized in inventory as work‑in‑process and recognized as cost of sales when the anticipated contract was awarded, but the company continuously monitors the recoverability of these pre‑contract costs and may record a loss if future performance issues or scope changes make recovery uncertain. Between 2022 and 2023, the company recorded additional reach‑forward losses on this contract (e.g., a $225 million loss in 2021 and a $100 million loss in 2023), and it noted that further performance problems or changes in scope could trigger additional losses, indicating that the accounting for these advanced costs remained subject to ongoing assessment and potential adjustment.",

In 2024, these figures rose to $62 million for performance-based awards and $50 million for restricted stock units, with recognition expected through early 2027. This indicates both a quantitative increase in liabilities and an extension of the recognition timeline.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed unrecognized compensation costs for performance‑based and restricted‑stock awards, the exposure related to supplementary retirement benefits for higher‑level employees increased from $48 million (performance‑based) and $42 million (restricted‑stock) as of December 31 2023 to $62 million (performance‑based) and $50 million (restricted‑stock) as of December 31 2024. This reflects a rise in the amount of compensation expense that will be recognized in future periods (primarily through 2026‑2027).",

By 2024, the recognized portion of content liabilities had increased to $6.2 billion (comprising $4.4 billion current and $1.8 billion noncurrent), with an additional $17.0 billion in unrecognized obligations, bringing the total to $23.2 billion.

This growth shows that the company is steadily expanding its multi‑year licensing and production spend, underscoring a strategy of investing heavily in a broad and deep content library to sustain subscriber growth and differentiate its streaming service.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company's inventory shrink reserve was $425 million (combining both short-term and long-term restricted balances), while in 2024, the shrink reserve increased by approximately $2 million to $427 million as of January 31, 2025. Regarding markdown reserves, in 2022, the reserve was not explicitly stated, but in 2024, it was reported at $222 million, reflecting a decrease of approximately $23 million from fiscal 2023. This indicates that the company experienced relatively stable shrink risk but reduced its markdown exposure, suggesting improved inventory management or stronger sales performance that lowered the need for markdowns.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's inventory reserves for shrinkage and markdowns decreased by $21 million overall between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024 ($222 million in 2024 versus $243 million in 2022), driven by a $23 million reduction in the markdown reserve offset by a $2 million increase in the shrink reserve. This decline signals that the firm is managing inventory risk more aggressively—maintaining tighter markdown allowances while modestly expanding its shrink‑reserve coverage—reflecting a strategy to protect margins while closely monitoring shrinkage‑related losses.",

The primary drivers were the loss of patent exclusivity—triggering direct biosimilar competition in the United States on January 31 2023—and continued biosimilar pressure abroad, which together erased the bulk of its prior growth. Consequently, Humira’s contribution to total net revenue fell from about 37% of 2021 sales to a much smaller share, underscoring the material impact of patent expiration on AbbVie’s top line.",

      "question": "How did GILD's disclosure regarding the risk to HIV product sales from shifts in treatment paradigms evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of their dependence on nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales and explicitly warned that any shift away from nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF could adversely impact HIV product sales. In 2024, while the company maintained the same risk narrative around potential paradigm shifts affecting nucleoside-based therapies, it omitted the specific percentage of total product sales attributable to HIV products. This suggests that while the core risk remained, the level of quantitative transparency decreased in the 2024 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, GILD’s disclosures show a consistent but increasingly nuanced focus on the vulnerability of its HIV product sales to shifts in treatment paradigms—particularly the potential decline of nucleoside‑based regimens such as tenofovir alafenamide (TAF).  \n\nIn the 2023 filing (pages 16‑20), the company emphasized that many of its HIV products contain TAF and warned that “if there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV, and nucleoside‑based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.” This language underscored a direct dependence on the continued dominance of nucleoside‑based therapies.  \n\nBy the 2024 filing (pages 16‑20), the warning was broadened and contextualized within a larger competitive and regulatory landscape: while still noting that HIV revenue relies heavily on TAF‑containing regimens, GILD framed the risk as part of broader “market share gains by competitive products, including generics” and “changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm” that could diminish the role of nucleoside‑based therapeutics. The 2024 text also linked this risk to the same reimbursement‑pressure themes (e.g., IRA‑driven pricing constraints) that affect all product lines, indicating that the company now views the nucleoside‑therapy risk as one component of a wider set of pressures on HIV sales rather than an isolated concern.  \n\nThus, the evolution is one of **intensified integration**: the 2023 disclosure singled out nucleoside‑based HIV drugs as a key exposure, whereas the 2024 disclosure treats that exposure as part of a broader, multi‑factor risk that includes competition, regulatory changes, and pricing pressures, reflecting a more holistic—but still explicit—acknowledgment of dependence on TAF‑based regimens.",

This evolution reflects a broader practice of omitting mark‑to‑market impacts on marketable securities from its non‑GAAP earnings measures, while also adding the Argentina‑specific pricing adjustment to its constant‑currency growth calculations beginning in Q1 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans showed a decreasing trend in future obligations, with amounts of $140 million for 2022 through 2024, declining to $130 million in 2025 and 2026, and totaling $570 million for 2027–2031. In 2023, Lockheed Martin continued to disclose these obligations but provided more detail on the accounting treatment, specifying that non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these plans were recorded as part of 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. This shift reflects a more detailed disclosure and classification refinement in 2023 compared to the primarily numerical disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the accounting treatment for retiree medical and life insurance plans remained classified under postretirement benefit obligations within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), with prior service costs and actuarial gains/losses initially deferred and subsequently amortized into FAS expense. In 2023, the net actuarial loss for these plans was $416 million (pre-tax), up from $387 million in 2022, driven by a decrease in the discount rate from 5.25% to 5.00%, increasing benefit obligations. The net prior service credit was $(2)$ million in 2023, compared to $(10)$ million in 2022, reflecting minor adjustments. These amounts were recognized in AOCL and amortized into income over time, consistent with prior years, maintaining their classification as postretirement obligations. The financial disclosure continued to reflect these plans as part of postretirement benefits, with no change in their accounting classification, though the magnitude of unrecognized gains/losses and prior credits shifted slightly due to valuation changes.",

      "original_answer": "The tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income continued to benefit Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, and in 2023, it increased slightly to 14.5%. Both years cite the foreign derived intangible income deductions as a key factor in reducing the effective tax rate, alongside other credits such as research and development and employee equity awards. The consistent mention of this deduction across both years indicates that it remained a stable component of the company's tax planning strategy, even amid broader tax law changes like the research and development capitalization rules that introduced new cash tax liabilities. However, the slight increase in the effective tax rate suggests a minor reduction in the relative benefit from these deductions.",
      "llm_answer": "The effective tax rate remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from 14.2% in 2022 to 14.5% in 2023, reflecting continued benefits from tax deductions for foreign-derived intangible income and research and development credits.

By 2024, this practice remained consistent, but the language evolved to emphasize that these assumptions were part of a broader set of economic inputs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing and foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting a more integrated and dynamic planning process that adapts to emerging policy and market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to incorporating refinery margins into its Corporate Plan assumptions has evolved to include more detailed, forward-looking modeling of refining economics within its long-term business outlook. The 2024 Corporate Plan now explicitly integrates refinery margin assumptions as part of its broader energy market fundamentals analysis, reflecting expectations of continued growth in liquid fuels demand through 2050 despite regional declines in light-duty vehicle consumption. This is consistent with the Outlook's projection that global liquid fuels demand will grow to 110 million barrels per day by 2050, with refining margins remaining relevant as a key component of the integrated business model's financial planning.",

In 2023, EMEA product revenue increased slightly to $10,645 million but its percentage contribution to total product revenue declined to 27.1%. This indicates that while the region maintained relatively stable revenue levels in absolute terms, its relative importance to Cisco's overall product revenue slightly diminished in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Cisco’s EMEA product revenue fell from $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion, a decline of about $1.2 billion (‑10%). Its share of total product revenue slipped from roughly 27.7 % in 2022 to about 27.1 % in 2023. This drop indicates that EMEA’s contribution to Cisco’s overall product sales weakened in 2023, reflecting a modest contraction in the region’s product performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde emphasized its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, indicating a proactive approach to cost management. By 2024, this mechanism had a negative 1% impact on sales growth, suggesting that while cost pass-through remained a feature of its contracts, it may have led to downward pressure on sales due to customer resistance or market conditions. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely strategic advantage to a more complex dynamic affecting revenue performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde’s cost‑pass‑through mechanisms continued to be applied primarily to on‑site customers, allowing the company to shift energy‑cost variances into pricing without materially eroding margins. In 2024, higher price/mix (up ≈ 3 % in the Americas and across other segments) more than offset the modest 1 % drag from cost‑pass‑through, driving a 7 % rise in segment operating profit and a 7 % increase in overall operating profit to $9.72 bn. This demonstrates that Linde’s pricing strategy increasingly relies on pass‑through of cost inflation to preserve profitability while maintaining competitive volume growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Operations and Support Expenses decreased due to automation in network operations, digitization of customer support, and reductions in personnel and network access costs, including a $75 benefit from a dispute settlement. By 2024, this trend continued as Business Wireline Operations and Support Expenses dropped to $14,217 million, down from the 2023 level, showing sustained progress toward efficiency goals. This reflects the company's ongoing transformation strategy to right-size operations in alignment with its strategic direction, indicating that the 2024 results are a continuation of the cost-saving initiatives launched in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2024 data in T_10k_2024.pdf (page 56), the Business Wireline segment’s Operations and Support Expenses totaled **$13,352 million**, which is lower than the 2023 level of **$14,217 million** (page 27) and the 2022 level of **$14,934 million** (page 27). This continued decline reflects the ongoing efficiency gains from automation and digitization initiatives that were first realized in 2023, demonstrating that those cost‑reduction measures are being sustained and further improved in 2024.",

Small business loans showed $45 million and $16 million in the same categories. By 2024, consumer delinquencies increased to $110 million (30-89 days) and $45 million (90+ days), while small business delinquencies rose to $56 million and $22 million respectively. This indicates a moderate increase in credit risk, suggesting potential deterioration in loan quality or economic pressures affecting repayment capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "The delinquency trends for Card Member Loans show that as of December 31 2024, the balances of loans in 30‑89 days past due fell to $220 million from $231 million a year earlier, and the 90+ days past due balance declined to $89 million from $73 million, indicating improved credit quality.  This reduction in past‑due balances, together with the modest increase in current balances for both consumer and small‑business loan portfolios, suggests that the company’s credit‑risk management has been effective at limiting new delinquencies and that existing modified loans are performing better than in the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD recorded a partial impairment charge of $50 million related to certain IPR&D assets, specifically linked to bulevirtide due to a delay in anticipated FDA approval. In contrast, 2024 saw significantly larger impairment activity, with two separate charges totaling $4.2 billion—$2.4 billion in Q1 and $1.8 billion in Q3—related to the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset for Trodelvy following the failure of the EVOKE-01 study and the subsequent discontinuation of the clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC. This marks a dramatic increase in impairment activity, signaling a major shift in the outlook for GILD's R&D initiatives, particularly in oncology.",
      "llm_answer": "The partial impairment charges related to IPR&D assets declined from $2.7 billion in 2023 to $2.4 billion in 2024, reflecting a less severe outlook for GILD’s research and development pipeline—particularly for the NSCLC indication of Trodelvy—while still indicating ongoing concerns about the commercial viability of certain IPR&D projects.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE's Accrued Asset Removal Costs were $406 million for decommissioning, $179 million for dismantlement, and $(494) million for other accrued asset removal costs, resulting in a total of $91 million. In 2023, these figures increased to $480 million for decommissioning, $182 million for dismantlement, and $(1,023) million for other accrued asset removal costs, leading to a total of $(361) million. This indicates a significant increase in the negative value of other accrued asset removal costs, which drove the overall total from positive $91 million in 2022 to negative $361 million in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, there is no information related to \"Accrued Asset Removal Costs\" for NEE (NextEra Energy) in either the 2022 or 2023 filings. The documents discuss Asset Retirement Obligations (AROs) for nuclear decommissioning, dismantlement of plants, and other accrued asset removal costs in Notes 11 and 12, but these are distinct from \"Accrued Asset Removal Costs\" as a specific line item. The ARO rollforward (Page 99) shows balances for NEE's AROs increasing from $3,166 million at December 31, 2020 to $3,179 million at December 31, 2021, but this is for the period ending in 2021, not 2022-2023. The 2023 ARO details (Page 52) reference \"Accrued decommissioning, dismantlement and other accrued asset removal costs (d)\" at $5,774 million as of December 31, 2023, compared to $5,450 million as of December 31, 2022, indicating a $324 million increase. However, this is part of a broader regulatory accounting framework for decommissioning and dismantlement costs, not the specific \"Accrued Asset Removal Costs\" metric questioned. The question's phrasing suggests a specific line item that does not appear in the provided financial statement notes.",

Second, while the 2023 Adjusted Operating Income table (page 48) showed a $0.14 impact from these adjustments, the 2024 comparison (page 51) indicates these costs were reduced and no longer a significant driver of segment operating income growth, reflecting a strategic de-emphasis on such adjustments in evaluating underlying performance. This shift aligns with the company's broader effort to streamline non-GAAP adjustments and focus on core operational metrics.",

However, in 2023, the Growth Markets revenue decreased by 2% in U.S. dollars but increased by 7% in local currency. This indicates a significant slowdown in growth compared to the previous year, despite positive momentum in local currency terms.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Growth‑Markets revenue grew 2% in local currency, and its contribution to overall local‑currency growth rose from roughly 17% of total local‑currency revenue (fiscal 2022) to about 18% (fiscal 2023). This indicates that Growth Markets accounted for a larger share of the company’s local‑currency revenue growth in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed actions taken to reduce pension obligation volatility, including pension risk transfer transactions such as the August 2021 purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for $4.9 billion in pension obligations, and noted a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion. The company also reported a weighted average discount rate of 2.875% for its defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021. In 2023, the company shifted focus to how it records components of FAS pension income/expense across different financial statement accounts and provided a reconciliation table for the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans, indicating a more structured financial presentation of benefit obligations and plan assets. This represents a shift from strategic pension risk management in 2022 to detailed financial disclosure and classification in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 the company’s disclosures of the funded status of its qualified defined‑benefit pension plans shifted markedly toward more detailed quantitative reconciliation and actuarial‑gain/loss information.  In the 2022 filing (pages 58‑62) the pension‑plan section presented only a brief funded‑status summary and limited actuarial‑gain/loss tables, whereas the 2023 filing (pages 81‑85) adds a full reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets, and the resulting unfunded status, plus an expanded table of actuarial gains/losses, prior‑service costs, and accumulated‑other‑comprehensive‑loss balances.  The 2023 note also clarifies that actuarial losses in 2023 stem from a discount‑rate reduction (5.25 %→5.00 %) and related changes, and it shows the amortization of those gains/losses into income.  Thus, the 2023 disclosure provides a more granular, line‑item presentation of the funded status and its impact on accumulated other comprehensive loss compared with the more aggregated 2022 presentation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased to $1.6 billion. This represents a reduction in the favorable profit adjustments year-over-year, indicating a decline in the magnitude of profit booking rate increases that positively impacted operating results.",
      "llm_answer": "The consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion in 2023 versus $1.8 billion in 2022, meaning the 2023 adjustment was $0.2 billion lower. These adjustments directly boosted each year’s segment operating profit, with the 2023 increase being about $0.2 billion smaller than the 2022 increase.",

This indicates that the company experienced a reduced pressure from cost pass-through mechanisms in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting improved pricing dynamics or better cost management.",

This reduction in cost pass-through pressure, combined with higher price/mix contributions (3% in 2024 vs. 6% in 2023), demonstrates that Linde successfully managed inflationary pressures through strategic pricing rather than passing costs to customers, signaling stronger pricing dynamics in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, foreclosure rates were listed as one of many external factors that could adversely affect customer confidence or financial condition, potentially leading to delayed purchasing decisions or reduced spending on home improvement products and services. By 2023, The Home Depot provided a more nuanced perspective, explicitly stating that adverse conditions in the housing market, including foreclosure rates, had already 'in some cases adversely impacted' customer behavior. This indicates a shift from a general acknowledgment of potential impact in 2022 to a more concrete recognition of realized effects in 2023, suggesting the company observed tangible changes in customer purchasing behavior linked to housing market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "The Home Depot’s discussion of foreclosure rates shifted from a brief, indirect mention in the 2022 filing—where foreclosure rates were only noted as part of broader macro‑economic factors that could affect demand—to a more explicit linkage in the 2023 filing, which ties rising foreclosure rates (and related housing‑market weakness) directly to reduced consumer purchasing power and lower demand for home‑improvement products. This evolution reflects a deeper integration of foreclosure‑related risk into the company’s assessment of market conditions and its impact on sales.",

In FY23, these costs were reported as 30.9% of Total Net Revenues, amounting to $11,180.6 million. While the absolute dollar value of these costs increased significantly, the percentage of revenue decreased, suggesting a more efficient cost structure relative to revenue in FY23 compared to FY22.",
      "llm_answer": "The data shows that Starbucks' **Product and Distribution Costs as a percentage of total net revenue decreased from 31.7% in fiscal 2023 to 30.9% in fiscal 2024** (a reduction of 80 basis points), primarily due to the impact of increased sales from pricing and reduced supply chain costs. This improvement occurred alongside a **130 basis point contraction in overall operating margin** (from 16.3% to 15.0%), driven by higher labor costs, deleverage, and promotional spending, which partially offset the cost-of-goods savings. Thus, while product and distribution costs declined as a percentage of revenue, the company's broader cost management strategy faced pressure from other operational investments, leading to margin compression.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD emphasized that inventory write-off charges were primarily linked to products failing specifications and quality standards, as well as changes in manufacturing strategy, with a focus on potential remediation efforts and costly alternatives. By 2024, the company shifted its emphasis, describing inventory write-offs as part of broader operational risks tied to single-entity dependencies in manufacturing and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), with a stronger focus on supply chain interruptions and their impact on clinical and commercial product availability. This evolution reveals a strategic shift from internal quality and strategy concerns to external manufacturing and supplier risks.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, GILD’s discussion of inventory write‑off charges remained consistent: the company continues to incur and expects to incur such charges for products that fail to meet specifications, quality standards, or for strategic manufacturing changes, and these charges can increase costs, erode revenue and damage its reputation. The 2024 disclosures add new emphasis on how manufacturing‑related risks—such as single‑source suppliers, regulatory suspensions, and counterfeit or diverted products—could interrupt production and trigger additional write‑offs, underscoring a heightened focus on managing manufacturing vulnerabilities in its risk disclosures.",

This represents a reduction of $71 million, or approximately 16.3%, indicating a decline in the company's international tax burden over the two fiscal years.",

This decline indicates that the company's effective tax rate fell slightly (from 23.9% to 24.0%) and that its exposure to foreign income taxes is modestly decreasing, reflecting lower foreign earnings or more favorable tax treatment abroad.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 19% increase in streaming revenues, with an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $11.67. By 2024, the streaming revenue growth rate had slowed to 17%, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership had decreased slightly to $10.96. This indicates a shift in Netflix's pricing strategy, potentially reflecting competitive pressures or changes in content value perception by consumers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s streaming revenue grew from $31.5 billion to $39.0 billion, a compound annual growth rate of roughly 16 % per year, while average monthly revenue per paying member (ARM) remained flat at about $11.70, showing only a 1 % increase over the period. This steady ARM alongside double‑digit revenue growth indicates that the company has been able to expand its subscriber base and modestly raise prices without significantly eroding pricing power, reflecting a strategy of incremental price adjustments and market‑level testing rather than aggressive hikes. Consequently, revenue generation is increasingly driven by scale—more paying members—while maintaining cost discipline, as evidenced by declining cost‑of‑revenues percentages and stable operating margins.",

In 2024, the total costs increased significantly to $365 million, driven primarily by a substantial rise in compensation and benefits to $214 million and a large increase in other costs to $134 million, with facility exit costs also contributing $13 million. This represents a major transformation in both the magnitude and structure of costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The total restructuring and related costs for Investor Services declined sharply from $365 million in 2023 to $504 million recognized through December 31 2024, reflecting a $101 million increase in cumulative costs over the two‑year period.  This change is driven primarily by higher employee compensation and benefits expenses (rising from $214 million in 2023 to $256 million in 2024) and modest additions in facility exit costs, while the composition shifted toward more severance and retention payments and less reliance on occupancy‑related charges.",

In 2024, the company reported a sharp increase in these impairments to $4,180 million, representing a substantial year-over-year increase from the 2023 level. This indicates a reversal of the prior year's downward trend and a significant rise in impairment charges over the two-year period.",

The increase reflects a $2.4 billion impairment in Q1 2024 and a $1.8 billion impairment in Q3 2024 related to the Trodelvy (sacituzumab govitecan) NSCLC intangible asset.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for qualified defined benefit pension plans were implicitly included within the company's broader disclosures on funded status, without a detailed breakdown of where these costs were recorded in the income statement. In 2023, LMT explicitly disclosed that the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these pension plans were recorded in a separate line item titled 'non-service FAS pension income (expense) account.' This indicates a more granular and transparent presentation of pension-related expenses in the financial statements in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The presentation of non‑service components for LMT’s qualified defined benefit pension plans remained in the non‑service FAS pension (income) account, while the accounting treatment of those components continued to follow the same amortization methodology (straight‑line over average remaining life expectancy or service period) as disclosed in the 2022 filing. However, the 2023 disclosures show a shift in how actuarial gains/losses and prior‑service costs are reported: the 2023 table (page 85) records actuarial gains/losses as negative amounts and includes a separate line for “Recognition of Previously Deferred Amounts” that offsets prior‑year deferrals, whereas the 2022 presentation (page 101) listed non‑service FAS pension expense as a negative expense and used different sign conventions for actuarial gains/losses and settlement charges. Consequently, while the underlying components (interest cost, expected return, amortization of prior service) are still presented separately, the way they are aggregated and labeled in the FAS expense schedule changed between 2022 and 2023.",

By fiscal year 2024, these figures increased to $37.2 billion in total unrecorded purchase obligations, with $15.9 billion due within one year. This indicates a significant increase in both the overall level of obligations and the near-term portion requiring fulfillment.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, Walmart’s unrecorded purchase obligations fell sharply. The total amount of those obligations dropped from **$27.9 billion** (as of the 2022 filing) to **$37.2 billion** in the 2025 filing, but the portion that must be settled within one year also declined from **$9.3 billion** to **$15.9 billion**. In other words, the overall unrecorded purchase commitments grew, yet the share that is due in the near‑term increased as well.",

This suggests that LMT experienced an increase in new orders or delays in fulfilling existing orders, which could signal stronger future revenue potential assuming the company can execute on the growing backlog.",
      "llm_answer": "The backlog at year‑end grew from $27.0 billion in 2022 to $32.2 billion in 2023, an increase driven primarily by higher orders on classified programs, PAC‑3, LRASM, JASSM and other missile‑defense contracts. This larger backlog signals that the company has secured more firm work that is expected to generate future revenue, supporting expectations of modest sales growth and continued profit expansion in the coming periods.",

      "original_answer": "Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs increased from $2,357.7 million in 2022 to $11,180.6 million in 2023 in absolute terms. However, as a percentage of Total Net Revenues, these costs decreased from 34.0% in 2022 to 30.9% in 2023. This indicates that despite higher overall spending, the company became more efficient in managing these costs relative to revenue. The decline in the cost ratio suggests improved supply chain performance or cost containment strategies that allowed Starbucks to scale operations more efficiently year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs as a percentage of Total Net Revenues decreased from 31.7% in fiscal 2023 to 30.9% in fiscal 2024, a reduction of 80 basis points. This decline, driven primarily by the impact of increased sales from pricing (approximately 70 basis points) and reduced supply chain costs (approximately 60 basis points), suggests improved supply chain efficiency during the period, as the company successfully negotiated lower input costs and optimized distribution networks despite broader inflationary pressures.",

Specifically, U.S. sales increased slightly to $1,118M from $1,060M (5.5% growth), while international sales declined to $161M from $174M (-7.1% change).

      "question": "How has the composition of Costco's Non-Foods merchandise category evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of the specific product lines included?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Costco's Non-Foods category included 'major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, garden and patio, sporting goods, tires, toys and seasonal, office supplies, automotive care, postage, tickets, apparel, small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry.' By 2023, the category retained most of these items but showed subtle changes: 'electronics' was more specifically defined as 'small electronics,' 'garden and patio' was simplified to 'lawn and garden,' and 'automotive care' and 'postage' were shortened to 'automotive' and 'stamps,' respectively. These changes suggest a slight refinement in categorization and emphasis, though the overall scope of the Non-Foods segment remained largely consistent.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Costco’s Non-Foods merchandise category remained part of its broader \"Non-Foods\" core business, which includes major appliances, electronics, health and beauty aids, hardware, lawn and garden, sporting goods, tires, toys, seasonal items, office supplies, automotive, stamps, tickets, apparel, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry. The company continued to emphasize a limited selection of fast-selling items, carrying fewer than 4,000 active SKUs per warehouse in its core warehouse business, consistent with its operational model. While specific product line expansions or contractions within Non-Foods are not detailed in the provided 2022 and 2023 pages, the structural composition of the category remained stable, with Non-Foods continuing to complement its core offerings alongside Foods, Fresh Foods, and Ancillary businesses. The 2023 document does not indicate a material shift in the category’s composition, suggesting continuity in product focus rather than a strategic evolution during this period.",

      "question": "How did the impact of profit booking rate adjustments on segment operating profit evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about Lockheed Martin's contract performance during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased to $1.6 billion. This represents a $200 million decline in the favorable impact of profit booking rate adjustments year-over-year, suggesting a moderation in the degree of positive revisions to contract cost estimates or an increase in unfavorable adjustments during 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the impact of profit booking rate adjustments on segment operating profit evolved from a $1.8 billion favorable adjustment in 2022 to a $1.6 billion favorable adjustment in 2023, reflecting a $200 million decrease in the net benefit from these adjustments. This reduction indicates that Lockheed Martin experienced less favorable profit adjustments—particularly in segments such as Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control—during 2023, suggesting that contract performance faced greater cost pressures or less favorable scope changes, leading to a modest decline in overall segment profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's International Segment had $19.2 billion in assets held for sale, primarily related to its operations in the U.K. and Japan, which were subsequently closed. This indicated a strategic shift in international operations, though the segment still played a significant role. By fiscal 2024, the International Segment generated approximately 18% of Walmart’s consolidated net sales, highlighting its continued importance. However, the 2024 report noted that unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations were adversely affecting the reported performance of the International Segment and, consequently, Walmart’s consolidated results. This evolution shows that while the segment remained a substantial contributor, its exposure to currency risk had become a more explicitly stated financial vulnerability, with a direct negative impact on consolidated performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through its International Segment has evolved such that unfavorable currency movements have increasingly weighed on its consolidated financial performance. While the company's international operations generated about 18% of total net sales in fiscal 2025, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates—particularly those unfavorable to the U.S. dollar—have materially adversely affected reported results, as noted in the 2022 10-K (page 63) which states such fluctuations \"adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\" This exposure has been a consistent risk, with the company actively managing it through hedging instruments like cross-currency swaps (page 62), but the translation of international segment results into U.S. dollars continues to create volatility in consolidated net sales and earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, content amortization increased by $1,423 million due to the expansion of existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. This increase was a major driver of the overall rise in cost of revenues. By 2024, the focus had shifted toward the complexity and subjectivity of the amortization methodology itself, with Netflix emphasizing the judgment involved in estimating future viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. The company also implemented more rigorous internal controls and audit procedures to validate the assumptions and data used in amortization modeling, indicating a more refined and risk-aware approach to managing content amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s content amortization methodology—based on estimates of future viewing patterns derived from historical and forecasted consumption—has remained consistent from 2022 through 2024, but the company has refined its assumptions to reflect evolving viewing behavior and pandemic‑related production delays. Consequently, amortization grew more slowly than revenue in 2021‑2022 (e.g., cost of revenues fell from 61 % to 58 % of revenue), and by 2024 the amortization schedule continues to be adjusted as new viewing data emerge, influencing the timing of expense recognition and the overall financial impact on earnings.",

By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include a broader set of factors such as changes in pricing (including fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives), general economic conditions, geopolitical events, regulations, new product launches, and seasonality. Additionally, 2023 introduced more nuanced factors like advertiser competition for keywords, changes in device mix, and traffic growth in emerging versus mature markets, which were not explicitly mentioned in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the disclosure around the factors influencing paid clicks remained consistent in structure—highlighting growth in search queries, mobile adoption, advertiser spending, and product/format improvements—but the 2023 filing (GOOGL_10k_2023.pdf, page 30) explicitly added new drivers not emphasized in 2022: the impact of AI‑enhanced ad formats and the increasing share of queries from emerging markets, alongside continued pandemic‑related volatility.

      "question": "How has Costco's approach to square footage growth in international markets evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about its global expansion strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Costco noted that square footage growth was 'generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets' and expected this trend to continue. In 2023, this observation remained consistent, with the company reiterating that 'certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth.' However, the 2023 filing added more emphasis on the strategic importance of international expansion by highlighting that these markets have 'lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales' and 'less or no direct membership warehouse competition.' This indicates that while the company maintained its focus on international square footage growth, it increasingly framed this strategy in terms of cost advantages and market opportunity. The evolution suggests a more deliberate shift toward leveraging international markets not just for growth, but for operational efficiency and competitive positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco’s international square‑footage growth slowed modestly in 2023 versus 2022, with new‑warehouse openings adding a smaller share of total growth as the company’s global footprint expands and site availability tightens, but the firm still relies on foreign markets to drive higher square‑footage growth than in the U.S. This shift signals a strategic focus on consolidating existing overseas locations while continuing to pursue new openings in less‑saturated international markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM used observable quoted prices primarily for equity securities held in separate accounts and relied on observable inputs of comparable market transactions for corporate, government, and asset-backed debt securities. In 2024, the company expanded the scope of observable quoted prices to include non-U.S. equity securities and specifically added government debt securities traded on active exchanges. Additionally, in 2024, XOM introduced a new category for cash balances subject to withdrawal penalties, which are treated as level 2 inputs. This indicates a more detailed and nuanced approach in 2024, with increased specificity in the application of observable quoted prices across a broader set of assets.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, XOM's reliance on observable quoted prices for fair value measurement of debt and equity securities remained consistent in scope and specificity. For equity securities held in separate accounts, fair value continued to be based on observable quoted prices on active exchanges (Level 1), with no change in methodology. For debt securities, fair value was consistently based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions (Level 2 inputs), including specific references to corporate, government, and asset-backed securities using comparable market transactions (Note 18, page 109; page 110). The documentation for 2024 (page 108) and 2023 (page 109) both explicitly state these inputs without expansion or modification, indicating no evolution in scope or specificity. The only variation was in the presentation of the fair value hierarchy tables, but the underlying valuation techniques and input sources remained unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, NVIDIA’s approach to long‑term supply commitments shifted toward shorter lead times and greater financial risk exposure.  In the 2022 filing the company noted that it was placing inventory orders “well in advance of historical lead times” and paying premiums to secure capacity, while acknowledging the risk of excess inventory if demand fell.  By the 2023 filing, NVIDIA reported that it had “begun placing orders at least twelve months in advance” and that “inventory and purchase commitments reflect our demand expectations for future quarters,” indicating a move to even earlier, longer‑term commitments.  At the same time, the company highlighted that these commitments increase exposure to inventory write‑downs and cost pressures if demand softens, underscoring a higher financial risk associated with securing supply.",

On an adjusted basis, the increase was from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024. The year-over-year growth in adjusted income from equity investments was modest, driven by improved performance in certain investments, although in the prior year, a decline was attributed to the overall performance of investments in APAC. In 2024, no such broad regional drag was mentioned, suggesting a stabilization or slight improvement in equity investment performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM highlighted that its hybrid cloud infrastructure was designed specifically for mission-critical and regulated workloads. By 2024, the company expanded its focus to include AI workloads, indicating a strategic shift toward supporting emerging AI-driven applications alongside traditional mission-critical systems. This reflects an evolution in IBM's infrastructure segment to align with growing market demands for AI capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, IBM's hybrid cloud infrastructure positioning evolved to explicitly target **mission-critical and AI workloads** as its core differentiator. The 2024 filing emphasizes that IBM gains advantage through \"investments in higher-value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission-critical and AI workloads\" (page 4), while the 2023 filing similarly notes its infrastructure strategy focuses on \"mission-critical and regulated workloads\" (page 4). This represents a clear strategic refinement between 2023 and 2024, shifting emphasis toward AI-optimized, high-value infrastructure to support enterprise digital transformation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MET reported Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues of $5,727 million. In 2024, this metric decreased by $212 million, or 3%, to $5,515 million on a reported basis. However, when adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations, the metric increased by $149 million, or 2%, compared to 2023. This change was driven by higher premiums in Korea and Australia, along with increased fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, which were partially offset by declines in premiums from Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues for MET declined overall in 2024, decreasing $238 million (‑3%) when measured against the prior year, driven primarily by lower premiums in the pension risk‑transfer and post‑retirement benefit businesses, which were partially offset by growth in the U.K. longevity reinsurance and institutional income annuities segments.  However, when examining the broader segment breakdown, the Group Benefits and Latin America segments posted increases of $941 million (+4%) and $209 million (+4%) respectively, with the Latin America growth fueled by strong sales and persistency in Chile and Mexico, while the EMEA segment saw a $202 million (+9%) rise supported by corporate‑solution sales across the Gulf, U.K. and Egypt and expanding credit‑life and pension businesses in Turkey and Romania.  These regional dynamics—particularly the robust performance in Latin America and EMEA—helped mitigate the declines observed in the Retirement & Income Solutions segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for qualified defined benefit pension plans were part of the accumulated other comprehensive loss, with actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recognized due to differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. By 2023, these non-service components were explicitly recorded in a separate line item called 'non-service FAS pension income (expense)' within the consolidated statements of earnings, indicating a shift in how these expenses were categorized and reported financially.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the non‑service components of FAS income for LMT’s qualified defined‑benefit pension plans shifted from a $1.47 billion non‑service expense in 2022 to $443 million of non‑service income in 2023, while the corresponding amount for retiree medical and life‑insurance plans moved from $106 million of non‑service income in 2022 to $56 million in 2023. This change reflects the recognition of previously deferred actuarial gains and prior‑service credits, as well as the amortization of those items, resulting in a substantial reduction in the non‑service expense (or a swing to income) for the pension plans and a modest decline in non‑service income for the medical/life‑insurance plans.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart recorded impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the Walmart International segment, primarily due to the write-off of one of Flipkart's fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as part of a strategic shift toward focusing on Myntra.com. By fiscal 2024, the nature of financial risk for Walmart International had evolved from internal strategic asset impairments to a more external and ongoing exposure to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations. Specifically, the 2024 filing highlights that unfavorable currency exchange rate movements would 'adversely affect the reported performance' of the international segment and notes that such fluctuations have already impacted results. This represents a shift from one-time strategic write-offs in 2022 to sustained financial risk from macroeconomic factors by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart International's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations remained material throughout the period, with unfavorable currency movements continuing to negatively impact reported financial performance. The company explicitly states that \"unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations\" and specifically notes that such fluctuations \"adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment.\" While the provided documents do not quantify the exact change in exposure between fiscal 2022 and 2024, they confirm that currency translation continues to be a significant risk factor for the international segment, which generated approximately 18% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025. The company's financial statements are prepared in U.S. dollars and must translate foreign currency amounts, making them vulnerable to exchange rate volatility.",

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's financial exposure related to its Compute & Networking segment evolve between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of goodwill and warranty liabilities?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA reported an increase in goodwill of $143 million assigned to the Compute & Networking segment due to acquisitions, bringing the total goodwill for that segment to $3.99 billion as of January 30, 2022. In contrast, by fiscal year 2023, the company noted that additions to product warranty liabilities primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment, indicating a growing financial exposure tied to product warranties rather than acquisition-related goodwill. This shift suggests a transition in the nature of financial commitments associated with the segment, from acquisition-driven asset valuation to operational liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment exposure evolved through the Mellanox acquisition's goodwill and warranty liabilities: the $3.43 billion goodwill from the acquisition was allocated to this segment and remains unamortized, while warranty liabilities for the segment increased substantially—from $82 million at the end of fiscal 2023 to $306 million at the end of fiscal 2024—reflecting additions tied primarily to Compute & Networking activities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements were described as a component of 'Other revenues' and were specifically tied to marketing and selling consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand. The 2023 filing also mentioned that the company provided an 'insignificant amount' of assistance, including royalty relief, to certain franchisees impacted by the war in the Middle East. By 2024, the description of brand licensing remained consistent as part of 'Other revenues,' but the company noted it provided only an 'immaterial amount' of assistance, including royalty relief or deferral of cash collection for certain franchisees. This indicates a slight evolution in the framing of financial assistance, suggesting a minor reduction in support or a shift in how the company assessed the materiality of such aid in the context of global events.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, McDonald’s brand licensing arrangements remained heavily franchised, with franchised restaurants representing approximately 95% of worldwide locations in 2024. The company’s revenue model continued to rely on franchised revenues (rent, royalties, and initial fees) and company-operated sales, but the nature of licensing evolved to include more developmental licenses and affiliate arrangements, particularly in international markets. Financially, franchised margins accounted for roughly 90% of restaurant margin dollars in 2023 and grew modestly in 2024, driven by sales growth in the U.S. and International Operated Markets, while company-owned margins faced pressure from U.S. sales declines and inflation. The shift toward more licensing-based models, especially in developmental licensed markets, contributed to stable, predictable cash flows but also exposed the company to macroeconomic headwinds, such as the war in the Middle East, which impacted system-wide sales in those regions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments were influenced by factors such as legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices, unbilled claims, processing time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. The company also emphasized its compliance with the SEC Consent Order, which included procedures for limiting sales to direct customers and estimating inventory levels using internal and external data from U.S. wholesalers. By 2024, the GTN sales adjustments included additional details on external rebate programs in non-U.S. countries, such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing, and pricing claw-backs. The company also expanded its use of external information sources, including third-party market research data and written/oral inventory updates from wholesalers, and highlighted limitations in relying on such third-party estimates and timing lags. This indicates a broader and more detailed approach to GTN adjustments, especially in international markets and data integration.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the scope and methodology for estimating GTN sales adjustments remained consistent in its reliance on external data, but the documentation evolved to reflect more structured use of third‑party information. Both the 2022 and 2024 filings describe the use of wholesaler inventory data, prescription‑demand forecasts, market‑research data, and internal analytics to estimate rebates, returns, charge‑backs, and other adjustments. The 2024 discussion emphasizes that these external inputs are combined with historical experience and projections of inventory levels, shelf life, competitive product pricing, and generic entry to gauge returns for established and new products. While the core factors (inventory, historical return rates, competitive dynamics, and pricing) are unchanged, the 2024 filing provides a more detailed articulation of the external sources—such as third‑party market‑research data and direct communications with wholesalers—and notes the inherent limitations of relying on estimates that may lag or be themselves estimates. Thus, the methodology’s substance is stable, but the articulation and emphasis on external data sources have become more explicit in the 2024 filing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola did not mention labor unrest or risks associated with manufacturing facilities impacting net operating revenues. The 2022 filing primarily described how net operating revenues were generated through concentrate and finished product operations, with no explicit mention of labor-related risks. However, in 2023, the company explicitly stated that strikes, work stoppages, or labor unrest at major manufacturing facilities or bottling operations could impair the ability to supply concentrates and syrups, which could reduce net operating revenues and expose the company to customer claims. This represents a new risk factor introduced in 2023 related to labor disruptions affecting revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Coca-Cola’s risk disclosures about labor unrest evolved from a general warning that strikes or work stoppages at major manufacturing facilities could impair supply and reduce net operating revenues (2022 KO_10K p. 4‑8) to a more detailed articulation that ties such unrest to potential increases in labor costs, disruptions to concentrate and syrup supply, and reputational damage that could further depress sales (2023 KO_10K p. 16‑20). The newer filing explicitly links unresolved collective‑bargaining negotiations and labor unrest at bottling partners to higher costs, lower employee morale, and the risk of corporate campaigns that could harm the Company’s brand and consumer acceptance.",

      "original_answer": "Caterpillar's product liability and insurance loss reserves increased from $1.3 billion in 2022 to $1.4 billion in 2023. This indicates a slight increase in the company's estimated exposure to product liability and insurance losses over the period. The reserves are based on reported claims and actuarial estimates for incurred but not reported losses, suggesting that either the frequency or severity of claims may have increased compared to historical levels.",
      "llm_answer": "Caterpillar's product liability and insurance loss reserves increased slightly from $1.3 billion at the end of 2022 to $1.4 billion at the end of 2023, reflecting ongoing accruals for reported claims and actuarial estimates of incurred but not‑reported losses. This modest rise indicates that the company continues to face exposure to potential product‑related claims and insurance costs, though the increase is not material and suggests that current reserves are considered sufficient under prevailing assumptions.",

By 2023, the company's outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations had significantly increased to $16.1 billion as of January 28, 2024. This indicates a substantial escalation in NVIDIA's supply chain commitments, reflecting a strategic shift toward securing greater manufacturing capacity and inventory supply, likely to support growing demand for its products.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 10‑K (page 71) NVIDIA reports “Excess inventory purchase obligations (1) $1,655 million” and “Excess inventory purchase obligations (1) $954 million” for fiscal 2023 and 2022 respectively, and notes that in fiscal 2024 it recorded an expense of approximately $1.4 billion for inventory purchase obligations in excess of demand projections. This shows a sharp increase in the company’s inventory‑purchase commitments between 2022 and 2023, reflecting stronger supply‑chain commitments to secure components ahead of anticipated demand.",

      "question": "How did HD's merchandise inventory levels evolve between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's inventory management strategy in relation to meeting customer demand?",
      "original_answer": "HD's merchandise inventories increased significantly from $30 million in fiscal 2022 to $110 million in fiscal 2023, representing a $80 million increase. This indicates a strategic shift toward building higher inventory levels, likely in response to supply chain challenges and efforts to 'continue to meet the demand environment' as mentioned in the 2022 filing. The significant increase suggests HD prioritized inventory availability to ensure product supply to customers, even at the cost of higher short-term working capital commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "HD's merchandise inventory levels declined from $57,275 million in fiscal 2022 to $56,865 million in fiscal 2023, a reduction of about $410 million (≈0.7%). This decrease reflects the company’s strategy of aligning inventory with consumer demand after building higher stock in 2022 to meet pandemic‑driven demand, and indicates a more disciplined inventory management approach that seeks to avoid excess while still ensuring sufficient supply for customer needs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM disclosed that during an extended financial market downturn, it could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding, which would pose liquidity risk and negatively impact financial flexibility. In 2024, the company repeated the same language regarding potential incremental pension funding requirements under similar conditions, indicating no substantive change in its exposure to pension-related liquidity risk. While the qualitative risk remained consistent, there is no explicit quantitative disclosure in either year that indicates a change in the magnitude of potential funding obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM’s 2024 filing notes that adverse market conditions can depress pension‑trust assets and increase estimated pension liabilities, potentially triggering incremental pension‑plan funding and related liquidity risk during an extended market downturn【page_11】. This suggests that the company’s exposure to pension‑related liquidity risk has grown modestly, as it now explicitly highlights the possibility of required additional funding and the associated liquidity constraints in its risk discussion【page_11】. No comparable language appears in the 2023 filing, indicating that the risk has become more pronounced rather than diminishing.",

However, in 2024, the company expanded its disclosure by formally integrating Systemwide Sales into its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), providing a detailed definition and linking it directly to franchisee health, loyalty programs, and as a driver of franchised revenues. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from merely setting goals around Systemwide Sales (2023) to institutionalizing its measurement and transparency (2024), reflecting a more mature and data-driven approach to managing and leveraging system performance.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, McDonald’s shifted its disclosure focus from a broad, risk‑heavy discussion of international operations, supply‑chain exposure, and franchisee dependence (pages 26‑30, 27‑28) to a more strategic emphasis on growth initiatives and shareholder returns. The 2024 filing highlights the “Accelerating the Arches” strategy, detailing specific pillars such as marketing, core menu innovation, digital and delivery expansion, and restaurant development, while also reporting concrete financial metrics (e.g., 1 % Systemwide sales growth, $130.7 billion in Systemwide sales, $7.7 billion returned to shareholders). This evolution signals that the company is now centering its narrative on executing its growth plan and delivering value to investors, rather than primarily warning about operational risks.",

      "question": "How did the trend in Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia evolve between 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, and what were the key differences in the impact of foreign currency fluctuations across these periods?",
      "original_answer": "In the 2022-2023 period, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia decreased by $377 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, and when net of foreign currency fluctuations, the decrease was minimal at $5 million. This was driven by declines in annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by higher premiums in Korea. In contrast, for 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $212 million, or 3%, compared to 2023, but net of foreign currency fluctuations, there was an increase of $149 million, or 2%, driven by growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products. Thus, while the reported revenue decline slowed from 5% to 3%, the underlying performance net of currency effects improved significantly, shifting from a slight $5 million decline to a $149 million increase.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022‑2023 and 2023‑2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia fell 3% on a reported basis (from $6,969 million to $6,757 million) but rose 2% when stripped of foreign‑currency effects (from $6,608 million to $6,757 million). The key driver of the modest growth in constant‑currency terms was higher premiums in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan’s foreign‑currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan’s accident & health and yen‑denominated life lines.  \n\nForeign‑currency fluctuations had a consistently negative impact on earnings across both periods: in 2022‑2023 the weaker yen, won and Australian dollar reduced adjusted earnings by about $34 million, and in 2023‑2024 the same currencies weakened again, subtracting roughly $34 million from earnings. Thus, while the underlying business trends showed slight revenue expansion in constant‑currency terms, reported earnings were pressured each year by adverse currency movements.",

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning of Humira relative to newer immunology products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq evolved between the 2022 and 2024 annual filings, particularly in the context of biosimilar competition?",
      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, Humira's global sales increased by 4% in 2021, with U.S. sales rising 8% due to market growth across all indications, though international sales declined 13% due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are highlighted as gaining market share and contributing to revenue growth, with Rinvoq benefiting from expanded regulatory approvals. By the 2024 filing, while no specific sales figures are provided, Humira is described in a broader product overview context without mention of growth metrics, and Skyrizi and Rinvoq are not explicitly referenced. This suggests a shift in strategic emphasis toward the broader immunology portfolio, likely in response to biosimilar pressures on Humira.",
      "llm_answer": "The strategic positioning of Humira has shifted from being AbbVie’s primary immunology anchor to a “legacy” product facing direct biosimilar competition, while newer agents like Skyrizi and Rinvoq are gaining share. In the 2022 filing, Humira’s international sales declined sharply (‑13% at constant currency) due to biosimilar erosion, and the 2024 filing notes that this decline was “partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq,” indicating that Skyrizi/Rinvoq are now cannibalizing Humira’s market share. Consequently, Humira’s growth now relies on modest U.S. increases (8% in 2021) rather than expansion, and the company is actively promoting Skyrizi and Rinvoq to sustain immunology growth amid biosimilar pressure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER reported a net income less net loss of $3,558 million, indicating a significant increase from the previous year. By 2024, NEE's 10-K filing projected NEER's capital allocation to be $3,945 million in 2025, sharply declining to $815 million in 2026 and further decreasing in subsequent years. This reflects a substantial downward shift in financial expectations and investment focus for NEER, transitioning from a year of strong reported earnings to a projected multi-year decline in capital allocation.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, NEER’s net income attributable to the segment increased sharply from $3,558 million to $2,299 million (as shown in the 2024 segment table), reflecting higher earnings from new clean‑energy projects and improved hedging results.  Capital allocation is being directed toward expanding clean‑energy capacity, with NEER projecting capital expenditures of roughly $11.0 billion in 2025, $7.5 billion in 2026, $3.8 billion in 2027, $1.5 billion in 2028 and $1.2 billion in 2029 (page 112), while FPL’s overall capital spend is expected to rise to about $8.4 billion in 2025 and $10.5 billion in 2026 (page 109).  These investments underscore a continued focus on growing NEER’s renewable portfolio and related infrastructure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX recognized revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis for substantially all defense contracts, primarily related to the Raytheon segment, using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. This approach was also applied to certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. By 2024, the company continued to use the percentage-of-completion method for defense contracts within Raytheon but expanded the explanation to include more nuanced treatment of variable consideration and performance obligations spanning multiple phases of the product life-cycle, such as production, maintenance, and support. Additionally, in 2024, RTX emphasized the allocation of transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices, which was not explicitly detailed in 2023. This indicates a more structured and granular approach to revenue recognition for long-term contracts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue‑recognition methodology for Raytheon’s long‑term aerospace contracts has remained consistent – performance obligations are satisfied over time using a cost‑to‑complete (percentage‑of‑completion) basis driven by incurred costs, which reflects the continuous transfer of control to the customer.  However, the 2024 disclosures note a shift in the handling of variable consideration and contract‑loss provisions: the company now includes more detailed estimates of variable amounts (e.g., flight‑hour and usage‑based fees) in the transaction price and recognizes loss provisions when anticipated costs exceed expected consideration, leading to adjustments in the timing and amount of revenue recognized on certain defense and aftermarket contracts.  These refinements affect the pattern of revenue recognition but do not change the underlying over‑time measurement approach.",

      "question": "How has the financial impact of Content Amortization evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its magnitude relative to revenue and its effect on operating income?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Content Amortization was $14,026,132 (thousands), representing a significant portion of NFLX's cost structure against $31,615,550 (thousands) in revenue and contributing to an operating income of $5,632,831 (thousands). By 2024, Content Amortization increased to $15,301,517 (thousands), while revenue grew to $39,000,966 (thousands), resulting in a higher operating income of $10,417,614 (thousands). This indicates that although amortization costs rose, they were accompanied by substantial revenue growth, leading to improved profitability. The amortization as a percentage of revenue decreased from approximately 44.4% in 2022 to 39.2% in 2024, suggesting improved efficiency or scaling in content cost management.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of Content Amortization has grown steadily from $14.0 billion in 2022 to $15.3 billion in 2024, representing roughly 39% of 2024 revenue versus about 44% of 2022 revenue, so its relative magnitude has declined.  This reduction coincides with operating income rising from $5.63 billion in 2022 to $10.42 billion in 2024, indicating that the larger amortization expense is now a smaller share of a substantially higher operating profit.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, consumer packaged goods sales were explicitly mentioned as part of the Company's 'Other revenues,' which included revenues from brand licensing arrangements using the McDonald's brand. In 2024, while the mention of brand licensing arrangements remained, the specific reference to consumer packaged goods was omitted from the description of revenue sources, suggesting a reduced emphasis or potential reclassification of this revenue stream. This evolution indicates a subtle shift in how the company is presenting its revenue sources, even though the overall structure remains largely franchising-focused.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2023 and 2024 SEC 10-K pages, McDonald's consumer packaged goods (CPG) sales are not explicitly detailed in the financial tables, but the document indicates that \"Other revenues\" includes \"revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand.\" In 2024, total \"Other revenues\" increased by 34% to $423 million (from $316 million in 2023), reflecting growth in CPG-related licensing activities. This growth contributed to the overall 2% increase in total revenues ($25,920 million in 2024 vs. $25,494 million in 2023), though CPG sales specifically are not broken out as a standalone line item. The document confirms that CPG revenue streams are part of the \"Other revenues\" category, which is a minor component of the company's total revenue structure.",

By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income and total CAS pension cost, indicating a shift from expense to income in the service cost component under FAS. This evolution suggests a favorable change in the company's pension adjustment dynamics, with CAS pension cost now exceeding the service cost component of FAS pension income to a greater extent than in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "The FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment—reflecting the difference between total CAS pension cost recorded in the business segments and the service‑cost component of FAS pension expense—declined from $1.96 billion in 2022 to $1.66 billion in 2023, indicating a reduced favorable adjustment.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 98 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through effective pricing strategies aligned with historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant turnaround from a substantial decline to a modest increase within one fiscal year.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 40 basis points in fiscal 2025 and by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024, reaching 24.1% and 23.7% of net sales respectively. The improvements were driven primarily by the U.S. segment’s price‑management strategy and growth in higher‑margin businesses, while the modest rise in fiscal 2024 also reflected lapping higher markdowns from the prior year. Key factors behind the changes include better pricing alignment, shifts toward higher‑margin categories and digital advertising, and cost‑control initiatives that reduced operating‑expense ratios.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that exclusivity assets had an estimated useful life ranging from 5 to 25 years, indicating a general framework for amortization based on contractual rights for new commercial aerospace platforms. By 2024, RTX provided more detailed financial disclosures, reporting that exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $3.3 billion at year-end, with remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, at approximately $5.5 billion. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely amortization-life-based disclosure to a more comprehensive valuation approach that includes forward-looking financial commitments and impairment assessments tied to the success of underlying aircraft platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX’s treatment of exclusivity assets and related financial commitments evolved in two key ways. First, the company recorded a $2.9 billion pre‑tax charge in Q3 2023 for the PW1100 GTF engine exclusivity issue, reflecting its 51 % share of expected customer compensation and incremental maintenance costs; this charge was reflected in a reduction of the accrual from $2.8 billion at year‑end 2023 to $1.7 billion at year‑end 2024 as compensation was paid out. Second, the company’s accounting for long‑term contracts and exclusivity payments continues to rely on variable consideration estimates and amortization over the useful lives of the assets (typically 5–25 years), with ongoing assessments of recoverability and impairment that can materially affect earnings if assumptions change.",

      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2024 and 2023 10-K disclosures, the impact of interest rate market indicators on ExxonMobil’s U.S. pension plan discount rate assumptions evolved as follows:  \n- In 2023, the U.S. pension plan discount rate was 5.30% (down from 5.60% in 2022), reflecting lower market rates, which increased the present value of future liabilities and contributed to an actuarial loss.  \n- By 2024, the discount rate rose to 5.70% (up from 5.30% in 2023), driven by higher market rates, which reduced the present value of liabilities and resulted in an actuarial gain.  \nThis shift directly affected the \"Net actuarial loss/(gain)\" in accumulated other comprehensive income, decreasing from a $39 million loss in 2023 to a $3 million gain in 2024 for U.S. pension plans.  \n\nThe resulting effect on actuarial gains/losses was a **$42 million improvement** (from a $39 million loss to a $3 million gain) in the U.S. pension plan's accumulated other comprehensive income, primarily due to the higher discount rate in 2024. This change was explicitly tied to the use of interest rate market indicators in determining the discount rate, as noted in the pension disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $8,024 million in 2023 to $8,635 million in 2024. This growth was driven by an increase in Segment Operating Profit from $9,070 million to $9,720 million. However, the reconciling items, including Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges, increased from $40 million in 2023 to $145 million in 2024, which partially offset the gains. The Purchase Accounting Impacts from Linde AG decreased from $1,006 million in 2023 to $940 million in 2024, contributing positively to the overall operating profit trend.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $8,024 million in 2023 to $8,635 million in 2024, a 7% rise. This growth was driven by higher segment operating profit across the Americas (+7%), EMEA (+12%) and APAC (+6%), while the Engineering segment profit fell 16% due to lower margins on Russian projects. The increase in segment profit was partially offset by $145 million of cost‑reduction and other charges and $940 million of purchase‑accounting impacts from the Linde AG merger, which together reduced reported operating profit from the $9,720 million segment total to $8,635 million.",

      "original_answer": "The total face value of Amazon's long-term debt increased from $50,553 million in 2022 to $67,182 million in 2023, but then decreased to $58,000 million by 2024. This indicates a reversal in trend, with a net reduction of $9,182 million between 2023 and 2024. Specific components contributing to this decline include the 2014 Notes, which decreased from $4,000 million in 2022 to $2,750 million in 2024, the 2017 Notes dropping from $16,000 million in 2022 to $13,000 million in 2024, and the 2021 Notes declining from $18,500 million in 2022 to $15,000 million in 2024. Additionally, the April 2022 Notes issuance of $12.8 billion decreased to $11,250 million by 2024, and the December 2022 Notes issuance of $8.3 billion dropped to $7,000 million by 2024. The credit facility, which was $803 million in 2022, was fully paid off by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Amazon’s total face value of long‑term debt fell sharply from about $67.2 billion to $58.0 billion. The decline reflects scheduled repayments and the termination of the $682 million revolving credit facility that was outstanding in 2023, which was not renewed in 2024. At the same time, the company continued to issue new senior notes (e.g., the April 2022 $12.8 billion issuance and the December 2022 $8.3 billion issuance), but the principal amounts of those notes were smaller than the maturing obligations, resulting in a net reduction of debt outstanding. Consequently, the overall debt profile shifted toward a lower total face value by the end of 2024.",

In 2023, these figures increased to $161 million for Series B and $20 million for Series C. This indicates that the recovery mechanism became more effective for both series, particularly for Series C where the increase was more pronounced (from $6 million to $20 million). The upward trend suggests improvements in how the recovery mechanism responded to market conditions or structural changes in the instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "The conversion rate recovery for Series B and Series C instruments improved markedly from 2022 to 2023, with the effective price per share rising from roughly $197–$205 in 2022 to about $272–$274 in 2023, and the associated recovery amounts increasing from $135/$6 to $161/$20 respectively. This upward trend shows that the mechanisms tied to these instruments are successfully releasing value—by lowering the conversion rates of the preferred stock and thereby reducing the as‑converted share count—thereby enhancing earnings per share and indicating that the recovery process is becoming more effective over time.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, foreign currency contracts positively impacted net operating revenues by $6 million, indicating a minor beneficial effect from currency fluctuations. In contrast, 2023 disclosures highlighted potential negative impacts on net operating revenues from labor-related risks, such as strikes or work stoppages, and consumer-related risks, including shifting preferences and health concerns around sweetened beverages. These represent a shift from direct financial instrument impacts to operational and market-based risks affecting revenues.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, foreign currency contract impacts were explicitly highlighted as a key factor affecting net operating revenues, with the Company using hedges to manage net investments in foreign operations and recognizing gains/losses in OCI. By 2023, the focus shifted to labor and consumer-related risks, as reflected in the \"Risks Related to Consumer Demand\" and \"Risks Related to the Coca-Cola System\" sections, which emphasized evolving consumer preferences, health concerns, and labor unrest as primary threats to revenue stability rather than currency volatility.",

      "question": "How did RTX's strategic focus on the Collins segment evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of divestiture plans and transparency around long-term aerospace contract accounting practices?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX was actively pursuing the divestiture of a portion of the Collins segment, specifically the actuation and flight control business, with a proposed sale to Safran S.A. for $1.8 billion, although the transaction was denied regulatory approval by the Italian government. This signaled a strategic intent to reduce or restructure parts of the Collins segment. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted toward operational transparency and financial reporting detail, particularly around revenue recognition for long-term aerospace contracts within Collins. The 2024 filing elaborates on the use of percentage-of-completion accounting for these contracts, including the use of incurred costs relative to total estimated costs as a progress metric. This shift indicates a strategic pivot from restructuring through divestiture to enhancing financial disclosure and operational clarity around key performance metrics in the Collins segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX’s strategic focus on the Collins segment shifted toward divestiture and transparency in aerospace contract accounting. The company announced a definitive agreement to sell its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within Raytheon for approximately $1.3 billion, reclassifying related goodwill to held‑for‑sale assets, and later recognized a $575 million charge from terminating a fixed‑price development contract, underscoring the financial impact of contract exits. At the same time, RTX enhanced disclosure of long‑term aerospace contracts by reporting $196 billion of remaining performance obligations (RPO) as of December 31 2023, with about 25 % expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months and roughly 45 % tied to long‑term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt & Whitney that can span up to 20 years. This greater visibility reflects a move toward more transparent accounting of extended contract revenue streams.",

      "question": "How did AbbVie's use of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's floating-rate interest obligation management strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AbbVie had interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 (referencing 2021 data as the most recent in the 2022 filing), aimed at converting floating-rate interest obligations to fixed rates. By 2024, these contracts had matured in November 2022 and were not renewed, indicating a discontinuation of this specific strategy for managing floating-rate debt. This reflects a strategic shift away from hedging floating-rate obligations through cash flow hedges during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s use of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges has shifted markedly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022 the company had only a modest cash‑flow hedge position (a single $‑1 million gain/loss in interest expense), but by 2024 it was actively hedging a larger floating‑rate exposure—issuing new fixed‑rate senior notes and swapping floating‑rate debt to fixed‑rate, with notional amounts of $3.5 billion in 2024 and $5.0 billion in 2023, and recording corresponding gains/losses in AOCI that are reclassified into interest expense. This expansion shows that AbbVie is proactively managing its floating‑rate obligations, locking in lower rates and reducing exposure to rising interest rates as it refinances and issues new long‑term debt.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company disclosed that contributions to defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans were among its key cash requirements, though no specific figures were provided for the retiree health plans at that time. By 2024, the company reported a total fair value of $2,580.3 million for Retiree Health Benefit Plans, with significant allocations across public equity securities, fixed income, and private alternative investments. This represents a notable increase in disclosed financial exposure and detail regarding Retiree Health Benefit Plans compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures, the company's financial exposure to retiree health benefit plans has remained relatively stable in terms of asset allocation and funding expectations, but with notable shifts in investment strategy and valuation. As of December 31, 2024, the retiree health benefit plan assets totaled $2,565.8 million, with a significant portion ($1,520.9 million) classified under Level 2 fair value measurements (significant observable inputs), compared to $1,603.5 million in Level 2 assets as of December 31, 2023. The plan's investment strategy emphasizes growth assets (80% of the U.S. and Puerto Rico plan, comprising public equities, hedge funds, private equity-like investments, and real estate) with a smaller fixed-income allocation (20%), reflecting a long-term focus on moderate to high returns. While the company expects to contribute approximately $30 million to defined benefit pension plans in 2025 to meet minimum funding requirements, it does not anticipate material discretionary contributions, indicating a stable but strategically shifting approach to managing retiree health benefit plan liabilities and assets over the 2022–2024 period.",

By 2024, the segment experienced a 33% revenue decline, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion in 2024, attributed to customer inventory normalization. Additionally, while the 2023 report emphasized the segment’s strategic importance and product breadth, the 2024 report noted a shift in focus toward Data Center and Client segments as the primary growth drivers, indicating a relative de-emphasis of the Embedded segment in AMD’s strategic narrative.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, AMD's Embedded segment experienced a significant revenue decline of 33% (from $5.3 billion to $3.6 billion), primarily driven by customers normalizing their inventory levels. This downturn was partially offset by favorable shifts in revenue mix toward higher-margin Data Center and Client segments, which contributed to overall gross margin expansion to 49% in 2024 from 46% in 2023. The segment's strategic positioning appears to be shifting toward AI-focused embedded solutions, as evidenced by AMD's acquisition of ZT Systems to accelerate AI infrastructure capabilities and its emphasis on adaptive computing products like the Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 for embedded systems.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment was the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost, with a favorable adjustment occurring when CAS pension cost exceeded the service cost component. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (rather than expense) and total CAS pension cost, signaling a shift from an expense to income position under FAS. This reflects a notable evolution in the financial impact of pension accounting differences over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's financial reporting shows that the difference between FAS pension income and CAS pension cost—the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment—declined from $1.96 billion in 2022 to $1.66 billion in 2023. This reduction reflects a smaller favorable adjustment, indicating that the excess of CAS pension cost over the service‑cost component of FAS pension income narrowed, although the adjustment remained positive. Consequently, the company characterized the 2023 adjustment as a smaller favorable item in its segment‑level reconciliation.",

In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts. This represents a significant turnaround from a decline in 2023 to an increase in 2024, indicating an evolution in gross margin performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 55 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to lapping elevated markdowns from the prior year and managing prices aligned with competitive historic gaps, partially offset by shifts in product mix toward lower-margin categories. The gross profit rate had decreased by 155 basis points in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, driven by inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that obligations for unknown future titles under content agreements were not determinable as of the reporting date and did not provide any forward-looking estimate. However, by 2024, Netflix explicitly stated that while it does not include estimated obligations beyond the known minimum amount, these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant.' This marks a shift from a neutral disclosure to a forward-looking qualitative warning about the potential magnitude of future liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s disclosure of obligations for unknown future titles under content acquisition and licensing agreements has evolved in both magnitude and framing. In the 2022 filing, the company reported $19.2 billion of such obligations, with $12.2 billion “not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets” because the titles were still unknown. By 2023, total obligations rose to $21.7 billion, of which $14.6 billion remained unrecorded, and the breakdown of the expected payment schedule became more detailed, showing specific amounts for “Less than one year,” “Due after one year and through three years,” etc. The 2024 filing shows $23.2 billion of obligations, with $17.0 billion still unrecorded, and refines the timing table to “Less than one year,” “Due after one year and through three years,” “Due after three years and through five years,” and “Due after five years.” The language also clarifies that obligations for acquisition and licensing of content include commitments for unknown future titles—such as traditional film output deals and TV series where the number of seasons is not yet determinable—emphasizing that only the known minimum amounts are accrued while the unknown portions are expected to be significant. This progression reflects increasing transparency about the scale and timing of future content liabilities.",

      "question": "What does the shift in AWS asset-related financial impacts from 2022 to 2024 indicate about Amazon's evolving approach to capital expenditure management in its cloud business?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS was not significantly impacted by asset-related charges, as impairments and severance costs primarily affected the North America segment, with AWS assets described as consisting mainly of property and equipment and accounts receivable. By 2024, AWS became the primary beneficiary of a strategic change in the useful life assumptions for server and networking equipment, resulting in a $3.2 billion reduction in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.5 billion benefit to net income. This indicates a shift toward optimizing capital efficiency in AWS infrastructure, moving from passive asset ownership to active lifecycle management to enhance financial performance in cloud operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in AWS asset-related financial impacts from 2022 to 2024 indicates that Amazon is increasingly optimizing capital expenditure management in its cloud business by extending useful lives for certain heavy equipment (from 10 to 13 years) and reducing the useful life of servers and networking gear (from 6 to 5 years), while also accelerating depreciation on early-retired assets. This strategic adjustment, which includes recording $920 million in accelerated depreciation in Q4 2024 and expects $0.6 billion to $0.9 billion in annual operating income impacts starting in 2025, reflects a deliberate effort to align asset accounting with the rapid pace of technological advancement in AI and machine learning, ultimately improving long-term capital efficiency and profitability in AWS.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Visa provided detailed quantitative breakdowns of Total Nominal Volume, including specific dollar amounts for consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial categories across U.S. and international segments, along with percentage changes year-over-year (e.g., Total Nominal Volume was $12,530 billion in 2022, up 11% from $11,334 billion in 2021). In 2023, while Visa continued to define Total Nominal Volume, it did not disclose updated dollar figures or comparative data. Instead, the focus shifted to qualitative disclosures, such as the relationship between service revenue and prior-quarter nominal payments volume, and explanations of data sources and potential updates. This represents a shift from quantitative transparency to methodological explanation without updated volume figures.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Visa’s disclosure of Total Nominal Volume (TNV) became more consistent in its reporting methodology, continuing to present nominal payments volume and cash volume separately before summing them to total nominal volume. In the 2022 filing (page 39), TNV was defined as the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume, with clear attribution to financial institution clients subject to review. This structure and definitional clarity remained unchanged in the 2023 filing (page 42), where TNV was similarly calculated and reported using the same methodology, maintaining transparency in how volume data drove revenue recognition. No significant change in reporting approach occurred—only updated figures reflected growth, with TNV increasing from $6.654B (2022) to $6.991B (2023), a 5% rise, consistent with the disclosed growth rates in payments volume.",

      "question": "How has the company's anticipated cash requirements related to purchases of goods and services evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what factors contributed to this change?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company anticipated that its cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services would be consistent with past levels relative to revenues. By 2024, the company disclosed that it had entered into agreements that could require payments of up to $14 billion if specified amounts of goods or services, primarily related to incretin medicines, are not purchased over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years. This indicates a significant shift from a stable outlook to a much larger financial commitment tied to supply agreements, driven by expansion in manufacturing capacity and contract manufacturing arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s anticipated cash requirements related to purchases of goods and services have remained broadly consistent with historical levels relative to revenue, but the nature of those requirements has shifted markedly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, cash outflows were driven primarily by pandemic‑related supply needs and the transition tax from the 2017 Tax Act, while by 2024 the company expects to allocate substantially more capital to new manufacturing capacity (e.g., a $1 billion facility in North Carolina and a €400 million plant in Ireland) and to fund large‑scale acquisitions and IPR&D payments, which together increase the scale and timing of ordinary‑course purchases of materials and contract services. Consequently, although the overall proportion of cash devoted to these purchases has stayed roughly in line with past patterns, the absolute dollar amount and the strategic focus on expanding production and pipeline assets have evolved significantly.",

This suggests Apple streamlined its short-term financing to focus exclusively on instruments with maturities of 90 days or less, such as the $3,960 million in net proceeds reported in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities > 90 days increased sharply from a net repayment of $2.6 billion in 2023 to essentially zero net proceeds in 2024, while total commercial‑paper outstanding rose from $6.0 billion to $10.0 billion. This shift indicates that Apple is relying more on longer‑dated commercial paper for short‑term financing, but the reduced net proceeds suggest tighter reliance on that channel and a possible move toward other sources (e.g., term debt or cash reserves) to fund dividends and share repurchases.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 98 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily driven by managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This improvement occurred despite operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increasing by 9 basis points due to higher variable pay.",

      "question": "How has RTX's Raytheon segment evolved in terms of its financial disclosures and contract revenue recognition practices between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that it was evaluating the impact of new segment reporting standards (ASU 2023-07), which required expanded segment disclosures including segment expenses and interim reporting of segment profit or loss and assets. Additionally, RTX announced the planned sale of its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within the Raytheon segment for approximately $1.3 billion, with related assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. By 2024, RTX provided detailed revenue recognition practices for its Raytheon segment, emphasizing that substantially all defense business revenue is recognized over time using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This reflects a shift from preparatory disclosures about upcoming standards to concrete implementation of those standards and more transparent reporting of performance obligations and contract accounting practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX’s Raytheon segment refined its revenue recognition practices by continuing to allocate transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices and to include variable consideration only when it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The segment, which primarily serves government customers, recognizes revenue over time for its defense contracts using a percentage‑of‑completion method driven by costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs. In 2024, Raytheon also began recognizing revenue on previously suspended contracts with a Middle East customer after obtaining regulatory approvals, and it recorded a $575 million charge related to the termination of a fixed‑price development contract, reflecting adjustments to contract assets and liabilities. These updates illustrate a continued emphasis on cost‑based progress measurement and careful assessment of contract modifications and variable consideration in the Raytheon segment’s financial disclosures.",

      "question": "How did Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in DCAI evolve between 2023 and 2024 to reverse the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics into a growth trend?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing hyperscaler purchasing power, internal semiconductor development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware in cloud services, which made it harder to differentiate products and led to order volatility. These factors eroded Intel's competitive position and adversely affected DCAI results. However, in 2024, Intel reversed this trend by focusing on high core count server products that increased average selling prices (ASPs), despite lower volume. This strategic shift in product mix, aimed at optimizing for performance and customization needs of cloud service providers, contributed to a 1% increase in DCAI revenue year-over-year. The internal foundry operating model also took effect in 2024, aiming to improve cost efficiency and product competitiveness, which likely supported this strategic pivot.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel reversed the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics in DCAI by shifting its product strategy toward AI‑optimized hardware and software—launching new Xeon 6 processors with E‑cores and P‑cores, expanding its Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, and emphasizing system‑level differentiation (e.g., AMX, SGX, crypto acceleration) that aligns with cloud‑provider requirements. This strategic focus, coupled with tighter integration of hardware and software and a restructured internal foundry model, drove a modest 1 % revenue increase in DCAI in 2024 and positioned the segment for growth as hyperscaler demand rebounds.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NFLX reported total content obligations of $23,161,360, with $10,019,306 due in the next 12 months and $13,142,054 beyond that period. By 2024, while no direct numerical update was provided, the company disclosed qualitative changes in how it accounts for content obligations, including more nuanced treatment of non-cancelable commitments, licensing of future titles, and obligations tied to creative talent agreements. This indicates a shift from purely quantitative disclosure to a more strategic and forward-looking explanation of content liabilities, suggesting increased complexity in content acquisition and production planning.",
      "llm_answer": "NFLX's content obligations increased from $21.7 billion at the end of 2023 to $23.2 billion at the end of 2024, reflecting higher upfront cash payments for licensed and produced titles and a larger share of obligations recorded on the balance sheet. This rise shows the company is accelerating its content acquisition and production strategy—spending more upfront to secure a broader library and original programming, while relying on longer‑term amortization to match the timing of viewership and cash outflows.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Amazon highlighted the general uncertainty in tax accruals due to the complexity of tax laws, audits, and controversies across jurisdictions, but did not specify any particular high-profile dispute. By 2024, the company disclosed a specific ongoing tax dispute with the Indian tax authority over cloud services fees, where the authority asserts that such fees are subject to tax in India. Amazon is contesting this, but an adverse outcome could result in additional payments for both current and prior periods. This evolution shows a shift from a more general risk disclosure to a concrete example of a material tax controversy affecting accrual adequacy.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon’s tax accrual disclosures have become more detailed and forward‑looking from 2022 to 2024. In the 2022 filing (pages 18‑22) the company notes “significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense, assets, and liabilities” and highlights uncertainty around “changes in laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax,” as well as specific controversies such as the Indian tax authority’s claim on cloud‑service fees. By 2024 (pages 14‑18, 20‑21) the language expands to stress that “a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals,” and that “proliferation of these or similar unilateral tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform is implemented,” while also citing concrete disputes (e.g., the Indian cloud‑services tax) and the need to assess “the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.” Thus, the evolution shows a shift from a general acknowledgment of judgment to a more explicit focus on emerging global tax reforms and specific contested tax liabilities that could materially affect future tax expense.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities was $5.1 billion, and it was influenced by higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, the passage of time, and lower discount rates. In 2024, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities was $3.8 billion, reflecting higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. This indicates that while Skyrizi sales continued to positively influence the fair value change in 2024, the impact of higher discount rates began to constrain the overall increase compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The estimated sales of Skyrizi drove a significant increase in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities between 2023 and 2024, as noted in the 2024 Form 10-K (page 46), where the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. This increase contributed to the $3.8 billion charge to other expense, net in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, patient assistance program costs were a key component of sales rebate and discount accruals, with a 5% change in the consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability impacting revenue by approximately $615 million. By 2024, these costs remained a significant part of the accruals, but the company emphasized a more structured expected value approach to estimate these liabilities. This evolution suggests an increased focus on precision in financial exposure management related to patient assistance programs.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s patient assistance program costs are treated as part of its sales‑rebate and discount accruals, which are estimated using an expected‑value approach that incorporates historical take‑up rates, program uptake trends, and adjustments for patent‑expiration‑driven inventory levels. In 2024 the methodology remained consistent with 2023, but the company now reports that adjustments to these accruals have been less than 1 % of consolidated revenue, indicating that its financial exposure to patient‑assistance‑related revenue reductions is relatively small and stable.",

In 2024, this increased to $109.6 billion, representing a slight growth in dollar terms, while the Products Gross Margin percentage rose to 37.2%. The increase in gross margin was attributed to cost savings, although this was partially offset by a different product mix and weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This indicates a moderate upward shift in the efficiency or pricing power of Apple's product portfolio over the two years.",

This improvement was attributed to cost‑saving initiatives, although it was partially offset by a shift in product mix and the adverse effect of weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Additionally, Services gross margin and its percentage also rose, driven mainly by higher Services net sales and a more favorable Services mix.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Net Earnings Common Stockholders were reported at $3,262 million. By 2023, this figure surged to $13,219 million, representing a significant increase of 309%. However, the document also indicates a projected decline of 85% from 2023 to 2024, suggesting a volatile financial performance around this metric.",
      "llm_answer": "The Net Earnings Common Stockholders for Emerson (EMR) declined sharply from $13,219 million in 2023 to $1,618 million in 2024—a decrease of $11,601 million, or about an 85 percent drop. This large decline was driven primarily by purchase accounting impacts from the National Instruments acquisition and higher restructuring charges, as well as a loss on the sale of the Copeland note receivable.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024 reflects Intel's evolving competitive positioning and product strategy in the data center market. While DCAI revenue grew only 1% year-over-year in 2024 (driven by higher server revenue from high-core-count products and improved ASPs), this modest growth occurred amid intensified competition from AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM-based solutions, as well as the broader industry shift toward GPUs for AI workloads. Intel responded by accelerating its heterogeneous compute strategy, launching the Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerators with enhanced memory bandwidth and flexibility, and advancing its Jaguar Shores GPU accelerator as a first generally programmable AI accelerator. This product strategy leverages Intel's integrated hardware-software approach—featuring AI-specific accelerators like AMX in Xeon processors and software-optimized workloads—to differentiate its offerings and regain market share in a rapidly changing data center landscape.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed that cost pass-through contributed positively to sales growth, accounting for a 2% change in sales variance. By 2023, the company emphasized that its long-term contracts provided not only cash flow stability but also the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, indicating a strategic reinforcement of this mechanism. This shows that cost pass-through evolved from being a minor contributing factor to a more integral and positively framed component of Linde’s contractual and pricing strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's cost pass-through strategy evolved from 2022 to 2023 by shifting from a drag on sales to a neutral-to-positive contributor to operating profit. In 2022, cost pass-through (energy cost variances billed to onsite customers) reduced sales by 3% with minimal profit impact, but in 2023 it remained a minor sales drag while the company leveraged higher pricing (6% price attainment) and productivity initiatives to drive a 49% reported operating profit increase and 15% adjusted operating profit growth, offsetting volume and inflation pressures. This strategic shift allowed Linde to maintain profitability despite lower volumes and currency headwinds, as evidenced by the 24.4% reported operating margin (up from 16.1% in 2022) and 27.6% adjusted operating margin.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, vendor allowances—primarily volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances—were described as reducing the carrying cost of inventory and were recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory was sold. These allowances were accrued as earned, particularly those tied to purchase levels, over the incentive period. By 2023, the focus shifted to the net presentation of inventory cost, which included acquisition costs, freight, and import costs, but was stated to be net of certain vendor allowances. This indicates a more direct impact on inventory valuation in 2023, where vendor allowances were factored into the gross inventory value before applying the lower of cost or market (LCM) or net realizable value (NRV) tests. The change reflects a more integrated treatment of vendor allowances in inventory valuation in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, the treatment and impact of vendor allowances on inventory valuation remained consistent between 2022 and 2023. Vendor allowances (including volume rebates and co-op advertising) are accrued as earned and reduce the carrying cost of inventory when received, with those allowances recognized in cost of sales upon the sale of the related inventory. The documents confirm that such allowances \"reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold\" (page 55), and there is no indication of a change in this policy between fiscal 2022 and 2023. The impact on inventory valuation was consistent, as the allowances directly lowered inventory costs during the periods they were earned, without altering the underlying accounting method.",

By 2024, Taltz generated $2,152.3 million in U.S. revenue and $1,108.1 million from outside the U.S., totaling $3,260.4 million, which represents an 18% increase compared to 2023. This indicates sustained growth in both regions, with continued volume gains offsetting pricing pressures.",
      "llm_answer": "Taltz revenue grew 18 % in 2024, reaching $3.26 billion (up from $2.76 billion in 2023), with U.S. sales rising 18 % and international sales up 19 %. The increase was driven by higher realized prices from rebate and discount adjustments and stronger demand, while volume gains also contributed.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEE disclosed that the non-qualifying hedge category could have a significant impact on NEER's results due to the lack of economic offset in the financial statements, as the related physical asset positions were not marked to market under GAAP. By 2024, the description remained consistent, emphasizing that the unrealized mark-to-market impact of non-qualifying hedges continued to cause earnings volatility, with the same mechanism of economic offset through unmarked physical assets. While the qualitative description remained stable, the continued emphasis on 'could be significant' in both years indicates that the financial impact of the non-qualifying hedge category remained material and volatile, with no explicit quantitative change provided.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the non‑qualifying hedge category’s impact on earnings volatility has become more pronounced for NEE, especially within NextEra Energy Resources. The economic offset mechanism—where gains or losses in the non‑qualifying hedge category are counterbalanced by opposite movements in the fair value of related physical asset positions that are not marked‑to‑market under GAAP—has been highlighted as a key driver of this increased volatility. Consequently, management now excludes the unrealized mark‑to‑market effect of these non‑qualifying hedges when assessing current‑period performance, reflecting the growing significance of this offset in shaping earnings volatility.",

However, while the 2023 disclosure framed this as a new charge impacting the 2024 tax rate compared to 2023, the 2024 disclosure reflects that this charge had fully materialized and remained a key factor in maintaining a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. Thus, the nature of the charge itself did not change, but its impact transitioned from being prospective in 2023 to realized in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The effective tax rate for 2024 was 24.1%, which was higher than the 14.7% rate recorded in 2023. This increase was primarily due to a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion related to the State Aid Decision, as disclosed in the provision for income taxes.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss, with actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits being recognized in connection with annual remeasurement and amortization. By 2023, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these plans were specifically recorded as part of the 'other non-operating income (expense), net' account on the consolidated statements of earnings, indicating a more explicit financial statement recognition of these costs.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023 the non‑service components of FAS expense for retiree medical and life‑insurance plans were recorded in the “other non‑operating income (expense), net” line of the consolidated statements of earnings, whereas in 2022 they were presented as part of the same non‑service FAS income (expense) account. This shift reflects the company’s classification of those items as non‑operating rather than operating, moving the related gains and losses from the operating to the non‑operating section of the income statement.",

      "original_answer": "Walmart's operating income rate as a percentage of net sales decreased by 120 basis points in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and reorganization in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, the operating income rate increased by 83 basis points in fiscal 2024, driven by lapping those prior-year charges and improvements in business performance. This represents a significant turnaround in the company's operating income trajectory.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 4.2% in fiscal 2024 to 4.4% in fiscal 2025. This improvement was driven by higher operating income ($29,348 million in 2025 vs. $27,012 million in 2024), which resulted from margin expansion due to managing prices to align with competitive historic gaps, growth in higher-margin businesses globally, and lapping prior-year markdowns and restructuring costs. The increase was partially offset by higher variable pay, marketing expenses, and depreciation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron's disclosures around Properties, Plant and Equipment were primarily limited to listing the note reference in the financial statements without detailed discussion of impairment triggers or sensitivity. By 2024, the company significantly expanded its disclosure, providing a detailed explanation of the impairment assessment process, including specific triggering events such as downward revisions in reserves, changes in commodity price outlook, and regulatory shifts related to environmental laws. The 2024 filing also elaborated on the complexity of sensitivity analyses due to the large number of assumptions involved, such as carbon costs, production profiles, and the pace of the energy transition—factors not explicitly highlighted in 2022. This represents a transformation in the depth and specificity of impairment-related disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Chevron’s approach to impairments of Properties, Plant and Equipment remained anchored in the same core methodology but evolved in its sensitivity and contextual framing. In the 2022 filing (pages 30‑34), impairments were discussed primarily as a function of reserve declines and commodity‑price outlooks, with a quantitative illustration that a 5 % reduction in proved reserves would have raised depreciation‑depletion‑amortization by roughly $700 million. By 2024 (pages 56‑60), the discussion expanded to include a broader set of triggers—significant reserve revisions, downward price outlooks, regulatory or environmental‑law changes, and potential sales—while emphasizing that impairment calculations rely on “highly uncertain” assumptions such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, and the pace of the energy transition. The 2024 text also notes that sensitivity analyses of impairment outcomes are “not practicable” due to the wide range of assumptions, underscoring greater uncertainty and a more nuanced, scenario‑driven assessment than in the earlier filing. Consequently, while the underlying accounting principle (recoverability test versus fair‑value comparison) stayed consistent, the 2024 disclosure reflects a more expansive set of variables and a clearer acknowledgment of the limitations in predicting impairment impacts.",

      "question": "How did the composition and magnitude of adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in relation to tax-related adjustments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax-related adjustment impacting EBIT-adjusted consisted of a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation. In 2023, the adjustment also included a tax benefit, but this time related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a geographic and contextual change in the nature of tax-related adjustments affecting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax event in 2022 to a Korea-focused tax event in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the EBIT-adjusted metric declined from $14.5 billion to $12.4 billion, reflecting a lower ROIC-adjusted return (20.0 % to 16.4 %). The primary driver of this shift was a reduction in tax‑related adjustments—specifically, the 2023 filing shows a smaller tax benefit from releasing valuation allowances (the $504 million tax effect in 2023 versus $870 million in 2022) and fewer one‑time items such as the Cruise restructuring charge that had been present in 2022. Consequently, while the magnitude of tax‑related adjustments decreased, the overall EBIT‑adjusted figure still fell, indicating that other operational factors (e.g., lower automotive margins and higher interest expense) outweighed the tax‑benefit reduction.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT highlighted liquidity risks tied to capital markets volatility and the potential inability to raise capital, which could hinder funding for future growth and expansion initiatives. By 2023, these risks were compounded by a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the India reporting unit, signaling a material decline in the unit's fair value and directly negatively impacting the company's ability to pursue growth initiatives. This evolution reflects a worsening financial outlook for expansion efforts due to both external market pressures and internal asset devaluations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMT's financial outlook for growth and expansion faced heightened liquidity risks due to rising interest rates, inflation, and debt service obligations, which constrained its ability to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. While the company continued pursuing strategic initiatives like the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction, it recorded a $322 million goodwill impairment in India (2023) amid declining cash flow expectations, underscoring the adverse impact of economic pressures on asset valuations and expansion plans.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and significance of variable rebates and incentives evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of their impact on net revenue and the level of management judgment required?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, variable rebates and incentives were described as being tied to customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds and were recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when volume- and transaction-based revenues were recognized. By 2024, these variable rebates and incentives had grown in importance, representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue. Additionally, the 2024 filing highlights that the estimation of variable rebates involves significant management judgment based on forecasted transactions, card issuance, and conversion volumes, leading to increased auditor scrutiny and classification as a critical audit matter. This indicates a transformation in both the scale and complexity of how variable rebates and incentives are managed and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, variable rebates and incentives remained a significant contra‑revenue component, with their estimation increasingly relying on complex management judgments about customer performance metrics (volume, transaction thresholds, forecasted activity, historical experience). The 2024 audit highlighted that assessing these estimates required a high degree of auditor judgment and extensive procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s forecasts and the underlying factors used. Consequently, the level of management judgment and audit effort needed to account for variable rebates and incentives grew, directly affecting the reliability of net revenue figures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple reported net repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days amounting to $2,645 million, whereas in 2024, the company no longer disclosed any activity in this category, indicating a strategic shift away from issuing longer-term commercial paper. This suggests Apple streamlined its short-term financing approach by focusing solely on instruments with maturities of 90 days or less, where it reported $3,960 million in net proceeds in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days were essentially flat year‑over‑year, moving from a net outflow of $2.6 billion in 2023 to a net outflow of only $0.6 billion in 2024 (the 2024 table shows “Proceeds from commercial paper” = $0 million and “Repayments of commercial paper” = $(2.6 billion), yielding a net cash outflow of roughly $2.6 billion, which is far smaller than the $2.6 billion net repayment recorded in 2023). This modest change indicates that Apple is maintaining a conservative short‑term financing posture, relying more on longer‑dated debt and internal cash generation rather than aggressive commercial‑paper issuance.",

This indicates that IBM maintained a consistent audit timeline, completing the audit of the financial statement schedule just before the end of February in both years, with only a one-day shift in the exact date of the report. The consistency in timing suggests stable and predictable audit processes across these two reporting years.",
      "llm_answer": "The auditor's report on the financial statement schedule shifted from a February 26, 2024 date in the 2023 filing to a February 25, 2025 date in the 2024 filing, reflecting a one‑year advance in the audit issuance timeline. This change likely indicates that IBM’s external audit was completed earlier in the 2024 reporting cycle, possibly due to timing adjustments in the audit process or a strategic decision to meet filing deadlines.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders were driven by the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from Cruise tax reconsolidation. In 2023, the adjustment stemmed from a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This geographic shift—from an internal restructuring event in the U.S. (Cruise) to a regional tax realization in Korea—suggests GM strengthened its international tax position, particularly in Asia, while stabilizing its domestic tax asset base.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the geographic sources of tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders shifted markedly toward Asia, particularly Korea, as evidenced by the $870 million tax benefit recorded in 2023 from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Korea (page 50). In contrast, the 2022 adjustments were dominated by North‑American items such as the Buick dealer strategy, Cruise restructuring and the voluntary separation program, with only a modest $106 million tax impact from GM Korea wage litigation. This transition reveals that GM is increasingly leveraging tax recoveries in its Asian operations—especially Korea—to offset earnings volatility, while its U.S. and other international tax positions have become comparatively less material to overall tax‑adjusted earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that ROU lease assets were being measured at fair value due to impairment charges that occurred in 2020, with impairment losses calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data. By 2024, PayPal's ROU lease assets had increased significantly to $599 million for operating leases and $73 million for finance leases as of December 31, 2024, up from $390 million for operating leases in 2023 (no finance leases reported then). This indicates a notable expansion in PayPal's leasing activities, particularly in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term commitments and potentially more capital-intensive operations.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Right-of-Use (ROU) lease assets increased from $390 million at the end of 2023 to $599 million at the end of 2024, reflecting new operating lease additions (e.g., $343 million of new ROU assets obtained in 2024) and the ongoing recognition of existing lease liabilities, while the related lease‑liability grew from $560 million to $764 million over the same period. This growth indicates that PayPal is expanding its leased facilities and equipment footprint—particularly in office, data‑center and computer‑equipment spaces—while maintaining a strategy of financing many of these assets through operating leases rather than purchases.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company considered historical rebate payments, patient assistance program costs by product as a percentage of historical sales, and evaluated current contracts, sales trends, and product pricing when estimating rebate accruals. By 2024, while historical rebate payments remained a key input, the estimation methodology evolved to include an 'expected value approach' for accruals, and the company expanded its consideration to include government rebate budget forecasts in large European countries, reflecting a more nuanced and diversified evaluation process.",
      "llm_answer": "The role of historical rebate payments in estimating sales rebate accruals has shifted from being primarily driven by historical payment patterns to incorporating more forward-looking, judgment‑based assessments of current contracts and program dynamics. In 2024, the estimation process now weighs recent trends—such as patent expiries, changes in managed‑care and Medicaid utilization, and updated wholesale inventory levels—more heavily than in 2023, while still referencing historical rebate payments to gauge the likelihood and magnitude of future rebate obligations. This evolution reflects a greater reliance on updated contract terms and market conditions to refine the accrual estimates.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DCAI revenue decreased by 20% due to lower server volume resulting from a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. In contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1%, driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs but lowered volume compared to 2023. This shift indicates a stabilization and slight recovery in DCAI's performance, supported by a strategic focus on higher-value offerings despite ongoing volume challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "The DCAI revenue trajectory reversed sharply between 2023 and 2024: it fell 20% year‑over‑year in 2023 (as noted on page 7) and then modestly rose about 1% in 2024 (page 13). The 2023 decline was driven by softening CPU demand in data‑center environments, while the 2024 rebound was powered by higher server revenue from high‑core‑count products and improved ASPs. In 2024 the segment also benefited from the company’s new internal foundry operating model and targeted investments in AI‑accelerator products such as Gaudi 3 and the upcoming Jaguar Shores GPU.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 97 basis points, primarily due to higher sales. In fiscal 2024, the same metric increased by 46 basis points, driven by lower fuel sales and elevated technology spend. This represents a shift from cost efficiency linked to sales growth in 2023 to cost pressures from operational investments in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined slightly from 18.5% in fiscal 2023 to 18.6% in fiscal 2024, and then to 22.6% in fiscal 2025 for the U.S. segment (and fell to 18.5% in the International segment). The key drivers of this change were higher inventory purchases and increased share‑repurchase activity that lifted operating costs, while revenue growth outpaced expense growth, leading to a modest rise in the expense ratio in 2025.",

      "original_answer": "The 309% increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders from $3,231 million in 2022 to $13,219 million in 2023 was primarily driven by a significant non-recurring gain or adjustment not reflected in earnings from continuing operations. While earnings from continuing operations increased modestly by 21% (from $1,886 million to $2,286 million), the net earnings figure spiked due to an additional $9,988 million gain or adjustment, as evidenced by the large discrepancy between earnings from continuing operations and net earnings in 2023. This suggests a one-time event or accounting adjustment specific to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The 309% increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders from 2022 to 2023 was driven by a $10 billion pretax gain from the sale of a majority stake in the Climate Technologies business and a $2.8 billion pretax gain from the divestiture of InSinkErator, which were recognized in fiscal 2023. This contrasts sharply with earnings from continuing operations, which declined 29% to $1,618 million in 2024 (down from $2,286 million in 2023), reflecting the impact of acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, and the loss on the sale of the Copeland note receivable.",

In 2023, the increase was attributed to cost savings, partially offset by a different product mix and foreign currency weakness. In 2024, the margin expansion continued despite ongoing mix challenges and currency headwinds, suggesting that cost-saving measures had a sustained impact and potentially more effective mitigation of negative factors.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Home Depot's Treasury Stock Balance at the end of the year was $ (757) million as of the 2022 10-K filing, showing a decrease due to repurchases of $ (45) million during the year. By fiscal 2023, the Treasury Stock Balance had significantly increased to $ (95,372) million, with the company repurchasing $ (8,074) million of its common stock during the year. This indicates a major shift in the company's stock repurchase strategy, moving from a relatively modest buyback in fiscal 2022 to a much more aggressive repurchase program in fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Home Depot's Treasury Stock Balance increased significantly from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, rising from $(87,298) million to $(95,372) million—a $8.074 billion increase—driven by $7.951 billion in share repurchases during fiscal 2023 alone. This substantial repurchase activity, part of a $20 billion authorization approved in May 2021, indicates an aggressive stock buyback strategy aimed at returning capital to shareholders and potentially boosting earnings per share. The company resumed repurchases after suspending them during the pandemic, reflecting confidence in its financial position and commitment to reducing outstanding shares.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for pension and postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a $428 million decrease primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and projected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a significant shift from a short-term net benefit expectation to a long-term near-complete reduction in costs, driven by changes in benefit structure and amortization patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 Disney’s postretirement medical benefit obligation declined from $961 million to $968 million (a modest increase in the projected benefit obligation), and the amortization of prior‑year medical‑benefit credits fell sharply—from $28 million of amortization expense in 2022 to a $36 million credit in 2023—driving the net periodic benefit cost to a $128 million credit in 2023 versus $29 million expense in 2022.  This reduction reflects lower amortization of previously deferred losses, partially offset by higher interest costs, resulting in an expected net benefit of $81 million in fiscal 2023.",

      "original_answer": "The growth rate of Rental Car Days booked through BKNG decreased from 53.5% in 2020 to 2021 to 30.7% in 2021 to 2022, indicating a slowdown in the recovery of the rental car segment. This suggests that while the business was still growing, the pace of recovery after the pandemic was moderating.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of rental‑car days booked through Booking.com accelerated markedly: it rose 30.7 % year‑over‑year in 2022 versus a 53.5 % increase in 2021, indicating that the segment’s recovery was gaining momentum but at a slower pace than the prior year. This suggests the rental‑car recovery is moving from a rapid rebound in 2021 to a more moderate, yet still positive, expansion in 2022.",

By 2023, there was no further impact from the Dermstore sale, as no gain was reported either pretax or on a per-share basis. This indicates that the financial effects of the Dermstore sale were fully recognized in 2022 and did not carry over into 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, CCG revenue decreased by 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year. In 2024, CCG revenue increased by 4% driven primarily by higher notebook volume compared to 2023, although this was partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to weaker demand and a decline in other CCG revenue from the exit of legacy businesses. The turnaround from a decline in 2023 to growth in 2024 indicates a recovery in notebook demand and strategic adjustments in the product portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "The CCG revenue declined modestly from $32.1 billion in 2023 to $31.5 billion in 2024, a roughly 2% drop. The primary drivers were lower notebook volume and weaker desktop ASPs, partially offset by higher desktop ASPs in the commercial and gaming segments and a modest uptick in second‑half notebook shipments as inventory normalized. These factors were compounded by broader macro‑economic pressures and the exit of legacy businesses, which together pressured CCG revenue despite the stabilization seen in the overall PC market.",

In 2024, the company's total repayment of matured debt increased to $3,373 million, with specific repayments including $1,500 million in April 2024 and $630 million in December 2024. This indicates a significant increase in the volume of debt repayments in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's total repayment of matured debt increased from $4,030 million in fiscal 2023 to $3,373 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a shift in its debt‑maturity profile toward more near‑term repayments and a continued reliance on rolling short‑term borrowings and revolving credit facilities to manage liquidity. This evolution indicates that the company is proactively refinancing longer‑dated obligations while maintaining a sizable pipeline of debt maturing over the next several years.",

However, this decrease occurred alongside a dramatic reduction in the amount of short-term borrowings, which dropped from $1,599 million in 2022 to just $1 million in 2023. Therefore, while the interest rate itself declined significantly, the company's overall exposure to short-term borrowing costs was drastically reduced in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The interest rate for weighted-average short-term borrowings fell from 2.8% at the end of 2022 to 0.4% at the end of 2023, reflecting a significant decline in the cost of the company's short-term financing. This shift indicates that Emerson Electric has benefited from lower market interest rates, improving its short-term borrowing position and reducing interest expense on revolving credit and commercial paper.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple's effective tax rate was influenced by a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, which contributed to a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. In 2024, this same one-time tax charge of $10.2 billion continued to negatively impact the effective tax rate, which remained higher than the statutory rate due to this charge, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation. The magnitude of the tax charge remained unchanged, but its ongoing effect indicates a sustained financial impact from the State Aid Decision.",
      "llm_answer": "The one‑time income‑tax charge tied to the State Aid Decision added roughly $10.2 billion to Apple’s 2024 provision for income taxes, pushing the effective tax rate up from 14.7 % in 2023 to 24.1 % in 2024. Consequently, the impact of that charge elevated Apple’s overall effective tax rate between 2023 and 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde leveraged its long-term contracts to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, contributing to cash flow stability. By 2023, the company explicitly quantified the impact of cost pass-through in its financial reporting, showing a negative 6% variance in sales growth due to this factor. This indicates that while cost pass-through remained a contractual mechanism, it had a dampening effect on reported sales growth in 2023 compared to the more neutral or supportive role implied in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde’s use of cost‑pass‑through mechanisms continued to expand between 2022 and 2023, especially in the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments where higher pricing and cost‑pass‑through adjustments lifted sales by 3‑6 % and improved segment operating profit by 14‑23 %. This contributed to a 15 % rise in total segment operating profit (to $9.07 bn) and helped offset inflationary pressures, driving overall operating profit up 15 % and boosting adjusted operating margin from 21.3 % to 23.3 %. Consequently, the enhanced pass‑through translated into stronger earnings growth and higher adjusted EPS, underpinning the company’s improved financial performance in 2023.",

By 2023, the financial disclosures indicate a shift: while the Asia Theme Parks were still included in the consolidated borrowing figures, the presentation separates borrowings 'Before Asia Theme Parks Consolidation' and shows specific Asia Theme Parks borrowings as distinct. For example, total borrowings including the Asia Theme Parks amounted to $45,101 million in 2023, compared to $43,809 million before including them, indicating a $1,292 million contribution from the Asia Theme Parks. This structured separation suggests a more transparent or modified reporting approach compared to 2022, where the Asia Theme Parks were fully consolidated without such a detailed breakout.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Disney’s financial relationship with the Asia Theme Parks evolved through both consolidation and borrowing disclosures. The company consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong and Shanghai) into its financial statements, as evidenced by their inclusion in total borrowings ($1,292 million in 2024) and the related debt‑issuance details on pages 100‑102. Concurrently, Disney disclosed new borrowings tied to these parks—specifically, a HK$0.5 billion loan for Hong Kong Disneyland (maturing September 2025) and an ¥8.6 billion loan for Shanghai Disney Resort (maturing 2036) – reflecting an expanded capital structure to fund park investments. These borrowing activities are reported under “Asia Theme Parks borrowings” in the consolidated balance sheets and maturities schedule, illustrating both the growth of Disney’s debt exposure and the integration of the parks into its overall financing profile.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, PayPal disclosed that TPV growth was directly impacted by the number of payment transactions enabled on its platform, and that transaction revenues were typically correlated with TPV growth. By 2024, PayPal reported TPV increasing from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, a 10% increase. This TPV growth trajectory indicates a positive trend in transaction revenue potential, as TPV is a key driver of transaction fees from merchants. The sustained increase in TPV across the filings suggests that PayPal's platform usage and merchant transaction volume were expanding, which would directly support revenue growth in line with the correlation described in the 2022 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal’s TPV grew from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024 (a 10% increase), and transaction revenue rose $2.0 billion, or 7%, over the same period. However, revenue growth lagged TPV growth because the mix shifted toward lower‑priced, high‑volume offerings (notably Braintree), indicating that transaction revenue is unlikely to accelerate at the same pace as TPV and may face downward pressure in 2025.",

This shift reveals a change in consumer behavior where shoppers were spending less per visit, potentially due to economic pressures or changes in purchasing habits. Target responded with strategies such as offering 'attractive everyday price points on key items' and 'compelling promotions' to drive traffic, suggesting a shift toward value-oriented pricing to counteract declining transaction sizes.",
      "llm_answer": "The comparable sales decline of 3.7% in 2023 was driven by a 1.4% decrease in average transaction amount, indicating Target's pricing strategy and consumer response shifted toward lower ticket sizes amid economic pressures. This contrasts with 2022's 12.3% traffic-driven comparable sales growth, revealing a significant change in consumer behavior where shoppers reduced both spending per visit and purchase frequency, likely due to inflationary pressures and reduced discretionary spending.",

By fiscal 2024, the dollar value of Membership and Other Income reached $1,408 million, compared to $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a short-term dip but sustained growth trajectory driven by membership base expansion and Plus penetration.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron attributed effective tax rate volatility primarily to 'mix effects' influenced by the absolute level of earnings or losses and their geographic distribution across tax jurisdictions. The company emphasized that a decline or increase in the effective tax rate might not indicate future results. By 2024, the explanation remained centered on 'mix effects' but placed additional emphasis on the impact of earnings volatility without reiterating the geographic component as explicitly. Instead, the 2024 disclosure focused more broadly on the non-indicative nature of tax rate changes and linked the discussion to broader financial reporting in Note 17 Taxes, signaling a subtle shift in framing from geographic mix to general earnings volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s explanation of the drivers behind its effective‑tax‑rate volatility has shifted from a focus on “mix effects” and “tax‑rate changes in high‑ or low‑tax jurisdictions” in 2022 to a more forward‑looking emphasis on “planned capital spend for lower‑carbon investments, evolving climate‑related regulations, and the uncertainty surrounding new global minimum‑tax (Pillar Two) rules” in 2024. The 2024 discussion also adds explicit references to the impact of sanctions, geopolitical risks, and the timing of tax‑related legislative changes, whereas the 2022 text only mentioned “external factors beyond our control” and generic “tax‑rate volatility.” This evolution reflects a broader context of heightened regulatory and geopolitical uncertainty and a strategic pivot toward sustainability‑related spending.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans contributed a $11 million decrease to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), and in 2024, the impact increased to a $25 million decrease. This indicates a growing negative impact of pension obligations on the company's comprehensive income over time.",
      "llm_answer": "The accumulated other comprehensive loss related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans shifted from a $20 million deficit at the end of 2020 to a $21 million surplus by the end of 2021, reflecting a $43 million increase that was partially offset by reclassifications. This net gain indicates that the company's pension obligations generated a modest positive impact on other comprehensive income during that period, reducing the overall accumulated loss. Over the longer span from 2022 to 2024, the balance swung to a $6 million deficit by the end of 2024, showing a continued but smaller negative position, suggesting that pension‑related gains and losses have been relatively stable yet slightly negative in recent years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple highlighted increasing investigatory expenses due to evolving data protection laws and potential noncompliance penalties, noting that these costs were substantial and could include significant fines or legal liability. By 2024, the company continued to face similar risks but emphasized a more pronounced focus on the complexity of complying with inconsistent international regulations, suggesting that the regulatory environment had become more challenging. This evolution indicates that Apple's exposure to investigatory expenses has increased due to the growing number and severity of global data protection requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s exposure to investigatory expenses tied to data‑protection and privacy compliance has risen sharply from 2023 to 2024, as reflected by a series of heightened regulatory actions and legal risks outlined across the disclosed pages.  In 2023 the company noted that “changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products” and “expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations” could materially affect its business, but it did not yet quantify any specific cost impact.  By 2024, the filing details multiple, concrete sources of such exposure: investigations and litigation concerning the EU’s Digital Markets Act and antitrust scrutiny of the App Store, heightened scrutiny of privacy‑related policies, and the need to comply with a growing patchwork of global data‑protection laws (e.g., GDPR, emerging state privacy statutes).  The 2024 text explicitly warns that “noncompliance could result in significant penalties or legal liability” and that “the Company is subject to an increasing number of federal, state and international laws relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of various types of personal information,” indicating that the regulatory environment is becoming more stringent and costly to navigate.  Consequently, the evolution signals that Apple now faces not only reputational risk but also tangible financial exposure—through potential fines, remediation expenses, and increased legal spend—driven by a more aggressive global privacy and antitrust enforcement landscape.",

      "question": "How did Linde's estimated revenue from minimum purchase requirements evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what notable exclusions or contextual factors were highlighted in each year's disclosure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde estimated that the consideration related to minimum purchase requirements was approximately $57 billion. In 2023, the company revised this estimate downward to $48 billion, and this amount specifically excluded Russian projects impacted by sanctions. Both years excluded sales above minimum purchase requirements, which can be significant depending on customer needs. However, the 2023 disclosure added the context of plant sales from the Linde Engineering business being primarily contracted on a fixed price basis, which was not mentioned in the 2022 disclosure.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 the estimated revenue tied to minimum‑purchase requirements fell from roughly **$57 billion** (as disclosed in the 2022 “Remaining Performance Obligations” section) to **about $48 billion** (the 2023 estimate of future consideration for minimum purchase requirements and plant sales, excluding Russian projects).  \n\nThe 2022 disclosure highlighted that roughly **half of that revenue would be earned in the next five years**, with the remainder thereafter, and noted that actual amounts would vary due to contract timing, price escalations, currency effects and pass‑through costs. The 2023 filing similarly warned that the final amounts would differ because of numerous external factors, but it gave a lower aggregate estimate ($48 billion vs. $57 billion) and omitted the explicit “half in the next five years” phrasing, focusing instead on the overall $48 billion figure and the same suite of influencing factors.",

This indicates a meaningful shift in the company's cost management, as adjusted operating expenses rose more slowly than adjusted net revenue—growing from $15,251 million in 2022 to $16,574 million in 2024, while adjusted net revenue increased from $34,250 million to $39,139 million over the same period. This trend suggests improved operational efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenue generation.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One's operating efficiency ratio improved from 44.33% in 2022 to 42.35% in 2024 (a 198 basis point decline), indicating enhanced cost management relative to revenue growth. This improvement occurred despite the company's stated expectation of near-term pressure on the ratio due to rising technology talent costs, suggesting effective expense control offsetting revenue headwinds during this period.",

By 2024, total worldwide sales of Humira had declined to $8.993 billion, representing a decrease of 36.9% at constant currency rates compared to 2022. This significant drop in sales follows the expiration of Humira's key patents, which began in 2016 in the U.S. and 2018 in the EU, leading to increased competition from biosimilars and eroding its market exclusivity.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Humira’s net revenues declined sharply—down 37% in 2024 (with a 41% drop in the U.S. and a 13% decline internationally) – reflecting the loss of patent exclusivity and the entry of biosimilar competition after its key patents expired. This steep downturn underscores a weakening market position for Humira, forcing AbbVie to rely increasingly on newer products such as Skyrizi, Rinvoq and Venclexta to offset the revenue loss.",

Thus, the language evolved from a concrete warning about possible earnings impacts in 2022 to a more general statement in 2023 that future transactions “could result in” such charges, without specifying magnitude.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's operating expenses rate increased by 23 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to opioid-related legal settlement charges and restructuring costs in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the operating expenses rate decreased by 60 basis points, driven by the absence of those prior-year charges, particularly the $3.3 billion opioid-related settlements and $0.8 billion restructuring expenses. This represents a significant turnaround in the trend of operating expenses relative to net sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased slightly from 20.4% in fiscal 2024 to 20.7% in fiscal 2025. This rise was primarily driven by higher variable pay due to exceeding planned performance, increased marketing spend, and higher depreciation expenses, partially offset by lapping prior-year charges related to opioid legal settlements and restructuring costs.",

This indicates that the capital impact evolved from an initial delayed implementation in 2022 to a more advanced phase-in stage by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 the CECL transition rule moved from a full‑year “day‑1” impact that was delayed until 2022 and then phased in at 25 % per year to a fully phased‑in schedule by 2025.  In 2022‑2023 the company added back the delayed CECL impact and applied a 25 % scaling factor each year; by the end of 2024 it had phased in 75 % of that amount, and the remaining 25 % will be phased in during 2025.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel had an unrecognized commitment to fund $29.0 billion for Arizona Fab LLC's construction costs and retained full operational control with the right to purchase 100% of the factory output, while also being subject to penalties for underperformance. By 2024, Intel entered into a Purchase and Contribution Agreement and an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement with Arizona Fab LLC, suggesting a formalization and potential shift in the financial and governance structure of the relationship, although full operational control remained. The specific funding commitment from 2023 was not reiterated in 2024, indicating a possible transition from a funding phase to an operational phase.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Intel’s financial commitment to Arizona Fab LLC deepened through a $29 billion unrecognized funding obligation for the joint venture’s construction costs and a 49 % ownership stake that gives Intel operational control and the right to purchase 100 % of the fab’s output. In 2024 the partnership expanded with new agreements—including a June 2024 purchase and sale agreement involving Intel Ireland Limited and APGrange Holdings—that further formalize Intel’s role in financing and governing the Arizona fab, while the joint venture’s assets grew to $4.8 billion in property, plant and equipment, reflecting ongoing construction investments.",

      "question": "How has Intel's strategic approach to its NAND memory business evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about its broader capital allocation priorities?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel referenced the divestiture of its NAND memory business as part of its capital allocation strategy, indicating a shift toward investing in its IDM 2.0 strategy and away from non-core businesses. By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as an active segment, and instead, Intel emphasized its focus on new business areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and external foundry services through IFS. This evolution indicates a continued strategic realignment toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing capabilities, while exiting businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's strategic approach to its NAND memory business shifted decisively between 2022 and 2023, marked by the full exit from the NAND market after completing the sale of its NAND memory business to SK Hynix in 2020 (referenced in 2022 10-K as \"in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NAND memory business to SK hynix\"). This move eliminated Intel's direct NAND manufacturing and sales operations, allowing the company to fully redirect its capital and R&D investments toward its core IDM 2.0 strategy, which prioritizes foundry services (IFS), advanced process technologies (e.g., Intel 20A, Ribbon FET), and high-growth areas like AI accelerators and discrete GPUs. Consequently, Intel's broader capital allocation priorities have pivoted almost entirely toward scaling its foundry business and R&D for next-generation manufacturing and packaging technologies, as evidenced by its $16 billion R&D spend in 2023 and targeted investments in new fabrication facilities (e.g., Arizona expansion via Brookfield partnership), while abandoning non-core ventures like NAND and 5G modems that previously consumed significant resources. This strategic exit underscores a clear prioritization of high-margin, high-growth semiconductor opportunities over commoditized memory markets, aligning capital toward areas deemed critical for future competitiveness and supply chain resilience.",

      "question": "How has Capital One's treatment of revolving loans in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of loan conversion and delinquency trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One converted $223 million of revolving loans to term loans in the domestic credit card portfolio. By 2024, the company reported a total domestic credit card loan portfolio of $155.618 billion, with $7.053 billion in total delinquent loans. This indicates a shift from proactive loan conversion strategies in 2022 to a focus on delinquency management in 2024, suggesting evolving credit risk dynamics in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s domestic credit‑card portfolio shows a modest rise in 90‑day delinquent balances that continue to accrue interest—$3.577 billion in 2024 versus $3.367 billion in 2023—while non‑performing balances remain essentially unchanged at $0.  The 2024 allowance data indicate a continued decline in net charge‑offs and a lower provision for credit losses, reflecting improved credit performance and a reduced reserve for revolving‑to‑term conversions.  Overall, delinquency rates have stayed flat, but the allowance trend points to a more favorable outlook for the portfolio.",

In 2023, the segment saw high single-digit organic sales growth, which was notably stronger than the company's overall organic sales growth of 4%. This suggests that the Grooming segment outperformed the company average in terms of growth during fiscal 2023, showing an upward trend in its relative importance or market traction.",
      "llm_answer": "The Grooming segment’s net sales grew 4% in 2023 versus 2022, driven by an 8% price increase (mainly in Latin America and Europe) and a modest 1% rise in unit volume, partially offset by a 5% adverse foreign‑exchange impact. This growth outpaced the company’s overall organic sales trend, which rose only low‑single digits, indicating that Grooming performed relatively better than the broader, slower‑growing organic sales pattern.",

This indicates a significant increase in U.S.-based demand for Compute & Networking segment products, which is attributed to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand. The shift suggests a growing adoption of NVIDIA's compute and networking solutions within the domestic market, potentially driven by data center expansion and enterprise AI initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "The geographic revenue concentration for NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment shifted markedly toward the United States, rising from 44% of total revenue in FY2023 to 47% in FY2024, while revenue from Singapore, Taiwan, and China declined as a share of total revenue. This trend indicates that demand in U.S. markets is accelerating, particularly for data center and AI computing platforms, and suggests a growing reliance on domestic U.S. customer base for the segment's growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MMM's Personal Safety segment reported sales of $3.916 billion, reflecting a decline compared to the prior year and indicating reduced demand, particularly in contrast to the strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand in 2021. By 2023, the Personal Safety segment's sales further decreased to $3.487 billion, representing a continued downward trend. This indicates a sustained reduction in the segment's contribution to MMM's overall revenue, suggesting a potential strategic shift or reduced emphasis on this business line.",
      "llm_answer": "The Personal Safety segment's net sales declined from $3,916 million in 2022 to $3,487 million in 2023, reflecting a drop in organic sales and the absence of pandemic‑driven demand that had buoyed the prior year. This reduction signals that 3M is repositioning away from the high‑growth safety products of the early 2020s and is focusing on broader industrial and specialty markets to sustain profitability.",

In contrast, CCG revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 to $54.2 billion due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in the second half of the year. The decline in 2023 was also influenced by a higher mix of small core and older generation products, which lowered ASPs, despite some offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial and gaming segments.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue declined 8% from 2022 to 2023, falling to $31.9 billion (from $34.8 billion in 2022), driven by lower notebook and desktop volumes amid reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by higher desktop ASPs from increased commercial and gaming sales. This decline occurred within a broader 14% drop in total company revenue ($54.2B in 2023 vs. $79.0B in 2022), with CCG's performance reflecting the challenging macroeconomic environment and inventory adjustments in the PC market.",

      "original_answer": "The fair value of non-agency RMBS decreased from $996 million in 2022 to $690 million in 2024. This indicates a significant reduction in the company's exposure to non-agency RMBS over this period. In 2022, the fair value was $996 million with $205 million in gross unrealized gains and no gross unrealized losses. By 2024, the fair value had declined to $690 million, with $89 million in gross unrealized gains and $5 million in gross unrealized losses. The decline in fair value, coupled with the emergence of unrealized losses, suggests a strategic reduction and potential de-risking from this segment of the portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2022 and 2024 data, the fair value of non‑agency RMBS held in the available‑for‑sale portfolio was $14 million in 2024 versus $1 million in 2022. This modest increase reflects a slight rise in the fair value of the non‑agency RMBS component, but the amount remains very small relative to the overall portfolio. Consequently, the company’s exposure to non‑agency RMBS is minimal and essentially unchanged over the two‑year period.",

The 2022 document explicitly notes that the Analytical Instruments segment was significantly impacted by the negative effects of the global pandemic in 2020, with some lingering effects in 2021. The 2023 data shows a modest rebound in the segment’s total assets after adjusting for currency translation and acquisitions, indicating stabilization and gradual recovery.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel still owned and operated its NAND memory business, which was generating losses of $4,306 million in net revenue and contributing a negative $1,369 million to operating income. By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing. This strategic exit removed the financial drag of the NAND segment from Intel's operations, allowing the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy and reduce restructuring and operational costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel’s NAND memory business was wound down in 2020–2021, with the first closing of its sale to SK hynix completed on December 29 2021 and the second closing still pending; the company fully de‑consolidated the NAND OpCo Business in Q1 2022 and excluded its results from non‑GAAP measures thereafter.  Consequently, the NAND business no longer contributed to Intel’s revenue or operating performance, and the divestiture generated a $1.37 billion gain (recorded as a reduction of operating income) that was removed in non‑GAAP calculations.  This exit eliminated a low‑margin, capital‑intensive segment, allowing Intel to focus on its IDM 2.0 strategy and foundry expansion, which required substantial capital investment and carried execution risk.  The reduced exposure to NAND memory helped stabilize Intel’s overall financial results, but the company still faces significant risks related to its large‑scale manufacturing investments and the timing of new process technologies.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Reported OCI increased by $409 million (4.1%), primarily driven by higher pricing of $1,688 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,158 million. In 2024, Reported OCI increased by $151 million (1.4%), mainly due to higher pricing that included higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration, and research costs by $56 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,648 million. The magnitude of the OCI increase was significantly higher in 2022 compared to 2024, indicating a decline in the growth rate of OCI over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Reported Operating Company Income (OCI) for the smokeable products segment increased modestly: $10,394 million in 2022 rose to $10,821 million in 2024, driven primarily by higher pricing (including multiple list‑price increases and higher promotional investments) that offset lower shipment volumes, higher per‑unit settlement and manufacturing costs, and exit‑related expenses. Shipment volume fell 7.5 % from 2021 to 2022 and a further 10.2 % from 2023 to 2024, with premium cigarettes comprising about 95.9 % of 2024 volume. Pricing actions in 2024 included list‑price hikes of $0.15–$0.22 per pack for cigarettes and $0.13–$0.16 per five‑pack for cigars, while oral‑tobacco OCI declined due to lower reported margins despite higher net revenues.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, there were no customers representing 10% or more of total revenue for NVDA. However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue and was specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also tied to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting a more pronounced dependency on major customers for this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compute & Networking segment has shifted from being heavily reliant on a few large customers to a more diversified, market‑concentrated position with reduced customer dependency. In fiscal 2023 the segment’s revenue was dominated by a small number of high‑volume customers, but by fiscal 2024 the company reports that demand remains concentrated yet the underlying market concentration has increased, reflecting broader adoption across multiple industries and a wider customer base. This evolution reduces the segment’s exposure to any single customer while maintaining a strong, concentrated presence in the data‑center and AI‑accelerated computing markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed that it self-insures costs associated with employee disability programs and bases accruals on actuarially estimated costs of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. By 2023, the company continued to self-insure these benefits but provided more detailed insight into the actuarial estimation process, noting that the estimates incorporated judgment around claim severity, frequency, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. This indicates a more nuanced and detailed approach to estimating liabilities related to employee disability benefits in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the company’s self‑insurance accruals remained largely unchanged in amount ($5.6 bn in 2024 versus $5.1 bn in 2023), but the underlying estimation method continued to rely on actuarial projections of incurred‑but‑not‑reported claims that incorporate assumptions about claim severity, frequency, healthcare inflation, seasonality and plan design; these actuarial estimates are periodically reviewed and can be adjusted, for example a 5 % change in assumed claim severity would shift reserves by roughly $280 million. The 2023 disclosures also highlighted that the company periodically evaluates the adequacy of its self‑insurance reserves and that changes in accident frequency, severity, insurance retention levels or other factors can materially affect the accruals. Thus, while the balance of the accrual did not shift dramatically, the evolution in treatment is reflected in the continued use of actuarial models and the explicit acknowledgment of the sensitivity of those estimates to claim‑severity assumptions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $631 million, increased by $201 million, and ended the year at $658 million. In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, decreased by $122 million, and concluded at $577 million. This indicates a shift from an increasing trend in inventory risk provisions in 2023 to a reduction in 2024, suggesting improved inventory risk management or a strategic adjustment in provisioning.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses increased from $631 million at the end of 2023 to $658 million at the end of 2024, reflecting a $201 million addition offset by $183 million in write‑offs and a $9 million foreign‑currency adjustment. This rise indicates that IBM is maintaining a larger reserve for potential inventory obsolescence or excess, suggesting heightened vigilance in managing inventory risk despite stable underlying inventory levels.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Adjusted OCI increased by $313 million (3.1%), primarily driven by higher pricing, despite lower shipment volume and increased costs. By 2024, Adjusted OCI increased by $212 million (2.0%), again supported by higher pricing and, notably, lower marketing, administration, and research costs ($86 million). However, both years experienced headwinds from declining shipment volumes—$1,931 million in 2022 and $2,528 million in 2024. The company's ability to maintain Adjusted OCI growth, despite worsening shipment declines, indicates improved cost management and sustained pricing power.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Adjusted OCI grew modestly—from $10,424 million in 2022 to $10,922 million in 2024—driven primarily by higher pricing and promotional investments that offset declining shipment volumes. This increase in Adjusted OCI margins (rising from 57.6 % in 2022 to 61.6 % in 2024) indicates that, despite fewer units shipped, the company has been able to sustain profitability by extracting higher revenue per unit and controlling costs, suggesting a resilient pricing power even as overall volumes contract.",

      "question": "How did FedEx's approach to self-insurance for property and cargo loss evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of actuarial estimation methods and risk exposure management?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed that it self-insured for property and cargo loss, with accruals based on actuarially estimated costs of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. The company also indicated that it periodically evaluates insurance coverage levels and adjusts them based on risk tolerance and premium expense. By 2023, FedEx provided more detailed insight into its self-insurance reserves, emphasizing that its estimates for property and cargo loss incorporated actuarial assumptions about claim severity, frequency, volume, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The 2023 filing also highlighted sensitivity to changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, and insurance retention levels, indicating a more refined and dynamic risk exposure management approach compared to the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, FedEx’s self‑insurance program for property and cargo loss remained largely unchanged in structure, but the company continued to refine its actuarial estimation methods and risk‑exposure management.  The 2023 disclosures note that reserves for self‑insurance are “primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred as of the balance‑sheet date,” with the actuary‑derived assumptions (severity, frequency, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan design) being periodically updated; a 5% shift in assumed claim severity would alter reserves by roughly $280 million.  Moreover, FedEx’s fleet‑modernization and retirement decisions—such as the 2023 permanent retirement of MD‑11 and additional Boeing 757/MD‑11F aircraft—were driven by the need to align capacity with projected volumes and to improve fuel‑efficiency, which indirectly reduces exposure to cargo‑loss risk while requiring careful impairment testing and actuarial reassessment of related asset lives.  Thus, while the core self‑insurance accrual methodology stayed consistent, the evolution of fleet composition and the more granular actuarial inputs introduced a modest increase in reserve volatility and refined the company’s approach to managing property‑and‑cargo loss risk.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, General Motors reported indefinitely reinvested basis differences in non-consolidated China joint ventures of $3.4 billion. By 2024, this amount decreased to $1.4 billion. This significant reduction indicates a shift in GM's reinvestment strategy, suggesting that a portion of these previously indefinitely reinvested earnings may no longer be considered permanently reinvested, potentially signaling a strategic move to repatriate or reallocate capital from these ventures.",
      "llm_answer": "The basis differences in GM’s investments in non‑consolidated China joint ventures fell sharply from $3.4 billion at the end of 2023 to $1.4 billion at the end of 2024. This decline reflects the fresh‑start accounting that eliminated a large portion of the prior‑year basis differences, indicating that GM is no longer deferring tax on those investments and is effectively reinvesting the remaining basis differences rather than holding them for future tax benefits.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx explicitly stated that healthcare inflation was one of the key judgmental factors in estimating self-insurance reserves, indicating its importance in liability projections. In 2023, while the company continued to include healthcare inflation as part of its estimation methodology, it added language emphasizing that it believes its recorded obligations are 'consistently measured and appropriate,' suggesting a more confident stance in its risk assessment. This evolution indicates a shift from a cautious acknowledgment of uncertainty in 2022 to a more assured posture in 2023 regarding the impact of healthcare inflation on self-insurance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, FedEx’s approach to healthcare inflation in its self‑insurance accruals shifted from a modest, indirect reference in the 2022 discussion to a more explicit acknowledgment of its impact in 2023. In the 2022 MD&A, the only mention of healthcare inflation appears in a brief sensitivity note stating that a 5 % change in claim severity would affect reserves by about $230 million, without detailing the driver. By 2023, the narrative expands to explain that reserves are “primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims incurred… including judgment about… healthcare inflation,” and the same 5 % sensitivity analysis is reiterated, indicating that the company now treats healthcare cost trends as a core assumption in its accrual calculations. This evolution suggests a more deliberate and risk‑aware assessment of healthcare‑related claim exposure, reflecting a refined judgment that fluctuations in medical cost inflation are a material driver of reserve volatility and must be monitored closely.",

      "question": "How has the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations evolved from 2023 to 2024, based on the company's disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums outside the United States could negatively impact its financial results. In 2023, the company noted that premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the respective countries. In 2024, IBM repeated the same language, indicating that the risk remained consistent and no material change occurred in the exposure or the underlying factors affecting the premiums. Therefore, the potential financial impact of these premiums remained stable between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures, the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations is expected to increase due to rising premiums driven by higher insolvency levels among unrelated companies in certain countries. While IBM's 2023 Annual Report notes that premium increases could be significant and may negatively affect financial results, the 2024 filing (specifically in the \"Financing and Capital Markets Activities\" section on page 11) confirms that such premiums remain a risk factor, with no indication of stabilization or reduction. Thus, the financial impact has evolved from a potential future risk in 2023 to an ongoing, potentially material cost in 2024, though the exact magnitude remains subject to market conditions and insolvency trends.",

The increase in the percentage was primarily due to changes in product mix, including decreases in Veklury product sales globally, which were offset by increased sales in HIV and oncology products, along with shifts in payer mix. Specifically, rebates and chargebacks rose from $12.6 billion (30% of gross sales) in 2022 to $14.3 billion (33% of gross sales) in 2023, contributing to the overall increase in deductions.",
      "llm_answer": "The gross‑to‑net deduction rate rose from **35 % of gross product sales in 2022 to 38 % in 2023** – an increase of roughly three percentage points. This jump was driven mainly by a shift in product mix (declines in Veklury sales were offset by higher‑margin HIV and oncology sales) and by changes in payer mix that expanded the proportion of rebates and chargebacks relative to total sales.",

By 2024, PBNA's related charges had decreased to $8 million, suggesting a reduction in major acquisition or divestiture actions involving this segment. This decline shows a notable shift in strategic focus or level of engagement with PBNA over the two-year period.",

This reduction reflects a strategic shift away from major PBNA‑focused acquisitions or disposals, signaling that PepsiCo is now concentrating on consolidating its existing PBNA operations rather than pursuing new large‑scale deals in that segment.",

      "question": "How did RTX's financial relationship with Pratt & Whitney evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of asset valuation and credit risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX held a direct stake in Pratt & Whitney valued at $1,563 million as of December 31, 2021, with no significant credit loss allowance directly tied to the segment. By 2024, the relationship had shifted from a direct stake to a dependency relationship, with a notable increase in credit risk exposure as evidenced by the $491 million allowance for expected credit losses, driven by a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney in the fourth quarter of 2024. This marks a significant transformation from a stable asset holding to a risk-influenced dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, RTX's financial relationship with Pratt & Whitney evolved through strategic divestitures and asset reclassifications that directly impacted goodwill valuation and credit risk exposure. RTX recorded a $676 million reduction in goodwill related to Collins Aerospace (including Pratt & Whitney's reporting unit) due to divestitures, while Pratt & Whitney's standalone goodwill remained stable at $1.563 billion. Concurrently, contract liabilities at Pratt & Whitney increased $1.4 billion in 2024 due to billings exceeding sales on certain contracts, and the company recorded a $491 million allowance for expected credit losses on contract assets—primarily driven by a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney in Q4 2024—signaling heightened credit risk exposure. These adjustments reflect a shift from growth-driven valuation to active portfolio optimization, with credit risk concentrated in aerospace contract receivables."
