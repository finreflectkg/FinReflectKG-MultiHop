      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil excluded items with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter from its Earnings (Loss) excluding Identified Items metric. By 2024, the company introduced a slight modification by stating that the threshold is 'typically' $250 million, suggesting a more flexible approach. This change indicates that the company may be allowing for more judgment in determining which items are excluded, potentially affecting the consistency and comparability of its non-GAAP earnings metric over time.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's threshold for identifying items excluded from earnings remained at $250 million in 2024, consistent with the 2022 threshold. This suggests that the company has maintained a stable approach to earnings transparency, continuing to exclude only individually significant non-operational events that meet the same financial threshold. This consistency allows for improved comparability of business results over time and reflects management's disciplined focus on isolating meaningful non-operational impacts for investors.",

      "question": "How did the treatment and presentation of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its reconciliation with other financial metrics?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company provided a detailed definition of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, explaining how it is calculated from net income by excluding gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate-related impairment charges, and real estate-related depreciation, amortization, and accretion, while also adjusting for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company moved toward a more quantitative presentation, showing that Nareit FFO increased from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, a 14% increase. Additionally, the 2024 filing included Nareit FFO within a broader comparative table that tracked changes across three years (2022–2024), indicating a shift toward emphasizing trend analysis and performance metrics over definitional explanations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment and presentation of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders evolved by removing the separate presentation of Consolidated AFFO. This change was made to better align the reporting with management's approach to capital allocation and performance assessment. The reconciliation of Nareit FFO to AFFO now directly adjusts for items like straight-line accounting, stock-based compensation, and capital expenditures, without an intermediate Consolidated AFFO line. This adjustment simplifies the reconciliation process and provides a clearer view of the company's operating performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth was 1.0%, while in 2024, this impact increased to 1.5%. This indicates that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations grew in 2024 compared to the previous year, contributing more positively to sales growth despite a decline in core sales during that period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a 1.0% negative effect in 2023 to a 0.5% negative effect in 2024. This indicates that while the company continued to face headwinds from a stronger U.S. dollar, the magnitude of the impact slightly decreased in 2024. This suggests that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations remained significant but somewhat moderated in 2024 compared to the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GE's Corporate operating profit was negatively impacted by a $12.5 billion decrease in gains on purchases and sales of business interests, primarily due to the absence of a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of the BioPharma business in 2020. By 2023, this metric improved significantly, with Corporate operating profit increasing by $6.7 billion, of which $5.7 billion was attributed to higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, particularly from AerCap and GE HealthCare investments, although partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year gains on the Baker Hughes investment. This represents a transformation in both the magnitude and composition of these gains, indicating a strategic shift in asset management and investment realization.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, GE reported a loss of $56 million on purchases and sales of business interests, a significant decline from the $12.45 billion gain in 2021, which was largely driven by the sale of the BioPharma business. In 2023, the loss further decreased to $9 million, indicating a reduction in the magnitude of losses. The primary source of these losses in 2023 was the $9 million loss on purchases and sales of business interests, with no major gains reported compared to the prior year. This evolution reflects a shift from significant gains in 2021 to smaller losses in 2022 and 2023, likely due to fewer large-scale business divestitures or acquisitions.",

In fiscal year 2024, Xbox Content and Services Revenue again increased by 50%, with the same 44 percentage points of net impact coming from the Activision Blizzard acquisition.

      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, Xbox Content and Services Revenue grew by 50%, driven largely by the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Specifically, the acquisition contributed 44 percentage points of net growth to this increase, as it transitioned Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party under Microsoft's Gaming segment.

By 2024, NFLX had implemented more structured hedging strategies, including cash flow hedges for foreign currency-denominated revenue, which resulted in a $124 million gain included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year. This indicates a shift from passive exposure to active management of foreign exchange risk, reducing volatility in reported revenues.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Tower evaluated tenant-related intangible assets for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or cancellation of relationships, with recoverability assessed through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, the company continued this tenant-level impairment review but expanded the criteria to include the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations as a key impairment indicator. Additionally, in 2023, the company introduced a more detailed framework for measuring impairment, incorporating available market information relative to asset fair value alongside projected discounted future cash flows, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This represents a refinement in methodology and a more structured approach to impairment assessment.",

In 2022, tenant-related intangible assets were reviewed for indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or relationship terminations, with recoverability assessed through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, the evaluation remained similar, but the Company recognized a goodwill impairment in its India reporting unit due to a triggering event linked to strategic alternatives, which highlighted the impact of tenant-related cash flow uncertainties, particularly in India. The projected cash flow assumptions incorporated tenant credit risk, renewal terms, attrition rates, and the potential impact of regulatory changes, such as those in India affecting AGR fees.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed nonmarketable investments totaling $5 million, grouped under the 'Other measurement basis' category alongside equity-method investments, with no change in value from the prior year. By 2024, while the specific dollar amount for nonmarketable investments was not quantitatively disclosed, the company expanded its qualitative disclosure, describing these investments as including interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities, and clarified that they are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more detailed discussion of counterparty risk concentration, which indirectly impacts the risk exposure of these nonmarketable investments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the valuation methodology and disclosure for TXN's nonmarketable investments remained consistent in terms of measurement basis, with nonmarketable investments still measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. However, the total value of nonmarketable investments slightly decreased from $5 million in 2023 to $4 million in 2024. There was no significant change in the risk exposure related to these investments, as they are primarily in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities, and the company continues to recognize gains and losses in OI&E.",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, Visa's treatment and disclosure of Lease Consolidation Costs remained consistent in terms of their classification as non-recurring expenses excluded from non-GAAP financial measures. In 2023, Lease Consolidation Costs were not explicitly mentioned, but in 2024, Visa specifically recorded a charge of $57 million within general and administrative expenses related to the consolidation of leased office spaces, which was excluded from non-GAAP results. This consistency indicates that Visa continues to follow a financial reporting approach that emphasizes core operational performance by excluding non-recurring or non-operational items like lease consolidation costs from key performance metrics.",

In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by better price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. This reflects a significant turnaround in the company's gross margin performance over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased from 24.3% in fiscal 2022 to 24.4% in fiscal 2024. The key drivers behind the change included price management in the Walmart U.S. segment due to cost inflation and merchandise mix, as well as growth in higher-margin businesses globally. Additionally, the 2024 increase was partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories, while the 2022 increase was partially offset by higher supply chain costs.",

This reflects a shift from primarily recognizing IPRD value in the year of acquisition to actively monitoring and adjusting it based on evolving expectations of future cash flows, regulatory timelines, and market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, BMY's treatment and valuation of IPRD evolved in terms of impairment recognition and fair value estimation assumptions. In 2022, BMY recognized $101 million in impairment charges related to long-lived assets, including IPRD, with impairments primarily driven by changes in market conditions, regulatory delays, and unmet development expectations. By 2024, impairment charges had significantly increased to $2.9 billion, reflecting a more aggressive reassessment of IPRD and other intangible assets due to factors such as competitive pressures, adverse clinical results, and delayed regulatory approvals. The assumptions used in fair value estimation remained centered on discounted cash flow models, incorporating revenue forecasts, probability of success, and discount rates, but with a heightened sensitivity to evolving market and clinical uncertainties.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the AMESA segment contributed $3 million to PepsiCo's total acquisition and divestiture-related charges, while in 2024, this contribution increased to $5 million. This represents a $2 million increase in AMESA's financial involvement in such activities over the two-year period. The change indicates a relatively modest increase in the segment's role in acquisition and divestiture-related expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial contribution from the AMESA segment to PepsiCo's total acquisition and divestiture-related charges decreased between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, AMESA contributed $3 million, in 2023 it contributed $2 million, and in 2024, it contributed $5 million. However, when considering the total acquisition and divestiture-related charges, AMESA's contribution remained relatively small and fluctuated slightly over the three years.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and specifically noted that interest revenue from financing arrangements was recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle continued to include unbilled receivables in accounts receivable and maintained similar revenue recognition timing under ASC 606. However, the 2024 disclosure reclassified interest revenue from financing contracts to 'non-operating expenses, net'—a more specific categorization than in 2022. This indicates a refinement in financial reporting terminology and structure, though the core treatment of unbilled receivables remained consistent.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's treatment and disclosure of unbilled receivables between fiscal years 2022 and 2024 remained consistent in that unbilled receivables are included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. However, there was a notable evolution in the expected timing of revenue recognition from remaining performance obligations. In 2022, Oracle expected to recognize 57% of its remaining performance obligations ($46.6 billion) within the next twelve months, while by 2024, this percentage had decreased to 39% of $97.9 billion, indicating a shift toward longer-term revenue recognition. This change reflects a greater proportion of revenue being deferred for longer periods, likely due to an increase in multi-year contracts or changes in customer contract structures.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 10-K, AIG reported cumulative paid losses of $1,557 million for accident year 2021 as of December 31, 2021. In the 2023 10-K, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident year increased to $1,640 million as of December 31, 2022. This $83 million increase indicates that AIG's initial estimate of paid losses for accident year 2021 was lower than the actual paid losses observed a year later, suggesting that the company may have initially underestimated the severity of claims for that year.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 10-K, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident year 2021 were reported as $488 million. By the 2023 10-K, this amount had decreased to $194 million. This significant reduction suggests that AIG revised its estimates for the accident year 2021, likely due to more accurate loss emergence or improved reserving methodologies.

      "original_answer": "The Home Depot's NOPAT was $18,294 million in fiscal 2022 and decreased to $16,424 million in fiscal 2024, indicating a decline in operational profitability over this period. This represents a reduction of $1,870 million, or about 10.2%, suggesting a meaningful downward trend in the company's after-tax operating profits.",
      "llm_answer": "The Home Depot's Net Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) decreased from $18,294 million in fiscal 2022 to $16,484 million in fiscal 2023 and further declined to $16,424 million in fiscal 2024. This trend indicates a slight decline in the company's operational profitability, despite maintaining a strong gross profit margin. The slight decrease in NOPAT reflects higher operating expenses and interest costs, as well as a negative comparable sales environment, suggesting some pressure on operational efficiency and top-line growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil presented Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) without specifying its classification relative to GAAP standards. However, in 2024, the company explicitly labeled ROCE as a Non-GAAP measure in its disclosures. Additionally, the formatting of the term changed, with 'ExxonMobil' being inconsistently rendered in the 2024 document as 'Ex x onMobil' in certain sections, indicating a change in how the metric is internally standardized and presented.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's presentation of Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) in its disclosures evolved from 2022 to 2024 primarily through the inclusion of the \"Non-GAAP\" designation and more detailed explanations of its components. In the 2022 filing, ROCE was described without explicitly labeling it as a non-GAAP measure, while the 2024 filing clearly identifies ROCE as a \"Non-GAAP\" performance measure and provides a more structured breakdown of financing costs and earnings excluding financing costs. Additionally, the 2024 filing integrates ROCE within a broader context of updated earnings drivers and structural cost savings, reflecting a more transparent and investor-focused approach to financial reporting.",

This indicated a clear policy with a specific reference to how the interest was calculated. In 2023, while SPG maintained the same general policy of capitalizing interest during construction, the level of detail was reduced, as the company no longer explicitly referenced the use of interest rates in effect during the construction period when determining the amount to capitalize. This suggests a subtle shift toward less granular disclosure, even though the core capitalization policy remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, SPG maintained consistent policy treatment of interest capitalized during construction, stating that interest is capitalized on projects during construction periods based on applicable interest rates until the projects are ready for their intended use. However, the 2023 disclosure provided slightly more detail by explicitly mentioning the inclusion of interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction within capitalized costs, while the 2022 disclosure grouped these costs more generally.

By 2024, this estimate increased slightly to $58 billion, but the time horizon for earning half of this amount was extended from five to six years. This indicates a slight shift in the expected timing of revenue recognition, potentially due to changes in contract duration or new contract signings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, currency exchange rates positively contributed 1.0% to total sales growth, whereas in 2024, the positive impact decreased to 0.5%. This indicates a reduced influence of foreign exchange fluctuations on sales growth, suggesting either more stable exchange rates or a shift in the company's geographic revenue mix or hedging strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a 1.0% negative effect in 2023 to a 0.5% negative effect in 2024. This reduction in the magnitude of the negative impact suggests that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations slightly decreased in 2024, likely due to a more stable or less pronounced strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other major currencies. However, the continued negative impact indicates that the company remains vulnerable to currency movements, particularly as a significant portion of its sales are generated outside the U.S.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil explicitly stated that it did not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment, emphasizing that long-term prices must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. By 2024, the company's language shifted, placing greater emphasis on the dependency of future cash flows on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, signaling a more pronounced sensitivity to these metrics in impairment assessments. While both years reference industry margins, the 2024 filing reflects a stronger linkage between impairment indicators and sustained changes in margins, rather than just temporary volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, ExxonMobil's consideration of industry margins in impairment assessments has evolved to incorporate more explicit factors related to long-term price assumptions and environmental considerations. In 2022, the Corporation emphasized that temporary price or margin declines were not viewed as impairment indicators, relying on long-term supply and demand fundamentals. By 2024, the process explicitly included estimated costs for greenhouse gas emissions and refining/chemical margins in cash flow projections, reflecting a more integrated approach to long-term price assumptions and sustainability goals. This evolution shows a shift toward aligning impairment assessments with broader strategic and environmental planning.",

By 2024, the company maintained the same description of these contracts, including the 10–20 year term range, minimum purchase requirements, and price escalation provisions, indicating no structural changes to the contract framework.

By 2024, this balance decreased to $19 million, with ($7) million in deductions and ($1) million in foreign currency adjustments. This indicates a consistent reduction in the noncurrent allowance, suggesting either improved credit quality of receivables or a strategic reduction in exposure to credit risk over time.",
      "llm_answer": "The provided document pages do not include specific data on IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent for 2022 or 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG explicitly included leasing prospects as a key component of their impairment evaluation and purchase accounting assumptions, using them alongside forecasted cash flows, operating income before depreciation and amortization, and capitalization rates. By 2023, while leasing prospects were still referenced, SPG placed increased emphasis on changes in economic and operating conditions, tenant financial health, and the intent and ability to hold assets when assessing the recoverability of investments. This reflects a more dynamic and condition-sensitive approach to leasing prospects in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, SPG's assumptions regarding leasing prospects in the evaluation of investment properties for impairment and purchase accounting have evolved to incorporate a more detailed consideration of local market conditions and expected probabilities of outcomes. In 2022, leasing prospects were mentioned as a factor in estimating undiscounted cash flows and fair value, but in 2023, the evaluation explicitly includes expected probabilities of outcomes, reflecting a more nuanced approach to uncertainty in leasing assumptions. This shift indicates a heightened focus on scenario-based forecasting and risk-adjusted assumptions in impairment and purchase accounting analyses.",

      "llm_answer": "The operating profit margin as a percentage of revenue decreased from 41.8% in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024, indicating a decline in profitability. This reduction was primarily driven by lower revenue across both the Analog and Embedded Processing segments, as well as higher manufacturing costs.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo's Parent company was subject to federal banking laws that limited covered transactions with its subsidiary banks to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in aggregate, with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length terms. Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the regulatory framework governing the relationship between Wells Fargo's parent company and its subsidiary banks has seen notable developments in capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms. The Support Agreement, which governs the transfer of liquidity and capital resources between the Parent and its subsidiaries, remains in place, with the IHC acting as an intermediary to provide liquidity and capital to key entities. In 2024, the Parent continues to face restrictions on dividend payments to the Parent if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers or if the Parent initiates bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, the FRB's enhanced supervision regulations impose capital distribution restrictions on large BHCs like Wells Fargo, including limitations on dividend payments triggered by capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management issues. These measures aim to ensure the Parent maintains sufficient liquidity and capital to support its subsidiary banks and meet obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE disclosed that NEER's asset retirement obligations (AROs) included dismantlement liabilities for certain wind and solar facilities, with the associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. For non-rate regulated operations, these costs were allocated to expense over the asset's estimated useful life, with changes in the ARO due to the passage of time recognized as an increase in the liability and as accretion expense, included in depreciation and amortization. By 2023, NEE further clarified that NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision specifically for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. This indicates a more explicit recognition and integration of dismantlement obligations into NEER’s depreciation methodology, showing a refinement in how these future liabilities are embedded into current financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "NextEra Energy's (NEE) approach to dismantlement obligations for NEER's wind and solar facilities evolved from 2022 to 2023 in terms of accounting treatment and expense allocation. In 2022, the dismantlement obligations for these facilities were primarily accounted for under asset retirement obligations (AROs), with liabilities accreted using the interest method until decommissioning or dismantlement activities are expected to be complete. The dismantlement costs were estimated at approximately $2.0 billion for NEER's wind and solar facilities. By 2023, the estimated cost had increased to approximately $3.1 billion, reflecting updated assessments and scenarios regarding the life of the plants and timing of dismantlement. Additionally, the accounting treatment remained consistent with AROs, but the updated studies and scenarios led to a higher estimated liability, indicating a more comprehensive and potentially conservative approach to future obligations.",

The 2023 adjustments were primarily driven by items such as the voluntary separation program ($1,035 million), Buick dealer strategy ($569 million), and Cruise restructuring ($478 million). In contrast, 2022 adjustments were influenced by the Cruise compensation modifications ($1,057 million), Russia exit ($657 million), and other strategic and operational decisions. Tax-related adjustments in 2023 included a tax benefit of $504 million, while in 2022, the tax effect of adjustments was $423 million. The underlying drivers for these adjustments in 2023 included cost reduction programs, strategic dealer transitions, and restructuring efforts, whereas in 2022, they were more influenced by one-time events such as the Cruise compensation modifications and the shutdown of operations in Russia.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Wells Fargo's relationship with its subsidiary banks in terms of capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms remained largely consistent, with a continued emphasis on regulatory compliance and financial stability. The Parent company's ability to receive dividends from its subsidiary banks is subject to federal and state regulations, as well as the terms of the Support Agreement with WFC Holdings, LLC (the IHC), which can restrict dividend payments if certain liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. Additionally, the FRB's enhanced supervision regulations for large BHCs, including Wells Fargo, impose capital distribution restrictions, including on dividend payments, upon the occurrence of specific triggers related to capital, stress tests, risk management, or liquidity. In 2024, the Company's resolution plan was noted to have no deficiencies, indicating continued alignment with regulatory expectations for liquidity and capital support mechanisms.",

By 2024, the company highlighted an increase in the sophistication and number of cyber threats, particularly with the emergence of AI-driven attack methods, and referenced industry-wide incidents like MOVEit as examples of events that could lead to financial loss. Despite these developments, IBM still reported that no cybersecurity incidents had resulted in a material adverse effect, indicating that while the threat landscape has evolved and potentially increased in risk, the company's mitigation strategies have kept the financial impact within manageable bounds.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, IBM's exposure to financial loss from cybersecurity incidents has increased due to the growing sophistication of cyber threats, including the use of AI and generative AI by malicious actors, which introduces novel attack methods.

In response, IBM has continued to enhance its mitigation efforts by monitoring, identifying, and remediating threats, while also addressing compliance obligations and investing in AI-based technologies to strengthen its cybersecurity posture. Despite these efforts, the evolving threat landscape and increased reliance on digital infrastructure underscore the persistent risk of material financial loss from potential breaches.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, the net pension and OPEB benefit was $192 million, an increase from $177 million in 2020, driven by a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred losses. In 2024, the benefit was $190 million, up from $164 million in 2023, with the increase attributed to a higher expected return on assets and lower interest costs due to a decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. The benefit remained relatively stable in magnitude but evolved in terms of its underlying drivers, shifting from primarily asset return and interest cost dynamics in 2021 to a more pronounced impact of reduced obligations in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The net pension and OPEB benefit, excluding service cost, increased from a $177 million benefit in 2021 to a $190 million benefit in 2024. The key drivers behind this change were a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs due to a decrease in benefit obligations. Additionally, the funded status of the plans improved, particularly for non-U.S. plans, due to a higher discount rate environment and strong asset performance.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This represents a significant shift from a slight improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2022, the gross profit rate was 24.3%, and it rose to 24.4% in fiscal 2023. The primary drivers of this increase were price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost inflation and merchandise mix improvements, partially offset by increased supply chain costs.",

      "question": "How did the treatment and compensation expense classification of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about ConocoPhillips' approach to PSU compensation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips disclosed that for performance periods beginning in 2018 or later, recipients of cash-settled PSUs received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense, with the accrued reinvested dividend paid at the time of settlement. In 2024, the company maintained the same structure, reiterating that for performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent, which was also charged to compensation expense and paid at settlement. This consistency indicates that the company did not alter its approach to dividend equivalents for these PSUs between the two years, maintaining a stable policy in how compensation is recognized and distributed for long-term incentive plans.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for cash-settled PSUs remained consistent, with these equivalents being charged to compensation expense and paid at the time of settlement. However, the compensation expense classification for cash-settled PSUs saw a notable decline in 2024, as reflected in the reduced total share-based compensation cost ($268 million in 2024 versus $334 million in 2023). This decline likely indicates a reduction in active cash-settled PSU awards, as no new cash-settled PSUs were granted after 2019 and most existing awards had vested by 2024. This evolution suggests that ConocoPhillips is transitioning away from cash-settled PSUs, aligning with a broader shift toward stock-settled compensation for long-term incentives.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Tower Corporation recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $0.4 million, while in 2023, the company recorded a slightly lower loss of $0.3 million. This indicates a minor reduction in the financial impact of debt repayments or retirements in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease suggests that the company may have experienced fewer or less costly early debt retirements during the 2023 period.",
      "llm_answer": "The loss on retirement of long-term obligations decreased significantly between 2022 and 2023, from $38.2 million in 2022 to just $0.3 million in 2023. This indicates that American Tower Corporation's debt repayment activities during 2023 were largely aligned with scheduled maturities or prepayment terms that did not incur substantial additional costs, in contrast to 2022, which included notable prepayment-related expenses, such as those tied to the repayment of InSite and CoreSite debts.",

Fixed license fees were recognized ratably over the contract term, and minimum guaranteed fees were recognized ratably over the guaranteed period, with excess fees recognized after the guarantee was exceeded. By fiscal 2024, the specific revenue recognition methodology was no longer detailed in the disclosures. Instead, affiliate fees were mentioned in the context of fluctuating with MVPD subscriber levels and were listed among the significant revenue sources for the Sports segment, particularly related to ESPN-branded channels. This indicates a shift from detailed recognition methodology in 2022 to a more contextual and segment-focused disclosure in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde identified cost pass-through as a 2% contributor to sales changes, indicating a limited but measurable impact of cost recovery mechanisms. By 2023, the company emphasized a structural advantage in its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, suggesting a more strategic and intentional reliance on cost pass-through as a financial management tool. This evolution indicates a shift from a reactive cost adjustment to a more proactive and contractual approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms shifted from a positive contributor to sales in 2022 to a negative factor in 2023. In 2022, cost pass-through increased sales by 3% in the Americas and 6% in EMEA, reflecting the company's ability to pass on rising energy costs to customers. However, in 2023, cost pass-through decreased sales by 3%, indicating that Linde may have faced challenges in maintaining the same level of cost pass-through, potentially due to market conditions or contractual limitations. This evolution suggests that while Linde has historically used cost pass-through to mitigate cost volatility, its effectiveness diminished in 2023, requiring the company to rely more on pricing and productivity initiatives to maintain profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 98 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a transformation in performance from a decline to an improvement in gross margin trends.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to higher inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges.

In 2023, GMI's revenue remained nearly flat with only a $2 million change (0%), but the variance components shifted significantly: volume contributed +$0.5 billion, mix decreased by $0.3 billion, cost reduced the revenue by $0.3 billion, and other factors added $0.1 billion.

In 2024, rather than disclosing specific membership figures, the company provided detailed information about its expanded use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing. This shift in disclosure suggests that Netflix anticipated sustained international growth in memberships and was proactively managing financial exposure to currency fluctuations, which could significantly impact revenue from global streaming. The detailed hedging strategy in 2024 reflects a strategic evolution from simply reporting growth to actively managing the financial implications of that growth.",

This increase indicates a slight rise in the company's risk profile related to settlement obligations, as it faces a higher potential exposure to customer settlement failures, despite having risk mitigation arrangements in place. However, the exposure remains short-term and historically, the company has experienced a low level of losses from such failures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the cost of natural gas resulted in a loss of $27 million in SO's derivatives in non-designated hedging relationships. By 2024, this relationship had reversed, with the cost of natural gas contributing a gain of $94 million to the same category. This indicates a significant shift in how natural gas pricing affected the company's financial instruments over this period. The change reflects a reversal in risk exposure, where previously rising natural gas costs hurt the company financially through derivatives, but more recently, those costs have benefited the company's position.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of the cost of natural gas on Southern Company's (SO) financial derivatives position shifted from a gain of $37 million in 2022 to a loss of $40 million in 2024. This indicates increased volatility and risk exposure in natural gas markets during this period, likely driven by factors such as supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, or regulatory changes affecting energy prices. The shift suggests that SO's hedging strategies became less effective in offsetting rising natural gas costs over time, reflecting broader market instability and potentially higher financial risk exposure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney detailed its revenue recognition methodology for Affiliate Fees, explaining that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber counts, with guaranteed fees recognized ratably over the contract term. By 2024, the company disclosed specific financial figures showing total Affiliate Fees reached $17,525 million, with $7,739 million attributed to Entertainment and $10,796 million to Sports. This indicates a shift from detailed policy description in 2022 to quantitative disclosure and segmentation in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's recognition and reporting of Affiliate Fees from 2022 to 2024 remained consistent in terms of revenue recognition methodology, with fees recognized as programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of subscribers. In terms of financial figures, Affiliate Fees decreased from $17,525 million in 2022 to $16,107 million in 2024, indicating a decline in reported affiliate fee revenue over the period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Free Cash Flow (FCF) as a percentage of revenue was 7.7%, but by 2024, it increased to 9.6%. This indicates an improvement in the company's financial efficiency, as it was able to generate a higher proportion of free cash flow relative to its revenue in 2024 compared to the previous year.",
      "llm_answer": "The Free Cash Flow (FCF) as a percentage of revenue increased from 7.7% in 2023 to 9.6% in 2024. This improvement indicates enhanced financial efficiency, as the company generated a higher proportion of free cash flow relative to its revenue despite lower overall revenue in 2024.

This consistent growth in Payment Network Revenue—rising from $14,358 million in 2022 to $15,824 million in 2023 and further to $17,335 million in 2024—indicates a stable and sustained performance in the company’s core payment services over the two-year period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DHR reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) of 1.0% for the year-over-year comparison of 2023 vs. 2022. In contrast, for 2024, the company reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) decline of (10.5)% for the comparison of 2023 vs. 2022 and a positive 3.0% for the 2024 vs. 2023 period. This indicates a significant shift from stable growth in 2023 to a notable decline in core sales growth in early 2024, followed by a partial recovery later in the year. The fluctuation suggests volatility in the company's underlying business performance during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, DHR's Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) showed a mixed trend across its business segments. In the Biotechnology segment, core sales declined by 18.0% in 2023 and further decreased by 4.5% in 2024, indicating ongoing challenges in demand for bioprocessing products and equipment. The Life Sciences segment experienced a 1.0% core sales growth in 2023 but faced a 2.0% decline in 2024, primarily due to weaker demand in China and Western Europe. Conversely, the Diagnostics segment saw a significant turnaround, with core sales declining by 10.5% in 2023 but growing by 3.0% in 2024, driven by increased demand for molecular diagnostics in North America. Overall, the mixed performance suggests that while some segments are showing signs of recovery, others continue to face headwinds, reflecting broader market dynamics and operational challenges.",

This decline was primarily driven by a $602 million decrease in Engineering segment sales, which included $894 million from projects in Russia in 2022 compared to only $238 million in 2023.

In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts.

The key drivers behind this change were primarily in the Walmart U.S. segment, where the company managed prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and benefited from lapping higher markdowns from the prior year. However, this was partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, the prior year's decline in the gross profit rate was driven by markdowns, merchandise mix shifts, and higher supply chain costs.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 155 basis points, primarily due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This shift reflects a significant change in the drivers of gross profit, moving from improvement due to internal efficiencies and product mix in 2022 to external pressures and cost increases in 2023.",

In fiscal 2022, the gross profit rate increased by 51 basis points, primarily due to price management in response to cost inflation, favorable merchandise mix, and the resumption of operations in Auto Care and Vision Centers, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. In contrast, fiscal 2023 saw a 85 basis-point decline in the gross profit rate, driven by net markdowns, shifts into lower-margin product categories, and higher supply chain costs, despite some benefits from price management.

This acquisition significantly enhanced ConocoPhillips' strategic position in Canada, increasing production by approximately 62 MBD of bitumen in the fourth quarter of 2023 and contributing to higher sales volumes in the Canada segment.",

By 2023, the Company expanded its criteria to include an additional indicator: the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations. This reflects a more comprehensive approach to assessing impairment risk, incorporating both behavioral and financial indicators of tenant health.",

In 2023, the Company added an explicit evaluation of a tenant's financial capacity to fulfill lease obligations, enhancing its ability to proactively identify at-risk assets.",

It was presented alongside other DPEP revenue categories like merchandise, food and beverage sales, and resort stays. By 2024, Theme Park Admissions was explicitly quantified at $11,171 million and categorized under the 'Experiences' segment, showing a distinct and separate reporting structure from other revenue streams such as Subscription fees ($18,796 million) and Advertising ($7,506 million).

This revenue stream is categorized under DPEP and includes sales of tickets for admission to theme parks and premium access services like Genie+ and Lightning Lane. In terms of relative contribution, Theme Park Admissions consistently represented a major portion of DPEP's total revenue, contributing 30% in 2022, 31% in 2023, and 33% in 2024. Compared to other DPEP revenue streams such as merchandise, food and beverage sales, and resorts and vacations, Theme Park Admissions remained a core and growing component of the segment's financial performance during this period.",

      "question": "How did Adobe's treatment or disclosure of unrealized credit-related losses evolve between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of recognition and presentation in financial statements?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Adobe disclosed that unrealized credit-related losses were recorded to 'other income (expense), net' in the Consolidated Statements of Income with a corresponding allowance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2024, the company maintained the same accounting treatment for unrealized credit-related losses, indicating consistency in recognition and presentation methodology. However, the context of significant financial activity—such as the $1 billion non-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition—suggests increased scrutiny on financial disclosures, though this did not alter the accounting approach for credit-related losses.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, Adobe maintained a consistent treatment of unrealized credit-related losses, recognizing them in the Consolidated Statements of Income as other income (expense), net, with a corresponding allowance for credit-related losses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In both years, no allowance for credit-related losses was recognized, as Adobe did not identify any credit-related impairments in its investment portfolio during either fiscal 2023 or 2024. The presentation and methodology for evaluating credit-related losses remained unchanged, with the company continuing to assess factors such as issuer defaults, credit ratings, and market conditions to determine the presence of credit losses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, General Motors reported an Automotive Interest Expense of $950 million. In 2023, this expense slightly increased to $987 million. This indicates that the company's interest burden related to its automotive operations remained relatively stable, with a modest increase of $37 million, or approximately 3.9%. The small change in interest expense suggests that GM's financing strategy for its automotive segment did not undergo significant alterations during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "General Motors' Automotive Interest Expense decreased from $950 million in 2022 to $911 million in 2023. This slight decline suggests that GM may have optimized its debt management strategies, potentially through refinancing or debt restructuring, to reduce borrowing costs or extend maturities, thereby improving its financial flexibility.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, HD acquired $1,827 million in lease assets through new operating lease liabilities and $336 million through new finance lease liabilities. In fiscal 2024, these figures changed to $1,384 million for operating leases and $153 million for finance leases. This indicates a significant decrease in both categories, especially in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on finance leases and moderating overall lease-driven asset acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, HD's acquisition of lease assets through new operating and finance lease liabilities evolved as follows: operating lease assets increased from $7,884 million to $8,592 million, while finance lease assets decreased from $2,840 million to $2,638 million. This indicates a strategic shift toward operating leases over finance leases, likely to enhance financial flexibility and manage long-term debt obligations.",

In 2024, the company experienced a core sales growth of 3.0%, showing a turnaround from the prior year.

This improvement indicates a stabilization in the company's underlying business performance, particularly in the Biotechnology segment, where core sales began to recover in the second half of 2024. The Diagnostics segment also showed positive core sales growth, driven by North America, suggesting a gradual return to more normal demand patterns and operational resilience.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil disclosed future dismantlement costs as part of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, noting that this measure includes costs for dismantlement, abandonment, and rehabilitation obligations. However, the company emphasized that the measure is based on first-day-of-the-month average prices, which can cause significant variability in cash flows year to year. In 2023, ExxonMobil maintained the same inclusion of future dismantlement costs but explicitly stated that the standardized measure 'depends on' these pricing assumptions, indicating a more direct acknowledgment of the sensitivity of dismantlement cost estimates to price fluctuations. This evolution shows a shift in how the company characterizes the relationship between external pricing and its long-term cost obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, ExxonMobil's treatment of future dismantlement costs within the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows remained consistent in being included as part of future development costs. However, the dependency on pricing assumptions became more pronounced in 2023 due to a significant negative net change in prices, which reduced the standardized measure by $172.8 billion. This contrasts with 2022, where a positive net change in prices increased the measure by $190.9 billion. The shift reflects heightened sensitivity to price volatility in 2023, impacting the valuation of future cash flows and dismantlement obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER had approximately 28,759 MW of contracted generation capacity with long-term power sales agreements, and only 1,842 MW of merchant generation assets that required active marketing and hedging. By 2024, NEER's disclosed future revenue commitments showed a significant shift, with $3,945 million in 2025 declining sharply to $370 million by 2029 and beyond, indicating a reduced long-term financial exposure and likely a strategic shift away from long-term contracted generation or a reclassification of assets. This reflects a transformation in NEER's business model under NEE, moving away from long-term commitments toward shorter-term or market-driven strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, NEE's NEER segment has seen a shift in its financial exposure, with a notable decrease in contracted generation assets and an increase in merchant generation exposure. In 2023, NEER reported approximately 28,759 MW of contracted generation capacity with a weighted-average remaining contract term of about 15 years, while merchant generation assets totaled 1,842 MW. By 2024, capital expenditures for NEER's contracted clean energy projects, such as wind and solar, show a decline, with wind and solar investments decreasing from $7,585 million in 2023 to $6,735 million in 2024. Additionally, the segment's revenue from contracted generation has decreased, with operating revenues for NEER dropping from $9,672 million in 2023 to $7,542 million in 2024, while merchant generation remains a smaller but active part of the portfolio.",

This reversal reflects a shift from operational improvement to substantial operational challenges across key business segments, particularly BCA and BDS, driven by production disruptions, program losses, and contract adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's Core Operating Loss increased significantly from $1,829 million in 2023 to $11,811 million in 2024, indicating a substantial deterioration in the company's operating performance during this period. This sharp rise was primarily driven by large losses in the Commercial Airplanes segment due to production disruptions, customer considerations related to the 737-9 grounding, and higher development costs, as well as increased losses in the Defense, Space & Security segment from unfavorable contract adjustments.",

      "question": "How did COP's treatment and disclosure of dry hole expenses evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of financial reporting and categorization of exploration costs?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP accounted for dry hole expenses under the successful efforts method of accounting, where exploratory well costs are capitalized pending evaluation and expensed as dry holes if economically recoverable reserves are not found. This is detailed in the 2023 disclosures regarding oil and gas exploration and development. By 2024, COP provided explicit financial figures showing a significant increase in dry hole expenses, rising from $109 million in 2023 to $251 million in 2024. This indicates a notable increase in the number or cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells during the year, reflecting a shift toward more aggressive or riskier exploration activities or changes in success rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, COP continued to apply the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development costs, as disclosed in both years’ 10-K filings. In 2023, dry hole expenses were categorized under \"Total Exploration Expenses\" and were specifically listed as $40 million for dry holes. By 2024, dry hole expenses were not explicitly listed in the financial tables, but total exploration expenses were reported as $355 million, with a breakdown of general and administrative expenses, leasehold impairment, and other costs. The absence of a separate dry hole line item in 2024 suggests a potential change in disclosure practices, though the treatment of dry hole costs as expenses remains consistent with prior years.",

By 2024, this figure transformed into a significant unrealized gain of $914,369 thousand.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast highlighted that lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, particularly for NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's channels, had an adverse effect on advertising sales and rates. The company noted that audience measurement methodologies could negatively affect advertising revenue if they did not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. By 2023, the company formalized its approach to advertising contracts by disclosing that it guarantees audience ratings for advertisements in some contracts. If a shortfall occurs in meeting these guaranteed ratings, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units within one year. This represents a shift from merely identifying audience ratings as a risk factor to actively managing the financial implications through contractual guarantees and revenue deferral policies.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast modified its approach to audience ratings guarantees in advertising contracts from 2022 to 2023 by deferring a portion of the revenue in cases where guaranteed ratings were not met, typically settling shortfalls by providing additional advertising units within one year of the original airing. This change impacted revenue recognition timing by delaying recognition for contracts with unmet ratings guarantees until the shortfall was resolved, as opposed to recognizing revenue in the period advertisements were aired.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Emerson reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $3,231 million, which significantly increased to $13,219 million in 2023. This substantial growth in earnings directly contributed to retained earnings, which rose from a beginning balance of $28,053 million in 2022 to $40,070 million in 2023 before dividends and other adjustments. The change reflects a transformational increase in profitability or a one-time gain, likely tied to strategic transactions such as the AspenTech acquisition disclosed in the 2023 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson's net earnings attributable to common stockholders increased significantly from $3,231 million in 2022 to $13,219 million in 2023. This substantial growth was driven by the gains from the divestitures of the Climate Technologies and InSinkErator businesses. In 2023, retained earnings increased by $13,219 million due to the net earnings, partially offset by dividends paid of $1,202 million, resulting in an ending retained earnings balance of $40,830 million.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Corporate G&A expenses increased by $113 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by mark-to-market adjustments associated with certain compensation programs. In contrast, the 2024 increase of $359 million compared to 2023 was mainly due to $432 million in transaction expenses linked to the acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including reduced mark-to-market impacts of key employee compensation programs. This reflects a shift from compensation-driven growth in 2023 to acquisition-driven growth in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The Corporate G&A expenses increased significantly from $357 million in 2023 to $716 million in 2024, representing a $359 million increase. In 2023, the increase of $113 million compared to 2022 was primarily driven by mark-to-market adjustments in compensation programs. In 2024, the increase was largely attributed to $432 million in transaction-related expenses from the acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including reduced mark-to-market impacts from key employee compensation programs.

However, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the company elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for the SB405 PSC and relinquished the block. This marks a shift from active exploration and evaluation to a strategic decision to discontinue further investment in the block.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT's forward-looking statements included references to the 'Pending ATC TIPL Transaction' in relation to its substantial leverage and debt service obligations, indicating a specific transactional context for its financial risk disclosures. By 2024, the disclosure no longer mentioned the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction, suggesting that the company had either completed or abandoned this specific agreement, and instead focused on broader financing activities and debt service obligations without tying them to a named transaction. This evolution reflects a shift from a transaction-specific risk to a more generalized disclosure around leverage and financing.",
      "llm_answer": "The discussion around AMT's substantial leverage evolved from 2023 to 2024 as the company addressed its leverage through strategic divestitures, particularly the completion of the ATC TIPL Transaction in 2024. In 2023, the forward-looking statements highlighted the ongoing risks associated with substantial leverage and debt service obligations, without detailing specific actions to mitigate them. By 2024, the company had taken concrete steps to reduce leverage by divesting its India operations and using the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under its credit facility. This shift reflects a more proactive approach to managing leverage and reducing financial risk, as evidenced by the detailed reporting of the transaction's impact on financial condition and results of operations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP capitalized appraisal drilling costs as part of its successful efforts method of accounting, suspending exploratory well costs on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of economically recoverable reserves. If appraisal drilling and seismic work continued to indicate potential, these costs could remain capitalized for several years. By 2024, COP disclosed that appraisal drilling was complete in certain areas, with costs now being incurred to assess development, while additional appraisal wells were still planned in other areas. This indicates a shift from capitalizing uncertain exploration costs to actively evaluating development feasibility, reflecting a more mature phase in those projects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment and disclosure of appraisal drilling costs in ConocoPhillips' financial reporting remained consistent with the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development. Under this method, exploratory well costs are capitalized as suspended wells pending further evaluation of economically recoverable reserves. If reserves are not confirmed, the costs are expensed as dry holes. In 2023, the ending balance of suspended wells was $184 million, and by 2024, it increased slightly to $196 million. The disclosures in both years included aging of suspended well costs and details on specific projects, such as appraisal drilling status and planned activities. The reporting practices remained focused on transparency regarding the capitalization of appraisal drilling costs and the rationale for continued capitalization or subsequent write-offs.",

This change was primarily driven by worsening losses in key segments, especially Commercial Airplanes, which faced forward losses on major programs, production disruptions, and grounding-related costs. Defense, Space & Security also experienced increased losses due to unfavorable contract adjustments.",

This sharp rise was primarily driven by significant losses in the Commercial Airplanes segment due to production disruptions, customer considerations related to the 737-9 grounding, and increased research and development expenses, as well as higher unfavorable adjustments in the Defense, Space & Security segment. The increase in Core Operating Loss suggests that the company faced major operational challenges in 2024, impacting its profitability and efficiency.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, content amortization was $14,197,437 thousand, and in 2024, it increased to $15,301,517 thousand. This indicates that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, as the cost of amortizing its content library grew year-over-year. The increase in content amortization suggests that Netflix is either producing or licensing more high-cost content, or extending the availability windows of existing content, which results in higher ongoing amortization expenses.",

This increase suggests that Netflix is continuing to invest heavily in content production and licensing, which is a core part of its strategy to maintain and grow its subscriber base by offering a diverse and compelling library of entertainment. The growth in amortization reflects the ongoing capitalization of new content assets and their accelerated amortization over shorter periods, consistent with Netflix's business model of rapid content turnover and high viewer engagement.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, AbbVie consistently expensed business valuation costs as incurred in connection with business combinations. However, the 2024 disclosure includes a more detailed emphasis on the treatment of contingent consideration liabilities, noting that 'subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.' This evolution in disclosure suggests a more transparent or refined approach to communicating the financial impact of post-acquisition adjustments, potentially indicating a shift toward more complex acquisitions with greater contingent payment structures.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, AbbVie's treatment of business valuation costs in relation to business combinations remained consistent, as both years explicitly state that legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs, and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred. However, the 2024 10-K reveals a significant increase in acquisition activity, with notable acquisitions of ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics, which likely led to higher related expenses. This suggests that AbbVie's acquisition strategy became more active in 2024, focusing on expanding its R&D pipeline and therapeutic capabilities, while maintaining its accounting practice of expensing such costs immediately.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment experienced low single-digit organic sales growth. Despite this consistency, the lack of acceleration suggests stable but stagnant performance in this segment over the two-year period, with no significant improvement or decline.",
      "llm_answer": "The Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment reported unchanged net sales in 2024 compared to 2023, while organic sales growth was in the low single digits. This indicates modest growth in this business area, suggesting stable performance amid broader company growth in other segments. The segment's performance reflects a mixed environment, with organic growth being driven by product innovation and market share leadership in key categories like feminine care and baby care, but constrained by factors such as competitive pressures and macroeconomic conditions.",

By 2024, the segment gross margin improved significantly to $487.1 million, showing a turnaround of nearly $683.1 million year-over-year. This indicates that the segment successfully implemented a turnaround strategy, shifting from a cost center to a profit contributor within a single year.",
      "llm_answer": "The year-over-year change in AMT's Data Centers segment gross margin was an increase of 10% (from $444.6 million in 2022 to $487.1 million in 2023). This increase was primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by increased direct expenses, mainly due to power costs. The positive change in the Data Centers segment's gross margin indicates that the segment's turnaround strategy, which likely included efforts to boost revenue and manage costs, was effective in improving profitability during the period.",

By 2024, the company had completed a 3D seismic survey (acquired in 2022) and processed the data, but in the fourth quarter of 2024, it elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration and relinquished the block. This indicates a strategic decision to exit the block after initial evaluation yielded insufficient promise.",
      "llm_answer": "ConocoPhillips' exploration strategy in Block SB405 shifted significantly between 2023 and 2024, moving from active exploration to relinquishing the block. In 2023, the company had acquired Block SB405 in 2021 with an 85% working interest and conducted a 3D seismic survey in 2022 to evaluate the area for future exploration drilling. However, by 2024, after completing the processing and evaluation of the seismic data, ConocoPhillips decided not to proceed to the second phase of exploration and formally relinquished the block in the fourth quarter of 2024. This action indicates a strategic decision to discontinue exploration efforts in Block SB405 due to the lack of viable development opportunities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the residual growth rates for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were aligned with brand operating plans and approximated expected long-term category market growth rates. By 2024, the residual growth rates remained conceptually similar but were now explicitly stated to depend on additional factors such as grooming habit changes and sustained deceleration in category growth. This evolution in assumptions reflects increased sensitivity to market dynamics, which contributed to the $1.3 billion impairment charge recorded in 2024 due to a higher discount rate, currency devaluation, and restructuring impacts. The 2024 analysis also introduced a more explicit sensitivity to a 25 basis-point decrease in residual growth rates, indicating a heightened risk of future impairment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the residual growth rates for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were adjusted downward, reflecting a more conservative outlook due to macroeconomic pressures, currency devaluation, and restructuring impacts. These lower residual growth rates contributed to a reduced fair value estimate for the asset, ultimately leading to a $1.3 billion non-cash impairment charge in 2024. The downward revision in assumptions increased the asset's susceptibility to impairment, highlighting the sensitivity of its valuation to adverse changes in market conditions and growth expectations.",

This suggests that Starbucks applies a straight-line or accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful life of these intangible assets, consistent with its practice for other finite-lived intangible assets. The minimal value and rapid amortization highlight that these trade secrets and processes likely had a short useful life or were fully expensed shortly after acquisition.",

By 2024, Duke Energy disclosed that its total remaining performance obligations for Piedmont amounted to $405 million, with $64 million due in 2025 and decreasing annually until $151 million in 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from a short-term lease-based relationship to a more structured, multi-year financial commitment with defined performance obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Duke Energy's financial commitment to Piedmont has significantly decreased, particularly in operating lease obligations. In 2022, Piedmont had operating lease payments of $5 million, which remained consistent in 2023 but dropped to $5 million in 2024. By 2026 and beyond, there are no remaining lease payments for Piedmont. Additionally, the total operating lease liabilities for Piedmont decreased from $19 million in 2022 to $14 million in 2024. These reductions suggest a decline in Piedmont's lease commitments over the period, indicating a reduced financial obligation from Duke Energy towards Piedmont.",

By 2024, the company not only continued to exclude these adjustments from non-GAAP metrics but also provided a concrete financial figure—$60 million in contingent consideration adjustments were excluded in 2023 as part of the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. This shows that while the policy of exclusion remained consistent, the company evolved its reporting by quantifying the impact of these adjustments in 2024, offering greater transparency into their financial effect.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AFFO (common stockholders) was defined as Consolidated AFFO excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in Consolidated AFFO. By 2024, the definition of AFFO (common stockholders) expanded to include adjustments for discontinued operations, in addition to noncontrolling interests, indicating a broader reconciliation that now incorporates the impact of discontinued operations on both Nareit FFO and the corresponding adjustments. This reflects a shift in how the company accounts for structural changes in its operations when presenting AFFO to investors.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the definition and presentation of AFFO (common stockholders) evolved to clarify its relationship with Consolidated AFFO and the treatment of noncontrolling interests. In 2022, AFFO (common stockholders) was defined as Consolidated AFFO excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the adjustments included in Consolidated AFFO. By 2024, the definition expanded to explicitly include adjustments for discontinued operations and noncontrolling interests in both Nareit FFO and the corresponding adjustments in AFFO, emphasizing a more comprehensive exclusion of noncontrolling interests and discontinued operations in the final metric.",

      "question": "How has the company's content amortization expense evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about its investment and monetization strategy for content assets?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company's content amortization expense was $14,197,437, and it increased to $15,301,517 in 2024. This represents an increase of over $1.1 billion in amortization costs year-over-year. The rise in content amortization suggests that the company has been actively investing in new content and is systematically recognizing the cost of these assets over time, consistent with its strategy of expanding its content library to enhance subscriber growth and retention.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's content amortization expense increased from $14,197 million in 2023 to $15,301 million in 2024, indicating a rise in the usage of previously acquired content assets. This increase suggests that the company is monetizing a larger portion of its content library, which could reflect a strategy to optimize returns on past investments. However, the fact that content amortization is growing at a slower rate than revenue (from 42% of revenue in 2023 to 39% in 2024) implies that the company may be managing its content costs effectively while continuing to invest in new content, as evidenced by the $13.1 billion in content payments in 2023 and likely similar levels in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast used its three Cable Communications divisions as the unit of account for testing the impairment of cable franchise rights and performed either qualitative or quantitative assessments annually or more frequently if there were substantive changes in circumstances. By 2024, the company continued to perform annual impairment testing as of July 1 and maintained the use of qualitative assessments first, but placed more emphasis on periodic quantitative assessments to support qualitative conclusions. Additionally, in 2024, the company explicitly referenced the discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and also considered earnings multiples from comparable companies and recent transactions, suggesting a more detailed and market-informed approach compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast's approach to the valuation and impairment testing of its cable franchise rights in 2024 continued to emphasize qualitative assessments over quantitative ones, with the most recent quantitative assessment conducted in 2022. In 2024, a qualitative assessment was performed, relying on factors such as changes in projected cash flows, macroeconomic conditions, and market capitalization, leading to the conclusion that fair values were substantially higher than carrying values, eliminating the need for a quantitative test. The units of account remained consistent with prior practices, focusing on franchise rights at the individual geographic service area level.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment of $(3) million, indicating a slight negative adjustment. However, in 2024, this figure shifted significantly to $(28) million, showing a much stronger negative impact on the company's financials. This indicates that AIG's claims management or reserving practices may have faced unforeseen challenges in 2024, leading to a larger-than-expected increase in loss adjustment expenses from prior years.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior year development for AIG decreased from $17 million in 2023 to $13 million in 2024. This reduction suggests that AIG improved its claims management and reserving practices, as it experienced less adverse development in ULAE in 2024 compared to the prior year.

By 2024, the company maintained a similar framework but placed a more explicit emphasis on 'past payment experience' as a core component of its credit risk assessment, suggesting a strategic refinement in prioritizing historical payment behavior in determining creditworthiness. This shift indicates a more focused approach on behavioral data in managing credit risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher's evaluation methodology for accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts in 2024 remained largely consistent with 2023, focusing on a combination of financial and qualitative factors such as customers' financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience, and credit bureau information. However, in 2024, the Company explicitly mentioned incorporating updated economic conditions into its evaluation process and revised its estimates of expected future losses for accounts receivable as necessary.

By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include specific details about impairment testing, such as performing undiscounted operating cash flow analyses at the lowest identifiable asset group level and calculating impairment losses as the excess of an asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows or expected proceeds less disposal costs.

By fiscal 2024, Licensed Stores Revenue had reached $2,747.4 million, accounting for 10.2% of North America Total Net Revenues, up slightly from $2,659.1 million or 10.0% in fiscal 2023. This indicates a continuation of growth, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the substantial year-over-year increase in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Licensed Stores Revenue grew significantly between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, both in absolute terms and as a proportion of total net revenues. In fiscal 2022, licensed stores revenue increased by $972 million (36.2%) to $3.7 billion, contributing 11.4% to total net revenues of $32.3 billion. By fiscal 2024, licensed stores revenue rose to $4.5 billion (North America and International combined), representing a $808 million increase from fiscal 2023 and contributing 13.6% to total net revenues of $33.1 billion.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Veralto Distribution contributed approximately $2.6 billion in cash to Danaher, a portion of which was used to redeem certain outstanding indebtedness. By 2024, the distribution had a residual impact on accumulated comprehensive income, with a reported $974 million credit to the Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) account as part of the comprehensive income reconciliation. This indicates that while the immediate liquidity benefit was realized in 2023, the 2024 figures reflect the ongoing financial restructuring and capital optimization effects of the distribution, particularly in terms of balance sheet adjustments and long-term investment positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the Veralto Distribution on Danaher's comprehensive income showed a significant shift between 2023 and 2024. In 2023, the distribution contributed positively, with a $983 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to the separation. However, in 2024, comprehensive income was negatively impacted, with a $1,470 million decrease primarily driven by foreign currency translation adjustments and pension-related losses. This indicates that while the Veralto Distribution initially provided a one-time boost to comprehensive income in 2023, its long-term financial implications are more complex, with ongoing exposure to currency and pension risks affecting overall comprehensive income in subsequent years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had a $400 million unsecured debt issuance linked to Piedmont. By 2024, this relationship had transformed from a debt-based connection to one involving performance obligations, with Duke disclosing a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations related to Piedmont, spread across 2025 through 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from direct debt financing to contractual performance-based financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont, as reflected in disclosed debt obligations, shows a notable shift. In 2022, Piedmont had no debt maturities, but by 2024, it had a $40 million maturity, and in 2025, a significant $205 million maturity is scheduled. Additionally, Piedmont's total long-term debt increased from $2,990 million in 2022 to $2,990 million in 2024, with a substantial portion maturing beyond 2025. This suggests that Piedmont's debt obligations have grown and are becoming more front-loaded in the coming years, indicating a more active role in financing and a potential increase in financial commitments within Duke Energy's structure.",

By 2023, the company had incurred total cumulative charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 for the same integration plan. This indicates that the integration efforts extended beyond initial cost estimates, reflecting potentially more complex integration activities or expanded restructuring initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "The total cumulative charges related to the Allergan integration plan increased from $2.0 billion through 2022 to $2.5 billion through 2023. This indicates that integration efforts continued into 2023, with additional costs incurred, primarily in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

By 2024, MDLZ explicitly disclosed the pension participation changes as a quantified item with an impact of $(3) million that was excluded from Adjusted EPS calculations. This represents a shift from a general exclusion to a specific, numerically disclosed adjustment, indicating more transparent and detailed reporting of pension-related impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MDLZ continued to exclude the impact from pension participation changes as an adjustment to Adjusted Operating Income. In 2022, this impact was a $1 charge, while in 2023, it was excluded at $0, and in 2024, it was not listed as a separate line item but likely remained excluded as part of the consistent treatment of non-recurring pension-related charges.

      "question": "How did Walmart's gross profit rate trend evolve between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and what were the key drivers behind the change?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, mainly due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This reflects a significant reversal in the trend, moving from a modest improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate declined from 24.4% to 23.5%, a decrease of 90 basis points. In fiscal 2023, the decline was primarily driven by markdowns and merchandise mix shifts into lower-margin categories in the U.S., as well as higher supply chain costs and inflation-related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. In contrast, fiscal 2022 saw a 14 basis-point increase in the gross profit rate, mainly due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost inflation and merchandise mix, partially offset by increased supply chain costs.",

      "question": "How did the impact of DD&A expenses on COP's financial performance evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's cost structure and production trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, DD&A expenses had a negative impact on COP's earnings, primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions resulting from increased costs and higher overall production volumes. This contributed to a net income (loss) decrease of $7,723 million. By 2024, DD&A expenses were reported at $9,599 million, up from $8,270 million in 2023, indicating a continued rise in these costs. While the explicit negative impact was not reiterated in 2024, the increase in absolute dollar terms suggests that DD&A remained a growing pressure point for the company, likely tied to sustained high production volumes and ongoing reserve adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, DD&A expenses for ConocoPhillips (COP) increased by $1,329 million, from $8.27 billion to $9.599 billion. This increase was driven by higher production volumes in the Lower 48 and Canada segments, higher depreciation rates in Alaska and the Lower 48, and the acquisition of Marathon Oil. The rising DD&A expenses indicate that COP's cost structure is becoming more capital-intensive, likely due to increased production and asset acquisitions. This trend suggests that the company is investing in expanding its operations, which could support long-term production growth despite the associated higher depreciation costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast primarily used a discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and market participant estimates of future cash flows, supported by internal forecasts, to estimate fair value for impairment testing of owned content. By 2024, the company continued to assess fair value using Level 3 inputs, but with a more detailed emphasis on market participant estimates of future cash flows and a more structured approach to impairment assessments, including evaluating content either individually or in identified film groups depending on monetization strategy. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced explanation of impairment triggers, including events or changes in circumstances known or knowable as of the balance sheet date, and clarified the treatment of abandoned content, which is now recorded as substantively abandoned in programming and production costs. This represents a moderate transformation in methodology and specificity.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Comcast's approach to impairment testing for owned content has evolved in terms of the specificity of impairment assessments and the basis for estimating fair value. In 2022, the company evaluated owned content for impairment primarily on an individual title basis, with fair value estimates based on market participant estimates of future cash flows, supported by internal forecasts. By 2024, the company maintained individual title assessments for the majority of owned content but provided more detailed criteria for determining fair value, emphasizing Level 3 inputs, such as market participant estimates of future cash flows, and clarified the testing approach for licensed content, which is generally assessed on a channel, network, or platform basis. This reflects a more structured and specific methodology for impairment assessments in 2024 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Starbucks recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to its Reinvention Plan, which focused on increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Additionally, the company had completed a prior restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 that included $155.4 million in restructuring and impairments, primarily from store closures and lease-related costs. By fiscal 2024, Starbucks reported no restructuring and impairments charges, in contrast to fiscal 2023, which had a $1.1 million charge. This indicates a reduction in impairment activity and a stabilization of restructuring efforts following the earlier strategic changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Starbucks' approach to restructuring and impairments shifted from initial implementation to refinement and optimization. In fiscal 2022, the company announced the Reinvention Plan in the U.S., which aimed to enhance efficiency and the customer experience, resulting in an immaterial impairment charge. By fiscal 2024, the focus had evolved to include strategic investments in store partner wages and technology, with no material restructuring or impairment charges recorded, indicating a more stabilized and growth-oriented strategy. The financial impact remained minimal, reflecting successful integration of restructuring efforts into ongoing operations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $(1) million, indicating a slight negative adjustment. By 2024, this figure significantly worsened to $(28) million, showing a substantial negative development. This suggests that AIG experienced greater-than-anticipated loss adjustment expenses in 2024, which could signal challenges in accurately forecasting or managing claims-related costs.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG's unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development decreased from $1 in 2023 to $-1 in 2024. This slight negative development in 2024 suggests a marginal improvement in claims management or reserving accuracy, indicating that the company may have refined its estimates or experienced fewer unexpected adjustments in prior years' reserves. However, the minimal change implies relatively stable claims management practices with no significant shifts in reserving strategies or claim resolution efficiency.",

By 2024, the company extended the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, aligning them more closely with the 30-year estimated useful life of tower assets. This change in accounting estimate, effective January 1, 2024, led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $730 million for the year.

      "question": "How did MDLZ's treatment and disclosure of contingent consideration adjustments evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of their inclusion in adjusted financial metrics?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ excluded contingent consideration adjustments from their Adjusted Operating Income as part of a list of exclusions that also included items like Simplify to Grow Program impacts and intangible asset impairments. By 2024, the company began disclosing specific contingent consideration adjustments within their Adjusted EPS reconciliation, with a reported impact of $(60) million in 2023 related to acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. This represents a shift from general exclusion to explicit quantification and inclusion in adjusted financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MDLZ included contingent consideration adjustments in its Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS metrics, but the treatment and impact of these adjustments evolved. In 2022, contingent consideration adjustments were excluded as part of acquisition integration costs and were reported as a negative adjustment of $72 million. By 2024, contingent consideration adjustments were still excluded but were grouped under acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, with a positive impact of $60 million in 2023 and no explicit mention in 2024, suggesting a reduction in their materiality or inclusion in broader adjustments. This indicates a shift in how these adjustments were integrated into non-GAAP metrics, reflecting either fewer adjustments or a change in disclosure practices.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories.

      "llm_answer": "Walmart's Gross Profit Rate decreased from 24.4% in fiscal 2022 to 23.7% in fiscal 2023.

In October 2023, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), bringing its total ownership to 100%.

The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, and by the end of the first quarter of 2024, the purchase price was fully allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The financial commitment included a contingent payment arrangement, under which ConocoPhillips could pay up to $0.4 billion CAD over five years, depending on WCS pricing and production targets.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, CMCSA recognized licensed content costs by capitalizing them when the license period began, the content was made available for use, and the costs were known, with amortization occurring as the associated programs were broadcast. Additionally, licensed content was tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network, or platform basis, except for broadcast networks and local stations, which were tested on a daypart basis. By 2024, the company maintained the capitalization criteria but refined the amortization methodology by incorporating 'estimated viewing patterns' into the process. Also in 2024, CMCSA explicitly classified licensed content as noncurrent assets under 'film and television costs' and clarified that production costs incurred in advance of airing are included in licensed content. The 2024 filing also introduced more detailed descriptions of co-financing arrangements and tax incentives, which were absent in 2022. These changes indicate a more nuanced and structured approach to licensed content asset management and cost recognition over time.",

In 2024, the methodology for amortization remained unchanged from 2022, with licensed content amortized based on usage and presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs.

      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the target allocation ranges for TXN's defined benefit plan investments became slightly more flexible. For the U.S. Defined Benefit plans, the fixed income securities and cash equivalents range shifted from 65% - 80% to 60% - 75%, while the equity securities range expanded from 20% - 35% to 25% - 40%. The U.S. Retiree Health Care and Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plans retained similar ranges, indicating a strategic shift toward a more balanced and potentially growth-oriented allocation for U.S. plans.",

In 2024, this figure changed significantly to a negative impact of $28 million. This represents a substantial reduction in the magnitude of prior year development, suggesting that AIG's reserving practices may have become more accurate or that claims settlements for prior years were more favorable than previously estimated.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth was 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact remained at 1.0% compared to the prior year. However, this consistency occurred in the context of a significant shift in total sales growth performance—implying a growing relative influence of currency effects as overall growth slowed. In 2023, the company experienced total sales growth of 1.5%, with currency exchange rates contributing positively at 1.0%. In contrast, by 2024, total sales growth turned into a decline of 2.0%, while the currency impact remained unchanged at 1.0%. This suggests that despite the company's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations remaining constant, the importance of this factor in the broader context of sales performance increased as overall growth weakened.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a negative effect to a neutral or slightly positive one. In 2023, the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced reported sales by 1.0%, while in 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates was positive in some segments (e.g., Life Sciences and Diagnostics) and neutral in others (e.g., Biotechnology). This suggests that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations decreased in 2024, potentially due to a more stable or favorable currency environment or hedging strategies.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported $2.3 billion in structural cost savings realized during the year, contributing to a cumulative total of $9.7 billion since 2019. These savings were attributed to increased operational efficiencies, reduced staffing costs, and initiatives such as supply chain optimization and improved maintenance. By 2024, the company formalized 'Structural Cost Savings' as a defined earnings driver, explicitly incorporating it into its financial reporting framework to provide greater transparency into its cost management performance. This shift indicates that XOM elevated structural cost savings from an internal efficiency metric to a strategic financial reporting category, aligning it with other key earnings drivers like advantaged volume growth and base volume. The change reflects a broader strategic emphasis on sustaining cost discipline as a core component of earnings power.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, XOM's structural cost savings increased by $2.3 billion in 2023 and continued to show progress in 2024, with cumulative savings reaching $12.1 billion since 2019. This evolution reflects the company's disciplined cost management strategy, focusing on operational efficiencies, reduced staffing costs, and divestment-related savings. The sustained emphasis on structural cost savings underscores XOM's commitment to optimizing spending and improving earnings power across its operations.",

By 2024, Piedmont had a significantly different profile in Duke Energy's disclosures, with a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations attributed to it, showing a growing financial commitment or operational involvement with Piedmont. This evolution reflects a shift from a minor stakeholder role in retirement funding to a more substantial contractual obligation.",

These intangibles were directly tied to tenant contracts and relationships at the time of acquisition. By 2024, the company's disclosures expanded to emphasize a more detailed impairment review process for tenant-related intangibles, assessing them on a tenant-by-tenant basis for indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or customer financial instability. The company also began determining recoverability based on projected undiscounted future cash flows and measuring impairment losses using discounted cash flows or market data. This marks a shift from a purely amortization-focused approach to a more dynamic model involving periodic impairment assessments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the treatment and evaluation of tenant-related intangibles evolved primarily in terms of amortization assumptions and impairment review processes. In 2024, the Company extended the estimated useful life of its tower assets from 20 to 30 years, which prospectively impacted the amortization of tenant-related intangibles, aligning their useful lives with the extended tower asset lives. Additionally, the impairment review process for tenant-related intangibles remained focused on tenant-specific factors such as contract renewals, attrition, and financial viability, but the Company refined its evaluation by incorporating updated cash flow projections and market conditions, particularly in response to macroeconomic factors like increased weighted average cost of capital.",

By 2023, the change in fair value again reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales, but this was driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time in combination with lower discount rates. This indicates a more favorable outlook for Skyrizi sales in 2023 compared to 2022 due to improved market dynamics and a decrease in discount rates.",

This acquisition was completed in October 2023. In 2024, the company disclosed that the final consideration for this Surmont acquisition was $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion) after customary adjustments, indicating a significant financial commitment to the asset. This evolution shows a full strategic alignment and increased capital investment in Surmont between the two reporting years.",
      "llm_answer": "In October 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in the Surmont oil sands asset in Canada from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd., increasing its ownership stake to 100%. The all-cash transaction was valued at $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion) and included contingent consideration of up to $0.4 billion CAD over five years, based on West Canada Select (WCS) pricing and production targets. By October 2024, ConocoPhillips had made $158 million USD in contingent payments under this arrangement. The acquisition provided full ownership of Surmont's proved and unproved properties and enhanced control over its long-life, low-cost bitumen production.",

By 2024, the company reiterated that environmental protection costs for that year were not significant and expected future expenditures to remain consistent with 2024 levels, barring major regulatory shifts. This indicates that Linde's approach to environmental compliance has remained stable over the three-year period, with no substantial increase in spending anticipated despite growing global emphasis on climate change mitigation and stricter environmental regulations in key markets like the EU, U.S., and China.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's environmental protection costs were not significant in both 2022 and 2024, with the company anticipating that future expenditures will remain similar to these years unless there are significant regulatory changes.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $8.50, which decreased to $7.64 in 2023—a drop of $0.86 or 10%. This decline occurred alongside a constant currency adjustment of -6% in 2023, suggesting that foreign exchange rates were not the primary driver of the drop. Instead, the decrease indicates a deliberate shift in pricing strategy, potentially to attract more subscribers in emerging markets where affordability is a key factor. This aligns with Netflix's broader strategic pivot toward global expansion and subscriber growth over short-term revenue per user, as evidenced by the significant increase in paid net membership additions from 5,391 thousand in 2022 to 7,315 thousand in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership from $11.67 in 2022 to $11.64 in 2023 reflects a 1% decline, primarily driven by a shift in plan mix and higher membership growth in regions with lower average revenue per membership, partially offset by limited price increases. Constant currency adjustments indicate that foreign exchange rate fluctuations further reduced revenue, as unfavorable currency movements would have increased 2023 revenues by approximately $597 million if rates had remained constant compared to 2022. This highlights the growing international market focus, where lower-revenue regions contributed to membership growth but diluted average revenue per membership.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $1 million. By 2024, this figure had changed to -$28 million, indicating a significant negative adjustment. This shift from a small positive adjustment to a substantial negative one suggests that AIG may have revised its prior estimates downward in 2024, reflecting either improved claims resolution or a reassessment of loss reserves that year.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG's unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior year development decreased from a negative $77 million in 2023 to a negative $72 million in 2024. This slight improvement suggests a marginal reduction in unfavorable development on prior year claims, indicating more stable claims management or reserving practices in 2024 compared to 2023.

Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized the sensitivity of Properties, Plant and Equipment valuations to volatile factors such as future commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes.

Additionally, the valuation of PP&E became more sensitive to assumptions about future cash flows, commodity prices, and environmental regulations, which influenced impairment assessments.

      "question": "How has the composition and risk assumption in UnitedHealth Group's premium revenues evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to value-based arrangements?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group emphasized that premium revenues from risk-based products comprised nearly 80% of total consolidated revenues, with Optum Health negotiating value-based arrangements where it received a fixed percentage of third-party payers' premiums to cover defined portions of medical costs. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, noting that value-based arrangements at Optum Health involve receiving per-patient per-month premiums under single performance obligations, where revenues are recognized as health care services are made available. This evolution indicates a more structured and service-linked approach to value-based premium revenue recognition over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group has seen a notable evolution in the composition and risk assumption of its premium revenues, particularly in relation to value-based arrangements. The company has increasingly shifted toward value-based care models, where Optum Health enters into agreements with health plans to deliver, integrate, and control health care services for patients in exchange for per-patient per-month premiums. This shift reflects a broader industry trend toward value-based care, where providers are incentivized to improve patient outcomes while managing costs. As a result, the risk assumption in premium revenues has evolved, with UnitedHealth Group assuming more financial risk tied to the delivery of care outcomes rather than just the volume of services. This transition is evident in the company's financial disclosures, which highlight the growing significance of value-based arrangements in its revenue composition and risk profile.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Procter & Gamble stated that its long-term target for Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity was to maintain it at or above 90 percent, indicating a strategic focus on strong cash conversion relative to net earnings. By 2024, the company exceeded this target, reporting an Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity of 105%. This evolution suggests an improvement in the company's ability to generate cash relative to its net earnings, surpassing its own long-term benchmark. The increase from the targeted 90% to an actual 105% reflects enhanced efficiency in converting earnings into cash, despite the inclusion of significant non-cash charges such as the Gillette intangible asset impairment and foreign currency translation losses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, reported under 'Other measurement basis' in the investment table. By 2024, the company no longer provided a specific dollar value for nonmarketable investments but instead elaborated on the valuation methodology, stating that these investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. This shift indicates a move from quantitative disclosure to qualitative explanation without updating the specific value, suggesting a more opaque but methodologically clarified approach to reporting these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Texas Instruments' valuation methodology and disclosure around nonmarketable investments remained consistent in terms of measurement basis (cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments) and recognition of gains and losses in operating income. However, the 2024 disclosures included more detailed descriptions of the types of nonmarketable investments, such as interests in venture capital funds, and provided updated values for these investments. This indicates a continued commitment to transparency and alignment with accounting standards, reinforcing the company's disciplined and conservative approach to reporting nonmarketable assets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the unrecognized actuarial losses for Other Plans were $33 million, whereas in 2024, there was an unrecognized actuarial gain of $23 million. This represents a shift of $56 million from a loss position to a gain position, indicating a significant change in the underlying assumptions or market conditions affecting the valuation of these plans.",
      "llm_answer": "The unrecognized actuarial gains and losses for Other Plans decreased from a net loss of $689 million in 2023 to a net gain of $340 million in 2024. This significant shift indicates increased volatility in valuation assumptions or market conditions affecting these plans, likely driven by changes in discount rates and investment returns. The change reflects a reversal from actuarial losses in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in discount rates, to gains in 2024, primarily from an increase in discount rates and adjustments in demographic data and assumptions.",

By 2024, SPG provided concrete financial figures showing fixed lease income increased from $3,858,592 in 2022 to $4,145,288 in 2023, and further to $4,365,734 in 2024, indicating a consistent upward trend.

      "llm_answer": "The Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment experienced unchanged net sales in 2024 compared to the prior year, while organic sales growth was in the low single digits. This indicates a modest performance trajectory for the segment, with growth primarily driven by organic factors rather than acquisitions or foreign exchange impacts.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, the Gross Profit Rate increased by 65 basis points, primarily due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses, although partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant shift from a positive trend in 2022 to a negative impact in 2023, indicating a reversal in the trajectory of gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The Gross Profit Rate for Walmart decreased by 98 basis points between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.

      "question": "How did GM Financial's exposure to residual value changes in the leased vehicle portfolio evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about its risk management approach?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM Financial indicated that used vehicle prices were expected to decrease relative to 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. It also stated that no impairment indicators were present in the leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. By 2023, the company quantified the financial impact of a 1% relative change in estimated residual values at year-end, showing that such a shift could directly affect depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio. This evolution indicates a shift from a qualitative assessment of residual value risk in 2022 to a more quantitative and scenario-based analysis in 2023, suggesting a more refined risk management approach.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GM Financial's exposure to residual value changes in the leased vehicle portfolio decreased, as the estimated residual value of leased vehicles dropped from $29.1 billion in 2022 to $22.7 billion in 2023. This reduction reflects a decline in used vehicle prices compared to the high levels seen in 2021 and 2022, which had driven residual value increases. Despite this decline, GM Financial did not record any impairment charges in 2023, indicating a cautious and proactive risk management approach. The company regularly evaluates residual values and adjusts depreciation rates accordingly, ensuring that its financial statements reflect current market conditions and minimizing potential losses from residual value shortfalls.",

In 2024, however, the total revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased to $17,766 million from $15,563 million in 2023. This growth was driven by increases in both asset management fees (from $12,002 million to $13,875 million) and brokerage fees (from $3,561 million to $3,891 million). Thus, the segment shifted from a decline in 2023 to a significant recovery and growth in 2024.",

By 2024, the core sales decline had improved to (1.5)%, showing a substantial reduction in the rate of decline. This evolution suggests that the company's underlying business performance strengthened significantly year-over-year, with core operations stabilizing and nearing growth. The improvement from (10.0)% to (1.5)% indicates a positive shift in demand, pricing, or unit sales, despite the broader market or economic challenges.",

This indicates that the company's underlying business trends stabilized somewhat in 2024, particularly in the Diagnostics segment and in North America, despite ongoing challenges in high-growth markets like China and the Biotechnology segment. The partial recovery in the second half of 2024, especially in the bioprocessing business, suggests some resilience and potential for future growth as demand gradually improved.",

However, in 2024, Refined Product Sales slightly declined from 1,287 thousand barrels per day (MBD) to 1,286 MBD. This indicates a shift from growth to near stability in downstream sales performance between the two years.",

This minimal change indicates that Chevron's downstream operational performance in the U.S. remained relatively stable in terms of sales volumes during this period. However, the U.S. downstream earnings declined significantly due to lower margins and higher operating expenses, suggesting that while operational output was consistent, profitability was impacted by market and cost pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 44.6%, while in 2024 it decreased to 37.9%. This represents a decline of 6.7 percentage points, indicating a weakening in the company's profitability relative to revenue. The drop suggests that operating costs grew faster than revenue during this period, or that the company faced challenges such as lower pricing power, increased competition, or higher input costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 41.8% in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024, indicating a decline in profitability. This shift reflects lower revenue across key segments (Analog and Embedded Processing) and higher manufacturing costs, suggesting challenges in cost management and margin preservation amid declining sales volumes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reported no restructuring and related costs, indicating a period of relative stability or absence of major operational changes. However, in 2023, the company incurred $92 million in restructuring and related costs, signaling a renewed focus on organizational changes or cost optimization efforts. This shift suggests that the company initiated new restructuring activities in 2023 after a period of inactivity.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's restructuring and related costs decreased from $188 million in 2022 to $92 million in 2023. This reduction indicates that the company had largely completed or scaled back significant restructuring initiatives by 2023, allowing it to focus more on operational efficiency and leveraging growth in its core markets. The decline in restructuring costs also contributed to improved margins and earnings in 2023, reflecting a strategic shift toward stabilizing operations and capitalizing on higher sales volumes and favorable pricing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Canadian Segment Gross Margin Percentage increase was driven by improvements in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, contributing a combined positive impact of 35 basis points, partially offset by increased 2% rewards. In 2024, the same factors—core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—continued to positively influence the gross margin percentage, again contributing a combined 35 basis points, despite the same offsetting pressure from increased 2% rewards. This indicates a consistent upward trend in gross margin performance from these areas, with no material change in the magnitude of their contributions.",
      "llm_answer": "The Canadian Segment Gross Margin Percentage in 2024 increased primarily due to improvements in both core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary businesses. Specifically, the increase was driven by higher gross margins in core merchandise categories and growth in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. However, these gains were partially offset by increased 2% rewards. In 2023, the Canadian segment's gross margin was not explicitly detailed in terms of basis point contributions, but the overall gross margin for the company was negatively impacted by charges related to the discontinuation of charter shipping activities, which were absent in 2024.",

In 2024, the CAS pension cost decreased to $1,684 million, while the FAS pension service cost was $60 million, leading to a total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment of $1,624 million. This reflects a decrease in both the CAS pension cost and the operating adjustment, indicating a reduction in pension-related financial pressure on operations.",

This narrowing gap between CAS pension cost and the FAS pension service cost resulted in a slight decrease in the total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, from $1,660 million in 2023 to $1,624 million in 2024.

By 2024, the company clarified that fixed lease income included both fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM reimbursements recorded on a straight-line basis. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward stabilizing revenue streams by emphasizing predictable income components such as fixed minimums and CAM reimbursements, while reducing reliance on variable tenant-sales-based income.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on SPG's disclosures in 2023 and 2024, fixed lease income increased from $4,145.3 million in 2023 to $4,365.7 million in 2024, indicating a strategic focus on enhancing fixed minimum lease considerations and maintaining higher occupancy rates.

In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever. This suggests that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue has remained a key factor between 2023 and 2024, as the segment continues to rely on a combination of installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion. However, the shift from on-premises licensing to cloud-based Office 365 subscriptions has intensified, which suggests that while installed base growth remains important, the focus is increasingly on monetizing existing users through higher-value services and AI-driven productivity tools.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix's streaming revenues grew by 7% compared to the prior year, with paid net membership additions totaling 8,903 thousand. By 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained stable at 7%, but paid net membership additions surged dramatically, increasing by 232% to reach 29,529 thousand. This indicates a significant improvement in user acquisition in 2023 despite a similar revenue growth rate, suggesting more efficient scaling or successful new market penetration.",

This indicates a shift toward rapid subscriber growth rather than revenue acceleration, likely driven by expansion in lower-revenue regions and competitive pricing strategies, suggesting a strategic focus on market penetration over immediate revenue maximization.",

By 2024, Chevron maintained the same GHG intensity target of 24 kg CO₂e/boe but had increased its total lower-carbon investments to $7.7 billion since 2021, indicating a continued commitment to its 2028 targets and broader 2050 net zero upstream production aspiration. Additionally, in 2024, Chevron placed more emphasis on external dependencies like technology development and policy incentives to achieve its long-term goals, signaling a strategic shift toward integrating external enablers into its GHG reduction pathway.",

By 2024, the company maintained a similar estimation methodology but placed increased emphasis on the completeness and accuracy of data submitted to CMS, reflecting a more mature and refined process for capturing risk adjustment data. The 2024 disclosure also specifically highlights the role of both the company and healthcare providers in collecting, capturing, and submitting the necessary data within prescribed deadlines, suggesting a more collaborative and systematic approach to data submission compared to 2022.",

The company continues to estimate risk adjustment premium revenues based on data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS, but the process has become more complex due to heightened regulatory scrutiny. Risk adjustment data are subject to government review and audit by regulators, reflecting a growing focus on compliance and accuracy in data reporting.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM reported $356 million in unrecognized tax benefits that could favorably affect its future effective tax rate. In 2023, this amount increased to $386 million. This represents a $30 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, suggesting a slight upward trend in the company's potential tax savings in the future, though the company noted that it is still not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change in these benefits over the next twelve months.",
      "llm_answer": "The unrecognized tax benefits disclosed by GM decreased from $634 million at the end of 2022 to $585 million at the end of 2023. This reduction was primarily driven by a $98 million reduction in prior years' tax positions and a $20 million reduction due to the lapse of statutory limitations. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits may positively impact GM's future effective tax rate, as $386 million of the remaining unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2023, could favorably affect the effective tax rate if recognized.",

In 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained consistent at 7%, while the operating margin improved to 21%. This indicates that despite a similar pace of revenue growth, Netflix enhanced its profitability through better cost management or operational efficiencies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's streaming revenue growth rate slowed from 7% to 7%, remaining consistent, while its operating margin improved slightly from 18% to 21%. The stable revenue growth reflects a balance between increased average paying memberships and a slight decline in average monthly revenue per paying membership, partly due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a shift in plan mix. The improved operating margin indicates better cost management and revenue growth outpacing cost increases, suggesting a positive trajectory in financial efficiency despite challenges in revenue per user.",

By 2023, Chevron had already spent $6.5 billion on lower-carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022. This indicates significant progress toward its 2028 target and suggests an acceleration in implementation, particularly in scaling lower-carbon business lines such as renewable fuels.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group listed 'medical costs payable' as a key component of its short-term cash requirements, indicating it was a primary liability to be settled within twelve months through cash flows from operations and available cash. The company emphasized that it expected to meet these obligations using operational cash flows and did not foresee liquidity issues due to its strong capital position. By 2024, the treatment of medical costs payable shifted to being a central focus in the company's accounting estimates and judgments, specifically under 'Use of Estimates' in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Here, medical costs payable was described as one of the most significant estimates requiring complex assumptions due to its inherent uncertainty and likelihood of change over time. The 2024 disclosure also highlighted that changes in estimates for medical costs payable were recognized in earnings during the period of adjustment, indicating a more dynamic and potentially volatile nature compared to the more static view in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, UnitedHealth Group's treatment and estimation of medical costs payable remained consistent in methodology but evolved in terms of cash impact and accounting implications. The company continued to use actuarial models to estimate medical costs payable, considering factors like claim processing lags, completion factors, and medical cost trends. However, the cash flows from operating activities showed a decrease in favorable development of medical costs, from $1.7 billion in 2021 to $1.4 billion in 2024. This evolution affected the company's cash requirements, as medical costs payable adjustments contributed to operating cash flows, with a reduction in the net change in medical costs payable from $4,053 million in 2022 to $2,503 million in 2024, reflecting tighter cost management or more accurate initial estimates.",

The facility had no financial covenants, was unsecured, and fees to maintain it were described as immaterial. In 2023, the Company entered into a new $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility in February 2023, which replaced the May 2018 facility. The terms remained largely consistent, with no financial covenants, unsecured status, and multiple interest rate alternatives. Again, fees to maintain the facility were disclosed as immaterial.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed a 2% increase to sales, reflecting higher costs being transferred to customers. By 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of 1% on sales, indicating a reversal in this dynamic. This shift suggests that LIN experienced a change in its cost structure or pricing strategy, where rising costs were no longer fully recoverable through pricing adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of cost pass-through on sales shifted from a positive contributor to a neutral or negative factor. In 2022 (as reflected in the 2021 vs. 2020 data), cost pass-through contributed positively to sales growth in the Americas (3%) and EMEA (6%), indicating that Linde successfully passed on rising costs to customers, maintaining margins. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had turned into a drag on sales in the Americas (-1%) and EMEA (-4%), while only slightly contributing in APAC (1%). This suggests that Linde faced challenges in maintaining pricing power as costs increased, potentially due to competitive pressures or customer resistance, indicating a shift in pricing dynamics toward a more cost-sensitive market environment.",

However, in fiscal 2024, these costs surged by 157.4% in dollar terms, rising from $20.2 million to $52.0 million. This indicates that while the company was able to manage these costs effectively in 2023, it faced significant cost pressures in 2024, undermining earlier efficiency gains.",
      "llm_answer": "Starbucks' product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 31.7% in fiscal 2023 to 30.9% in fiscal 2024, a reduction of 80 basis points. This decline was primarily driven by the impact of increased pricing and reduced supply chain costs. This trend suggests effective cost management, as the company was able to lower its product and distribution costs relative to revenue, despite rising operational expenses in other areas like store partner wages and benefits. The reduction in these costs indicates that Starbucks successfully leveraged pricing strategies and supply chain efficiencies to maintain cost discipline.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM's net warranty expense was $2,592 million, composed of $2,593 million in warranties issued and assumed, $-261 million in supplier recoveries, and $260 million in adjustments and other. In 2023, this figure increased significantly to $4,778 million, driven by a substantial rise in warranties issued and assumed (from $2,593 million to $3,282 million) and a dramatic increase in adjustments and other (from $260 million to $1,493 million). The supplier recoveries also shifted slightly from a negative $261 million in 2022 to a positive $3 million in 2023, indicating a reversal in net recovery position. This represents a significant transformation in GM's net warranty expense.",
      "llm_answer": "GM's net warranty expense increased significantly from $2,606 million in 2021 to $4,778 million in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a substantial rise in warranties issued and assumed in the period, which rose from $4,485 million in 2021 to $3,282 million in 2023. Additionally, adjustments to pre-existing warranties increased from $296 million in 2021 to $1,493 million in 2023, further contributing to the overall increase in net warranty expense. Supplier recoveries also shifted from a negative impact of $2,175 million in 2021 to a minimal negative impact of $3 million in 2023, indicating a reduced offset to the warranty charges.",

This increase was driven by intangible asset impairment charges in 2024, the impact of recent acquisitions, and a loss on the termination of a commercial arrangement. While these factors indicate some challenges in cost management efficiency, the increase was partially offset by non-recurring 2023 charges, suggesting that the trend may not be entirely indicative of ongoing inefficiencies.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through was described as a positively impacting factor due to Linde's long-term contracts that allowed for the transfer of energy and feedstock cost fluctuations to customers, contributing to stable cash flow. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact, contributing to a (1)% change in sales. This shift indicates a change in the effectiveness or direction of cost pass-through mechanisms, possibly due to market conditions or contract renegotiations, affecting Linde's pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through mechanisms on Linde's sales shifted from a positive contributor to a negative one. In 2022, cost pass-through increased sales by 5%, reflecting the company's ability to pass on higher energy and feedstock costs to customers. However, by 2024, cost pass-through decreased sales by 1%, indicating that energy cost variances were lower and had minimal impact on operating profit. This shift suggests that Linde's pricing dynamics had evolved, with the company increasingly relying on price attainment and productivity gains rather than cost pass-through to drive profitability.",

      "question": "How has Verizon's treatment of overage usage revenue evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of how it recognizes revenue for postpaid wireless plans with usage that exceeds monthly allowances?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Verizon recognized overage usage revenue for postpaid wireless plans on a month-to-month basis as the customer exercised their option for incremental services beyond their monthly allowance. In 2024, this recognition method remained consistent; however, the company placed increased emphasis on the month-to-month nature of these overage fees, reinforcing that they are recognized only when the customer actually uses the service beyond the plan's allowance. While the core revenue recognition principle remained unchanged, the 2024 disclosure provided more explicit language around the timing and conditions of overage fee recognition, indicating a subtle refinement in how the company communicates its policy, rather than a substantive accounting change.",
      "llm_answer": "Verizon's treatment of overage usage revenue for postpaid wireless plans remained consistent between 2023 and 2024. In both years, overage usage is recognized as incremental service fees when the customer exercises the option, typically on a month-to-month basis. There is no indication of a change in this revenue recognition approach in the provided documents.",

In 2024, the company instead stated that unamortized ITCs 'impact' regulatory liabilities, suggesting a broader, potentially more indirect influence rather than a primary attribution.

However, in 2023, the company disclosed restructuring and related costs totaling $10 million, signaling a shift toward active restructuring efforts.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed 2% to the year-over-year sales growth, indicating that rising costs were at least partially transferred to customers. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on the year-over-year sales comparison, suggesting that either cost pressures eased or LIN was less able to pass through cost increases to customers. This shift reflects a reversal in the company's cost pass-through dynamics, moving from a supportive factor to a slight drag on sales growth.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through on sales shifted from a positive contributor to a negative one. In 2022, cost pass-through increased sales by 3% in the Americas, 6% in EMEA, and 2% in APAC, indicating that Linde was effectively passing on higher energy costs to customers through contractual billing. However, by 2024, cost pass-through decreased sales by 1%, suggesting that Linde was either reducing the extent of cost pass-through or facing challenges in passing on costs to customers. This shift indicates improved cost management dynamics, as Linde likely absorbed some cost pressures or implemented productivity initiatives to mitigate inflationary effects, thereby reducing reliance on cost pass-through to sustain sales.",

However, the growth rates for specific segments changed over time. In 2022, the Consumer Credit segment grew by 17% globally, while in 2024, this growth rate slowed to 6%. Similarly, the Commercial segment saw an increase in growth rate, from 29% in 2022 to 12% in 2024 globally.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, CVX reported current-year dry hole expenditures of $83 million, while in 2023, this figure increased significantly to $326 million. This represents a more than threefold increase in dry hole costs year-over-year. The substantial rise in dry hole expenditures suggests that CVX experienced a notable increase in unsuccessful exploration activities in 2023 compared to the prior year, indicating a higher exploration risk profile during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "CVX's current-year dry hole expenditures increased from $83 million in 2021 to $326 million in 2023, with a notable jump from $83 million in 2021 to $309 million in 2022, and then to $326 million in 2023. This upward trend in dry hole expenditures indicates an increased level of exploration activity and, consequently, a higher exploration risk profile during this period. The rise suggests that Chevron was undertaking more exploration projects, some of which did not yield commercially viable results, thereby reflecting a more aggressive or expanded exploration strategy.",

Additionally, Pfizer noted that approximately 75% of the expected $700 million in separation costs had been incurred by the end of 2021. By 2023, the Upjohn Business was formally defined in the glossary as 'Pfizer's former global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business,' which had been spun-off on November 16, 2020, and combined with Mylan to create Viatris. This shift indicates a move from active financial tracking and cost reporting to a more historical and definitional reference, suggesting the integration and separation process had largely concluded by 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Pfizer's relationship with the Upjohn Business remained unchanged in terms of financial reporting structure and strategic positioning, as the Upjohn Business had already been spun off in the fourth quarter of 2020.

By 2023, Automotive Interest Expense decreased to $911 million, but Automotive Financing - GM Financial Interest Expense rose sharply to $4,685 million, resulting in a total interest expense of $5,596 million. This shift shows that the proportion of interest costs attributed to GM Financial increased significantly, suggesting a greater reliance on financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022.",

This shift indicates a growing reliance on GM Financial's financing operations, which likely reflects the company's strategy to expand its financial services segment and manage liquidity through higher debt utilization in its automotive financing arm. The overall increase in total interest expense from $3,868 million in 2022 to $5,596 million in 2023 suggests a more leveraged financial structure driven by GM Financial's debt growth.",

In contrast, by 2024, the cost of wireless equipment surged to $26,100 million, with $21,259 million attributed to the Consumer segment and $4,841 million to the Business segment. This significant increase of over $21 billion indicates a major shift in strategy, likely tied to increased investment in or sales of wireless equipment.",
      "llm_answer": "The cost of wireless equipment decreased from $4,959 million in 2023 to $4,841 million in 2024, representing a reduction of $118 million. This decline is primarily attributed to a lower volume of wireless devices sold, driven by fewer upgrades and phone activations. This trend suggests a strategic shift toward higher-priced equipment in the mix of devices sold, indicating an effort to optimize margins rather than volume in the wireless equipment segment.",

      "original_answer": "The approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under IBM's publicly announced program remained unchanged at $2,007,611,768 in both 2022 and 2024. This indicates that, despite the two-year interval, the company's remaining repurchase capacity under the program did not change in dollar terms.",
      "llm_answer": "The approximate dollar value of shares available for repurchase under IBM's publicly announced program remained unchanged at $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, and continued at the same amount as of December 31, 2024. This suggests that IBM has not utilized any of the authorized funds for repurchases during this period, potentially indicating a suspension or strategic pause in its stock repurchase activities, as noted in the documents.",

By 2023, the net figure for Other Income and Expense was $392 million, which included contributions from various components such as interest income ($27 million), AFUDC equity ($197 million), post-in-service equity returns ($34 million), and nonoperating income, other ($134 million). This indicates a shift in the composition of the net income, with AFUDC equity and nonoperating income, other playing significant roles in 2023 compared to the 2022 drivers.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Duke Energy's \"Other Income and Expense, Net\" increased from $392 million to $598 million. In 2023, the increase was primarily driven by coal ash insurance litigation proceeds at Duke Energy Progress, lower non-service pension costs, and unrealized gains on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at Duke Energy Florida.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer defined Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. By 2023, the definition changed to exclude amortization of intangible assets instead of purchase accounting for acquisitions, along with acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. This indicates a shift in the nature of adjustments being emphasized in the metric's calculation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the definition of Pfizer's Adjusted Cost of Sales evolved by removing the exclusion of \"purchase accounting adjustments\" (such as incremental charges from the sale of acquired inventory written up to fair value) and \"certain acquisition-related items\" (like transaction and integration costs). In 2023, these items were no longer excluded, as the Adjusted Cost of Sales now excludes only amortization of intangible assets, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. This change reflects a shift in how Pfizer accounts for acquisition-related costs in its non-GAAP financial reporting.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MO's total oral tobacco products held a retail share of 42.5%, which declined to 37.5% in 2024. This indicates a weakening in the company's competitive position in the oral tobacco segment over this period. Specific brands like Copenhagen and Skoal experienced notable declines, with Copenhagen dropping from 23.5% to 19.1%, and Skoal from 9.3% to 7.6%. While on! saw an increase from 6.8% to 8.3%, it was not enough to offset the overall decline.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the retail share of MO's oral tobacco products declined from 42.5% to 37.5%, primarily due to significant share losses in moist snuff tobacco (MST) products, partially offset by growth in the nicotine pouch segment. This decline indicates a weakening competitive position in the MST category, likely due to shifting consumer preferences toward nicotine pouches, which grew to 42.9% of the oral tobacco market in 2024. While the on! brand maintained a presence in the nicotine pouch category, its share decreased slightly, reflecting increased competition in this emerging segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx's pension plan assumptions included future salary increases as a key component in calculating the projected benefit obligation, which stood at $28.7 billion. By 2024, while the company continued to disclose pension plan assumptions, it emphasized a strategic shift by closing its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees starting 2020 and introducing an enhanced 401(k) plan with an 8% company match. This indicates a reduced emphasis on defined benefit plans and a shift toward defined contribution plans, suggesting a moderation in long-term salary-linked pension liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, FedEx's assumptions regarding future salary increases for pension plan obligations evolved slightly, with the rate of increase in future compensation levels used to determine the benefit obligation rising from 5.11% in 2022 to 5.29% in 2024. This indicates a modestly more optimistic outlook on long-term compensation growth for pension-eligible employees, although the changes are relatively small, suggesting a cautious and stable approach to long-term compensation expectations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of stock-settled PSUs issued prior to 2013 received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to retained earnings. However, by 2024, the company clarified that recipients of stock-settled PSUs authorized beginning in 2013 receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense, rather than retained earnings, and these are paid at the time of settlement. This reflects a shift in both the timing and accounting treatment of dividend equivalents for newer PSU grants.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment of dividend equivalents for stock-settled performance share units (PSUs) remained consistent in terms of accounting and settlement timing. Recipients of stock-settled PSUs authorized for future grants since 2013 receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense while the PSUs are unvested. These dividend equivalents are paid at the time of settlement, which occurs following the conclusion of the three-year performance period.

In 2024, the year-over-year growth was lower at 5.9%, amounting to approximately $393.4 million (from $4,446,461 thousand to $4,839,816 thousand). This indicates a slight slowdown in the rate of revenue growth despite a larger absolute dollar increase in 2024.",

The absolute dollar growth in streaming revenues was $4,829,817 million during this period. This growth was driven by an increase in paid memberships and favorable hedging impacts of $124 million included in 2024's streaming revenues.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BK's Other Segment included corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments, and certain business exits. By 2024, the segment continued to include corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, and certain business exits; however, 'renewable energy' was replaced with 'tax credit investments' as a highlighted component. This indicates a strategic shift in the types of corporate investments being emphasized within the Other Segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD's provisions during the period were $106 million, while in 2024, they increased significantly to $213 million. This indicates a doubling of provisions over the two-year period, suggesting that AMD faced greater financial commitments or anticipated higher liabilities in 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "AMD's provisions for product warranties increased from $106 million in 2022 to $213 million in 2024, indicating a growing financial commitment to address potential product defects and customer claims over time. This increase suggests that AMD may have expanded its product offerings or extended warranty terms, leading to higher anticipated warranty costs. The trend reflects an increase in the company's liabilities related to post-sale product support.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and disclosure of the current and deferred income tax impact on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of the company's rationale for excluding these impacts?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the income tax expense (benefit) on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using applicable tax rates in relevant jurisdictions and included both current and deferred tax amounts. The rationale for excluding purchase accounting impacts focused on the merger of equals structure, geographic management approach, and the need for comparability across segments and with peers. By 2024, the company retained the same technical explanation for the tax impact but added specificity to its rationale by referencing the 2018 business combination explicitly, reinforcing the long-standing nature of the merger and its ongoing influence on financial reporting. This evolution indicates a more detailed contextualization of the merger's lasting effects on financial disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the treatment and disclosure of the current and deferred income tax impact on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments remained consistent in rationale but evolved in magnitude. The company continues to exclude these impacts because they arise from purchase accounting adjustments related to the 2018 merger of equals with Linde AG, which are non-cash and not reflective of ongoing business performance. Management emphasizes that excluding these impacts provides a clearer view of operational performance, as the adjustments vary significantly across geographies and affect comparability. In 2024, the total tax adjustments increased to $258 million compared to $534 million in 2022, reflecting changes in the underlying pre-tax adjustments and applicable tax rates.",

Additionally, the carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $344.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with tower portfolio and network location intangible assets valued at $916.2 million and $243.6 million, respectively. By 2024, the Company finalized a review of estimated useful lives of its tower assets, extending the depreciation period from 20 to 30 years, which led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year. This change in accounting estimate reflects a shift in the long-term valuation and treatment of the India reporting unit's assets.",

In 2023, a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million was recorded for the India reporting unit due to its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value, as determined during a strategic review. Additionally, in 2023, the India reporting unit had previously recorded impairments on fixed and intangible assets, including a $97.0 million impairment on tower and network location intangible assets and a $411.6 million impairment on tenant-related intangible assets, primarily due to payment issues with VIL. In 2024, no further goodwill impairment was recorded for the India reporting unit, as its fair value was in excess of its carrying amount, indicating some recovery or stabilization in its valuation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD benefited from the FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) tax benefit, which contributed $147 million to its income tax provision. By 2024, the impact of FDII had evolved due to a change in U.S. tax regulations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures instead of deducting them as incurred. This change increased taxable income in 2024 and 2023, which in turn increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit, indicating a growing influence of FDII on AMD's tax position despite no direct benefit amount being disclosed for 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) tax benefit on AMD's taxable income increased between 2022 and 2024, primarily due to the capitalization and amortization of R&D expenditures mandated by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This change in U.S. tax regulations caused an increase in taxable income for 2024 and 2023, which in turn made more income eligible for the FDII tax benefit. The FDII deduction decreased from $261 million in 2022 to $185 million in 2023 and further to $275 million in 2024, reflecting its evolving impact on taxable income.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense. This applied particularly to PSUs with performance periods beginning before 2018, where recipients received dividend equivalents only after the performance period ended and until settlement. For PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received accrued reinvested dividend equivalents, which were paid at the time of settlement. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted to stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs), where most recipients received either a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to retained earnings. Additionally, the grant date fair market value of RSUs that did not receive a dividend equivalent was adjusted to reflect the net present value of estimated dividends not received. This represents a shift from cash-settled to stock-settled instruments with distinct implications for dividend equivalent treatment and financial accounting.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips continued its practice of providing dividend equivalents or accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for unvested restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs). In both years, recipients of unvested stock-settled RSUs generally received cash payments of dividend equivalents or accrued reinvested dividend equivalents, which were charged to retained earnings or compensation expense. The financial impact remained consistent, with the company recognizing compensation expenses related to these dividend equivalents as part of its share-based compensation programs. Notably, in 2024, the weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted increased compared to 2023, which could influence the future financial impact of dividend equivalents as more higher-valued awards vest.",

In 2024, the company disclosed that it had implemented foreign exchange hedging strategies that directly impacted its streaming revenues. Specifically, hedging gains of $124 million were included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year ended December 31, 2024. This indicates that while the core streaming revenue growth trajectory remained positive, the company actively managed foreign exchange risk in 2024, which contributed an incremental $124 million to its reported streaming revenues.",

By fiscal 2024, this impact increased significantly to a pre-tax income of $177 million, driven by additional realized gains on contingent consideration.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron described crude oil liftings as a factor that 'impacted' its forward-looking statements, indicating an external influence among many others. By 2024, the company shifted its language to state that its forward-looking statements 'depend on' crude oil liftings, placing it among a narrower group of critical factors affecting outcomes. This change in phrasing indicates a more direct and central framing of crude oil liftings in relation to the company's projections, though the document does not quantify or elaborate on the extent of this dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's characterization of the relationship between crude oil liftings and its forward-looking statements has evolved from 2022 to 2024 by emphasizing increased uncertainty and expanding the range of factors affecting liftings. In 2022, the 10-K listed \"timing of crude oil liftings\" as a factor influencing forward-looking statements, but in 2024, it was expanded to \"timing of crude oil liftings\" alongside additional uncertainties such as geopolitical conflicts (e.g., Russia-Ukraine, Middle East), supply chain disruptions, and the impact of the Hess Corporation transaction. This evolution reflects a broader acknowledgment of external risks and complexities affecting crude oil liftings and their implications for forward-looking guidance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, gasoline costs were described as a negative impact on Costco's business, with rising energy prices contributing to adverse effects on demand, cost of inventory, and operational expenses. The company expressed concerns about its ability to pass on these cost increases without negatively affecting consumer demand. By 2024, however, the framing shifted: gasoline cost fluctuations were described as a factor influencing comparable sales growth, indicating that Costco had begun to treat gasoline price volatility not just as a cost burden, but as a lever affecting sales performance and potentially pricing strategy. This evolution shows that gasoline costs became a more integral, strategic variable in Costco's financial dynamics, rather than solely a risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, gasoline costs had a notable impact on Costco's financial performance, particularly in terms of net sales and gross margin. Rising gasoline prices in 2024 contributed to higher net sales growth, as increased traffic from the gasoline business drove more customer visits to warehouses. However, this also led to a lower gross margin percentage due to the inherently lower-margin nature of gasoline sales. The company acknowledged that while gasoline sales enhance traffic and leverage SG&A expenses, they dilute overall gross margin. This indicates that Costco's financial performance remains sensitive to gasoline price fluctuations, though the company strategically leverages this business to drive broader retail sales and member engagement.",

By 2024, these figures increased to $88,461 million for the Lower 48 and $11,274 million for the Asia Pacific/Middle East, indicating a significant increase in investment concentration in the Lower 48 and a modest increase in the Asia Pacific/Middle East.

      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips' (COP) proved property investments in the Lower 48 region increased significantly, with a rise in productive oil and gas wells and higher capitalized costs. In contrast, the Asia Pacific/Middle East region showed a modest increase in productive oil wells but remained relatively stable in terms of overall investment and capitalized costs. The Lower 48 became a stronger focus for COP's operations, reflecting increased drilling and development activities, while the Asia Pacific/Middle East region maintained a consistent but smaller footprint in COP's global portfolio.",

By 2024, these impairment charges surged to $2.9 billion, indicating a significant increase in the write-down of intangible assets, particularly IPRD. This evolution reflects a more aggressive reassessment of asset valuations, likely due to changing market conditions, regulatory challenges, or internal strategic shifts.

However, the net settlement exposure still rose, suggesting that the growth in gross exposure outpaced the additional risk mitigation.",

However, the company also increased its risk mitigation arrangements from $12,167 million to $13,466 million during the same period, which suggests that Mastercard is actively managing its exposure.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Converse's direct to consumer revenues increased by 22%, driven by strong digital demand, while wholesale revenues decreased by 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China and global supply chain constraints. By fiscal 2024, both channels experienced declines: direct to consumer revenues decreased by 14% on a currency-neutral basis, mainly due to reduced traffic in North America and Western Europe, and wholesale revenues fell by 16%, driven by declines across all geographies. The shift from growth to decline in direct to consumer and the deepening of the wholesale decline reflect changing market dynamics and increased promotional activity that reduced ASP by 3% in fiscal 2024.",

DTC revenues decreased by 14% on a currency-neutral basis in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, driven by declines in North America and Western Europe due to reduced traffic, partially offset by growth in Asia. Wholesale revenues also declined by 16% on a currency-neutral basis in fiscal 2024, with declines across all geographies. The key drivers of these changes included increased promotional activity in DTC, which reduced average selling prices (ASPs), and broader market challenges impacting both channels.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group highlighted its cash and investment balances, including $21.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and emphasized that fluctuations in asset values would not materially impact liquidity due to strong operating cash flows and access to credit facilities. Medical costs payable were part of the short-term obligations expected to be covered through operational cash flows and available liquidity. In 2023, the company placed greater emphasis on the estimation methodology for medical costs payable, noting that these estimates require complex assumptions and are inherently uncertain, often changing in subsequent periods. The 2023 disclosure also explicitly tied changes in estimates directly to earnings in the period they are adjusted, signaling a more dynamic and risk-sensitive approach to financial reporting around medical liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, UnitedHealth Group refined its estimation of medical costs payable by enhancing its actuarial models and incorporating more detailed data on claim trends, completion factors, and medical cost trends. In 2023, the company emphasized the use of consistent, centralized, and automated actuarial processes to estimate incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, factoring in variables such as seasonal variances, membership demographics, and benefit plan changes. Additionally, the company improved its risk management approach by closely monitoring claim submission patterns and adjusting estimates as more complete claim data became available. These adjustments were reflected in the financial statements, with medical costs payable increasing by $3.48 billion in 2023 compared to $4.05 billion in 2022, indicating a more conservative and data-driven estimation process.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), transitioning from a partial owner to full ownership. This marked a significant shift in strategic involvement, as disclosed in the 2024 filing. The acquisition was funded through new debt issuance of $2.7 billion, increasing total debt from $16.6 billion in 2022 to $18.9 billion by the end of 2023. This reflects a transformation from a shared-operational model to full control, which likely influenced capital allocation decisions, including the planned $9 billion return of capital in 2024, signaling confidence in the company’s post-acquisition financial positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "ConocoPhillips fully acquired Surmont in October 2023 by purchasing the remaining 50% working interest from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for approximately $2.7 billion in cash, funded through new long-term debt. This acquisition increased ConocoPhillips' ownership in Surmont to 100%. The transaction had significant financial implications, including a $2.3 billion increase in total debt to $18.9 billion by December 31, 2023. Additionally, the company extended the weighted average maturity of its debt portfolio and reduced near-term maturities through refinancing activities. The Surmont acquisition added approximately $2.9 billion in proved properties and $0.2 billion in unproved properties to ConocoPhillips' asset base.",

This indicates an improvement in cost efficiency, as the company reduced its costs relative to revenue in this segment over the period.",

This indicates a marginal decline in cost efficiency for this segment, as the cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased slightly, likely due to higher employee-related costs and service delivery expenses.",

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with current content liabilities remaining unchanged at $4.5 billion, but non-current content liabilities decreased to $2.6 billion.

However, by fiscal 2024, Converse revenues had decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This decline was primarily attributed to drops in North America and Western Europe, with combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales down 12%, driven largely by a decrease in wholesale. Additionally, average selling price (ASP) fell by 3%, mainly due to increased promotional activity in the direct-to-consumer channel.",
      "llm_answer": "Converse's revenue declined by 14% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, and by 8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, indicating a worsening financial trajectory. The primary factors contributing to this decline included reduced wholesale and direct-to-consumer sales, driven by lower unit sales and decreased average selling prices (ASP), particularly due to increased promotional activity in the direct-to-consumer channel. Additionally, gross margin contraction, partly due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes and lower full-price ASP, further impacted profitability.",

By 2024, the company had already spent $7.7 billion on lower carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022, reaffirming its commitment to the same $10 billion total target through 2028. This indicates that Chevron has maintained its long-term capital commitment to lower carbon initiatives, while accelerating spending in the early years, particularly through strategic acquisitions that support its broader decarbonization goals.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's planned capital allocation for lower carbon investments increased from $10 billion through 2028 as announced in 2021, with $7.7 billion spent by 2024, including $2.9 billion for the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group (REG) in 2022.

By 2024, this amount increased significantly to $110 million total liabilities, with $69 million current and $41 million non-current. This indicates a substantial increase in Alabama Power's risk exposure tied to regulatory hedging instruments over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Alabama Power's derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes increased from $7 million to $23 million. This increase indicates a rise in the company's exposure to energy price volatility, as these liabilities are related to hedging activities for fuel costs. The growth in liabilities suggests that Alabama Power has expanded or extended its hedging strategies, potentially to manage greater uncertainty or longer-term price risks in its fuel procurement.",

This signaled a strategic move to enhance decision-making tools in biopharma services. By 2024, the segment's revenues increased slightly from $23.041 billion to $23.157 billion, indicating a continuation and consolidation of prior strategic initiatives, though no new major acquisitions were disclosed for that year.

      "llm_answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific's Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment saw a slight revenue increase from 2023 to 2024 (1% growth), with organic revenue remaining flat due to growth in research and clinical research businesses offset by reduced demand for COVID-19-related activities. In terms of acquisitions, the segment acquired CorEvitas, LLC in August 2023 to enhance real-world evidence solutions for drug development.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Tire Installation was listed among other warehouse ancillary services, but it was embedded within a broader list that included gasoline, pharmacy, optical, and food court services. By 2024, Tire Installation was explicitly called out as a distinct category under warehouse ancillary services, indicating a more deliberate emphasis on its importance. This evolution suggests that Costco may have elevated the strategic positioning of Tire Installation, potentially aligning it more closely with core member services to drive traffic or enhance the value proposition for members.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's treatment and positioning of Tire Installation within its business model remained consistent between 2022 and 2024, as it continued to be classified under the \"Warehouse Ancillary\" category, which includes services like gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, and hearing aids. In both years, Tire Installation was positioned as a complementary service designed to enhance member convenience and encourage more frequent visits to Costco warehouses. No significant changes in emphasis or strategic positioning of Tire Installation were noted in the provided documents for this period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, Linde plc reported income from equity investments at $119 million, with an adjusted figure of $231 million, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in APAC effective January 1, 2021. By 2024, the reported income from equity investments had stabilized at $170 million, with values of $167 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022. This represents a decrease from the adjusted 2021 level but shows relative stability in recent years. The earlier increase in 2021 was partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge in the third quarter of that year related to an APAC joint venture, while the more recent figures suggest a normalization following the structural change in 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde plc's income from equity investments increased from $119 million in 2021 to $170 million in 2024, reflecting a notable upward trend. The key change in composition was driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in the APAC segment, which shifted from being part of sales to being reflected in equity income starting in 2021. Despite some fluctuations, such as a $35 million impairment charge in 2021, the overall growth in equity investment income was sustained through 2024.",

By 2023, Booking Holdings reclassified these indirect taxes into 'Sales and other expenses' to align with a presentation that reflects costs more closely tied to revenue changes. This reclassification affected the composition of the metric, although it did not impact previously reported Revenue, Operating income, Income before income taxes, or Net income for 2022 or 2021.",

This reclassification was implemented to better align the presentation with costs that vary based on revenue changes. As a result, Sales and Other Expenses increased from $1,818 million in 2022 to $1,986 million in 2023, while General and Administrative expenses decreased from $934 million to $766 million.

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with $4.5 billion in current content liabilities, $2.6 billion in non-current content liabilities, and $14.6 billion in off-balance-sheet obligations. This reflects a minor shift in the composition of obligations, with a small decrease in non-current liabilities offset by a slight increase in off-balance-sheet commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix's content obligations slightly decreased from $21.8 billion to $21.7 billion. On-balance-sheet obligations (comprising current and non-current content liabilities) remained relatively stable, decreasing marginally from $7.6 billion in 2022 to $7.1 billion in 2023. Off-balance-sheet obligations, which represent future commitments not yet meeting recognition criteria, decreased from $14.2 billion in 2022 to $14.6 billion in 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the table summarizing derivative assets and liabilities covered the periods ending December 31, 2023 and 2022. By 2024, this table was updated to cover the periods ending December 31, 2024 and 2023. This reflects a forward progression in the reporting periods included for derivative instruments, maintaining a two-year comparative structure but shifting the most recent year from 2022 to 2023 in the comparison.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the presentation and categorization of derivative liabilities within \"Changes in Other Liabilities\" evolved in the time periods covered in the summarized tables. In 2023, the fair values of derivative liabilities were reported as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, with the net exposure for derivative liabilities at $2,335 million as of December 31, 2023. By 2024, the reporting period was updated to include data as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, with the net exposure for derivative liabilities reduced to $1,728 million as of December 31, 2024. This shift reflects updated derivative positions and adjustments in netting and collateral impacts over the one-year period.",

By 2023, the company no longer disclosed production from Australia and instead focused entirely on domestic U.S. assets, including the Delaware Basin (537 MBOED), Eagle Ford (226 MBOED), Midland Basin (182 MBOED), Bakken (106 MBOED), and Other (16 MBOED), totaling 1,067 MBOED.

Correspondingly, the overall output volume from Norway decreased from 135 MBOED in 2022 to 115 MBOED in 2023, reflecting a decline in crude oil and natural gas production.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Life Sciences Solutions segment reported $105 million in earnings, while in 2024, this figure decreased to $69 million. This indicates a decline in the segment's financial performance year-over-year. The drop from $105 million to $69 million suggests a reduced contribution to the company's consolidated results, signaling a potential challenge or strategic shift affecting this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Life Sciences Solutions segment experienced a significant decline in financial performance from 2023 to 2024, with revenues dropping by 26% from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023, and segment income decreasing by 39% to $3,420 million. This decline was primarily driven by a moderation in COVID-19-related revenue and unfavorable volume pull-through, partially offset by productivity improvements and favorable pricing. As a result, the segment's contribution to the company's consolidated results weakened, highlighting its reduced impact on overall financial performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Honeywell detailed a specific methodology for estimating asbestos-related liabilities, including the use of average resolution values over a defined look-back period for both pending and future claims projected through 2059. The company also recorded probable insurance recoveries, factoring in the solvency status of insurers, and acknowledged the uncertainty in projections due to variables like future claims filing rates and disease classifications. By 2024, the disclosure became more generalized, focusing on the unpredictability of litigation outcomes and contingent liabilities without specifying the same detailed methodology. The 2024 filing emphasized broader uncertainties, including the potential impact of new developments, settlement strategies, and evidentiary requirements, but omitted the detailed actuarial assumptions present in the 2023 report.",
      "llm_answer": "Honeywell's disclosure regarding asbestos-related liabilities in 2024 shows a continued reliance on historical data and epidemiological projections to estimate future claims, with no significant changes in methodology from 2023. The company accrues for both pending and future claims based on average resolution values, claims filing experience, and dismissal rates, reviewing these assumptions annually. In terms of insurance recoveries, uncertainties remain, as some carriers are insolvent, and future recoveries could be higher or lower than projected. The 2024 disclosure emphasizes the inherent uncertainty in projecting future events and the company's ongoing reevaluation of probable recoveries based on changes in liability projections or recovery experience.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), bringing its ownership to 100%. By 2024, there was no indication of any divestiture or change in ownership of Surmont; however, the company disclosed plans to sell noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for approximately $400 million. This highlights a strategic contrast: while COP was acquiring core assets in Canada like Surmont in 2023, it was planning divestitures in other, noncore segments in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "ConocoPhillips fully acquired the Surmont asset in its Canada segment in October 2023 by purchasing the remaining 50% working interest from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for a total cash consideration of $3.0 billion (including $2,635 million in cash paid and $320 million in contingent consideration). By the end of 2024, the company had made $158 million in contingent payments under the arrangement, which ties to WCS pricing exceeding $52 per barrel. As a result, ConocoPhillips holds a 100% working interest in Surmont, with no further material changes to its ownership stake or financial commitment in 2024 beyond the initial acquisition and partial fulfillment of the contingent payment terms.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde excluded purchase accounting impacts from its non-GAAP measures, emphasizing that these adjustments were critical for investor understanding due to their uneven geographic impact and the fact that management and variable compensation were assessed based on results excluding these impacts. By 2024, purchase accounting impacts were explicitly included in the company's definition of segment operating profit, indicating a shift in how these impacts are communicated and evaluated internally and externally. This evolution reflects a more integrated approach to reporting these adjustments within segment performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Linde's treatment and disclosure of purchase accounting impacts remained consistent in their exclusion from segment operating profit and performance evaluation metrics. The company continues to exclude purchase accounting impacts—primarily depreciation and amortization from the Linde AG merger—because they affect geographic comparability and are not reflective of operational performance. Management evaluates performance and determines variable compensation based on results excluding these adjustments, as disclosed in both periods. In 2024, purchase accounting impacts reduced reported operating profit by $940 million, compared to $1,006 million in 2023, showing a slight decrease in magnitude but maintaining their role as a non-operational adjustment.",

This increase indicates that the company has continued to realize tax benefits from its stock-based compensation programs, likely due to higher stock-based compensation expenses and favorable tax treatment of these expenses.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $9.56, while in 2023 it decreased to $8.66. This represents a decline in the average revenue generated per membership, suggesting a potential shift in the company's pricing strategy or a change in the mix of membership plans offered. The decrease could also indicate efforts to attract more subscribers by offering lower-cost plans, as evidenced by the increase in paid memberships at the end of the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The average monthly revenue per paying membership decreased by 1% from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.64 in 2023. This slight decline suggests that the company experienced a shift in plan mix and higher membership growth in regions with lower average revenue per membership, partially offset by limited price increases.

The 2024 disclosures also included a breakdown of current and non-current portions of these derivatives, indicating a more detailed regulatory reporting structure compared to the general segment reporting in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Alabama Power's treatment of energy-related derivatives designated for regulatory purposes showed a modest increase in balance sheet liabilities. In 2023, the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet for these derivatives were $7 million in assets and $23 million in liabilities, while in 2024, the net amounts were $5 million in assets and $100 million in liabilities. This indicates a significant rise in regulatory liabilities, likely reflecting expanded hedging activities or changes in derivative positions. The regulatory reporting structure remained consistent, with derivatives designated for regulatory purposes being accounted for under the regulatory hedge method, where gains and losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities and later recognized in fuel expense as the hedged fuel is used.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Operating Income Excl. increased by 20.3%, driven by favorable pricing, a favorable comparison related to the Saudi Arabia customs assessments, and lower marketing, administration, and research costs (including a $45 million favorable comparison related to asset impairment and exit costs). However, this was partly offset by higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable volume/mix due to lower cigarette mix. In 2024, Operating Income Excl. increased by 25.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing and volume/mix driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. However, lower manufacturing costs were largely offset by higher marketing, administration, and research costs, and a favorable comparison to the prior year was noted due to the South Korea indirect tax charge of $204 million in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the factors contributing to Operating Income Excl. showed improvement, particularly in cost management and volume/mix impacts. In 2023, the Wellness and Healthcare segment reported a significant operating loss of $870 million, largely due to a goodwill impairment charge and higher administrative costs. By 2024, cost management improved across multiple regions, with lower marketing, administration, and research costs in SSEA, CIS & MEA and EA, AU & PMI DF, partly offsetting higher manufacturing costs. Volume/mix impacts also became more favorable, especially in HTU growth in Europe and SSEA, contributing positively to operating income. Overall, these improvements led to higher operating income in 2024 compared to 2023.",

      "question": "How has the composition and growth trajectory of Windows Commercial revenue evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in relation to security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and cloud services?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was described as being driven by demand for volume licensing, Software Assurance, and advanced security offerings such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on the number of information workers in enterprises rather than PC sales. By 2023, the revenue categorization expanded to include 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services,' explicitly listing Windows cloud services as a component alongside volume licensing. The inclusion of 'cloud services' in the 2023 breakdown indicates a strategic shift toward integrating cloud-based offerings into the Windows Commercial portfolio. This evolution suggests that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, as part of the broader cloud services, became more embedded within a diversified set of commercial offerings, aligning with the company's emphasis on cloud transformation and subscription-based models. The 2023 filing also introduced a formalized growth metric for this revenue segment, signaling a more structured approach to tracking and expanding this part of the business.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Windows Commercial revenue growth was driven by increased demand for volume licensing and advanced security offerings, including Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This growth was relatively independent of PC sales and reflected the expansion of cloud services and security solutions within the Windows ecosystem. The 2023 results highlighted a stronger emphasis on cloud-based security and enterprise mobility solutions, aligning with Microsoft's broader strategy to integrate security deeply into its cloud and operating system offerings.",

This suggests that Gulfstream has seen an expansion in the value of unexercised contract options and unfunded work under IDIQ contracts, which contributes to longer-term revenue potential despite the uncertainty around future funding.",
      "llm_answer": "The estimated potential contract value in Gulfstream's defense segments increased from $35.9 billion at the end of 2022 to $37.9 billion by December 31, 2023, reflecting a $2 billion growth. This upward trend indicates improved future revenue visibility for the defense segments, driven by new contract awards and the inclusion of unexercised options and potential funding under IDIQ contracts.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $14.56, showing a 9% increase compared to the previous year. By 2023, this metric had significantly declined to $8.66, reflecting a 2% increase year-over-year. This sharp drop indicates a major shift in Netflix's pricing strategy or market dynamics, such as a move toward more affordable plans, increased competition, or changes in regional pricing structures.",
      "llm_answer": "The average monthly revenue per paying membership decreased slightly by 1% from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.64 in 2023. This decline was primarily due to changes in plan mix and higher membership growth in regions with lower average revenue per membership, partially offset by limited price increases. This suggests that Netflix's pricing strategy in 2023 was more focused on expanding its global user base, particularly in lower-revenue regions, rather than aggressively raising prices. The slight dip in revenue per membership indicates a potential shift in market dynamics, where growth is being prioritized over immediate revenue maximization.",

In 2024, the company recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million specifically for the India reporting unit as of September 30, 2023.

By 2024, no goodwill impairment was recorded for the India reporting unit, as it had been divested through the ATC TIPL Transaction in September 2024.

In 2024, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix mainly from higher HTU volume, but partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a shift in growth drivers from broad pricing and volume gains across both product lines in 2023 to a more HTU-focused volume/mix benefit in 2024, with some moderation in pricing impact.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, PM's net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, showed positive growth driven by favorable pricing variance and volume/mix dynamics. In 2024, pricing variance was predominantly favorable, especially in combustible tobacco, and volume/mix improved due to higher cigarette and HTU volumes. This contrasts with 2023, where pricing variance was mixed or unfavorable in certain regions (e.g., Europe due to the German HTU surcharge), while volume/mix was generally favorable but less impactful. Overall, 2024 demonstrated stronger pricing and volume/mix contributions compared to 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $631 million, increased by $201 million, and ended the year at $658 million. In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, increased by $122 million, but after write-offs of $199 million and adjustments for foreign currency, ended at $577 million. This indicates a shift in inventory risk exposure, with a notable reduction in the allowance balance by the end of 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting either improved inventory management or a strategic reduction in inventory holdings.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses increased from $631 million at the beginning of 2023 to $658 million by the end of 2024. This indicates a relatively stable approach to inventory risk management, with IBM maintaining a consistent level of provisions for potential inventory losses despite slight fluctuations in additions and write-offs. The modest growth in the allowance suggests IBM is proactively managing inventory risks without significant deterioration in inventory quality or demand.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 42,802 thousand, while the average monthly revenue per membership rose slightly to $8.66. This indicates that Netflix experienced both subscriber growth and a modest increase in pricing, likely reflecting a combination of successful market expansion and strategic price adjustments.",

This indicates that Netflix experienced moderate subscriber growth during this period, primarily driven by international expansion, but faced challenges in maintaining or increasing pricing due to factors such as a shift in plan mix and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. The slight decline in revenue per membership suggests that the company's pricing strategy may have been less effective in 2023 compared to previous years, potentially due to market pressures or competitive dynamics.",

      "question": "How has Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does the change in decline rate suggest about its competitive positioning in the region?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe was 30.3%, down from 31.1% in 2022, reflecting a decline of 0.8 percentage points. In 2024, the cigarette market share remained unchanged at 30.3% compared to the prior year, indicating that the rate of decline slowed to zero. This suggests a potential stabilization in PM's cigarette business in Europe, which may reflect strategic adjustments or competitive responses to market pressures, including competition from heated tobacco products which saw continued growth in market share.",
      "llm_answer": "Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe declined slightly from 30.1% in 2023 to 30.3% in 2024, representing a 0.8 percentage point decrease compared to the prior year. However, the decline rate in 2024 appears to have slowed compared to previous years, suggesting that Philip Morris is maintaining a relatively stable competitive position in the region despite the overall shrinking cigarette market. This is further supported by the company's strong growth in heated tobacco units (HTUs), which helped offset some of the cigarette volume losses and contributed to a slight increase in total market share.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM described its business as 'depending on' client spending budgets, highlighting that a downturn in economic environment and client spending could impact its revenue and profit. In 2024, the company shifted its framing, describing the relationship as being 'impacted by' client spending budgets and economic conditions. This indicates a more passive but still significant sensitivity to external spending trends, suggesting a strategic reframing of how client budgets influence IBM's business outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, IBM's characterization of the relationship between client spending budgets and its business performance became more specific and forward-looking. In 2023, the focus was on the general impact of economic conditions and client spending on revenue and profit. By 2024, IBM emphasized the influence of client spending patterns in high-growth, high-competitive areas like AI and generative AI, highlighting the uncertainty of client adoption and the potential for emerging business models to affect demand and profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Mastercard classified its net revenues into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions, with the payment network primarily generating revenue from fees based on GDV (including both domestic and cross-border volume) and for providing switching and other network-related services. By 2024, the company consolidated its reporting into a single reportable operating segment called 'Payment Solutions,' which derives revenue from a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers, including access to the continuous payment network and value-added services either integrated or sold standalone. This evolution indicates a shift from a dual classification of revenue sources to a more unified segment reporting approach, where all activities are considered interrelated and supportive of each other.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Mastercard maintained a single reportable operating segment, \"Payment Solutions,\" with no material changes in segment reporting structure. However, revenue classification evolved slightly, with net revenue increasing from $25,098 million in 2023 to $28,167 million in 2024. The company continued to classify revenue into payment network and value-added services, with a focus on innovation in data, technology, and open banking solutions. Notably, Mastercard emphasized expanding its data infrastructure and enhancing payment rails to support new services, reflecting a strategic shift toward leveraging data and technology to drive growth in value-added offerings.",

By 2024, the segment's revenue sources were described as primarily coming from 'healthcare-related services' and internet services, suggesting a shift from general health technology toward more direct healthcare services. While internet services remained a consistent revenue contributor in both years, the evolution from 'health technology' to 'healthcare-related services' implies a more specialized or clinical orientation in the later year. This change may reflect a strategic pivot toward monetizable healthcare solutions within the Other Bets portfolio.",

In 2022, it was mentioned that revenues from Other Bets were generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services, with Verily noted as developing tools and platforms to improve health outcomes.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company underwrote consumer loans using proprietary models that included deal structure data, and Table 21 provided credit score distribution details for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2023, the company continued to incorporate deal structure data into its underwriting process, but Table 21 was updated to reflect credit score distribution metrics as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. This indicates that while the use of deal structure data remained consistent, the underlying credit score metrics used in underwriting evolved to reflect more recent borrower risk profiles.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the use of deal structure data in underwriting consumer loans at COF remained consistent, as the credit score metrics for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios showed minimal change. For the domestic credit card portfolio, the percentage of accounts with FICO scores greater than 660 slightly decreased from 69% in 2022 to 68% in 2023, while the percentage of accounts with scores 660 or below increased slightly from 31% to 32%. For the auto loan portfolio, the percentage of accounts with FICO scores greater than 660 remained stable at 53%, and the distribution for scores between 621-660 and 620 or below also remained unchanged at 20% and 27%, respectively. These consistent credit score distributions suggest that the underwriting approach, including the use of deal structure data, did not significantly evolve during this period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT evaluated strategic alternatives for its India operations, receiving third-party indications of value that were lower than the carrying value of the India reporting unit. This information was used as a significant input in determining the fair value of the unit during the goodwill impairment test, although no impairment was explicitly recorded in that year. By contrast, in 2024, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, leading to a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This marks a shift from a potential strategic exit with uncertain impairment implications to a concrete recognition of value loss.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the financial impact of the India reporting unit on American Tower Corporation (AMT) evolved significantly. In 2023, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million for the India reporting unit due to indications of value from third parties that were less than the carrying value. This impairment was part of a broader $402.0 million goodwill impairment charge, which also included $80.0 million for Spain. In 2024, the India operations were classified as discontinued operations following the completion of the ATC TIPL Transaction in September 2024. The loss from discontinued operations for 2024 included a $1.245 billion non-cash loss on the sale of ATC TIPL, primarily due to the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments. Thus, while 2023 reflected impairment charges based on fair value assessments, 2024 marked the conclusion of the India operations through a divestiture.",

This marks a change from 2022, where no such specific acquisitions were cited in the description of these rights.

Accumulated amortization also increased from $12,769 million in 2022 to $18,049 million in 2023, reflecting ongoing amortization expenses.

In 2024, this growth slowed to 8.6%, still driven by favorable pricing variance and volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, with lower cigarette volume as a partial offset.

      "question": "How has the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations evolved from 2023 to 2024, based on the company's disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums could negatively impact its financial results, particularly outside the United States, due to the potential for significant premium increases driven by the insolvencies of unrelated companies. However, in 2024, the company expanded its discussion to include more detailed context on how it manages broader financial risks, such as currency and financing risks, which may indirectly influence the impact of these premiums. Despite this broader framing, there was no explicit quantitative change in the disclosed exposure related to pension insolvency insurance premiums between the two years, indicating a stable risk profile for this specific item.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures in IBM's 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations remained consistent in terms of risk factors but with updated context for 2024. In both years, IBM highlighted that premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States could significantly impact its results, particularly due to insolvencies of unrelated companies in the relevant jurisdictions. However, in 2024, the disclosure explicitly mentions the inclusion of updated information in the 2024 Annual Report to Stockholders regarding pension funding and assumptions, indicating a more current assessment of the risk. There is no indication of a material change in the magnitude or nature of the impact from 2023 to 2024.",

By fiscal 2023, this reserve increased significantly by approximately $106 million, reaching $245 million as of February 2, 2024. This substantial increase indicates that LOW anticipated higher losses associated with inventory becoming obsolete, suggesting a shift in inventory risk exposure, possibly due to changes in consumer purchasing patterns or product quality concerns.",
      "llm_answer": "The Obsolete Inventory Reserve increased from $168 million in fiscal 2022 to $245 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a $77 million rise. This increase suggests that LOW recognized a higher level of anticipated losses from selling inventory below cost during 2023, potentially due to shifts in consumer demand, supply chain disruptions, or inventory management challenges. While the company maintains that its inventory is not subject to significant obsolescence risk in the near term, the reserve increase implies a more cautious approach to inventory risk management in 2023 compared to 2022.",

The Services Business was not explicitly tied to cloud adoption but rather positioned as a flexible offering across deployment models. By fiscal 2023, Oracle significantly evolved its strategic positioning of the Services Business, explicitly linking it to cloud adoption and customer support. The 2023 filing emphasized that customers could 'continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments.' This included integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and AI-enhanced offerings like Oracle Autonomous Database, which used machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions. The Services Business in 2023 was framed as a key enabler of cloud migration and customer retention, with a focus on supporting Oracle Cloud Services contracts and product enhancements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, Oracle's strategic positioning of its Services Business shifted to align more closely with cloud adoption by emphasizing migration and expansion opportunities for customers moving to Oracle Cloud.

Additionally, customer support offerings were enhanced to provide more seamless integration with Oracle Cloud Services, reflecting a stronger emphasis on cloud-centric support and services.",

By 2024, the company continued to emphasize structural cost savings as a key earnings driver, incorporating it into its newly introduced earnings driver framework. While the 2024 disclosure does not provide a new cumulative savings figure, the explicit inclusion of structural cost savings as a defined earnings driver indicates a strategic shift to institutionalize cost efficiency as a recurring component of earnings performance.

By fiscal 2023, the Core routing portfolio continued to grow, contributing to an overall 18% increase in the Networking product category. This growth was driven by Catalyst 8000 routers, SD-WAN, and IoT routing offerings.

In 2024, the year-over-year growth rate for the Family of Apps revenue slowed to approximately 22%, based on the $133,006 million in 2023 and $162,355 million in 2024 disclosed in the 2024 10-K filing. This indicates a significant decline in the growth rate of Meta's core advertising business, suggesting a potential maturation or slowdown in expansion momentum.",

This decline indicates a deterioration in the company's profitability, primarily driven by lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings.

By 2023, this level of detail was no longer included; instead, the company only provided a brief definition of net charge-off rates without historical data or specific loan category breakdowns. This represents a significant reduction in transparency regarding credit quality and charge-off practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One's approach to disclosing net charge-off rate calculations became more transparent in 2023 compared to 2022, particularly in terms of credit quality and policy details. In 2023, the company provided more granular data across loan categories and geographic regions, with expanded explanations of the factors influencing charge-offs, such as borrower financial difficulty modifications under ASU 2022-02. Additionally, the 2023 filing included updated policies on financial difficulty modifications (FDMs), replacing the prior TDR framework, and offered more detailed descriptions of how modifications are applied across different business segments. These changes reflect a shift toward greater clarity and alignment with evolving accounting standards.",

The segment was positioned within a long-term corporate planning framework supported by the Global Outlook and annual Corporate Plan. By 2024, the company elevated the strategic importance of Specialty Products by categorizing it under 'Advantaged Projects' and explicitly linking it to value creation through integration, higher-value product yields, and above-average returns. Additionally, in 2024, Specialty Products were tied to performance chemicals and lubricants, highlighting differentiation and customer value enhancement, a shift from the broader integrated business model focus of 2023.",

      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of the Family of Apps revenue increased from 16% in 2022 vs 2023 to 22% in 2023 vs 2024, indicating an accelerating revenue trajectory driven by higher advertising revenue and other revenue streams like WhatsApp Business Platform. This acceleration suggests stronger performance and growth momentum in the Family of Apps segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the document outlined the asset allocation for U.S. Retiree Health Care, indicating that 65% - 80% of assets were invested in fixed income securities and cash equivalents, with the remainder in equity securities. By 2023, the company reported specific projected funding obligations for U.S. Retiree Health Care, totaling $27 million for 2024, declining to $22 million by 2028, and $97 million cumulatively from 2029 to 2033. This reflects a decreasing financial obligation over time, as compared to the earlier year's asset-focused disclosure.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial commitment to U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations increased from 2022 to 2023, as reflected in the projected funding levels. The accumulated benefit obligations rose from $489 million in 2022 to $480 million in 2023, indicating a slight decrease, but the projected future benefit payments for the U.S. Retiree Health Care plan show an increase in the assumed payments for 2024 and beyond compared to prior years. Additionally, the discount rate used to determine benefit obligations for the U.S. Retiree Health Care plan increased from 5.68% in 2022 to 5.17% in 2023, which would generally reduce the present value of future obligations, but the overall funding level still reflects a higher financial commitment due to other actuarial adjustments and assumptions.",

      "question": "How did UNH's medical costs payable evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's liability management in terms of current and prior-year medical cost obligations?",
      "original_answer": "UNH's medical costs payable increased from $29.056 billion at the end of 2022 to $32.395 billion at the end of 2023. In 2022, the company reported $210.842 billion in total medical costs, with $206.577 billion paid out during the year, leaving a smaller increase in payable liabilities. In contrast, 2023 saw $241.894 billion in total medical costs and $238.556 billion in payments, indicating a larger buildup of unpaid liabilities compared to the prior year. This suggests that UNH's liability for medical costs grew more significantly in 2023, reflecting either higher incurred costs or a strategic shift in payment timing.",
      "llm_answer": "UNH's medical costs payable increased from $24.48 billion in 2021 to $29.06 billion in 2022 and further to $32.39 billion in 2023. This indicates a growing liability related to both current and prior-year medical cost obligations. The increase is primarily driven by growth in the number of individuals served, particularly in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, as well as higher medical costs. The company's management of these liabilities appears to involve careful estimation and actuarial analysis, with a focus on addressing both current and prior-year obligations through medical payments and reserve adjustments.",

      "question": "How did the use of prior payment history in estimating U.S. rebate accruals evolve between 2023 and 2024, given the changes in the accrued balance for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D rebates?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the accrued balance for U.S. rebate accruals related to Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D was $2.3 billion, and the company used prior payment history as a key input in estimating the expected provision for rebates. In 2024, this accrued balance decreased slightly to $2.2 billion, and prior payment history continued to be used as a foundational element in the estimation process. The slight decrease in the accrued balance suggests a minor adjustment in expected rebate obligations, which may reflect either a refinement in the use of prior payment data or a shift in rebate claim trends. This indicates that while the methodology remained consistent, the underlying assumptions or data inputs based on prior payment history may have evolved slightly to reflect updated trends in rebate claims.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Merck increased its reliance on prior payment history as a key factor in estimating U.S. rebate accruals for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D. In 2023, the accrued balance for these rebates was based on historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, and inventory levels. By 2024, the accrued balance of $2.2 billion reflected a more refined approach, incorporating not only historical data but also a stronger emphasis on actual rebate claims paid and trends in prior payment history to improve the accuracy of estimates. This evolution aimed to enhance the reliability of rebate accruals amid significant measurement uncertainties.",

By 2024, JPM adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2024, for Investments in Tax Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method, applied under the modified retrospective method, signaling a specific procedural update in how tax consequences are accounted for. This indicates a shift from general acknowledgment of complexity and estimation risk to the implementation of a new structured accounting methodology for tax-related assets.",

However, in 2024, the firm adopted updated guidance on investments in tax credit structures using the proportional amortization method, which impacted the recognition of tax effects in stockholders' equity. This adoption marked a refinement in the application of tax accounting principles but did not fundamentally alter the core methodology for accounting for tax-related assets and liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the remeasurement of net monetary position contributed $0.03 to Adjusted EPS, while in 2023, the contribution increased to $0.07, representing a $0.04 increase. This indicates a growing impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on Mondelēz International's financial performance, potentially signaling increased exposure to currency volatility in its international operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The remeasurement of net monetary position positively impacted Mondelēz International's Adjusted EPS by $0.04 (from $0.03 in 2022 to $0.07 in 2023). This increase suggests a reduction in financial exposure related to currency fluctuations, particularly in highly inflationary regions like Argentina and Türkiye, where the company applies specific accounting treatments. The growing positive impact indicates improved management of currency-related risks or a more favorable foreign exchange environment in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GD's Marine Systems segment contributed to revenue growth driven by U.S. Navy ship construction. By 2023, the segment's performance was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program. These challenges were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis-class (TAO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program in 2023. Additionally, GD highlighted increased risk in 2023 around variable consideration for long-term U.S. Navy contracts, particularly the Virginia-class submarine program, indicating a shift toward greater financial uncertainty compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GD's Marine Systems segment experienced growth in revenue, increasing from $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion, driven by continued progress on key U.S. Navy programs such as the Columbia-class submarine, John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler, and Arleigh Burke-class destroyer programs. However, the segment faced performance challenges in 2023, including supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer program. These issues partially offset improvements from the John Lewis-class program, highlighting risks related to long-term contracts and supply chain volatility. Despite these challenges, the segment maintained a stable operating margin, reflecting ongoing learning curve efficiencies in shipyard operations.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a decrease of $428 million due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and expected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a strategic shift toward significantly reducing or eliminating postretirement medical costs over the medium term.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, Disney's postretirement medical cost expectations decreased, as reflected in the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement medical plans, which dropped from $29 million in fiscal 2022 to $3 million in fiscal 2023. This decline indicates a positive trajectory for the company's long-term management of these expenses, likely driven by improved actuarial assumptions and adjustments in benefit options.

      "question": "Merck reported $190 million in pretax facility shut-down costs in 2023 as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program. How did these costs evolve in 2024, and what does this reveal about the scale and progression of the company's restructuring activities across both years?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Merck recorded $190 million in pretax costs related to the upcoming 2024 Restructuring Program, which included facility shut-down expenses as a key component. By 2024, the company disclosed that the cumulative pretax costs for this restructuring program were estimated at $4.0 billion, with facility shut-down costs continuing to represent a significant portion of the cash outlays. This indicates a substantial increase in restructuring activity and signals an escalation in the execution phase of the program, aligning with the company’s plan to optimize its global manufacturing networks for both Human and Animal Health. The shift from initial costs in 2023 to broader implementation in 2024 reveals a deliberate scaling of restructuring efforts.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024, Merck reported $888 million in pretax facility shut-down costs related to the 2024 Restructuring Program, a significant increase from the $190 million reported in 2023. This evolution indicates that the restructuring activities expanded in scale and scope in 2024, with the company accelerating its efforts to optimize its global manufacturing networks for both Human Health and Animal Health. The increase in costs reflects the ongoing implementation of the program, which is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2031.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment faced significant operating cash flow challenges due to lower deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers, with net cash used by operating activities reaching $3.4 billion in 2021. The company had $16.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $58.1 billion in debt as of December 31, 2021, and anticipated continued negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramped up. By 2024, the Commercial Airplanes segment reported a contractual backlog of $498,802 million, up slightly from $497,094 million in 2023, indicating a gradual recovery in order book stability. While liquidity improved as the company moved past the worst of the 737 MAX and pandemic-related disruptions, the segment was still not fully back to pre-crisis financial health, though the trend suggests improvement.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment experienced significant operating cash flow challenges and a decline in backlog value. In 2022, BCA reported a $2.3 billion operating loss with revenues of $26 billion, and by 2024, the operating loss widened to $7.97 billion despite a revenue drop to $22.86 billion, driven by production disruptions, the 737-9 grounding, and reach-forward losses. Additionally, BCA's contractual backlog decreased from $109.6 billion in 2022 to $89.7 billion in 2024, reflecting order cancellations and delivery delays.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that it did not include any estimated obligation for future titles beyond the known minimum amount but noted that these unknown obligations were expected to be significant. In 2023, the company reiterated this approach but added more emphasis on the significance of these unknown obligations, explicitly stating that 'the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.' This represents a qualitative evolution in the company's disclosure, signaling increased awareness or risk communication around future content liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix's disclosure regarding obligations for unknown future content titles remained consistent in stating that such obligations were not included beyond the known minimum amount and were expected to be significant. However, the total content obligations slightly decreased from $21.8 billion in 2022 to $21.7 billion in 2023, with the portion of obligations not yet meeting recognition criteria decreasing from $14.2 billion to $14.6 billion.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort) in its financial statements due to its management agreements, which granted its subsidiaries the power to direct the parks' day-to-day operations and strategic development, despite owning less than 50% equity. By 2023, the 10-K filing included specific financial disclosures showing that Disney reported $128 million in borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks for fiscal year 2025 and $1,164 million in borrowings thereafter. This indicates a shift from primarily qualitative consolidation justification in 2022 to more detailed quantitative disclosure of the financial obligations tied to the Asia Theme Parks in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Disney's financial relationship with the Asia Theme Parks remained consistent in terms of management agreements, as the Company continued to consolidate the Asia Theme Parks due to its management agreements and significant influence over their operations. Regarding borrowing disclosures, in 2023, the Asia Theme Parks had borrowings totaling approximately $1.2 billion from Shendi, with an interest rate of 8% and a maturity in 2036, as well as a $0.4 billion line of credit.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.' The removal of 'home builders' could imply a strategic shift away from partnerships with home construction firms, potentially signaling a reduced emphasis on new home purchase financing or a refocusing of referral partnerships within the retail mortgage channel.",
      "llm_answer": "JPM's 2023 10-K described the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel as including borrowers referred by \"Chase branch bankers, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties.\" In the 2024 10-K, the description omitted \"home builders\" as a specific referral source, listing only \"Chase branch bankers, real estate brokers, or other third parties.\" This omission may suggest a strategic shift in JPM's mortgage acquisition approach, potentially reducing reliance on home builder partnerships in favor of other referral channels like direct retail or third-party brokers. Such a shift could reflect broader market dynamics or a focus on more cost-effective or scalable origination methods.",

In 2023, the company disclosed how medical costs payable were sensitive to changes in completion factors, with a 0.75% change in these factors leading to an $880 million increase in medical costs payable.

The company noted that this trend was industry-wide and had an adverse impact on its results of operations, including impairment of long-lived assets. In 2024, inventory shrink is explicitly listed as a component of the cost of sales, indicating it is now formally recognized and accounted for as a direct cost of merchandise operations.

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning and growth focus of Adobe's Digital Experience segment evolved from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, particularly in terms of market differentiation and go-to-market strategy?",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment reported an operating loss of $3.544 billion. By 2024, the operating loss for the same segment had increased to $5.413 billion. This indicates a significant worsening in the financial performance of the BDS segment over this two-year period. While other segments like Global Services showed improvement, the BDS segment experienced growing losses, suggesting ongoing challenges or increased costs in defense and space programs.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment experienced a mixed trajectory. Revenues increased in 2023 compared to 2022 but declined in 2024 due to higher net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments on major fixed-price development programs. Operationally, the segment moved from a loss of $3,544 million in 2022 to a loss of $1,764 million in 2023, but then significantly worsened to a $5,413 million loss in 2024, primarily driven by unfavorable adjustments on development programs. This indicates ongoing challenges in program execution and cost management, despite stable demand for national security-related products and services.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil defined Structural Cost Savings as sustainable decreases in cash operating expenses (excluding energy and production taxes) compared to 2019 levels, with cumulative savings totaling $9.7 billion. The company emphasized internal stewardship to support management oversight over time. By 2024, Structural Cost Savings were reframed as an earnings driver, with a focus on after-tax earnings effects and inclusion of cash operating expenses related to divestments previously captured in volume/mix drivers. This shift indicates a broader integration of cost savings into financial reporting and performance analysis.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ExxonMobil's approach to Structural Cost Savings evolved in both its definition and internal management. In 2023, structural cost savings were defined as decreases in cash operating expenses (excluding energy and production taxes) resulting from operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and other sustainable cost-saving measures compared to 2019 levels, totaling $9.7 billion in cumulative savings. By 2024, the definition was expanded to include \"divestment-related reductions,\" and the cumulative savings increased to $12.1 billion. Internally, the Corporation stewards these savings to support management's oversight of spending, emphasizing disciplined expense management and transparency for investors.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Payment Network contributed 11% to Mastercard's net revenue growth, reflecting its strong operational performance and a key role in driving revenue. By 2024, the Payment Network was fully integrated into the newly defined 'Payment Solutions' segment, which Mastercard now treats as its sole reportable operating segment. This shift indicates a strategic move toward unifying its payment network with value-added services under a single framework, emphasizing holistic payment solutions rather than distinguishing between core network operations and supplementary services. The consolidation of reporting and the repositioning of the Payment Network within a broader segment reflect a significant transformation in how Mastercard organizes and evaluates its core business performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Mastercard's Payment Network continued to demonstrate strong performance, contributing significantly to net revenue growth. In 2023, net revenue from the Payment Network increased by 10%, driven by growth in domestic and cross-border dollar volumes and an increase in the number of switched transactions. This trend continued into 2024, with net revenue rising to $28,167 million from $25,098 million in 2023, reflecting sustained growth in transaction processing assessments and integration within the broader Payment Solutions segment. The Payment Network remains a core strategic asset, supporting Mastercard's overall financial performance and reinforcing its position as a leader in global payment solutions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the net interest expense was $200 million, calculated from $480 million in interest incurred on debt and other, partially offset by $197 million in interest income. By 2024, the net interest expense increased to $256 million, driven by a rise in interest incurred on debt and other to $555 million, despite a further increase in interest income to $228 million. This indicates that the company's financing costs grew, and its capital structure management experienced increased pressure due to higher debt-related expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Linde's net interest expense increased from $200 million to $256 million. This upward trend indicates higher financing costs, likely due to increased debt levels or higher interest rates. The increase suggests a potential shift in the company's capital structure toward more debt financing, which could reflect strategic initiatives to fund operations or growth, but also signals increased financial risk.",

      "original_answer": "Nike's Operating Overhead Expense in 2023 included wage and benefit-related expenses, as evidenced by $136 million in 401(k) plan contributions. In 2024, the definition of Operating Overhead Expense remained consistent, including wage and benefit-related costs, but the company also highlighted increased prepayments for advertising, rising from $755 million in 2023 to $814 million in 2024. This indicates a strategic increase in investment in demand creation activities, which in turn affects overhead costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Nike's Operating Overhead Expense components, such as wage and benefit-related expenses and prepayments for advertising, showed the following trends:\n\n1. **Wage and Benefit-Related Expenses**: Nike's stock-based compensation expense, a significant component of wage and benefit-related expenses, increased from $755 million in 2023 to $804 million in 2024. This increase was driven by higher expenses for stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Additionally, contributions to the 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan rose from $136 million in 2023 to $153 million in 2024, further contributing to wage and benefit-related expenses.\n\n2. **Prepayments for Advertising**: Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses increased from $755 million at the end of 2023 to $814 million at the end of 2024. This indicates a rise in prepayments for advertising campaigns, with $420 million and $372 million, respectively, recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and $394 million and $383 million in Deferred income taxes and other assets for 2024 and 2023.\n\nOverall, these figures suggest an increase in both wage and benefit-related expenses and prepayments for advertising within Nike's Operating Overhead Expense from 2023 to 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan disclosed that the Core Deposit Intangible from the First Republic acquisition was valued at $1.3 billion and was being amortized over a projected period of approximately 7 years. The valuation methodology was described, including the use of after-tax cost savings and assumptions about market participant behavior. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in terms of the $1.3 billion valuation and the 7-year amortization period, but the language was slightly refined, emphasizing that the intangibles 'are amortized' rather than 'will be amortized,' indicating that the amortization process had commenced. Additionally, the 2024 filing made a new reference to 'disputed amounts with the FDIC as of April 30, 2024,' which was not present in the 2023 filing, suggesting an ongoing financial or legal development affecting the acquisition-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "JPMorgan Chase's treatment and disclosure of Core Deposit Intangibles related to the First Republic acquisition remained consistent between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings. In both years, the core deposit intangible was valued at $1.3 billion, calculated using the favorable source of funds method by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits. The 2024 filing reflects a final bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion, up from $2.8 billion in 2023, due to additional adjustments during the measurement period, but the valuation methodology and assumptions for core deposit intangibles were unchanged.",

      "question": "How has the impact of a 2% increase in market interest rates on UnitedHealth Group's investment income and fair value of financial liabilities evolved from 2022 to 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, a 2% increase in market interest rates resulted in $401 million in additional investment income and a $8,700 million decrease in the fair value of financial liabilities. In 2023, the same 2% increase led to a higher investment income of $629 million, while the fair value of financial liabilities decreased by $7,365 million. This indicates that UnitedHealth Group's exposure to interest rate changes increased in magnitude over the year, particularly on the investment income side, while the sensitivity of liabilities slightly decreased.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the impact of a 2% increase in market interest rates on UnitedHealth Group's investment income and fair value of financial liabilities became more pronounced. In 2022, a 2% increase in interest rates was projected to increase investment income by $499 million and reduce the fair value of financial assets by $3,080 million, while decreasing the fair value of financial liabilities by $8,664 million. By 2023, the same 2% increase was projected to increase investment income by $688 million and reduce the fair value of financial assets by $3,642 million, with a larger decrease in the fair value of financial liabilities of $8,142 million. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to interest rate changes in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, currency exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact decreased to 0.5%. This indicates a reduced positive contribution from exchange rate movements, suggesting a decline in the company's exposure or a shift in the direction of foreign exchange fluctuations affecting sales during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a 1.0% negative effect in 2023 to a 0.5% negative effect in 2024. This reduction in adverse impact suggests that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations slightly decreased between the two years, likely due to a more stable or less pronounced strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2024 compared to 2023.",

In 2024, these figures increased to $3.9 billion in short-term investments and $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This reflects a consistent approach to preserving principal and liquidity, with an expansion in the scale of short-term investments and overall liquidity reserves, indicating a maintained but more capitalized strategy in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Target Corporation's approach to preserving principal and liquidity in its short-term investments remained consistent, as outlined in its investment policy. However, the cash and short-term investment balances increased significantly. In 2024, cash and cash equivalents rose to $4.8 billion (including $3.9 billion in short-term investments) from $3.8 billion in 2023 (including $2.9 billion in short-term investments). This increase reflects a larger allocation to short-term instruments that mature in 60 days or less, maintaining the company's focus on liquidity and principal preservation while managing excess cash generated from operations.",

This upward trend continued into fiscal 2024, where the revenue reached $4.864 billion, showing an additional increase of $534 million from fiscal 2023.

By 2024, the segment's backlog revenue stood at $64,023 million for the year, compared to $59,012 million in 2023. While the facilities footprint remained relatively stable, the significant increase in backlog revenue—approximately 8.5% from 2023 to 2024—suggests a growing demand for the segment's offerings, indicating a positive growth trajectory despite no major changes in physical capacity.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment's total backlog increased slightly from $59,012 million in 2023 to $64,023 million in 2024, driven by growth in contractual and unobligated backlog. The segment's facilities footprint in 2021 was 28,554 thousand square feet, with operations across multiple U.S. and international locations.

In both years, unrealized non-credit-related losses were included in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, while unrealized credit-related losses were recorded to other income (expense), net, with a corresponding allowance for credit-related losses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, Adobe did not recognize any allowance for credit-related losses on its investments during either fiscal year.",

By 2023, the company specifically disclosed a liability of $39 million principally related to travel transaction taxes. This indicates that while the company continued to face exposure, the liability was quantified and likely reflected settlements, accrual adjustments, or resolution progress from prior uncertainties.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial liability related to travel transaction taxes increased from 2022 to 2023, as evidenced by the $44 million in liabilities related to travel transaction taxes included in \"Other non-current liabilities\" in the Getaroom acquisition details for 2023, compared to no specific mention of such liabilities in 2022. This increase indicates a growing exposure to obligations related to travel transaction taxes, likely due to ongoing legal proceedings, audits, and evolving tax regulations in various jurisdictions.

      "question": "How did Netflix's content obligations and related financial risks evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of liquidity constraints and the nature of content-related commitments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that it had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, with significant additional streaming content commitments that did not meet the criteria for liability recognition. These obligations were described as long-term and fixed-cost in nature, limiting Netflix’s flexibility in reacting to changes in business conditions and potentially requiring access to capital markets at unfavorable times. By 2023, Netflix expanded its description of content obligations to include non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements, as well as production-related obligations. While specific dollar figures for total content liabilities were not explicitly stated in 2023, the company emphasized that obligations for unknown future titles under certain licensing agreements were expected to be significant, indicating a growing complexity and financial exposure in its content commitments. This evolution reflects both an increase in the scale and inflexibility of content obligations, heightening liquidity risk.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's content obligations increased slightly, from $21.8 billion to $21.7 billion, with a notable shift in the timing of payments. The amount due in less than one year decreased marginally, while obligations due after one year and through three years also declined. This suggests a continued focus on long-term commitments. In terms of liquidity constraints, the nature of these fixed-cost obligations remains a risk, as they are largely inflexible and could strain cash flow if membership growth does not meet expectations. Additionally, the company's use of derivative instruments in 2023 to manage foreign exchange risk indicates a new layer of financial strategy to mitigate currency-related volatility on content obligations.",

      "llm_answer": "The company's free cash flow as a percentage of revenue declined significantly from 29.6% in 2022 to 7.7% in 2023. This sharp drop indicates a substantial decrease in the cash generated by operations relative to revenue, primarily driven by lower revenue, higher manufacturing costs, and significantly increased capital expenditures.

      "original_answer": "In the 2023 filing, the Veralto Distribution contributed $974 million to Accumulated Comprehensive Income, as noted in the line item under Other Comprehensive Income. By 2024, this amount was no longer present as a separate line item, and Accumulated Comprehensive Income had declined from $(1,748) million in 2023 to $(3,218) million in 2024. This indicates that while the Veralto Distribution had a significant positive impact in 2023, its absence in 2024 contributed to the overall decline in Accumulated Comprehensive Income, alongside other comprehensive losses during the year.",
      "llm_answer": "The Veralto Distribution significantly impacted Danaher's Accumulated Comprehensive Income between 2023 and 2024. In the 2023 filing, the balance of Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) was $(1,748) million, and the 2024 filing shows a further decline to $(3,218) million. This change was primarily driven by the \"Distribution of Veralto Corporation,\" which contributed a $(974) million adjustment in 2023 and an additional $(1,470) million in 2024, reflecting the separation-related reclassifications and adjustments to comprehensive income.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and occurred when revenue was recognized prior to invoicing, with specific mention of deferred revenues being recorded when revenues were to be recognized after cash collection. In fiscal year 2024, Oracle maintained the same classification of unbilled receivables within accounts receivable but updated the presentation slightly, referring to 'non-operating expenses, net' instead of 'non-operating expenses or income, net' when discussing interest revenue from financing arrangements. This indicates a subtle evolution in financial statement presentation without a substantive change in the treatment of unbilled receivables.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's treatment and disclosure of unbilled receivables remained largely consistent between fiscal years 2022 and 2024. In both years, unbilled receivables are recognized when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing and are included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. The timing of invoicing aligns with contractual terms: invoices for cloud licenses, on-premise licenses, and hardware products are generally issued when the product or license is made available or delivered, while support contracts and cloud services are typically invoiced annually in advance. No material changes were disclosed in the classification or accounting treatment of unbilled receivables during this period.",

By 2024, the growth rate of average paying memberships had slowed to 15% year-over-year (from 240,889 in 2023 to 277,730 in 2024), yet streaming revenues still grew by 16% year-over-year. This indicates that despite a lower growth rate in memberships compared to earlier years, Netflix was able to maintain strong revenue growth, likely due to more stable monetization per membership and a larger base of paying members.",

This growth in average paying memberships positively impacted Netflix's streaming revenue growth, which increased by 19% in 2022, 16% in 2023, and 16% in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that foreign currency exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities were recorded in other income (expense), net, and partially offset by gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge these exposures. Additionally, PayPal mentioned a matured net investment hedge from 2020, with its gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the foreign subsidiary was sold or liquidated. By 2023, PayPal expanded its disclosure to clarify that foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were included in other, net, along with forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and fair value changes on non-hedging derivative contracts. The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts. This evolution indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to disclosing foreign exchange exposures and their financial effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, PayPal's treatment and disclosure of foreign currency exchange gains and losses remained consistent in their accounting approach, but there was a slight shift in the impact on financial statements. In both years, PayPal used foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge against exchange rate movements, with gains and losses from these contracts offsetting those on assets and liabilities. However, in 2023, the net favorable impact of foreign exchange on operating income was less pronounced compared to 2022, reflecting reduced hedging effectiveness or increased volatility. Additionally, the 2023 filing provided more detailed disclosures on the nature of foreign currency contracts and their role in managing exposure, indicating a more transparent approach to hedging activities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed that approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services were known and settled within 90 days, with substantially all settled within twelve months. By 2023, the company provided a more quantified sensitivity analysis, stating that a hypothetical 1% difference between its December 31, 2023, estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable would have increased or decreased 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This indicates a more explicit quantification of risk exposure in 2023 compared to the more qualitative disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity analysis of medical costs payable estimates showed an increased exposure in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2023, a 1% change in completion factors could impact medical costs payable by approximately $585 million (0.50% change) to $880 million (0.75% change), whereas in 2022, the impact was lower at $410 million for a similar change. Additionally, a 1% change in medical cost per member per month (PMPM) trend factors in 2023 could affect medical costs payable by $376 million, compared to $1.7 billion in favorable development in 2022. This indicates a higher sensitivity and, therefore, greater risk exposure in 2023 related to unpaid claims, likely due to increased uncertainty in claim submission rates, care activity, and processing patterns.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company reported restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $1.9 billion, which increased to $2.4 billion in 2024. This represents a $0.5 billion or approximately 26% increase in restricted funds. The increase suggests a more conservative liquidity strategy in 2024, with a greater portion of cash being set aside for specific purposes, potentially to mitigate credit and settlement exposures or to meet regulatory or contractual obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents related to capital asset purchases decreased from $2.2 billion in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2023 and further to $2.4 billion in 2024. This fluctuation suggests that the company may be strategically managing its liquidity by reallocating funds from restricted to more flexible uses, potentially to support operational needs or growth initiatives, while still maintaining a buffer for capital asset purchases and obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 44.6%, while in 2024 it decreased to 37.9%. This indicates a decline in profitability relative to revenue, suggesting potential challenges in cost management or a reduction in pricing power during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 41.8% in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024, indicating a decline in profitability. This shift suggests challenges in cost management, as both Analog and Embedded Processing segments experienced lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs, particularly in Embedded Processing, where the operating profit percentage dropped significantly from 29.9% to 13.9%. The decline reflects reduced factory loadings and the impact of planned capacity expansions, which increased fixed costs relative to output.",

By 2023, the company emphasized the sensitivity of its Medical Costs Payable estimates, disclosing that a hypothetical 1% difference between estimated and actual Medical Costs Payable would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million.

By 2024, this metric had decreased further to (5.2)%, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accruals.

By 2024, the company refined its approach by emphasizing a more precise methodology in which the selected discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value derived from the yield curve analysis. While the core method remained consistent, the 2024 filing reflects a more structured emphasis on the derivation of the equivalent rate as a direct output of the present value calculation, suggesting a refinement in transparency and analytical rigor.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Texas Instruments' approach to determining the single equivalent discount rate for non-U.S. defined benefit plans remained consistent in methodology but saw a notable increase in the weighted average discount rate. The discount rate for non-U.S. defined benefit plans rose from 3.28% in 2023 to 3.76% in 2024, reflecting changes in market conditions and bond yields in the respective countries. The methodology continued to rely on constructing a yield curve from high-quality corporate bonds or government bond indices, depending on the depth of the local bond market.",

      "llm_answer": "In 2022, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be repurchased under Walmart's publicly announced plans was $10.6 billion, while in 2024, this value was $12.0 billion. This slight increase indicates that Walmart has maintained a consistent repurchase strategy, with ongoing authorization to repurchase shares under its $20.0 billion program approved in 2022, reflecting the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $11.67. By 2024, this metric had decreased slightly to $10.96. This indicates a shift in the company's pricing or value proposition strategy over the two-year period, potentially reflecting promotional pricing, changes in regional mix, or adjustments in service tiers.",
      "llm_answer": "The average monthly revenue per paying membership increased slightly from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.70 in 2024, representing a minimal 1% change. This indicates that the company's pricing strategy remained relatively stable over the period, with only modest adjustments and the influence of foreign exchange fluctuations. The slight decline in 2024, despite price increases in certain regions, suggests that currency devaluations, particularly in Argentina, offset some of the pricing gains, implying a focus on maintaining value proposition through content and global expansion rather than aggressive price hikes.",

However, in 2023, WarnerMedia was classified as part of discontinued operations following its separation and distribution, signaling a complete operational and financial divestiture.

In 2022, AT&T announced its agreement to combine WarnerMedia with Discovery, with the transaction expected to close in Q2 2022. By 2023, the separation was completed, and WarnerMedia was conveyed to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) as part of the transaction. Financially, AT&T conveyed approximately $41,600 in debt to WarnerMedia, including $30,000 in Spinco senior notes and a $10,000 term loan, while receiving cash and other adjustments.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments stated that it rebalanced the plans' investments when they were outside the target allocation ranges. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the fact that assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets were based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. Additionally, in 2023, the company explicitly mentioned adjusting results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets and that assumptions for non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflected different economic environments. This indicates a more detailed and forward-looking approach to asset allocation in 2023 compared to the more general rebalancing policy described in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Texas Instruments adjusted the target allocation ranges for its defined benefit plans, particularly for U.S. Retiree Health Care plans, narrowing the equity allocation from 15%-25% to 20%-35% and increasing the fixed income allocation from 75%-85% to 65%-80%. The rebalancing approach remained consistent, with investments adjusted when they fell outside the target ranges. Additionally, the long-term rate of return on plan assets increased significantly for U.S. Defined Benefit plans, from 3.80% in 2022 to 5.70% in 2023, reflecting updated asset class assumptions.",

By 2023, the company reported 4,355,000 members in Medicare Supplement (Standardized) plans, indicating a slight decrease of 45,000 members from the prior year. This small decline suggests relative stability in the company's Medicare Supplement market share, despite broader growth in other senior-focused segments like Medicare Advantage.

      "question": "How has NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of lead times and financial risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved between 2022 and 2023 by significantly extending lead times and increasing financial risk exposure due to supply chain constraints. In 2022, lead times were historically around six months, but by 2023, NVIDIA began placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance to secure supply and capacity. This shift increased financial risk exposure, as extended commitments and prepayments could lead to excess inventory or financial charges if demand for products decreased or was met by competitors.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Mastercard reported Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) as $9.0 trillion, reflecting 12% growth on a local currency basis. In 2024, while no updated GDV figure was provided, the company introduced a more detailed explanation of GDV, clarifying that it includes both purchase volume and cash volume, and specifying that cross-border volume growth is measured separately. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced approach to currency conversion, using quarterly average exchange rates to calculate U.S. dollar equivalents. This represents a shift from simply reporting GDV figures to enhancing transparency around its components and measurement methodology.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard's Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) increased from $9.0 trillion in 2023 to $9.8 trillion in 2024, reflecting an 8% growth on a U.S. dollar-converted basis and 11% growth on a local currency basis.

By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent had decreased to $19 million, down from $27 million at the start of the year, primarily due to a $7 million deduction with no write-offs and a $1 million reduction from foreign currency and other adjustments.

By fiscal year 2023, the financial exposure shifted toward post-sale obligations, as warranty liabilities primarily related to this segment were highlighted, indicating increased responsibility for long-term product support and customer commitments. This evolution shows a transition from upfront investment risk to ongoing operational liability.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced a notable shift in financial exposure between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, primarily due to the termination of the Arm acquisition and the ongoing integration of Mellanox. In 2022, the goodwill from the Mellanox acquisition, valued at $3.43 billion, was allocated to the Compute & Networking segment, with no impairment recorded. However, in 2023, NVIDIA incurred a $1.36 billion charge related to the termination of the Arm acquisition, which was recorded as an operating expense. This charge reflects the write-off of the prepayment made to SoftBank, significantly impacting the financial exposure for the segment in 2023. No additional post-sale obligations from the Mellanox acquisition are mentioned, indicating that the primary exposure in 2023 stemmed from the Arm transaction termination.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Membership and Other Income increased by 13.1% compared to the previous year, driven by growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. By fiscal 2024, the Membership and Other Income reached $2,323 million, representing a $272 million increase from $2,051 million in fiscal 2023, which corresponds to a growth rate of approximately 13.3%. This indicates that Sam's Club's membership strategy remained effective and consistent in driving growth over this period, maintaining a strong upward trend in membership-related revenue.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of Membership and Other Income for Sam's Club increased from 7.5% in fiscal 2024 to 13.3% in fiscal 2025, indicating a significant acceleration in membership growth and Plus Member penetration. This suggests that Sam's Club's membership strategy, which likely includes expanding its membership base, enhancing member value through services like Walmart+, and managing promotional offerings, is effectively driving higher membership revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported a postretirement benefits reserves adjustment of $200 million, indicating a positive impact on comprehensive income. However, in 2024, the company disclosed a negative reclassification of $70 million related to the amortization and settlement of these reserves, showing a shift from a gain to a cost. This change reflects an increased burden from pension obligations in the later year.",
      "llm_answer": "The postretirement benefits reserves adjustment for ExxonMobil (XOM) evolved from a balance of $1,067 million as of December 31, 2023, to $1,547 million as of December 31, 2024, indicating an increase of $480 million during the period. This increase suggests that XOM's pension-related liabilities grew in 2024, likely due to factors such as changes in actuarial assumptions or obligations. The adjustment was also reclassified into net periodic benefit costs, with $70 million amortized and settled in 2024, compared to $81 million in 2023. Overall, the rising reserves adjustment reflects an increase in the financial burden of XOM's postretirement benefits obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix emphasized the complexity and subjectivity involved in estimating content amortization, which is based on historical and forecasted viewing patterns, and noted that changes in these patterns could affect amortization timing. By 2024, the company provided a more concrete and quantifiable disclosure, showing that tax incentives on qualified production spend directly reduced the cost basis of content assets, resulting in lower amortization. Specifically, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023, and $899 million in 2024, indicating a growing impact of these incentives over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's treatment and disclosure of content amortization remained consistent in methodology, with amortization based on estimated viewing patterns. However, the impact of tax incentives on amortization costs increased. In 2022, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million, rising to $835 million in 2023 and $899 million in 2024. This increase reflects Netflix's continued investment in content production and the growing benefit of tax incentives on qualified production spend, which directly lowers the amortization expense over the life of produced content.",

By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MetLife's assumptions regarding withdrawal rates for GMWBs and GMABs/GMIBs showed a slight increase in the weighted average withdrawal rate, from 3.72% in 2022 to 4.77% in 2024. This evolution reflects a higher estimated percentage of account balances that policyholders are assumed to withdraw annually. The impact of these changes is such that for GMWBs, an increase in withdrawal rates results in an increase in the estimated fair value of the guarantees, while for GMABs and GMIBs, an increase in withdrawal rates leads to a decrease in the estimated fair value.",

However, in 2024, the financial data shows that QFNA's allocation was only $11 million, a significant drop compared to other segments like FLNA ($150 million) and PBNA ($238 million). This suggests that QFNA's strategic importance may have diminished relative to other divisions, as reflected in the reduced financial resources allocated to it.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the financial allocation for Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) within PepsiCo's restructuring and productivity plan increased significantly. In 2023, QFNA accounted for 1% of the total pre-tax restructuring charges, while in 2024, it rose to 1% as well, but with a notable increase in the absolute value of charges. This increase suggests that QFNA is undergoing more substantial restructuring efforts in 2024, indicating a heightened strategic focus on optimizing its operations and cost structure within the company's broader productivity initiatives.",

In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by effective price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, although this was partially offset by shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS revenue was reported in a table format showing $10,653 million in 2021 and $10,653 million in 2022, indicating a flat performance. However, in 2023, the company provided a more detailed description of AWS revenue recognition, emphasizing that revenue is primarily recognized when customers use services based on the quantity rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Additionally, in 2023, Amazon disclosed that certain AWS services, including compute and database, are offered as fixed quantities over specified terms, with revenue recognized ratably. This shift reflects a more nuanced understanding of contractual arrangements and service delivery models, including the capitalization and amortization of sales commissions for contracts exceeding one year, which was not mentioned in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AWS revenue continued its upward trajectory, increasing from $62,202 million in 2022 to $75,726 million in 2023, as reflected in the consolidated net sales. The recognition of AWS revenue remains tied to on-demand service usage, with revenue primarily recognized when customers utilize services such as compute and storage capacity. Additionally, certain services offered over a fixed term are recognized ratably. The composition of AWS services has evolved with an increasing focus on long-term contracts and fixed-term offerings, which influence the timing of revenue recognition. AWS also continues to invest heavily in infrastructure, as seen in the growth of AWS segment assets and property and equipment, supporting its expanding service delivery capabilities.",

By 2023, this value decreased to $4,031.2 million, indicating a decline of $728.2 million.

By 2024, the company provided a more detailed and concrete description of the amortization process, emphasizing its complexity and subjectivity due to reliance on both historical and forecasted viewing data. The 2024 filing also outlined specific audit procedures conducted by Ernst & Young LLP to evaluate the amortization method, including sensitivity analyses and comparisons of prior estimates to actual results—indicating a more structured and scrutinized approach over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Netflix's content amortization process has become increasingly complex and subjective. As noted in the 2024 10-K, amortization is based on estimated future viewing patterns derived from historical and forecasted data, requiring significant judgment. The auditor highlighted this as a critical audit matter due to the subjective nature of estimating viewing trends and the potential for adjustments if actual results differ from forecasts.

In 2023, the plan maintained this structure for those hired through December 31, 2003, but for employees hired after that date, the fixed 2% contribution was removed, leaving only the matching contribution of up to 4%.

      "question": "How has MetLife's approach to the performance factor in Performance Shares evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its impact on final share payouts?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife described the performance factor as being applied to Performance Units, which were liability awards, and the factor was determined using the same methodology as for Performance Shares, though specific performance metrics or outcomes were not detailed. By 2024, MetLife provided a more detailed and structured approach for Performance Shares, which were classified as equity awards. The performance factor for the 2021–2023 period was explicitly set at 147.5%, based on return on equity relative to business plan goals, total shareholder return compared to a peer group, and a cap if shareholder return was zero or negative. Additionally, the 2024 filing clarified that the Compensation Committee could adjust for 'Significant Events' affecting performance. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of performance factor usage to a more transparent and quantitatively defined mechanism with explicit outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "MetLife's approach to the performance factor in Performance Shares from 2022 to 2024 has remained consistent in its methodology, which considers the Company's annual adjusted return on equity compared to its business plan goal and total shareholder return relative to a peer group, with a cap of 100% if total shareholder return is zero or less. However, the performance factor for the 2021–2023 period increased to 147.5% in 2024 from 110.8% in 2022, indicating stronger financial performance and a greater impact on final share payouts during this period.",

In 2023, the company stated that a hypothetical 1% difference in its estimate of Medical Costs Payable at year-end would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This shift indicates that while the company still experiences estimation variance, the nature of the impact evolved from realized favorable developments in prior years to a forward-looking sensitivity analysis in 2023, reflecting a more predictive and quantified risk to earnings.",

In 2022, a 1% difference in estimates would have impacted net earnings by approximately $184 million, while in 2023, the impact rose to $245 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported an international tax liability of $3,090 million, which decreased to $2,604 million in 2024. This reduction of $486 million suggests that the substantial tax liability risk disclosed in 2023 related to the Kenvue separation was partially realized and subsequently addressed. The decrease implies that JNJ may have resolved or mitigated a portion of the previously disclosed international tax exposure associated with the separation.",
      "llm_answer": "JNJ's international tax liability increased between 2023 and 2024, as evidenced by the rise in international taxes currently payable from $3,090 million in 2023 to $2,604 million in 2024. This increase, combined with the tax risk disclosed regarding the Kenvue separation, implies that the Company faces potential exposure to substantial tax liability if the IRS or other jurisdictions challenge the tax-free nature of the separation.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo described its allocation methodologies for operating expenses across segments, including share-based compensation, pension, and retiree medical expenses, but did not disclose any specific dollar amounts allocated to the AMESA segment. In contrast, the 2024 filing explicitly reported a $5 million allocation to the AMESA segment for these expenses. This change indicates a shift in the company's financial reporting approach, with increased transparency in 2024 regarding resource allocation to the AMESA region, suggesting a more detailed and accountable presentation of financial commitments across geographic segments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, PepsiCo's disclosure of operating expense allocations to its AMESA segment remained relatively stable, with the segment consistently receiving around 5% of share-based compensation expenses in both years (5% in 2023 and 5% in 2024). This consistency suggests a stable and predictable approach to allocating corporate expenses to the AMESA segment, reflecting PepsiCo's centralized financial reporting structure and its method of distributing costs based on predefined percentages tied to segment performance and resource utilization. The lack of significant change in allocation percentages indicates that the company's financial reporting approach for AMESA has remained consistent, with no material shifts in how the segment is managed or resourced.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and risk exposure of MET's Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to interest rate sensitivity and investment performance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed that liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using present value of expected benefits and premiums, with key assumptions including mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns. The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities. This indicates a shift from a primarily actuarial estimation approach in 2022 to a more risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MET's treatment and risk exposure of Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits have evolved with a continued focus on managing interest rate sensitivity and investment performance. The company employs strategies such as interest rate derivatives, asset/liability duration matching, and product design features to mitigate gross margin compression in both declining and rising interest rate scenarios. In a declining rate environment, reinvestment risk is partially offset by lowering crediting rates and using derivatives, while in a rising rate environment, higher reinvestment rates on cash flows help offset increased crediting rates and lower derivative income. Additionally, MET maintains that approximately 5% of its invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk through 2024, reflecting a measured approach to managing these exposures.",

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's treatment and disclosure of profit-share payments in collaborative arrangements change between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of their contribution to revenue reporting?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ disclosed that profit-share payments in collaborative arrangements were capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product after regulatory approval, indicating a long-term asset treatment. By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted to emphasize that profit-share payments were now included directly in sales to customers, with the note that these payments represented less than 2.0% of total revenues in fiscal year 2024. This reflects a change in emphasis from long-term amortization to current revenue recognition, improving transparency around the contribution of collaborative arrangements to top-line performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Johnson & Johnson's treatment and disclosure of profit-share payments in collaborative arrangements remained consistent in terms of their inclusion in revenue reporting. In both years, profit-share payments were included in sales to customers and contributed less than 2.0% of total revenues. However, the 2024 disclosure explicitly states that these payments were less than 2.0% for both 2024 and 2023, whereas the 2023 disclosure indicated less than 2.0% for 2023 and less than 3.0% for 2022. This suggests a slight reduction in the relative contribution of profit-share payments to total revenues in 2024 compared to 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Target disclosed that substantially all vendor income—arising from volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising activities—was recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales. Additionally, reimbursements from vendors for advertising were recognized as offsets within SG&A expenses, with net advertising costs reported at $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. By 2024, Target's classification had evolved: vendor income that constitutes reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs was now explicitly offset against advertising expenses within Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, while vendor income not tied to such reimbursements continued to reduce Cost of Sales. This reflects a more nuanced and bifurcated treatment of vendor income depending on its nature and use.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Target's treatment of vendor income has remained largely consistent in its classification as a reduction of Cost of Sales, except when the income is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs, in which case it is recorded as an offset to Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses. However, a notable change in 2024 was the reclassification of certain advertising-related expenses to align with the current year's presentation, which increased Cost of Sales by $92 million and $77 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, while decreasing SG&A Expenses by the same amounts. This reclassification did not affect Net Sales, Operating Income, or Net Earnings. Advertising expenses, net of vendor reimbursements, were $1.5 billion in 2024, $1.4 billion in 2023, and $1.5 billion in 2022.",

However, in 2024, the Corporation experienced a significant reduction in its asset retirement obligations liability, partly due to a large reduction of $1,445 million from property sales, compared to a much smaller reduction of $288 million in 2023.

This shift indicates a more conservative financing strategy in 2023, with the company relying less on issuing new long-term debt and instead using existing cash flows and other resources to fund operations, dividends, and share repurchases.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, foreign exchange gains were $403 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a $431 million non-cash gain from the remeasurement of Senior Notes in euros, partially offset by losses on cash and content liability positions. In contrast, by 2024, foreign exchange losses were $18 million (net of derivatives and hedging), with a $122 million non-cash gain from Senior Notes offsetting losses on cash and content liabilities. This marks a significant shift from a net gain in 2022 to a smaller net loss in 2024, with the Senior Notes' impact decreasing in magnitude and hedging playing a more prominent role in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the composition and magnitude of foreign exchange impacts on Interest and Other Income (Expense) shifted significantly. In 2022, the expense was $48.8 million, driven by a $176 million non-cash loss from the remeasurement of euro-denominated Senior Notes and losses from cash and content liability positions. By 2024, this turned into a $266.8 million income, primarily due to a $122 million non-cash gain from the remeasurement of the €5,170 million Senior Notes, partially offset by losses from cash and content liability positions.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Gigafactory Shanghai was listed as an active production location manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. By 2024, Tesla disclosed a formal agreement with the Shanghai local government that introduced new operational conditions tied to cumulative capital expenditure targets and annual tax revenue requirements starting in late 2023. Additionally, while incentives received in 2023 were deemed immaterial, Tesla continued to receive immaterial amounts in 2024, indicating that while the financial impact remained minor, the nature of the relationship evolved from operational to more formally structured with defined performance obligations.",

While the document notes that incentives tied to these commitments are recorded as reductions in capital investment costs or manufacturing expenses, the amounts received in both 2023 and 2024 were deemed immaterial, indicating no significant changes in the financial incentives or operational commitments during this period.",

In the subsequent 2023–2024 period, the decline continued but at a slower pace, with a 3% decrease from $2,188 million to $2,126 million.

In contrast, by 2023, the company recorded a significant net loss of $407 million from the disposal of businesses or assets. This sharp change indicates a notable shift in NextEra Energy's divestiture strategy, moving from limited asset sales with small gains to a more active divestiture approach involving larger transactions that resulted in a substantial net loss, possibly reflecting strategic portfolio realignment.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the gains on disposal of businesses or assets increased significantly from $4 million to $407 million. This sharp rise indicates that NextEra Energy executed a more active divestiture strategy in 2023, likely selling off higher-value assets or businesses compared to the minimal gains recorded in 2022. The increase suggests a strategic focus on optimizing its asset portfolio and potentially reallocating capital to more profitable ventures during this period.",

In 2023, the impact of such favorable items, including cost recoveries, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion.

This decrease indicates a slight moderation in favorable adjustments to operating profit due to changes in estimated costs and variable consideration.

By 2024, fuel surcharge revenues further declined to $2.6 billion from $3.0 billion in 2023, again driven by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lagged effect of price changes, partially offset by higher shipment volumes. This indicates a continued downward trend in fuel surcharge revenues over the two-year period, influenced by both pricing and volume dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, freight revenues from fuel surcharge programs declined from $3.0 billion to $2.6 billion, representing a $0.4 billion decrease. This decline was primarily driven by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lag effect of fluctuating fuel prices, which typically take up to two months to impact surcharge recoveries. In 2023, the decrease was similarly attributed to lower fuel prices and reduced volume, partially offset by fluctuating fuel prices.

      "question": "How has ExxonMobil's approach to incorporating greenhouse gas emissions pricing into its Corporate Plan assumptions evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic planning for lower-emission investments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil stated that its Corporate Plan assumptions included greenhouse gas emissions pricing as part of its economic evaluation for investments, developed annually based on its Global Outlook. By 2024, the company maintained this approach but emphasized that current policy trends and lower-emission solutions were not yet aligned with a net-zero pathway by 2050, indicating a more cautious stance on the pace of emissions reduction. This evolution suggests that while emissions pricing remains a consistent factor in planning, ExxonMobil is signaling that external policy support and technological advancements need to accelerate for the company to meet more aggressive emissions targets.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to incorporating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing into its Corporate Plan assumptions has become more explicit and integrated from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, the company noted that GHG emissions pricing was part of the annual Corporate Plan assumptions, which guide investment evaluations and capital allocation. By 2024, the discussion emphasizes that actions to advance the company's 2030 GHG emission-reduction plans are incorporated into medium-term business plans and that the Global Outlook, which underpins the Corporate Plan, reflects increasing policy stringency and technology improvement up to 2050. This evolution indicates a more strategic and forward-looking integration of emissions pricing and climate-related factors into long-term planning, signaling a stronger commitment to aligning with lower-emission investment opportunities while maintaining a disciplined focus on returns and policy developments.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets was $313 million. By fiscal 2024, this figure had increased significantly, as the company reported a year-over-year rise in amortization expenses, attributing this growth directly to the acquisition of Splunk Inc. in March 2024. The Splunk acquisition, which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, also brought with it additional intangible assets that required amortization, marking a clear shift in Cisco's financial obligations tied to its acquisition-driven growth strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets increased significantly, from $313 million in fiscal 2022 to $1,169 million in fiscal 2024 (sum of $313 million in 2022 and $789 million in 2024, as restructuring charges are separate). This increase indicates a more active acquisition strategy during this period, particularly highlighted by the acquisition of Splunk Inc. in fiscal 2024, which contributed to higher amortization expenses. The rise in amortization reflects Cisco's focus on expanding its capabilities in areas like security and observability through strategic acquisitions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde's long-term contracts enabled the company to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, positively impacting its business by ensuring stable cash flow. However, in 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on sales, indicating a shift in how these cost adjustments affected the company's revenue. This change suggests that rising costs could not be fully offset by customer pricing adjustments, potentially signaling tighter pricing conditions or increased cost pressures in the market.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through on Linde's sales decreased from a 3% reduction in 2023 to a 1% reduction in 2024. This shift indicates that Linde was able to mitigate the effect of energy cost fluctuations on its sales to a greater extent in 2024, likely through improved pricing strategies or more effective cost management. The reduced impact of cost pass-through, combined with higher price attainment, suggests stronger pricing dynamics and better control over energy cost volatility in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "Amgen's investment in its Research and Early Pipeline segment decreased from $1,584 million in 2023 to $1,534 million in 2024. This indicates a modest reduction in early-stage R&D funding, suggesting a potential strategic shift toward later-stage development or cost containment in the earliest phases of drug discovery.",
      "llm_answer": "Amgen's investment in its Research and Early Pipeline segment slightly decreased from $1,611 million in 2023 to $1,534 million in 2024. This modest decline suggests that the company is prioritizing later-stage clinical programs and marketed product support over early-stage research, as evidenced by the significant increase in spending in those categories. This shift indicates a strategic focus on advancing near-term pipeline candidates toward commercialization while managing early-stage R&D investments more conservatively.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reviewed its network location intangible asset for impairment using a cash flow modeling approach that incorporated tower location, demographics, timing of new tenants, lease rates, and ongoing cash requirements. Tenant-related intangible assets were assessed on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on turnover, contract non-renewals, or relationship terminations. By 2023, while the impairment review framework remained largely the same, the company added context around tenant risk by referencing a specific customer (VIL) in India that had made partial payments in 2022 and indicated it would not resume full contractual payments in 2023, signaling a shift in how tenant-specific risks were explicitly tied to impairment considerations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the treatment and assumptions related to the Network Location Intangible asset's impairment analysis evolved in terms of cash flow modeling and tenant-related risk factors. In 2022, the cash flow modeling approach incorporated factors such as tower location demographics, lease rates, and estimated tenancy length, while tenant-related risk factors were assessed on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on turnover, attrition, and contract cancellations. By 2023, the modeling approach remained similar but included updated assumptions reflecting the evolving tenant landscape, particularly in India, where partial payment issues with a major tenant (VIL) were factored into impairment assessments. Additionally, the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and rising interest rates, was more explicitly considered in the impairment analysis for 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ excluded war-related costs associated with the conflict in Ukraine, including asset impairments, inventory losses, and allowances for uncollectible receivables, from non-GAAP operating results to facilitate comparisons of ongoing performance. By 2024, MDLZ disclosed a specific incremental cost of $4 million directly attributed to the war in Ukraine, which was included in operating results. This marks a shift from exclusion in 2023 to explicit recognition and quantification in 2024, indicating a change in how these costs were treated and communicated.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, MDLZ's treatment and disclosure of war-related costs showed a notable shift. In 2023, the company explicitly mentioned \"incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine\" as a separate line item in its Adjusted EPS reconciliation, indicating these costs had a measurable impact on operating results. By 2024, however, these costs were no longer listed as a distinct adjustment, suggesting either a reduction in their financial impact or their inclusion in broader categories. This evolution implies that the war-related costs had a more pronounced effect on operating results in 2023 but were less significant or normalized in 2024.",

Additionally, it specified that pre-contract costs were generally recognized as cost of sales upon receipt of the anticipated contract. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, emphasizing that these costs are incurred to enhance the ability to meet schedule and customer milestones, while maintaining the same core conditions for capitalization. The evolution reflects a more strategic framing of pre-contract cost incurrence without altering the financial treatment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin's treatment and disclosure of pre-contract costs remained largely consistent, with a notable increase in the amount capitalized as work-in-process inventory.

As of December 31, 2022, $791 million of pre-contract costs were included in inventories, and this increased to $989 million by December 31, 2023, primarily driven by the Aeronautics business segment, particularly classified contracts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix described obligations for unknown future titles as part of its content obligations but did not specify whether these were expected to be significant. By 2024, the company explicitly stated that these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant,' indicating a more definitive acknowledgment of their material impact on future financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's disclosure regarding its obligations for unknown future content titles remained consistent between 2022 and 2024, with both years stating that such obligations are not estimated beyond the known minimum amount and are expected to be significant. However, a notable change in language occurred in 2024, where the phrase \"unknown obligations are expected to be significant\" was repeated verbatim, but the 2024 filing omitted the 2022 clarification that these obligations were \"expected to be significant\" in the prior year. This omission suggests a subtle shift in the company's stance, potentially indicating a greater emphasis on the materiality and ongoing importance of these uncertain obligations in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM identified 'Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets' as a key risk factor, indicating continued sensitivity to client budgets. However, in 2024, the company added a nuance by emphasizing a 'shift in client buying patterns' as a contributing factor to this risk, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2023. This evolution suggests that while the core risk remains stable, IBM is observing and highlighting changing dynamics in how clients allocate their budgets, potentially due to digital transformation trends or shifts toward cloud and AI investments.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the risk factors disclosed in its 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, IBM's exposure to client spending budgets has remained a consistent risk, with no significant evolution noted between the two periods. Both filings highlight that a downturn in economic conditions or shifts in client buying patterns could impact IBM's revenue and profitability. The 2024 filing adds specific mention of AI and generative AI as areas where client adoption rates and economic models remain uncertain, but the core risk related to client spending remains unchanged in nature.",

In 2024, these figures increased to $1,615 million in current loans, $110 million in 30-89 days delinquent, and $45 million in 90+ days past due. This indicates a moderate increase in both delinquency categories, suggesting a slight rise in credit risk exposure over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the distribution of Card Member Loan balances showed a slight increase in current balances and a marginal rise in delinquent balances. As of December 31, 2024, current balances totaled $2,863 million compared to $2,785 million in 2023, while delinquent balances (30-89 days and 90+ days past due) rose to $220 million and $89 million, respectively, from $231 million and $73 million in 2023. This indicates a modest increase in credit risk exposure for American Express, as delinquencies grew slightly despite overall loan balances increasing.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the decline in ENBREL sales was attributed to three factors: lower net selling price, lower inventory, and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. By 2024, the decline was attributed solely to a lower net selling price, indicating that inventory and sales deductions were no longer significant contributors to the decline. Additionally, the company's expectations shifted from anticipating ENBREL to follow the historical quarterly sales pattern in 2024 with further price declines, to expecting relatively flat volumes with continued price erosion in 2025, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price set for 2026.",
      "llm_answer": "The decline in ENBREL sales from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by continued lower net selling prices, with 2024 experiencing a 10% decrease compared to 2023, which also saw a 10% decline. The company expects ENBREL sales to follow a historical seasonal pattern with lower first-quarter sales due to deductible resets and insurance changes, as well as relatively flat volumes with ongoing net selling price declines, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price setting beginning in 2026.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs were capitalized in inventory if they directly related to a specific anticipated contract, with the costs generally recognized as cost of sales upon contract award. The company also noted that start-up costs were expensed as incurred. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the strategic use of pre-contract costs in advanced procurement for a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment, with explicit mention of recoverability risks tied to the customer's decisions on future program phases. This reflects a shift from a general accounting policy to a more risk-focused disclosure involving specific programs and financial exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin's treatment and disclosure of pre-contract costs remained consistent in terms of capitalization criteria, as outlined in both years' filings. Pre-contract costs are capitalized in inventories as work-in-process if they directly relate to a contract or anticipated contract with probable award, generate or enhance resources for performance obligations, and are recoverable. However, the 2023 filing provided more detailed risk exposure related to specific programs, such as the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at the Aeronautics segment and the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP), where performance issues and potential cost overruns could impact recoverability of pre-contract costs. This suggests an increased emphasis on disclosing program-specific risks in 2023 compared to 2022.",

However, in 2023, the Growth Markets revenue showed a decline of 2% in U.S. dollars, but still maintained a 7% increase in local currency. This indicates a slowdown in growth compared to the prior year, although positive momentum remained in local terms.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Growth Markets revenue decreased slightly in U.S. dollars by 2% (from $12,209 million in 2022 to $11,300 million in 2023) but increased by 7% in local currency. This indicates that while local currency growth was positive, the strengthening U.S. dollar led to a reduction in reported revenue when converted to U.S. dollars.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ did not exclude the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from its Organic Net Revenue calculations, and Organic Net Revenue stood at $35.6 billion, reflecting a 14.7% increase driven by net pricing and favorable volume/mix. However, in 2024, due to the significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso in late 2023 and the potential distortion on constant currency growth measures, MDLZ decided to exclude pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year (classified as 'extreme pricing') from Organic Net Revenue and related non-GAAP metrics. This change was implemented prospectively starting in Q1 2024, with the impact of extreme pricing now being separately disclosed as part of 'currency-related items.' In 2024, extreme pricing in Argentina contributed $1,167 million (3.2 percentage points) to Organic Net Revenue growth, offsetting some of the unfavorable currency translation impacts. This indicates a strategic shift in how MDLZ accounts for and reports financial performance in hyperinflationary environments.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, extreme pricing in Argentina significantly impacted MDLZ's Organic Net Revenue, prompting the company to exclude pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year from its non-GAAP financial measures starting in Q1 2024. This exclusion aimed to address distortions caused by hyperinflationary conditions, as Argentina's economic environment met the U.S. GAAP threshold for hyperinflation. By 2024, this shift indicates MDLZ's strategic approach to managing hyperinflationary markets by adjusting reporting practices to reflect more accurate performance metrics, thereby improving transparency and decision-making in volatile economic conditions.",

By 2023, the company continued to incur these costs but shifted the terminology to 'pre-contract costs' and expanded the context to include ongoing monitoring of recoverability based on the customer's decisions about future phases.

These costs were being monitored for recoverability, which could be impacted by the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program.\n\nBy 2023, the disclosure continued to highlight the incurrence of advanced procurement costs for the same classified fixed-price incentive fee contract. However, the 2023 filing provided more specific context, noting that these costs were being incurred to enhance the ability to achieve the schedule and certain milestones, and the company was actively monitoring the recoverability of these pre-contract costs, which remained contingent on the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program. The 2023 disclosure also emphasized the ongoing performance issues and the potential for additional losses if further performance issues, scope increases, or cost growth occurred.",

Regarding markdown reserves, in 2022, the reserve was not explicitly stated, but in 2024, it was reported at $222 million, reflecting a decrease of approximately $23 million from fiscal 2023. This indicates that the company experienced relatively stable shrink risk but reduced its markdown exposure, suggesting improved inventory management or stronger sales performance that lowered the need for markdowns.",

This suggests that the company experienced relatively stable shrinkage risk, supported by consistent inventory management practices, while proactively reducing markdown risk, likely through improved inventory alignment with demand.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales and explicitly warned that any shift away from nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF could adversely impact HIV product sales. In 2024, while the company maintained the same risk narrative around potential paradigm shifts affecting nucleoside-based therapies, it omitted the specific percentage of total product sales attributable to HIV products. This suggests that while the core risk remained, the level of quantitative transparency decreased in the 2024 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, GILD's disclosure regarding the risk to HIV product sales from shifts in treatment paradigms remained consistent in highlighting the dependence on nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF. In both years, the company emphasized that if treatment paradigms for HIV change and nucleoside-based therapeutics are no longer preferred, their HIV product sales would be adversely impacted. However, the 2024 filing provided slightly more context on the broader challenges in the HIV market, such as competition and the need to introduce new medications to remain competitive, but did not indicate a significant evolution in the specific risk related to TAF.",

In 2024, this exclusion was maintained and further clarified as part of the non-recurring adjustments to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods. The change reflects a more explicit justification for the exclusion in 2024, emphasizing the non-recurring nature of these items and their lack of relevance to ongoing operational performance.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, the treatment of mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses associated with marketable securities was added to the non-GAAP adjustments, with these gains or losses excluded from non-GAAP earnings measures starting in the first quarter of 2023.

In fiscal 2023, the segment contributed $13.8 billion in revenue, representing 21% of total revenues, compared to $12.6 billion, or 20% of total revenues, in fiscal 2022.

In 2023, Lockheed Martin continued to disclose these obligations but provided more detail on the accounting treatment, specifying that non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these plans were recorded as part of 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. This shift reflects a more detailed disclosure and classification refinement in 2023 compared to the primarily numerical disclosure in 2022.",

In 2023, the funded status of these plans improved, with a funded status of $387 million compared to $297 million in 2022, indicating that plan assets exceeded obligations to a greater extent. Additionally, the discount rate used to calculate obligations decreased from 5.25% in 2022 to 5.00% in 2023, which increased the present value of future obligations.

      "original_answer": "The tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income continued to benefit Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, and in 2023, it increased slightly to 14.5%. Both years cite the foreign derived intangible income deductions as a key factor in reducing the effective tax rate, alongside other credits such as research and development and employee equity awards. The consistent mention of this deduction across both years indicates that it remained a stable component of the company's tax planning strategy, even amid broader tax law changes like the research and development capitalization rules that introduced new cash tax liabilities. However, the slight increase in the effective tax rate suggests a minor reduction in the relative benefit from these deductions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the impact of tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income on Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate remained relatively stable, as both years reported effective tax rates of 14.2% and 14.5%, respectively. These rates benefited from consistent tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income, along with other factors such as research and development tax credits and employee equity awards. This stability suggests that the company's tax planning strategy effectively leveraged these deductions to maintain a favorable effective tax rate despite broader economic and regulatory changes.",

By 2024, this practice remained consistent, but the language evolved to emphasize that these assumptions were part of a broader set of economic inputs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing and foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting a more integrated and dynamic planning process that adapts to emerging policy and market conditions.",

In 2023, the company emphasized the use of its Global Outlook as the foundation for Corporate Plan assumptions, including refinery margins, volumes, and development costs. By 2024, the approach evolved to include more detailed scenario analysis and a stronger focus on the impact of policy changes and technological advancements on refinery margins.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde emphasized its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, indicating a proactive approach to cost management. By 2024, this mechanism had a negative 1% impact on sales growth, suggesting that while cost pass-through remained a feature of its contracts, it may have led to downward pressure on sales due to customer resistance or market conditions. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely strategic advantage to a more complex dynamic affecting revenue performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms showed a mixed evolution across its geographic segments. In 2023, cost pass-through decreased sales by 3% due to energy cost variances, primarily impacting the Americas and EMEA segments. By 2024, the impact of cost pass-through had shifted: it decreased sales by 1% in the Americas and 4% in EMEA but increased sales by 1% in APAC. This indicates that Linde's pricing strategy increasingly emphasized passing through energy and feedstock costs to customers, particularly in regions with favorable market conditions. The minimal impact on operating profit suggests effective cost management, as Linde leveraged higher pricing and productivity initiatives to offset the cost inflation and maintain profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD's Federal income tax provision was $3,918 million, while in fiscal 2023, it decreased to $3,764 million, indicating a reduction in the company's tax liability. This downward shift suggests a change in the company's taxable income or tax planning strategies over the two fiscal years.",
      "llm_answer": "HD's Federal income tax provision decreased from $3,918 million in fiscal 2022 to $3,764 million in fiscal 2023, reflecting a slight reduction in current federal tax expense. This decline, alongside a stable effective tax rate (24.0% in 2023 vs. 23.9% in 2022), suggests a consistent tax position with minor fluctuations influenced by adjustments in state and foreign taxes, as well as deferred tax balances. The company's tax strategy appears to remain stable, with no material impact from recent tax law changes like the Inflation Reduction Act or BEPS Pillar Two.",

Small business loans showed $45 million and $16 million in the same categories. By 2024, consumer delinquencies increased to $110 million (30-89 days) and $45 million (90+ days), while small business delinquencies rose to $56 million and $22 million respectively. This indicates a moderate increase in credit risk, suggesting potential deterioration in loan quality or economic pressures affecting repayment capabilities.",

This indicates a modest rise in credit risk, though the overall performance remains relatively stable. The increase suggests that credit risk management strategies may need to be more proactive in addressing early-stage delinquencies to prevent further deterioration.",

In contrast, 2024 saw significantly larger impairment activity, with two separate charges totaling $4.2 billion—$2.4 billion in Q1 and $1.8 billion in Q3—related to the NSCLC IPR&D intangible asset for Trodelvy following the failure of the EVOKE-01 study and the subsequent discontinuation of the clinical development program in metastatic NSCLC. This marks a dramatic increase in impairment activity, signaling a major shift in the outlook for GILD's R&D initiatives, particularly in oncology.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, GILD's partial impairment charges related to IPR&D assets increased significantly, from $50 million in 2023 to a combined $4.2 billion ($2.4 billion in Q1 2024 and $1.8 billion in Q3 2024) in 2024. This sharp increase indicates a more pessimistic outlook for certain R&D initiatives, particularly for the NSCLC program related to Trodelvy, which was discontinued in the second-line indication due to unsuccessful clinical trial results and strategic reassessments. The evolving impairment charges reflect a reassessment of the potential commercial viability and regulatory prospects of key IPR&D projects, signaling a shift in GILD's R&D priorities and risk management approach.",

In 2023, the company shifted focus to how it records components of FAS pension income/expense across different financial statement accounts and provided a reconciliation table for the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans, indicating a more structured financial presentation of benefit obligations and plan assets. This represents a shift from strategic pension risk management in 2022 to detailed financial disclosure and classification in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Lockheed Martin's treatment and disclosure of the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans evolved in several key ways. In 2023, the funded status of the plans worsened, with the net unfunded liability increasing from $5,470 million in 2022 to $6,159 million in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate from 5.25% at December 31, 2022, to 5.00% at December 31, 2023, which increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $765 million. Additionally, the actual return on plan assets was approximately 7% in 2023, contributing to the funded status but not enough to offset the increased liabilities. The reconciliation details in the 2023 filing provided a more granular breakdown of the changes in the funded status, including the impact of actuarial losses, settlements, and changes in assumptions, offering greater transparency into the factors affecting the funded status compared to the 2022 disclosure.",

In 2022, these adjustments contributed $353 million (pre-tax) to comprehensive income, driven by the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar. By 2023, the impact turned negative, with a $165 million (pre-tax) reduction, and in 2024, it improved to a $147 million (pre-tax) positive contribution.

In 2023, cost pass-through reduced sales by 6% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA, and 1% in APAC. By 2024, the impact had diminished to a 1% reduction in the Americas, a 4% reduction in EMEA, and a 1% increase in APAC.

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, foreclosure rates were listed as one of many external factors that could adversely affect customer confidence or financial condition, potentially leading to delayed purchasing decisions or reduced spending on home improvement products and services. By 2023, The Home Depot provided a more nuanced perspective, explicitly stating that adverse conditions in the housing market, including foreclosure rates, had already 'in some cases adversely impacted' customer behavior. This indicates a shift from a general acknowledgment of potential impact in 2022 to a more concrete recognition of realized effects in 2023, suggesting the company observed tangible changes in customer purchasing behavior linked to housing market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "In the 2022 10-K filing, The Home Depot noted that higher foreclosure rates could impact consumer confidence and financial conditions, potentially reducing demand for home improvement products and services. By the 2023 filing, the company expanded on this, emphasizing that rising foreclosure rates, along with inflation and interest rate increases, contributed to a shift in consumer purchasing behavior—specifically, a move away from big-ticket, discretionary purchases toward smaller, less discretionary items. This evolution reflects a more detailed analysis of how macroeconomic factors, including foreclosures, influence customer spending patterns.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD emphasized that inventory write-off charges were primarily linked to products failing specifications and quality standards, as well as changes in manufacturing strategy, with a focus on potential remediation efforts and costly alternatives. By 2024, the company shifted its emphasis, describing inventory write-offs as part of broader operational risks tied to single-entity dependencies in manufacturing and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), with a stronger focus on supply chain interruptions and their impact on clinical and commercial product availability. This evolution reveals a strategic shift from internal quality and strategy concerns to external manufacturing and supplier risks.",
      "llm_answer": "GILD's characterization of inventory write-off charges evolved from 2023 to 2024 by explicitly linking these charges to specific instances of clinical trial failures and strategic decisions to discontinue certain programs. In 2023, the write-offs were broadly attributed to changes in manufacturing strategy and product failures to meet specifications. By 2024, the company detailed specific examples, such as the failure of the Phase 3 EVOKE-01 study and the decision to discontinue development in NSCLC, directly tying inventory write-offs to these events. This evolution in disclosure suggests a more transparent and detailed approach to manufacturing and clinical risk, reflecting a heightened emphasis on accountability and clarity in financial reporting.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 19% increase in streaming revenues, with an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $11.67. By 2024, the streaming revenue growth rate had slowed to 17%, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership had decreased slightly to $10.96. This indicates a shift in Netflix's pricing strategy, potentially reflecting competitive pressures or changes in content value perception by consumers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's streaming revenue grew at a 16% annual rate, driven by a 15% increase in average paying memberships and a 1% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. While membership growth accelerated significantly (from +8,903 net additions in 2022 to +41,350 in 2024), the average revenue per membership slightly declined from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.70 in 2024. This indicates that Netflix's pricing strategy focused more on expanding its user base, particularly in international markets, rather than aggressive price hikes. The modest revenue per membership growth, partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds, suggests a balanced approach to maintaining affordability while leveraging regional price adjustments and premium offerings to sustain revenue growth.",

In 2024, the total costs increased significantly to $365 million, driven primarily by a substantial rise in compensation and benefits to $214 million and a large increase in other costs to $134 million, with facility exit costs also contributing $13 million. This represents a major transformation in both the magnitude and structure of costs.",

The composition of these costs remained primarily focused on employee compensation and benefits, with $214 million in 2023 and $189 million in 2024, alongside facility exit costs, which included impairment and accelerated amortization of assets. The slight increase in total costs was driven by ongoing integration activities and facility-related expenses, despite a reduction in employee-related costs in 2024.",

In 2024, the company reported a sharp increase in these impairments to $4,180 million, representing a substantial year-over-year increase from the 2023 level.

In 2023, the impairments were $50 million, while in 2024, they totaled $4.2 billion.

In 2023, LMT explicitly disclosed that the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these pension plans were recorded in a separate line item titled 'non-service FAS pension income (expense) account.' This indicates a more granular and transparent presentation of pension-related expenses in the financial statements in 2023 compared to 2022.",

In both years, the non-service components were recorded in the non-service FAS pension (income) expense account on the consolidated statement of earnings. In 2022, the non-service FAS pension expense was a negative $1,292 million, whereas in 2023, it improved to a negative $443 million.

      "original_answer": "In the 2023 filing, IBM disclosed Valuation and Qualifying Accounts and Reserves covering the years 2023, 2022, and 2021. In the 2024 filing, the company disclosed the same category covering the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. This indicates a shift in the reporting window, with the inclusion of the most recent year (2024) and the exclusion of the oldest year (2021), consistent with a rolling three-year disclosure approach.",

      "original_answer": "Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs increased from $2,357.7 million in 2022 to $11,180.6 million in 2023 in absolute terms. However, as a percentage of Total Net Revenues, these costs decreased from 34.0% in 2022 to 30.9% in 2023. This indicates that despite higher overall spending, the company became more efficient in managing these costs relative to revenue. The decline in the cost ratio suggests improved supply chain performance or cost containment strategies that allowed Starbucks to scale operations more efficiently year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs as a percentage of Total Net Revenues decreased from 31.7% in fiscal 2023 to 30.9% in fiscal 2024, a reduction of 80 basis points. This suggests that the company improved its supply chain efficiency during this period, likely due to a reduction in supply chain costs and the positive impact of increased sales from pricing strategies.",

By 2024, the growth pattern had changed significantly, with total Other Aesthetics Sales growing by only 3.7% year-over-year. Specifically, U.S. sales increased slightly to $1,118M from $1,060M (5.5% growth), while international sales declined to $161M from $174M (-7.1% change).

By 2023, the category retained most of these items but showed subtle changes: 'electronics' was more specifically defined as 'small electronics,' 'garden and patio' was simplified to 'lawn and garden,' and 'automotive care' and 'postage' were shortened to 'automotive' and 'stamps,' respectively. These changes suggest a slight refinement in categorization and emphasis, though the overall scope of the Non-Foods segment remained largely consistent.",

By 2023, the category retained most of these product lines but rephrased some descriptions, such as \"lawn and garden\" instead of \"garden and patio\" and \"automotive\" instead of \"automotive care.\" Additionally, \"stamps\" were explicitly listed in 2023, replacing \"postage\" from the prior year.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased to $1.6 billion. This represents a $200 million decline in the favorable impact of profit booking rate adjustments year-over-year, suggesting a moderation in the degree of positive revisions to contract cost estimates or an increase in unfavorable adjustments during 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's International Segment had $19.2 billion in assets held for sale, primarily related to its operations in the U.K. and Japan, which were subsequently closed. This indicated a strategic shift in international operations, though the segment still played a significant role. By fiscal 2024, the International Segment generated approximately 18% of Walmart’s consolidated net sales, highlighting its continued importance. However, the 2024 report noted that unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations were adversely affecting the reported performance of the International Segment and, consequently, Walmart’s consolidated results. This evolution shows that while the segment remained a substantial contributor, its exposure to currency risk had become a more explicitly stated financial vulnerability, with a direct negative impact on consolidated performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through its International Segment has had a consistent adverse impact on its consolidated financial performance between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024. Unfavorable currency exchange rate movements have led to significant adverse period-over-period changes in the reported financial performance of the Walmart International segment, which in turn negatively affects the company's consolidated results. These fluctuations have reduced the translated value of international earnings and increased the cost of goods purchased in other currencies, thereby reducing gross profit and overall financial performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, content amortization increased by $1,423 million due to the expansion of existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. This increase was a major driver of the overall rise in cost of revenues. By 2024, the focus had shifted toward the complexity and subjectivity of the amortization methodology itself, with Netflix emphasizing the judgment involved in estimating future viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. The company also implemented more rigorous internal controls and audit procedures to validate the assumptions and data used in amortization modeling, indicating a more refined and risk-aware approach to managing content amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Netflix's approach to content amortization evolved by refining its estimation methodology, particularly in terms of incorporating more detailed historical and forecasted viewing patterns. As noted in the 2024 10-K, the company amortizes content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, with the estimation process relying heavily on judgments about future consumption trends. This approach allows for a more accurate alignment of amortization expenses with the actual usage of content. Financially, this method impacts the timing of expense recognition, as changes in viewing patterns could alter the amortization period and pattern. The 2024 10-K also highlights the complexity and subjectivity of these estimates, emphasizing the importance of continuous evaluation and sensitivity analysis to ensure the accuracy of amortization expenses.",

      "question": "How has Costco's approach to square footage growth in international markets evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about its global expansion strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Costco noted that square footage growth was 'generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets' and expected this trend to continue. In 2023, this observation remained consistent, with the company reiterating that 'certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth.' However, the 2023 filing added more emphasis on the strategic importance of international expansion by highlighting that these markets have 'lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales' and 'less or no direct membership warehouse competition.' This indicates that while the company maintained its focus on international square footage growth, it increasingly framed this strategy in terms of cost advantages and market opportunity. The evolution suggests a more deliberate shift toward leveraging international markets not just for growth, but for operational efficiency and competitive positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Costco's approach to square footage growth in international markets shifted to a more measured pace, with 7 new warehouses opened in 2022 and 5 new warehouses in 2023. This indicates a strategic focus on optimizing existing international markets before rapid expansion, suggesting a shift toward quality growth and operational efficiency rather than aggressive geographic expansion.",

However, by fiscal 2024, Membership and Other Income had declined to $1,408 million from $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a reversal in the earlier growth trend.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM used observable quoted prices primarily for equity securities held in separate accounts and relied on observable inputs of comparable market transactions for corporate, government, and asset-backed debt securities. In 2024, the company expanded the scope of observable quoted prices to include non-U.S. equity securities and specifically added government debt securities traded on active exchanges. Additionally, in 2024, XOM introduced a new category for cash balances subject to withdrawal penalties, which are treated as level 2 inputs. This indicates a more detailed and nuanced approach in 2024, with increased specificity in the application of observable quoted prices across a broader set of assets.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's reliance on observable quoted prices for fair value measurement of debt and equity securities remained consistent between 2023 and 2024 in terms of methodology but showed slight shifts in asset allocation specifics. In both years, equity securities held in separate accounts were valued using Level 1 inputs based on observable quoted prices on active exchanges, while corporate, government, and asset-backed debt securities were valued using Level 2 inputs based on observable market transactions. However, in 2024, there was a marginal increase in the allocation to equity securities (particularly in U.S. pension plans) and a corresponding shift in the composition of debt securities, indicating a more nuanced approach to balancing risk and return within the investment strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved from 2022 to 2023 by significantly extending lead times and increasing financial risk exposure. In 2022, the company typically placed orders with a lead time of approximately six months, but by 2023, this had extended to at least twelve months due to supply chain constraints. This shift increased financial risk, as the company committed to larger, non-cancellable inventory orders and paid premiums or deposits to secure supply, exposing it to potential excess inventory or financial charges if demand fell short or was met by competitors.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Venclexta sales totaled $1,820 million with a growth rate of 36.1% compared to the previous year. By 2024, the total revenue contribution from Venclexta increased to $2,583 million, representing a growth rate of 12.9% compared to 2023. This indicates a significant slowdown in the growth rate from 36.1% in 2022 to 12.9% in 2024, although the total revenue contribution continued to increase.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Venclexta sales grew at a steady pace, with a 16% increase in 2024 compared to 2023 and a 13.9% increase in 2023 compared to 2022. This indicates a slightly decelerating growth rate over the two years. In terms of total revenue contribution, Venclexta's net revenues rose from $2,009 million in 2022 to $2,288 million in 2023 and further to $2,583 million in 2024, reflecting a growing contribution to AbbVie's overall revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for qualified defined benefit pension plans were part of the accumulated other comprehensive loss, with actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recognized due to differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. By 2023, these non-service components were explicitly recorded in a separate line item called 'non-service FAS pension income (expense)' within the consolidated statements of earnings, indicating a shift in how these expenses were categorized and reported financially.",
      "llm_answer": "The non-service components of FAS income (expense) for LMT's qualified defined benefit pension plans showed a significant improvement from 2022 to 2023. In 2022, the non-service FAS expense was $971 million, driven by a large pension settlement charge of $1,470 million and a negative recognized net actuarial loss of $425 million. In contrast, in 2023, the non-service FAS income was $443 million, primarily due to the absence of a major settlement charge and a smaller recognized net actuarial loss of $168 million, partially offset by a lower expected return on plan assets.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart recorded impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the Walmart International segment, primarily due to the write-off of one of Flipkart's fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as part of a strategic shift toward focusing on Myntra.com. By fiscal 2024, the nature of financial risk for Walmart International had evolved from internal strategic asset impairments to a more external and ongoing exposure to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations. Specifically, the 2024 filing highlights that unfavorable currency exchange rate movements would 'adversely affect the reported performance' of the international segment and notes that such fluctuations have already impacted results. This represents a shift from one-time strategic write-offs in 2022 to sustained financial risk from macroeconomic factors by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart International's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related financial risks appears to have remained a significant concern between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024. The 2022 10-K highlights that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates have historically had adverse effects on the company's reported results of operations, particularly for Walmart International, as local currency financial results are translated into U.S. dollars. The 2024 10-K reiterates this risk, emphasizing that unfavorable exchange rate movements continue to pose a threat to financial performance and reported results. Additionally, the 2024 filing notes the implementation of the OECD's Pillar Two initiative, which introduced a 15% global minimum tax effective January 1, 2024, adding complexity to the financial risk landscape for Walmart's international operations.",

In contrast, by fiscal year 2023, the company noted that additions to product warranty liabilities primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment, indicating a growing financial exposure tied to product warranties rather than acquisition-related goodwill. This shift suggests a transition in the nature of financial commitments associated with the segment, from acquisition-driven asset valuation to operational liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced notable changes in financial exposure. Goodwill increased significantly due to the $7.13 billion acquisition of Mellanox Technologies in 2020, with $3,431 million allocated to goodwill, which was attributed to the segment. Warranty liabilities also increased, with additions in fiscal 2023 reaching $278 million (primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment), compared to $145 million in fiscal 2022, reflecting higher exposure in this segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements were described as a component of 'Other revenues' and were specifically tied to marketing and selling consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand. The 2023 filing also mentioned that the company provided an 'insignificant amount' of assistance, including royalty relief, to certain franchisees impacted by the war in the Middle East. By 2024, the description of brand licensing remained consistent as part of 'Other revenues,' but the company noted it provided only an 'immaterial amount' of assistance, including royalty relief or deferral of cash collection for certain franchisees. This indicates a slight evolution in the framing of financial assistance, suggesting a minor reduction in support or a shift in how the company assessed the materiality of such aid in the context of global events.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements remained a small but notable component of its revenue structure, primarily through fees for consumer packaged goods and technology platforms. In 2023, Other revenues from brand licensing were $316 million, while in 2024, these increased to $423 million, reflecting a 34% year-over-year growth. This increase was driven by higher fees from franchisees for technology platforms and continued brand licensing activities, despite the negative impact of the Middle East conflict on certain developmental licensed markets.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments were influenced by factors such as legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices, unbilled claims, processing time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. The company also emphasized its compliance with the SEC Consent Order, which included procedures for limiting sales to direct customers and estimating inventory levels using internal and external data from U.S. wholesalers. By 2024, the GTN sales adjustments included additional details on external rebate programs in non-U.S. countries, such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing, and pricing claw-backs. The company also expanded its use of external information sources, including third-party market research data and written/oral inventory updates from wholesalers, and highlighted limitations in relying on such third-party estimates and timing lags. This indicates a broader and more detailed approach to GTN adjustments, especially in international markets and data integration.",

By 2024, the methodology incorporated more detailed and real-time data from U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers, including weekly months-on-hand inventory and out-movement information for approximately 89% of gross U.S. revenues.

However, in 2023, the company explicitly stated that strikes, work stoppages, or labor unrest at major manufacturing facilities or bottling operations could impair the ability to supply concentrates and syrups, which could reduce net operating revenues and expose the company to customer claims.

In 2023, this accounting treatment remained unchanged, continuing to be reported under 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings.

In 2022, the non-service FAS income was $106 million, and in 2023, it increased to $56 million.

This indicates a strategic shift toward building higher inventory levels, likely in response to supply chain challenges and efforts to 'continue to meet the demand environment' as mentioned in the 2022 filing.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM disclosed that during an extended financial market downturn, it could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding, which would pose liquidity risk and negatively impact financial flexibility. In 2024, the company repeated the same language regarding potential incremental pension funding requirements under similar conditions, indicating no substantive change in its exposure to pension-related liquidity risk. While the qualitative risk remained consistent, there is no explicit quantitative disclosure in either year that indicates a change in the magnitude of potential funding obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, IBM's exposure to pension-related liquidity risk remained consistent in terms of the potential for incremental pension funding requirements during extended financial market downturns. Both years highlight that adverse financial market conditions could negatively impact the value of pension trust assets and lead to the need for additional funding, which could affect financial flexibility. However, the 2024 filing adds that the company's results could also be impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the U.S., with potential premium increases due to unrelated company insolvencies in those regions.",

However, in 2024, the company expanded its disclosure by formally integrating Systemwide Sales into its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), providing a detailed definition and linking it directly to franchisee health, loyalty programs, and as a driver of franchised revenues. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from merely setting goals around Systemwide Sales (2023) to institutionalizing its measurement and transparency (2024), reflecting a more mature and data-driven approach to managing and leveraging system performance.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, McDonald's increased its strategic emphasis on Systemwide Sales as a key performance indicator, particularly highlighting its importance in evaluating the financial health of both Company-owned and franchised restaurants. In 2023, the disclosure focused on Systemwide Sales as a measure of overall business performance, but in 2024, the company provided more detailed metrics, such as the 1% growth in Systemwide Sales (to $130.7 billion) and a specific breakdown of sales to loyalty members.

      "original_answer": "In the 2022-2023 period, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia decreased by $377 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, and when net of foreign currency fluctuations, the decrease was minimal at $5 million. This was driven by declines in annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by higher premiums in Korea. In contrast, for 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $212 million, or 3%, compared to 2023, but net of foreign currency fluctuations, there was an increase of $149 million, or 2%, driven by growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products. Thus, while the reported revenue decline slowed from 5% to 3%, the underlying performance net of currency effects improved significantly, shifting from a slight $5 million decline to a $149 million increase.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia decreased by 5% and 3%, respectively. In 2022-2023, foreign currency fluctuations had a minimal impact (only a $5 million decrease net of fluctuations), with declines in Japan's annuity and accident & health products offset by growth in Korea. In contrast, during 2023-2024, foreign currency fluctuations had a more significant negative impact, with the Japanese yen and Korean won weakening against the U.S. dollar, yet underlying revenue growth in Korea and Australia, along with fee income in Japan, partially offset these effects.",

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning of Humira relative to newer immunology products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq evolved between the 2022 and 2024 annual filings, particularly in the context of biosimilar competition?",
      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, Humira's global sales increased by 4% in 2021, with U.S. sales rising 8% due to market growth across all indications, though international sales declined 13% due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are highlighted as gaining market share and contributing to revenue growth, with Rinvoq benefiting from expanded regulatory approvals. By the 2024 filing, while no specific sales figures are provided, Humira is described in a broader product overview context without mention of growth metrics, and Skyrizi and Rinvoq are not explicitly referenced. This suggests a shift in strategic emphasis toward the broader immunology portfolio, likely in response to biosimilar pressures on Humira.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Humira's strategic positioning has faced increasing pressure from newer immunology products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as biosimilar competition. In 2022, Humira's U.S. sales grew by 8%, but international sales declined by 13% due to biosimilar competition. By 2024, the continued expansion of Skyrizi and Rinvoq—both showing significant revenue growth—indicates a shift in market share away from Humira, particularly in international markets. This evolution highlights AbbVie's strategic focus on transitioning patients to newer, innovative therapies while managing the impact of biosimilars on Humira's legacy position.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, LLY disclosed that the retiree health benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, but did not provide specific asset composition details. By 2024, LLY provided a detailed breakdown of the asset classes for these plans, showing that public equity securities (U.S. and International) totaled $216.9 million and private alternative investments, including hedge funds ($281.2 million) and equity-like funds ($335.1 million), accounted for a combined total of $616.3 million. This evolution indicates a shift toward more granular and transparent disclosure about the asset composition of the retiree health benefit plans.",

In 2022, public equity securities (U.S. and international) accounted for approximately $184.2 million and $103.7 million, respectively, while private alternative investments, including hedge funds and equity-like funds, totaled $631.3 million. By 2024, public equity securities increased slightly to $1,905.6 million (U.S.) and $1,517.3 million (international), and private alternative investments rose to $7,288.6 million. This indicates a growing emphasis on private alternative investments as part of the overall strategy to diversify and manage risk in the retiree health benefit plans.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER reported a net income less net loss of $3,558 million, indicating a significant increase from the previous year. By 2024, NEE's 10-K filing projected NEER's capital allocation to be $3,945 million in 2025, sharply declining to $815 million in 2026 and further decreasing in subsequent years. This reflects a substantial downward shift in financial expectations and investment focus for NEER, transitioning from a year of strong reported earnings to a projected multi-year decline in capital allocation.",
      "llm_answer": "NEE's financial expectations for NEER evolved significantly from 2023 to 2024, with net income for NEER decreasing from $3,558 million in 2023 to $2,299 million in 2024. This decline was primarily driven by unfavorable changes in non-qualifying hedge activity, equity losses from investees, and impairments. In terms of capital allocation, NEER's projected capital expenditures for 2025 through 2029 show a decline compared to prior years, with a focus on wind, solar, and other clean energy projects, as well as nuclear and transmission investments. These projections reflect a strategic shift toward maintaining and optimizing existing assets rather than aggressive new investments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX recognized revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis for substantially all defense contracts, primarily related to the Raytheon segment, using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. This approach was also applied to certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. By 2024, the company continued to use the percentage-of-completion method for defense contracts within Raytheon but expanded the explanation to include more nuanced treatment of variable consideration and performance obligations spanning multiple phases of the product life-cycle, such as production, maintenance, and support. Additionally, in 2024, RTX emphasized the allocation of transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices, which was not explicitly detailed in 2023. This indicates a more structured and granular approach to revenue recognition for long-term contracts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue recognition methodology for long-term aerospace contracts within the Raytheon segment remained largely consistent between 2023 and 2024 in terms of performance obligations satisfied over time. In both years, Raytheon primarily recognized revenue over time for defense contracts due to the continuous transfer of control to customers. Revenue was recognized using a percentage-of-completion basis, typically based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. In 2024, notable events included a $102 million net operating profit benefit from resuming work on contracts with a Middle East customer and a $575 million charge from terminating a fixed-price development contract with a foreign customer. These events did not alter the core methodology but impacted specific contract outcomes.",

By 2024, Content Amortization increased to $15,301,517 (thousands), while revenue grew to $39,000,966 (thousands), resulting in a higher operating income of $10,417,614 (thousands). This indicates that although amortization costs rose, they were accompanied by substantial revenue growth, leading to improved profitability. The amortization as a percentage of revenue decreased from approximately 44.4% in 2022 to 39.2% in 2024, suggesting improved efficiency or scaling in content cost management.",

As a result, the proportion of Content Amortization relative to revenue remained relatively stable, hovering around 44-45%. However, the impact on operating income was significant, as Content Amortization, combined with other costs, reduced operating income growth. Operating income increased from $5,633 million in 2022 to $10,418 million in 2024, but the growth was partially offset by the rising Content Amortization expenses, which continued to absorb a large portion of revenue.",

In 2024, while the mention of brand licensing arrangements remained, the specific reference to consumer packaged goods was omitted from the description of revenue sources, suggesting a reduced emphasis or potential reclassification of this revenue stream.

In 2023, Other revenues were $316 million, and in 2024, they increased to $423 million, representing a 34% year-over-year increase.

      "question": "How did the treatment and disclosure of CAS pension cost in relation to FAS pension income evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin recognized CAS pension cost in each business segment's net sales and cost of sales, with the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment representing the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income and total CAS pension cost, indicating a shift from expense to income in the service cost component under FAS. This evolution suggests a favorable change in the company's pension adjustment dynamics, with CAS pension cost now exceeding the service cost component of FAS pension income to a greater extent than in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment decreased from $1,709 million in 2022 to $1,660 million in 2023. This decline reflects a reduction in the difference between CAS pension cost and the service cost component of FAS pension income. Meanwhile, non-service FAS pension income increased significantly from a $971 million expense in 2022 to $443 million income in 2023, primarily due to the absence of the large pension settlement charge in 2023 compared to 2022. Overall, the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment increased from $738 million in 2022 to $2,103 million in 2023, driven by the favorable shift in non-service components.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through effective pricing strategies aligned with historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant turnaround from a substantial decline to a modest increase within one fiscal year.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased from 23.5% in fiscal 2023 to 23.7% in fiscal 2024. The key factors contributing to this improvement included better price management in the Walmart U.S. segment, lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, and partially offsetting product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.

By 2024, RTX provided more detailed financial disclosures, reporting that exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $3.3 billion at year-end, with remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, at approximately $5.5 billion. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely amortization-life-based disclosure to a more comprehensive valuation approach that includes forward-looking financial commitments and impairment assessments tied to the success of underlying aircraft platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "RTX's treatment and valuation of exclusivity assets between 2023 and 2024 remained consistent in terms of amortization assumptions, with exclusivity assets being amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from 5 to 25 years. However, in 2024, the company reported exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, at approximately $3.3 billion, with remaining estimated commitments of around $5.5 billion, indicating an increase in financial commitments compared to 2023.

This increase in the discount rate led to an actuarial loss of $441 million in 2024, in contrast to an actuarial gain of $550 million in 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, foreign currency contracts positively impacted net operating revenues by $6 million, indicating a minor beneficial effect from currency fluctuations. In contrast, 2023 disclosures highlighted potential negative impacts on net operating revenues from labor-related risks, such as strikes or work stoppages, and consumer-related risks, including shifting preferences and health concerns around sweetened beverages. These represent a shift from direct financial instrument impacts to operational and market-based risks affecting revenues.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, the primary factor affecting net operating revenues was foreign currency contract impacts, as seen in the economic hedging strategy section, where foreign currency contracts influenced net operating revenues with a gain of $6 million. In contrast, in 2023, labor and consumer-related risks became more prominent, including challenges in attracting and retaining a skilled workforce, labor shortages, and evolving consumer preferences, which could disrupt operations and affect revenue.

      "question": "How did RTX's strategic focus on the Collins segment evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of divestiture plans and transparency around long-term aerospace contract accounting practices?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX was actively pursuing the divestiture of a portion of the Collins segment, specifically the actuation and flight control business, with a proposed sale to Safran S.A. for $1.8 billion, although the transaction was denied regulatory approval by the Italian government. This signaled a strategic intent to reduce or restructure parts of the Collins segment. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted toward operational transparency and financial reporting detail, particularly around revenue recognition for long-term aerospace contracts within Collins. The 2024 filing elaborates on the use of percentage-of-completion accounting for these contracts, including the use of incurred costs relative to total estimated costs as a progress metric. This shift indicates a strategic pivot from restructuring through divestiture to enhancing financial disclosure and operational clarity around key performance metrics in the Collins segment.",
      "llm_answer": "RTX's strategic focus on the Collins segment evolved between 2023 and 2024 through the continued pursuit of divesting non-core assets, particularly the actuation and flight control business within Collins, which was under regulatory review in Italy. In 2023, RTX entered into an agreement to sell this business to Safran S.A. for $1.8 billion, but the transaction faced regulatory hurdles, with the Italian government denying Safran's acquisition of a portion of the Collins business conducted by Microtecnica S.r.l. RTX and Safran appealed the decision and continued to evaluate options. In terms of accounting transparency, RTX provided details on long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt & Whitney, which accounted for approximately 45% of its $218 billion in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) as of December 31, 2024, with these obligations generally expected to be realized over up to 20 years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AbbVie had interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 (referencing 2021 data as the most recent in the 2022 filing), aimed at converting floating-rate interest obligations to fixed rates. By 2024, these contracts had matured in November 2022 and were not renewed, indicating a discontinuation of this specific strategy for managing floating-rate debt. This reflects a strategic shift away from hedging floating-rate obligations through cash flow hedges during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie's use of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges decreased from $2.3 billion in 2020 to $750 million in 2021, and these contracts matured by November 2022. By 2024, no new interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges were reported, indicating a reduced reliance on such instruments. This evolution suggests that AbbVie has either successfully converted or refinanced its floating-rate obligations to fixed-rate debt or is managing its interest rate exposure through other means, reflecting a shift in its strategy to stabilize interest expenses amid changing market conditions.",

By 2024, the company reported a total fair value of $2,580.3 million for Retiree Health Benefit Plans, with significant allocations across public equity securities, fixed income, and private alternative investments.

As of December 31, 2024, the total fair value of assets in Retiree Health Benefit Plans was $2,565.8 million, compared to $2,580.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in total assets is primarily driven by a reduction in public equity securities (from $216.9 million to $287.9 million) and equity-like funds (from $335.1 million to $346.1 million), partially offset by an increase in the cash value of trust-owned insurance contracts (from $1,526.5 million to $1,464.9 million).

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment was the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost, with a favorable adjustment occurring when CAS pension cost exceeded the service cost component. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (rather than expense) and total CAS pension cost, signaling a shift from an expense to income position under FAS. This reflects a notable evolution in the financial impact of pension accounting differences over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment decreased from $1,709 million to $1,660 million, indicating a narrowing of the favorable difference between CAS pension cost and the service cost component of FAS pension income. In 2022, the adjustment was $1,709 million, and in 2023, it slightly declined to $1,660 million. This suggests that the gap between the CAS pension cost, which is higher and recoverable through U.S. Government contracts, and the FAS pension income, which is lower, remained favorable but slightly reduced in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts. This represents a significant turnaround from a decline in 2023 to an increase in 2024, indicating an evolution in gross margin performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points between fiscal 2023 (23.5%) and fiscal 2024 (23.7%). The key factors contributing to this improvement were better price management in the Walmart U.S. segment, which aligned with competitive historic price gaps, and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year. These factors were partially offset by shifts in product mix toward lower-margin categories. In contrast, the prior year's decline in gross profit rate was driven by markdowns, merchandise mix, and higher supply chain costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that obligations for unknown future titles under content agreements were not determinable as of the reporting date and did not provide any forward-looking estimate. However, by 2024, Netflix explicitly stated that while it does not include estimated obligations beyond the known minimum amount, these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant.' This marks a shift from a neutral disclosure to a forward-looking qualitative warning about the potential magnitude of future liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's disclosure regarding obligations for unknown future titles under content acquisition and licensing agreements remained consistent in stating that such obligations are not included beyond the known minimum amount due to their indeterminate nature. However, the total off-balance-sheet obligations for unknown future titles increased from $12.2 billion in 2020 to $17.0 billion in 2024, reflecting the growing scale of Netflix's content commitments over this period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS was not significantly impacted by asset-related charges, as impairments and severance costs primarily affected the North America segment, with AWS assets described as consisting mainly of property and equipment and accounts receivable. By 2024, AWS became the primary beneficiary of a strategic change in the useful life assumptions for server and networking equipment, resulting in a $3.2 billion reduction in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.5 billion benefit to net income. This indicates a shift toward optimizing capital efficiency in AWS infrastructure, moving from passive asset ownership to active lifecycle management to enhance financial performance in cloud operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in AWS asset-related financial impacts from 2022 to 2024 indicates that Amazon is adapting its capital expenditure management in its cloud business to align with rapid technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2022, AWS focused on long-term asset utilization by extending server useful lives, while in 2024, it accelerated depreciation and early retirement of certain servers and networking equipment to stay ahead of evolving technology. This reflects a more dynamic and agile approach to capital allocation, prioritizing flexibility and innovation in response to industry demands.",

In 2023, while Visa continued to define Total Nominal Volume, it did not disclose updated dollar figures or comparative data. Instead, the focus shifted to qualitative disclosures, such as the relationship between service revenue and prior-quarter nominal payments volume, and explanations of data sources and potential updates. This represents a shift from quantitative transparency to methodological explanation without updated volume figures.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Visa's disclosure and treatment of Total Nominal Volume remained consistent in terms of reporting methodology, as it continued to define Total Nominal Volume as the sum of nominal payments volume and cash volume, provided by financial institution clients and subject to Visa's review. However, there was a slight improvement in transparency in 2023, as the 2023 filing included additional context on the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and provided more detailed explanations of the components of nominal payments volume, such as consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial categories. The 2023 report also included clearer percentage changes and growth metrics, enhancing the comparability of data across periods.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 98 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points between fiscal 2023 (23.5%) and fiscal 2024 (23.7%). The key factors contributing to this improvement were better price management in the Walmart U.S. segment, which included aligning prices with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that it was evaluating the impact of new segment reporting standards (ASU 2023-07), which required expanded segment disclosures including segment expenses and interim reporting of segment profit or loss and assets. Additionally, RTX announced the planned sale of its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within the Raytheon segment for approximately $1.3 billion, with related assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. By 2024, RTX provided detailed revenue recognition practices for its Raytheon segment, emphasizing that substantially all defense business revenue is recognized over time using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This reflects a shift from preparatory disclosures about upcoming standards to concrete implementation of those standards and more transparent reporting of performance obligations and contract accounting practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX's Raytheon segment experienced notable changes in financial disclosures and contract revenue recognition practices. In 2024, the segment recognized a $102 million net operating profit benefit due to resuming work on contracts with a Middle East customer after obtaining regulatory approvals, alongside a $575 million charge from terminating a fixed-price development contract with a foreign customer. Additionally, the segment's Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) increased to $218 billion as of December 31, 2024, from $196 billion in 2023, with 45% tied to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts. These developments reflect adjustments in contract management and regulatory compliance impacting revenue recognition.",

      "question": "How did Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in DCAI evolve between 2023 and 2024 to reverse the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics into a growth trend?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing hyperscaler purchasing power, internal semiconductor development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware in cloud services, which made it harder to differentiate products and led to order volatility. These factors eroded Intel's competitive position and adversely affected DCAI results. However, in 2024, Intel reversed this trend by focusing on high core count server products that increased average selling prices (ASPs), despite lower volume. This strategic shift in product mix, aimed at optimizing for performance and customization needs of cloud service providers, contributed to a 1% increase in DCAI revenue year-over-year. The internal foundry operating model also took effect in 2024, aiming to improve cost efficiency and product competitiveness, which likely supported this strategic pivot.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in DCAI evolved between 2023 and 2024 by focusing on AI acceleration and heterogeneous compute solutions to reverse the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics. The company launched the Intel Xeon 6 processors with E-cores and P-cores to address diverse workloads and introduced the Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerators with enhanced capabilities. Additionally, Intel emphasized a system-level approach with integrated hardware acceleration engines and software optimization, leveraging its installed base of Intel Xeon processors to drive growth in high-demand AI and data center workloads.",

Amazon is contesting this, but an adverse outcome could result in additional payments for both current and prior periods. This evolution shows a shift from a more general risk disclosure to a concrete example of a material tax controversy affecting accrual adequacy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, patient assistance program costs were a key component of sales rebate and discount accruals, with a 5% change in the consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability impacting revenue by approximately $615 million. By 2024, these costs remained a significant part of the accruals, but the company emphasized a more structured expected value approach to estimate these liabilities. This evolution suggests an increased focus on precision in financial exposure management related to patient assistance programs.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the role and estimation methodology of patient assistance program (PAP) costs in revenue recognition remained consistent, with PAP costs continuing to be estimated as a percentage of historical sales and incorporated into provisions for rebates and discounts at the time of sale. However, the 2024 disclosures highlight an expanded discussion of the expected value approach and factors influencing estimates, including product-specific trends and contractual terms. This indicates that the company maintains a significant financial exposure to PAP costs, as these programs contribute to material reductions in net product revenue, particularly in the U.S., where they account for a substantial portion of rebate and discount liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple's Products Gross Margin was $108.8 billion with a percentage of 36.5%. In 2024, this increased to $109.6 billion, representing a slight growth in dollar terms, while the Products Gross Margin percentage rose to 37.2%. The increase in gross margin was attributed to cost savings, although this was partially offset by a different product mix and weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. This indicates a moderate upward shift in the efficiency or pricing power of Apple's product portfolio over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's Products Gross Margin increased from $108,803 million in 2023 to $109,633 million in 2024, representing a $830 million increase. The Products Gross Margin percentage also rose from 36.5% in 2023 to 37.2% in 2024. This improvement was driven by cost savings, partially offset by a different product mix and the unfavorable impact of weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024, with a 1% increase driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, reflects Intel's strategic focus on workload-optimized solutions and heterogeneous compute offerings in the data center market. Despite a challenging competitive landscape, Intel is emphasizing AI acceleration, security, and performance through innovations like the Intel Xeon 6 processors and Gaudi AI accelerators. However, the modest revenue growth highlights ongoing competitive pressures from rivals like AMD and NVIDIA, as well as the need for Intel to further differentiate its offerings to regain market share and drive stronger growth in the high-growth AI and data center segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed that cost pass-through contributed positively to sales growth, accounting for a 2% change in sales variance. By 2023, the company emphasized that its long-term contracts provided not only cash flow stability but also the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, indicating a strategic reinforcement of this mechanism. This shows that cost pass-through evolved from being a minor contributing factor to a more integral and positively framed component of Linde’s contractual and pricing strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Linde's approach to cost pass-through shifted from contributing positively to sales growth to negatively impacting sales. In 2022, cost pass-through increased sales by 3% in the Americas, 6% in EMEA, and 2% in APAC, with minimal impact on operating profit. However, in 2023, cost pass-through decreased sales by 3%, primarily due to lower energy cost variances being passed through to onsite customers. This change reflected a more challenging energy cost environment and a strategic shift in contractual terms, which reduced sales growth but maintained operating profit margins.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, vendor allowances—primarily volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances—were described as reducing the carrying cost of inventory and were recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory was sold. These allowances were accrued as earned, particularly those tied to purchase levels, over the incentive period. By 2023, the focus shifted to the net presentation of inventory cost, which included acquisition costs, freight, and import costs, but was stated to be net of certain vendor allowances. This indicates a more direct impact on inventory valuation in 2023, where vendor allowances were factored into the gross inventory value before applying the lower of cost or market (LCM) or net realizable value (NRV) tests. The change reflects a more integrated treatment of vendor allowances in inventory valuation in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the treatment and impact of vendor allowances on inventory valuation remained consistent. Vendor allowances, primarily volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances, continued to reduce the carrying cost of inventory and were recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory was sold.

By 2024, the description remained consistent, emphasizing that the unrealized mark-to-market impact of non-qualifying hedges continued to cause earnings volatility, with the same mechanism of economic offset through unmarked physical assets. While the qualitative description remained stable, the continued emphasis on 'could be significant' in both years indicates that the financial impact of the non-qualifying hedge category remained material and volatile, with no explicit quantitative change provided.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of the non-qualifying hedge category on NEE's earnings volatility from 2023 to 2024 remained significant, as changes in the fair value of these derivatives, which do not qualify for hedge accounting, continued to be marked-to-market and reported in the consolidated statements of income. This resulted in earnings volatility, particularly for NEER, as the economic offset to these positions—such as physical asset positions—were not marked-to-market under GAAP. As a result, NEE's net income reflected only the movement in one part of economically linked transactions, leading management to view adjusted earnings (excluding non-qualifying hedge impacts) as a more meaningful measure of performance.",

      "original_answer": "The one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision remained consistent at $10.2 billion net in both 2023 and 2024. However, while the 2023 disclosure framed this as a new charge impacting the 2024 tax rate compared to 2023, the 2024 disclosure reflects that this charge had fully materialized and remained a key factor in maintaining a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. Thus, the nature of the charge itself did not change, but its impact transitioned from being prospective in 2023 to realized in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision significantly increased Apple's effective tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, Apple's effective tax rate was 14.7%, while in 2024, it rose to 24.1%. This increase was primarily driven by a $10.2 billion, net, one-time income tax charge in 2024 related to the State Aid Decision, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron's disclosures around Properties, Plant and Equipment were primarily limited to listing the note reference in the financial statements without detailed discussion of impairment triggers or sensitivity. By 2024, the company significantly expanded its disclosure, providing a detailed explanation of the impairment assessment process, including specific triggering events such as downward revisions in reserves, changes in commodity price outlook, and regulatory shifts related to environmental laws. The 2024 filing also elaborated on the complexity of sensitivity analyses due to the large number of assumptions involved, such as carbon costs, production profiles, and the pace of the energy transition—factors not explicitly highlighted in 2022. This represents a transformation in the depth and specificity of impairment-related disclosures.",

In both years, the company emphasizes that impairment reviews are triggered by significant events or changes in circumstances, such as downward revisions in reserves or price outlooks. However, in 2024, there is a more explicit mention of the impact of the energy transition and evolving environmental regulations on impairment considerations. Sensitivity analyses for impairments are noted as impracticable due to the complexity and interdependencies of assumptions, but 2024 provides a clearer explanation of how changes in key variables like commodity prices or production profiles could affect impairment outcomes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax-related adjustment impacting EBIT-adjusted consisted of a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation. In 2023, the adjustment also included a tax benefit, but this time related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a geographic and contextual change in the nature of tax-related adjustments affecting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax event in 2022 to a Korea-focused tax event in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the composition and magnitude of adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted evolved, with tax-related adjustments playing a notable role. In 2022, the total adjustments amounted to $2.125 billion, with tax adjustments contributing a $482 million reduction in tax expense, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as a result of Cruise tax reconsolidation. By 2023, the total adjustments decreased to $1.865 billion, and tax adjustments shifted to a $870 million tax benefit, largely from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Korea. This indicates a significant shift in the nature and magnitude of tax-related adjustments, with 2023 showing a more substantial tax benefit compared to the smaller tax adjustments in 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT highlighted liquidity risks tied to capital markets volatility and the potential inability to raise capital, which could hinder funding for future growth and expansion initiatives. By 2023, these risks were compounded by a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the India reporting unit, signaling a material decline in the unit's fair value and directly negatively impacting the company's ability to pursue growth initiatives. This evolution reflects a worsening financial outlook for expansion efforts due to both external market pressures and internal asset devaluations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMT's financial outlook for future growth and expansion initiatives has been significantly impacted by liquidity risks and impairment charges. In 2023, the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million for its India reporting unit, primarily due to indications of value from third parties during a strategic review, including potential divestitures. This impairment, combined with ongoing liquidity constraints from securitization agreements and the risk of amortization periods triggered by debt service coverage ratios (DSCR), has limited AMT's ability to distribute excess cash for growth initiatives. The evolving economic environment, including rising interest rates and inflation, has further constrained AMT's access to capital and increased the risk of additional impairments or financial strain on its expansion efforts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, variable rebates and incentives were described as being tied to customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds and were recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when volume- and transaction-based revenues were recognized. By 2024, these variable rebates and incentives had grown in importance, representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue. Additionally, the 2024 filing highlights that the estimation of variable rebates involves significant management judgment based on forecasted transactions, card issuance, and conversion volumes, leading to increased auditor scrutiny and classification as a critical audit matter. This indicates a transformation in both the scale and complexity of how variable rebates and incentives are managed and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, variable rebates and incentives have grown significantly in impact on Mastercard's net revenue, with contra-revenue increasing from $10,961 million in 2022 to $10,961 million in 2024, reflecting a larger portion of gross revenue being offset by these incentives. The level of management judgment required has also increased, as these rebates are tied to customer performance metrics like volume thresholds and require ongoing estimation and evaluation of customer activity, which involves complex and subjective judgments. Auditors have highlighted this area as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of judgment involved in estimating customer performance and the potential for material misstatement.",

This suggests Apple streamlined its short-term financing approach by focusing solely on instruments with maturities of 90 days or less, where it reported $3,960 million in net proceeds in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days increased significantly from $6.0 billion in 2023 to $10.0 billion in 2024. This increase suggests that Apple is leveraging longer-term short-term financing to support its operations, potentially to take advantage of favorable interest rates or to align with its liquidity needs for general corporate purposes, including dividends and share repurchases. The shift indicates a more active use of commercial paper with slightly extended maturities as part of its short-term financing strategy.",

In 2023, this figure decreased by $64 million, or 12%, resulting in an operating profit of $409 million. This decline was primarily driven by lower sales, including the impact of terminated or suspended projects in Russia, which accounted for approximately $894 million in sales in 2022 and only $238 million in 2023.

      "question": "How did the geographic sources of tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about shifts in GM's international tax positioning?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders were driven by the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from Cruise tax reconsolidation. In 2023, the adjustment stemmed from a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This geographic shift—from an internal restructuring event in the U.S. (Cruise) to a regional tax realization in Korea—suggests GM strengthened its international tax position, particularly in Asia, while stabilizing its domestic tax asset base.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the geographic sources of tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders shifted significantly. In 2022, major adjustments included the resolution of indirect tax matters in Brazil and restructuring activities in Russia, while 2023 saw a focus on valuation allowance releases in Korea and the restructuring of Cruise operations in the U.S. This shift indicates a strategic realignment of GM's international tax positioning, with a move from addressing historical tax disputes in emerging markets to managing operational restructuring and tax optimization in key markets like Korea and the U.S.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that ROU lease assets were being measured at fair value due to impairment charges that occurred in 2020, with impairment losses calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data. By 2024, PayPal's ROU lease assets had increased significantly to $599 million for operating leases and $73 million for finance leases as of December 31, 2024, up from $390 million for operating leases in 2023 (no finance leases reported then). This indicates a notable expansion in PayPal's leasing activities, particularly in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term commitments and potentially more capital-intensive operations.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Right-of-Use (ROU) lease assets increased from $390 million in 2023 to $599 million in 2024, indicating a significant expansion in its leasing activities, particularly for real estate and operational spaces. This growth suggests a strategic shift toward securing more physical infrastructure, possibly to support business operations or data center needs. The increase in ROU assets, coupled with a rise in lease liabilities, reflects PayPal's continued investment in long-term real estate commitments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company considered historical rebate payments, patient assistance program costs by product as a percentage of historical sales, and evaluated current contracts, sales trends, and product pricing when estimating rebate accruals. By 2024, while historical rebate payments remained a key input, the estimation methodology evolved to include an 'expected value approach' for accruals, and the company expanded its consideration to include government rebate budget forecasts in large European countries, reflecting a more nuanced and diversified evaluation process.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the role of historical rebate payments in estimating sales rebate accruals remained a key factor but was increasingly supplemented by additional dynamic factors. In 2023, historical rebate payments were a primary basis for estimating accruals, alongside considerations such as patient assistance program costs, sales trends, and contract terms. By 2024, while historical data continued to play a central role, the estimation process incorporated more real-time adjustments for changes in sales volume, particularly driven by the growth of incretin products, and updated evaluations of contract terms and market conditions, reflecting a more responsive and nuanced approach to accrual estimation.",

While earnings from continuing operations increased modestly by 21% (from $1,886 million to $2,286 million), the net earnings figure spiked due to an additional $9,988 million gain or adjustment, as evidenced by the large discrepancy between earnings from continuing operations and net earnings in 2023.

These gains significantly boosted net earnings, despite a decline in earnings from continuing operations, which fell by 30% in 2024 due to purchase accounting impacts from the National Instruments acquisition, restructuring charges, and a loss on the Copeland note receivable.",

This indicates a significant growth in the company's long-term tax liabilities over this period, suggesting either increased deferrals or changes in tax regulations or corporate activities affecting deferred tax obligations.",

By fiscal 2023, the Treasury Stock Balance had significantly increased to $ (95,372) million, with the company repurchasing $ (8,074) million of its common stock during the year.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for pension and postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a $428 million decrease primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and projected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a significant shift from a short-term net benefit expectation to a long-term near-complete reduction in costs, driven by changes in benefit structure and amortization patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, Disney's postretirement medical cost expectations evolved as the projected net benefit shifted from $29 million in fiscal 2022 to a net benefit of $3 million in fiscal 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in amortization of previously deferred losses, partially offset by higher interest costs. Additionally, the discount rate used to determine the fiscal year-end benefit obligation for postretirement medical plans increased from 5.47% in fiscal 2022 to 5.94% in fiscal 2023, reflecting improved assumptions about the present value of future obligations.",

However, capital expenditures in Africa rose significantly from $507.3 million in 2022 to $425.6 million in 2023, indicating a continued strategic focus on development and expansion in the region.

However, in 2023, there was no impact from the Dermstore sale, as it had already occurred in 2021, and no related adjustments were included in the 2023 EPS reconciliation.

In 2024, CCG revenue increased by 4% driven primarily by higher notebook volume compared to 2023, although this was partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to weaker demand and a decline in other CCG revenue from the exit of legacy businesses.

ASPs also declined due to a higher mix of small-core and older-generation products.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the backlog at year-end was $56,630 million, and by 2023, it increased to $60,156 million. This indicates that the company is receiving more orders than it is fulfilling within the same period, suggesting strong demand and potential for higher future revenue as the backlog is realized.",
      "llm_answer": "The backlog at year-end increased from $135.4 billion in 2022 to $147.1 billion in 2023, indicating growth in the company's order pipeline. This increase suggests strong demand for the company's products and services, particularly in key segments like Aeronautics and Space, where higher orders on classified and specific programs contributed to the growth. The rising backlog supports the potential for future revenue as these orders are fulfilled over time.",

In 2024, the company's total repayment of matured debt increased to $3,373 million, with specific repayments including $1,500 million in April 2024 and $630 million in December 2024.

      "original_answer": "The interest rate for weighted-average short-term borrowings decreased from 2.8% in 2022 to 0.4% in 2023. However, this decrease occurred alongside a dramatic reduction in the amount of short-term borrowings, which dropped from $1,599 million in 2022 to just $1 million in 2023. Therefore, while the interest rate itself declined significantly, the company's overall exposure to short-term borrowing costs was drastically reduced in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The weighted-average interest rate for short-term borrowings increased significantly from 0.1% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. This sharp rise indicates that the company faced higher borrowing costs in 2023, likely due to broader interest rate hikes in the economic environment. Additionally, the increase in the interest rate, combined with a notable rise in short-term borrowings (from $334 million in 2022 to $1,599 million in 2023), suggests a more pronounced reliance on short-term financing in 2023, which could reflect either increased operational needs or a strategic shift in capital structure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple's effective tax rate was influenced by a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, which contributed to a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. In 2024, this same one-time tax charge of $10.2 billion continued to negatively impact the effective tax rate, which remained higher than the statutory rate due to this charge, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation. The magnitude of the tax charge remained unchanged, but its ongoing effect indicates a sustained financial impact from the State Aid Decision.",
      "llm_answer": "The one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision significantly increased Apple's effective tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, Apple's effective tax rate was 14.7%, while in 2024, it rose to 24.1%.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde leveraged its long-term contracts to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, contributing to cash flow stability. By 2023, the company explicitly quantified the impact of cost pass-through in its financial reporting, showing a negative 6% variance in sales growth due to this factor. This indicates that while cost pass-through remained a contractual mechanism, it had a dampening effect on reported sales growth in 2023 compared to the more neutral or supportive role implied in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms shifted from a net positive contributor to a negative factor in sales growth. In 2022, cost pass-through contributed positively to sales, as seen in the prior year's 5% favorable impact in the Executive Summary. However, in 2023, cost pass-through decreased sales by 6% in the Americas, 3% in EMEA, and 1% in APAC, as detailed in the segment discussions. Despite this drag on sales, the impact on operating profit was minimal due to the company's ability to offset cost inflation through higher pricing and productivity initiatives. Overall, while cost pass-through mechanisms reduced sales growth in 2023, they did not significantly harm profitability.",

By 2023, the financial disclosures indicate a shift: while the Asia Theme Parks were still included in the consolidated borrowing figures, the presentation separates borrowings 'Before Asia Theme Parks Consolidation' and shows specific Asia Theme Parks borrowings as distinct. For example, total borrowings including the Asia Theme Parks amounted to $45,101 million in 2023, compared to $43,809 million before including them, indicating a $1,292 million contribution from the Asia Theme Parks. This structured separation suggests a more transparent or modified reporting approach compared to 2022, where the Asia Theme Parks were fully consolidated without such a detailed breakout.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Disney continued to consolidate the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong and Shanghai Disney Resorts) in its financial statements, as they are variable interest entities (VIEs) under its control despite holding less than 50% equity ownership. In 2023, the Asia Theme Parks had borrowings totaling approximately $1.3 billion, including loans from Shendi for Shanghai Disney Resort totaling 8.6 billion yuan ($1.2 billion) with an 8% interest rate maturing in 2036, and a line of credit of 2.6 billion yuan ($0.4 billion). Hong Kong Disneyland Resort had borrowings of HK$0.5 billion ($68 million) with an interest rate of three-month HIBOR plus 2%, maturing in 2025. These borrowings were disclosed separately, and the Asia Theme Parks were excluded from the Company’s bank facilities and covenants.

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, PayPal disclosed that TPV growth was directly impacted by the number of payment transactions enabled on its platform, and that transaction revenues were typically correlated with TPV growth. By 2024, PayPal reported TPV increasing from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, a 10% increase. This TPV growth trajectory indicates a positive trend in transaction revenue potential, as TPV is a key driver of transaction fees from merchants. The sustained increase in TPV across the filings suggests that PayPal's platform usage and merchant transaction volume were expanding, which would directly support revenue growth in line with the correlation described in the 2022 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Total Payment Volume (TPV) increased from $1.25 trillion in 2021 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11%. This growth in TPV indicates a positive trajectory for the company's transaction revenue, although transaction revenue growth (7% in 2024) lagged behind TPV growth due to factors such as changes in merchant mix and lower pricing for higher-volume transactions.

      "question": "How did the contribution of average transaction amount to comparable sales change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about Target's pricing strategy and consumer response during these periods?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average transaction amount contributed positively to comparable sales growth with a 0.4% increase, indicating that consumers were spending slightly more per transaction. However, in 2023, the average transaction amount decreased by 1.4%, becoming a drag on comparable sales performance. This shift reveals a change in consumer behavior where shoppers were spending less per visit, potentially due to economic pressures or changes in purchasing habits. Target responded with strategies such as offering 'attractive everyday price points on key items' and 'compelling promotions' to drive traffic, suggesting a shift toward value-oriented pricing to counteract declining transaction sizes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the contribution of the average transaction amount to comparable sales decreased from a 0.4% increase in 2022 to a 1.4% decrease in 2023. This shift indicates that in 2023, consumers spent less per transaction compared to the prior year, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining pricing power or a shift in consumer purchasing behavior toward lower-spending transactions. This decline in average transaction amount, alongside a decrease in traffic, reflects a broader softening in demand for discretionary categories and highlights the need for Target to adjust its pricing strategy and promotions to stimulate consumer spending.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Membership and Other Income increased by 7.0% compared to the prior year, and in fiscal 2024, the growth rate rose slightly to 7.5%. Additionally, in fiscal 2024, the income was positively impacted by higher Plus renewals and the expiration of a promotional offering that had offset membership fee increases in the prior year. By fiscal 2024, the dollar value of Membership and Other Income reached $1,408 million, compared to $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a short-term dip but sustained growth trajectory driven by membership base expansion and Plus penetration.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, Walmart's Membership and Other Income increased by 7.0% and 7.5%, respectively.

      "question": "How has Chevron's explanation of the factors influencing its effective tax rate volatility evolved between 2022 and 2024, and what specific changes in context or emphasis are evident in the company's disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron attributed effective tax rate volatility primarily to 'mix effects' influenced by the absolute level of earnings or losses and their geographic distribution across tax jurisdictions. The company emphasized that a decline or increase in the effective tax rate might not indicate future results. By 2024, the explanation remained centered on 'mix effects' but placed additional emphasis on the impact of earnings volatility without reiterating the geographic component as explicitly. Instead, the 2024 disclosure focused more broadly on the non-indicative nature of tax rate changes and linked the discussion to broader financial reporting in Note 17 Taxes, signaling a subtle shift in framing from geographic mix to general earnings volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's explanation of the factors influencing its effective tax rate volatility between 2022 and 2024 has remained consistent in emphasizing the impact of earnings volatility and the geographic mix of profits in jurisdictions with varying tax rates. However, in 2024, the company added specific context regarding the implementation of the OECD's Pillar Two global minimum tax framework, noting that while it did not have a material impact in 2024, the company is evaluating its long-term implications. This reflects an increased emphasis on regulatory developments affecting global taxation. Additionally, the 2024 disclosure highlights the complexity of tax compliance in a changing regulatory environment, particularly as new climate-related policies and carbon pricing mechanisms evolve.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple highlighted increasing investigatory expenses due to evolving data protection laws and potential noncompliance penalties, noting that these costs were substantial and could include significant fines or legal liability. By 2024, the company continued to face similar risks but emphasized a more pronounced focus on the complexity of complying with inconsistent international regulations, suggesting that the regulatory environment had become more challenging. This evolution indicates that Apple's exposure to investigatory expenses has increased due to the growing number and severity of global data protection requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's exposure to investigatory expenses related to data protection and privacy compliance has increased from 2023 to 2024, as reflected in the heightened regulatory scrutiny and the need to implement compliance measures in response to evolving laws like the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). This indicates a more complex and stringent regulatory environment, with Apple facing growing costs and operational adjustments to meet global data protection standards and avoid potential fines or penalties.",

This indicates a meaningful shift in the company's cost management, as adjusted operating expenses rose more slowly than adjusted net revenue—growing from $15,251 million in 2022 to $16,574 million in 2024, while adjusted net revenue increased from $34,250 million to $39,139 million over the same period. This trend suggests improved operational efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenue generation.",

However, the adjusted operating efficiency ratio (excluding specific items) declined from 44.53% in 2022 to 42.35% in 2024, showing stronger underlying efficiency improvements.

By 2024, total worldwide sales of Humira had declined to $8.993 billion, representing a decrease of 36.9% at constant currency rates compared to 2022. This significant drop in sales follows the expiration of Humira's key patents, which began in 2016 in the U.S. and 2018 in the EU, leading to increased competition from biosimilars and eroding its market exclusivity.",

In the U.S., sales fell by 41% in 2024 due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity in January 2023, while international sales decreased by 13%. This sharp decline indicates that Humira's market position has been severely impacted after the expiration of its key patents, as biosimilar competitors have eroded its market share and revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that future pension risk transfer transactions could result in noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period, but did not specify the magnitude or likelihood of such charges. In 2023, the company maintained the same general disclosure but added that these transactions could also result in the company making additional contributions to the pension trust, indicating a more detailed articulation of the financial risks involved. While the core risk remained consistent, the 2023 disclosure expanded on the potential dual impact of additional contributions and noncash charges.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's operating expenses rate increased by 23 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to opioid-related legal settlement charges and restructuring costs in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the operating expenses rate decreased by 60 basis points, driven by the absence of those prior-year charges, particularly the $3.3 billion opioid-related settlements and $0.8 billion restructuring expenses. This represents a significant turnaround in the trend of operating expenses relative to net sales.",

By 2024, the cumulative 'Day 2' ongoing impact was being calculated using the same 25% scaling factor, but the phase-in had progressed to 75% phased in by 2024, with full phase-in expected by 2025. This indicates that the capital impact evolved from an initial delayed implementation in 2022 to a more advanced phase-in stage by 2024.",

In 2022, 25% of the after-tax \"day 1\" CECL adoption impact and cumulative \"day 2\" ongoing impact were phased in. This increased to 50% in 2023 and 75% in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, 75% of the total impact had been phased in, with the remaining 25% to be phased in by January 1, 2025.

By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as an active segment, and instead, Intel emphasized its focus on new business areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and external foundry services through IFS. This evolution indicates a continued strategic realignment toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing capabilities, while exiting businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Intel's strategic approach to its NAND memory business shifted from divestiture to a more focused capital allocation strategy. In 2022, Intel completed the first closing of the divestiture of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, signaling a strategic exit from non-core operations. By 2023, the company emphasized a capital allocation strategy prioritizing investments in its IDM 2.0 strategy, R&D, and manufacturing capacity, while reducing reliance on share repurchases. This evolution indicates that Intel is reallocating capital toward core growth areas such as advanced manufacturing, foundry services, and product innovation, rather than maintaining peripheral businesses like NAND memory.",

In 2024, delinquencies for domestic credit cards were $7,053 million (4.54% of the total domestic credit card portfolio), compared to $6,806 million (4.61%) in 2023. The percentage of total loans delinquent in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio increased slightly from 4.61% in 2023 to 4.54% in 2024. However, the overall delinquency rate for the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio remains relatively consistent compared to the broader loan portfolio.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Grooming segment accounted for 8% of net sales, indicating its relatively smaller contribution to the company's overall revenue. In 2023, the segment saw high single-digit organic sales growth, which was notably stronger than the company's overall organic sales growth of 4%. This suggests that the Grooming segment outperformed the company average in terms of growth during fiscal 2023, showing an upward trend in its relative importance or market traction.",
      "llm_answer": "The Grooming segment's net sales grew by 4% in 2023, driven by an 8% increase in pricing and a 1% rise in unit volume, despite a 5% negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. This growth outperformed the company's overall organic sales growth of 4%, indicating that the Grooming segment performed slightly better than the company's overall organic sales trend.",

      "original_answer": "In FY2023, revenue from customers outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in FY2024, this dropped to 56%. This indicates a significant increase in U.S.-based demand for Compute & Networking segment products, which is attributed to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MMM's Personal Safety segment reported sales of $3.916 billion, reflecting a decline compared to the prior year and indicating reduced demand, particularly in contrast to the strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand in 2021. By 2023, the Personal Safety segment's sales further decreased to $3.487 billion, representing a continued downward trend. This indicates a sustained reduction in the segment's contribution to MMM's overall revenue, suggesting a potential strategic shift or reduced emphasis on this business line.",
      "llm_answer": "MMM's Personal Safety segment saw a decline in sales from $4,470 million in 2021 to $3,487 million in 2023, indicating a significant reduction in revenue over the two-year period. This decline is attributed to factors such as the prior-year strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand in 2021, which did not persist in 2022 and 2023. The drop in sales suggests that the company is facing challenges in maintaining growth in this segment, potentially due to reduced demand for pandemic-related products and competitive pressures. This indicates that MMM may be strategically repositioning or divesting parts of the Personal Safety segment, as seen with the planned spin-off of the Health Care business, which includes Personal Safety, to focus on more growth-oriented areas.",

In contrast, CCG revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 to $54.2 billion due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in the second half of the year. The decline in 2023 was also influenced by a higher mix of small core and older generation products, which lowered ASPs, despite some offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial and gaming segments.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 compared to 2022. This decline was primarily due to lower notebook and desktop volumes driven by reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in the second half of 2023 as customer inventory levels normalized.

By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing. This strategic exit removed the financial drag of the NAND segment from Intel's operations, allowing the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy and reduce restructuring and operational costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Intel continued the process of divesting its NAND memory business, which had been under a pending sale to SK hynix since 2020. The first closing of the sale occurred in December 2021, and the company fully deconsolidated its ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. As a result, the NAND memory business was excluded from Intel's core operations and non-GAAP financial measures, reflecting its status as a non-core asset. This divestiture positively impacted Intel's financial performance by allowing the company to focus on its core operations and improve its non-GAAP operating margins and earnings per share by excluding the underperforming NAND business.",

In 2024, Reported OCI increased by $151 million (1.4%), mainly due to higher pricing that included higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration, and research costs by $56 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,648 million. The magnitude of the OCI increase was significantly higher in 2022 compared to 2024, indicating a decline in the growth rate of OCI over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the Reported Operating Company Income (OCI) for the smokeable products segment increased by $427 million (from $10,394 million in 2022 to $10,821 million in 2024). The key drivers of this change were higher pricing actions, which contributed positively to OCI, partially offset by lower shipment volumes and increased costs. In 2024, reported OCI increased by $151 million (1.4%) compared to 2023, driven by higher pricing and lower marketing costs, despite a 10.2% decline in cigarette shipment volumes due to industry trends, retail share losses, and illicit e-vapor product growth. Adjusted OCI rose by $212 million (2.0%) in 2024, reflecting the positive impact of pricing and cost reductions.",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue and was specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also tied to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting a more pronounced dependency on major customers for this segment.",

In 2024, the segment experienced a 215% increase in revenue compared to 2023, driven largely by Data Center growth, particularly in AI-related applications. This growth led to a notable concentration of demand, with one direct customer accounting for 13% of total revenue and an estimated indirect customer representing approximately 19% of total revenue, both attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. In contrast, there were no customers with 10% or more of total revenue in 2023, indicating a more diversified customer base in the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Adjusted OCI increased by $313 million (3.1%), primarily driven by higher pricing, despite lower shipment volume and increased costs. By 2024, Adjusted OCI increased by $212 million (2.0%), again supported by higher pricing and, notably, lower marketing, administration, and research costs ($86 million). However, both years experienced headwinds from declining shipment volumes—$1,931 million in 2022 and $2,528 million in 2024. The company's ability to maintain Adjusted OCI growth, despite worsening shipment declines, indicates improved cost management and sustained pricing power.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Adjusted OCI for the smokeable products segment increased from $10,424 million in 2021 to $10,922 million in 2024, despite a continued decline in shipment volumes. The primary contributing factors to this growth were higher pricing actions and cost management, partially offset by lower shipment volumes and higher per unit settlement charges. The increase in Adjusted OCI margins from 57.6% in 2021 to 61.6% in 2024 indicates the company's ability to maintain profitability amid declining shipment volumes through strategic pricing and operational efficiencies.

The company also indicated that it periodically evaluates insurance coverage levels and adjusts them based on risk tolerance and premium expense. By 2023, FedEx provided more detailed insight into its self-insurance reserves, emphasizing that its estimates for property and cargo loss incorporated actuarial assumptions about claim severity, frequency, volume, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The 2023 filing also highlighted sensitivity to changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, and insurance retention levels, indicating a more refined and dynamic risk exposure management approach compared to the prior year.",

There is no explicit mention of a change in actuarial estimation methods during this period. However, the company adjusted its risk exposure management by permanently retiring several aircraft types, such as Boeing MD-11F and Boeing 757-200, to align with fleet modernization and capacity adjustments. These retirements were part of broader efforts to optimize the global network and reduce exposure to older, less efficient aircraft.",

This evolution indicates a shift from a cautious acknowledgment of uncertainty in 2022 to a more assured posture in 2023 regarding the impact of healthcare inflation on self-insurance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, FedEx's consideration of healthcare inflation in its self-insurance accruals appears to have increased, as evidenced by the rise in total self-insurance accruals from $4,535 million in 2022 to $5,069 million in 2023. The sensitivity of these accruals to healthcare inflation is highlighted by the potential material impact—approximately $230 million in 2022 and $280 million in 2023—of a five percent change in assumed claim severity. This suggests that the company is actively incorporating healthcare inflation into its risk assessment, acknowledging its significant impact on liability estimates and financial planning. The evolution reflects a more conservative and forward-looking approach to managing healthcare-related risks.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums outside the United States could negatively impact its financial results. In 2023, the company noted that premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the respective countries. In 2024, IBM repeated the same language, indicating that the risk remained consistent and no material change occurred in the exposure or the underlying factors affecting the premiums. Therefore, the potential financial impact of these premiums remained stable between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures in IBM's 10-K filings for 2023 and 2024, the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations has remained consistent in terms of risk description but with updated context. In both years, IBM noted that its results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States, with premium increases potentially being significant due to insolvencies of unrelated companies in the relevant countries. However, in the 2024 filing, there is a slight emphasis on the broader context of financial market conditions and pension funding obligations, suggesting a continued but stable risk profile without indicating a material change in the financial impact from 2023 to 2024.",

This growth indicates a strengthening position for Accenture in the Health & Public Service sector, contrasting with declines observed in other industry groups like Communications, Media & Technology, suggesting a strategic emphasis or improved market demand in this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue contribution from the Health & Public Service segment increased by 10% (from $12,560 million in fiscal 2023 to $13,841 million in fiscal 2024). This growth outpaced the overall revenue growth of 1%, indicating a strengthening strategic positioning in this industry group. The increase suggests that Accenture is successfully capitalizing on opportunities in the Health & Public Service sector, likely driven by demand for its consulting and managed services in this area.",

      "original_answer": "The sales per retail square foot increased from $604.74 in fiscal 2021 to $627.17 in fiscal 2022, representing a 3.7% growth. However, in fiscal 2023, this metric declined by 3.6% to $604.55. This reversal indicates that while the company was able to improve its in-store sales productivity in fiscal 2022, that momentum did not carry into fiscal 2023, suggesting a potential challenge in sustaining productivity gains.",
      "llm_answer": "The 3.6% decline in Home Depot's sales per retail square foot from fiscal 2022 to 2023, following a 3.7% increase in fiscal 2021, suggests a weakening trend in the company's in-store sales productivity. This decline indicates that, despite maintaining a similar retail square footage, the company generated less revenue per square foot in 2023 compared to 2022, which could reflect reduced customer traffic, lower average spending, or operational challenges in its physical stores. The drop follows a period of improvement in 2021, signaling a potential shift in consumer behavior or market conditions affecting in-store performance.",

This indicates a strengthening competitive positioning in the European market, driven by the continued growth momentum of its IQOS brand, despite challenges such as the EU flavor ban and the German excise tax surcharge on heated tobacco products.

      "original_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable increased from $24,483 million at the end of 2022 to $26,050 million at the end of 2023, reflecting a $1,567 million increase. According to the 2023 filing, this represents the company's 'estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs' as of December 31, 2023. The 2023 report also explains that the company uses an actuarial process to estimate these liabilities, considering factors like time from service date to claim processing, seasonal variances, and healthcare cost trends. This indicates that the company's obligation for unpaid medical costs grew year-over-year, and the estimation methodology remained consistent and centrally controlled.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable increased from $21,872 million at the beginning of 2021 to $24,483 million at the end of 2021, indicating a rise in the company's liability for unpaid medical costs during this period. This increase suggests that the company faced higher obligations for incurred but not yet paid medical claims, potentially due to factors like increased healthcare utilization or reserve adjustments. The continued growth in medical costs payable from 2022 to 2023 would need to be analyzed using the 2023 data to determine if this trend persisted.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, KO reported net operating revenues of $45.754 billion, reflecting steady growth from $43.004 billion in 2022 and $38.655 billion in 2021. However, the 2024 filing highlights several operational and integration-related risks that could threaten this growth trajectory. Specifically, KO notes that challenges in integrating acquired businesses—such as delays in realizing cost synergies, difficulties in extending internal controls, and potential increases in costs due to integration issues—could negatively affect financial results. Additionally, risks related to third-party service providers failing to meet commitments, labor unrest affecting manufacturing and bottling operations, and the inability to offset cost increases through pricing or productivity initiatives all pose direct threats to maintaining revenue momentum. These risks, if realized, could materially reduce or even reverse the upward trend in net operating revenues observed in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Specific operational and integration-related risks identified in KO's 2024 10-K that could threaten the sustainability of its 2023 revenue growth include challenges in integrating acquired businesses or bottling operations, potential disruptions from productivity initiatives, and the risk of failure to adapt to evolving consumer preferences and digital transformation. These risks could lead to increased costs, reduced efficiency, loss of market share, and negative impacts on brand reputation, all of which could reduce future net operating revenues. Additionally, supply chain disruptions and labor-related issues could further hinder growth by increasing input costs and reducing operational effectiveness.",

However, by fiscal 2024, the Core Routing portfolio was part of an overall revenue decline in the Networking product category, which fell by 15% ($5.3 billion), including a specific decline in enterprise routing. This shift indicates a deterioration in the Core Routing portfolio's ability to support revenue growth in the Networking category, despite pockets of strength like SD-WAN.",

In fiscal 2023, the Core Routing portfolio had driven growth in the Networking category, particularly through offerings like the Cisco 8000 series and webscale provider market. However, in fiscal 2024, the Core Routing portfolio, along with other Networking segments like enterprise routing and routed optical networking, faced revenue declines. This shift highlights a weakening role of Core Routing within the Networking category, as customer spending became more cautious and demand for certain core infrastructure solutions softened.",

By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had shifted to a positive contribution of 1.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, and 1.0% in 2023 compared to 2022. This indicates a significant reversal in the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, turning a prior headwind into a modest tailwind over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a positive contribution to a negative one. In 2022, currency exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by 1.0%, whereas in 2024, they negatively impacted sales by 0.5% due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. This indicates that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has become more volatile and potentially more detrimental to sales growth in recent years, as a stronger dollar reduces the value of foreign sales when converted to U.S. dollars.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle's Cloud Services and License Support Expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and infrastructure investments made to support the growth in its cloud and license business. By fiscal 2024, these expenses had risen to $8,783 million, reflecting a 21% increase in constant currency compared to fiscal 2023. This indicates a continued and accelerating investment in cloud infrastructure and support functions, aligning with the company's strategic focus on expanding its cloud offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's Cloud Services and License Support Expenses increased from $7,222 million in fiscal 2023 to $8,783 million in fiscal 2024, representing a 21% growth in constant currency. This significant rise indicates that Oracle is investing heavily in its cloud and license business, particularly in technology infrastructure to support growing customer demand for cloud services and license support. The company expects this trend to continue as it expands data center capacity and enters new geographic markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016 through 2021 totaled $1,439 million. In 2023, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident years increased to $2,055 million. This significant rise indicates a lengthening of the claims settlement timeline, suggesting that AIG is taking longer to settle claims, which could imply either more complex claims or a more conservative approach to claims resolution. This also points to potential reserving implications, as the company may have initially underestimated the ultimate payout for these accident years.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016 through 2021 increased from $7,286 million to $7,286 million, indicating no change in the cumulative paid losses for these years. This suggests that the company's claims settlement timeline for these accident years remained stable, with no significant acceleration or delay in settling claims. The reserving practices appear to have been consistent, as there was no notable change in the cumulative paid losses, indicating that the reserves set aside for these claims were appropriately estimated and managed.",

By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had decreased reported sales by 0.5% year-over-year. This indicates that DHR's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations had lessened by 2024 compared to 2022, although the U.S. dollar's strengthening against other major currencies still had a modest negative impact on sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on DHR's reported sales shifted from a positive to a negative influence. In 2022, the U.S. dollar weakened against major currencies, contributing a 1.0% increase in reported sales. By 2024, the U.S. dollar had strengthened, leading to a 0.5% decrease in reported sales.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel had already completed the divestiture of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, indicating a strategic exit from this segment as part of its capital allocation strategy that prioritized investment in core IDM 2.0 initiatives and away from non-strategic assets. By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as part of Intel's active operations, and instead, the company emphasized winding down other non-core businesses like Intel Optane, further signaling a sharpened focus on strategic areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and its internal foundry model. This evolution reflects a broader strategic shift toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing, while divesting or discontinuing businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",

By 2024, this figure had decreased to $0.5 billion, with only an insignificant amount tied to GE Vernova. This reduction reflects the tax implications of the spin-off, as GE no longer retained the associated tax benefits from the spun-off entity. The change indicates a significant shift in GE’s deferred tax position following the separation of GE Vernova, reducing the company’s future tax obligations tied to those non-U.S. losses.",
      "llm_answer": "The spin-off of GE Vernova between 2023 and 2024 impacted GE's deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses as follows: the amounts recorded for these deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, decreased from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, to $0.5 billion at December 31, 2024. This reduction was primarily driven by the separation of the GE Vernova business, which contributed a significant portion of the non-U.S. net operating losses, particularly those associated with discontinued operations.",

In the 2023 disclosure, cumulative paid losses for accident year 2014 decreased to $439 million and for accident year 2015 decreased to $495 million.

This indicates that AIG continued to pay out claims for these older accident years, reflecting ongoing claim settlement activity.

In 2022, currency exchange rates positively impacted sales growth by 1.0%, while in 2024, they negatively impacted sales by 0.5% due to the strengthening U.S. dollar.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE completed the separation of GE HealthCare through a spin-off on January 3, 2023, and its historical results were reported as discontinued operations. By 2024, GE continued to disclose financial impacts related to GE HealthCare, specifically noting that $0.6 billion of non-U.S. net operating losses associated with discontinued operations at the end of 2023 were reduced to an insignificant amount by the end of 2024. This reflects a significant decrease in the financial exposure or tax implications tied to the previously spun-off GE HealthCare business within GE's consolidated disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, GE HealthCare is no longer reported as part of GE's continuing operations and is classified as discontinued operations in GE's consolidated financial disclosures. In 2023, the historical results of GE HealthCare were reported as discontinued operations, and the spin-off was completed on January 3, 2023. The financial impact of GE HealthCare in 2023 included significant cash flows from investing activities related to the separation, with $7.6 billion in cash received. In 2024, the financial impact of GE HealthCare is limited to discontinued operations, with cash flows primarily reflecting lower activity compared to 2023, including a decrease in cash used for investing activities due to net settlements and reduced cash related to the separation.",

      "question": "How has the risk profile of American Express's Discount Revenue evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to merchant surcharging practices and airline merchant exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Discount Revenue was described as American Express’s largest revenue source, primarily earned from transactions at merchants accepting American Express cards, with no specific emphasis on surcharging or airline-related risks. By 2024, the company explicitly noted that surcharging and differential acceptance practices in regions like Australia, Canada, and the EU were materially impacting merchant discount rates and card usage. Additionally, in 2024, the company highlighted a 7% exposure of worldwide billed business to airline merchants, introducing credit risk if airlines fail to deliver services after payments are made. This indicates a shift from viewing Discount Revenue as a stable core income stream to recognizing it as increasingly vulnerable to external pressures such as regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and sector-specific credit risks.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, American Express's risk profile related to Discount Revenue has shown increased exposure due to merchant surcharging practices and airline merchant exposure. The company has observed a rise in surcharging on American Express cards in jurisdictions where it is permitted, particularly in certain merchant categories, with surcharges sometimes being higher than those on competing cards or absent for Visa and Mastercard. This differential surcharging could suppress card usage and negatively impact transaction volumes and revenue. Additionally, spending at airline merchants, which accounted for approximately 7% of worldwide billed business in 2024, exposes the company to credit risk, as American Express may bear losses if airlines fail to deliver purchased services. These factors highlight a growing risk to Discount Revenue stability as surcharging practices expand and airline-related credit risks persist.",

This represents a 4.2% decrease over the two-year period. The decline was primarily driven by the sale of the RCS business, which reduced the Medical Surgical segment by $208 million.

During this period, the gross margin contribution from Products slightly increased from $114,728 million in 2022 to $108,803 million in 2023, while the gross margin from Services grew significantly from $56,054 million in 2022 to $60,345 million in 2023.

The composition of gross margin contributions shifted during this period: the Products gross margin percentage rose slightly from 36.3% to 37.2%, while the Services gross margin percentage increased more significantly from 71.7% to 73.9%.

However, in 2023, PEP disclosed a $5 million charge related to the AMESA segment under 'COVID-19 charges,' suggesting that the company's exposure had shifted from long-term asset amortization to short-term costs associated with the pandemic.

      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures in the 2022 and 2023 reports, PEP's financial exposure to the AMESA segment evolved as follows:\n\nIn 2022, AMESA had a net revenue of $6,078 million and an operating profit of $858 million. The segment faced pre-tax charges of $15 related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including impairments and other costs. Additionally, AMESA recorded $31 million in pre-tax impairment charges related to brands from the Pioneer Foods acquisition.\n\nIn 2023, AMESA's net revenue slightly decreased to $6,078 million (unchanged from 2022), while its operating profit remained at $858 million. However, the segment recorded a pre-tax credit of $13 million, primarily adjustments for changes in estimates of previously recorded amounts. AMESA also incurred $6 million in pre-tax impairment charges, primarily related to brands from the Pioneer Foods acquisition. Overall, AMESA's exposure remained relatively stable in 2023, with adjustments and impairments being less significant compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE disclosed that upon spin-off, GE Vernova would be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support-related payments, with an expectation that the fair value of this obligation would not be significant due to the low probability of loss. GE's exposure under these credit support arrangements could not be reasonably estimated, but contractual maturities of $15 billion each for Power and Renewable Energy segments within five years were highlighted. By 2024, the deferred tax assets associated with losses in discontinued operations, which include GE Vernova, decreased from $0.6 billion in 2023 to an insignificant amount, suggesting a reduction in the tax basis liability linked to these indemnifications. This indicates that the spin-off led to a material shift in how these obligations were accounted for, with GE no longer carrying the same level of tax-related exposure tied to GE Vernova's past credit support arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, GE's financial obligations related to GE Vernova's credit support arrangements remained largely consistent in terms of indemnification responsibilities, with GE retaining obligations under parent company guarantees until they are novated or terminated post-spin-off. GE Vernova was obligated to indemnify GE for any credit support-related payments GE made, though the fair value of this indemnification obligation was not expected to be significant due to the low probability of loss. In terms of deferred tax asset implications, the 2024 filing noted a reduction in deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, from $1.0 billion in 2023 to $0.5 billion in 2024, with a portion tied to GE Vernova's operations. This suggests a potential reassessment of future tax recoverability as the spin-off progressed.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple noted the risk of a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs' due to noncompliance with payment card industry data security standards, which could 'materially adversely affect the Company's business.' By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize not only the risk of increased costs but also the growing regulatory and compliance burden Apple faces globally, including 'an increasing number of federal, state and international laws' that heighten the potential for penalties. This indicates a shift from a general risk acknowledgment in 2022 to a more pronounced concern over the expanding regulatory environment in 2023, which likely exacerbates the financial exposure related to transaction costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, iPhone net sales showed an increase compared to 2021, primarily driven by the launch of new iPhone models since the fourth quarter of 2021. However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth in 2022 to stagnation in 2024 suggests a decline in the momentum of iPhone sales performance over time, potentially indicating market saturation or reduced consumer demand for new model releases during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, iPhone net sales showed a slight decline, decreasing from $205.5 billion in 2022 to $201.2 billion in 2024. While iPhone sales were flat in 2024 compared to 2023, they marked a reversal from the 7% growth in 2022. This suggests that the iPhone's growth trajectory has plateaued, potentially indicating market saturation or reduced demand for newer models, despite continued product innovation.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, Apple stated that failing to follow payment card industry data security standards could result in 'significant fees or fines.' In the 2023 filing, Apple maintained that potential penalties include 'significant fees or fines,' but added that the company could also experience a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards.' This evolution indicates a more detailed articulation of the financial and operational consequences tied to noncompliance in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "In both the 2022 and 2023 filings, Apple describes the consequences of failing to meet payment card industry (PCI) data security standards as potentially incurring significant fees or fines, increased payment card transaction costs, or losing the ability to process payment cards, which could materially adversely affect its business. However, the 2023 filing adds more context about the broader regulatory environment, such as the impact of laws like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and increased global regulatory scrutiny, which may heighten the risks associated with noncompliance. This suggests a slight evolution in the description, with the 2023 filing emphasizing the growing complexity and potential consequences of regulatory changes in data security standards.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the filing explicitly stated that 'our ability to return capital to shareholders [...] may be limited [...] by our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' In 2023, this language was expanded to include the phrase 'our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations [...] and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' This evolution indicates a more nuanced disclosure that retains the prior year's emphasis on preferred stock dividends as a limiting factor but adds a broader regulatory and governance context. This suggests the company is reinforcing the conditional nature of capital returns, particularly tied to preferred stock obligations, while emphasizing board discretion and regulatory constraints.",
      "llm_answer": "The disclosure regarding the impact of preferred stock dividends on capital return decisions between 2022 and 2023 shows a shift in emphasis toward greater caution and alignment with regulatory and financial constraints. In 2022, the focus was on the general limitations imposed by U.S. banking laws and the need to pay full and timely dividends on preferred stock before returning capital to common shareholders. By 2023, the disclosure expanded to highlight the company's discretion in capital return decisions while explicitly noting that these decisions are subject to regulatory capital planning requirements and the need to maintain sufficient capital levels.

      "question": "How did Altria's treatment and disclosure of NPM Adjustment Items evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of their impact on adjusted operating results?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Altria excluded NPM Adjustment Items from its adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate forecasts, noting that these items could be significant, unusual, or infrequent, and difficult to predict. The company did not provide a GAAP reconciliation for these exclusions. By 2023, Altria explicitly disclosed the financial impact of NPM Adjustment Items in its operating results, reporting a $29 million impact in Smokeable Products, which was factored into the reconciliation between reported OCI and adjusted OCI. This represents a shift from exclusion to explicit quantification within operating performance metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Altria's treatment and disclosure of NPM Adjustment Items showed a reduction in their impact on adjusted operating results. In 2022, NPM Adjustment Items reduced reported OCI by $63 million, while in 2023, the reduction was $29 million. This indicates a decline in the magnitude of these adjustments, suggesting either fewer disputes or smaller resolution amounts in 2023 compared to 2022. Both years excluded NPM Adjustment Items from adjusted OCI to reflect underlying operational performance.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom allocated $110 million to intangible assets primarily within its infrastructure software segment through acquisitions. By fiscal year 2024, Broadcom significantly enhanced this segment through the acquisition of VMware, a leading provider of multi-cloud services, in a transaction valued at approximately $84.2 billion (including both cash and stock). This represents a major strategic shift from smaller-scale asset acquisitions to a transformative acquisition aimed at strengthening Broadcom’s infrastructure software capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Broadcom significantly enhanced its strategic positioning in the Infrastructure Software segment from fiscal year 2022 to 2024 through major acquisition activity. In 2022, it announced the $61 billion pending acquisition of VMware, which was completed in November 2023, substantially expanding its infrastructure software capabilities by integrating VMware’s multi-cloud services. Additionally, in 2022, Broadcom acquired the Symantec Corporation Enterprise Security Business for $10.7 billion in 2019, which bolstered its cybersecurity offerings and aligned with its mission-critical infrastructure software portfolio. These acquisitions reflect Broadcom's strategy to strengthen its infrastructure software segment by acquiring leading technology and expanding its solutions for enterprise IT environments.",

This indicates a significant shift in the company's claims management or reserving practices, moving from a net positive development in prior years to a negative adjustment in 2024, suggesting either overestimation of prior loss reserves or a change in claims settlement patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development for AIG decreased from $74 million in 2022 to $44 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue significantly declined from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, Paxlovid was part of a broader set of risks related to the company's efforts to develop and commercialize COVID-19 products, including Comirnaty, with specific concerns about reduced demand, inventory write-offs, and challenges transitioning to a commercial market. By 2024, Paxlovid's global revenue dropped by 57% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand globally, especially in China, where there was a non-recurrent surge in COVID-19 infections in early 2023, and a transition to an out-of-pocket market in the second quarter of that year. Additionally, the global market for COVID-19 treatments had become more endemic and seasonal, leading to reduced demand and lower contractual deliveries in most international markets.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue increased significantly between 2023 and 2024, with a global revenue of $5,716 million in 2024 compared to $11,220 million in 2023. The growth in 2024 was primarily driven by a non-cash revenue reversal of $3.5 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, a $771 million favorable final adjustment in the first quarter of 2024, and a one-time contractual delivery of treatment courses to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile in the third quarter of 2024. However, this growth was partially offset by lower contractual deliveries in international markets due to the transition to traditional commercial market sales and reduced global demand, particularly in China.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software segment was described as generating a portion of the company's net revenue, with software solutions that enabled customers to manage and secure applications across various platforms. However, the segment was not yet a central strategic focus, as evidenced by the pending $61 billion acquisition of VMware, which was expected to close in fiscal year 2023. By fiscal year 2024, the relationship had transformed significantly: Broadcom had completed the VMware acquisition on November 22, 2023, and integrated VMware's infrastructure software capabilities into its portfolio. The acquisition involved a financial commitment of approximately $30,788 million in cash and $53,398 million in Broadcom stock, marking a substantial increase in both strategic emphasis and financial investment in the Infrastructure Software segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, Broadcom significantly elevated the strategic positioning of its Infrastructure Software segment by acquiring VMware in November 2023, which substantially expanded its capabilities in multi-cloud services and enterprise IT solutions. This acquisition marked a major financial commitment, with the VMware deal valued at approximately $61 billion, and it was fully integrated into Broadcom's operations starting in fiscal year 2024.

However, by 2024, the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. on January 31, 2023, led to a 41% decline in U.S. sales due to direct biosimilar competition, while international sales dropped by 13% due to continued biosimilar pressures. The primary factors driving the change in performance were the loss of market exclusivity and the increasing impact of biosimilar alternatives in both domestic and international markets.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, AMD disclosed 'anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls' as a standalone risk factor without explicit linkage to strategic initiatives. By 2023, the disclosure expanded to frame these same information security costs within the context of broader strategic efforts, specifically mentioning the 'expected implications from the development of the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI.' This indicates a shift from viewing information security costs purely as an operational expense to positioning them as part of a strategic response to technological and regulatory trends.",
      "llm_answer": "Between the 2022 and 2023 filings, AMD's disclosure regarding information security costs became more explicit and was increasingly framed in the context of broader strategic initiatives. In the 2022 filing, AMD mentioned \"anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls\" as a forward-looking statement, but it did not explicitly tie these costs to specific strategic areas. In contrast, the 2023 filing included a new Item 1C on Cybersecurity and expanded the discussion of information security costs, linking them to the company's strategic focus on AI development, regulatory adaptation, and the need to support emerging technologies. This evolution reflects a more integrated view of information security as a foundational element of AMD's innovation and compliance strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion, driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and a positive mix of traffic, including a relative increase in industrial shipments. By 2023, freight revenues decreased 3% to $22.6 billion, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenues and a negative mix of traffic, such as decreased lumber shipments and increased short-haul rock shipments, despite core pricing gains. Fuel surcharge revenues declined from $3.7 billion in 2022 to $3.0 billion in 2023, reflecting a 15% decrease in fuel prices and lower volume. These changes indicate a shift from growth driven by broad-based volume and pricing in 2022 to a contraction influenced by fuel and mix effects in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, freight revenues for the company decreased by 3%, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge contributions and a negative traffic mix. Fuel surcharge revenues dropped by $0.7 billion, driven by a 15% decline in fuel prices and lower shipment volumes, partially offset by the lagged impact of fluctuating fuel prices on surcharge recoveries. Traffic mix impacts were also significant, with decreased lumber shipments and increased short-haul rock shipments contributing to a less favorable revenue profile. Additionally, volume declined by 1%, particularly in intermodal and coal shipments, further affecting freight revenue performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD reported a net inventory balance of $1,955 million as of December 25, 2021, and described its process of adjusting inventory carrying value based on historical and forecasted demand, with a focus on recent historical activity. By 2023, the net inventory balance had increased significantly to $4,351 million as of December 30, 2022. Additionally, AMD's language shifted from 'inventory carrying value adjustments' to 'inventory excess and obsolescence reserves,' indicating a more refined and possibly more conservative approach to inventory valuation. This evolution suggests a growing complexity in inventory management, likely due to increased inventory holdings and forward-looking risk assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMD's inventory carrying value increased significantly from $1,955 million to $4,351 million. The methodology for estimating inventory adjustments remained consistent, with the company adjusting inventory to the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value based on reviews of on-hand inventory against forecasted demand, historical activity, and anticipated market conditions. However, the scale of inventory more than doubled, indicating a substantial increase in inventory complexity and management challenges, likely driven by higher production volumes or shifts in demand dynamics during this period.",

In contrast, in 2023, the licensing gain from royalty income was significantly lower at $34 million, with no mention of milestone-related gains.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Canadian segment gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to improvements in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increased 2% rewards. In 2024, the same factors were cited—increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—again contributing positively, with the same offsetting effect from increased 2% rewards. The specific contribution magnitudes were consistent across both years, indicating a sustained trend in margin performance drivers within the Canadian segment.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the Canadian segment's gross margin percentage increased, driven by improvements in both core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary businesses. In 2023, the gross margin percentage was impacted by charges related to the discontinuation of charter shipping activities, while in 2024, these charges were absent, contributing to the improvement. Additionally, in 2024, core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary businesses (such as e-commerce and gasoline) positively influenced the gross margin percentage, although increased 2% rewards partially offset these gains.",

Simultaneously, Pfizer received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) from the JV, which it repaid in July 2022 after receiving £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion. By 2024, this indemnification had been terminated in conjunction with the demerger, and there was no indication of ongoing loan obligations or new financing arrangements with the JV. This marks a full resolution of the indemnification and loan relationship that existed in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Pfizer's financial relationship with the Consumer Healthcare JV evolved as follows: \n\nIn 2022, Pfizer had an indemnification obligation for 32% of any amounts payable by GSK under its guarantee of the JV's issued notes. Following the issuance of these notes in March 2022, the JV loaned proceeds to Pfizer and GSK on a pro-rata basis. Pfizer received a £2.9 billion loan (equivalent to $3.7 billion) at 1.365% interest, which was repaid in July 2022 alongside a £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) pre-separation dividend from the JV. This terminated Pfizer's indemnification obligation.\n\nBy 2024, Pfizer had significantly reduced its equity stake in the JV (Haleon) through two major share sales in 2024, reducing its ownership from 32% to approximately 15%. As a result, Pfizer no longer exercised significant influence over Haleon and ceased applying the equity method of accounting for its investment. The remaining shares were reclassified as an equity security with a readily determinable fair value. No further indemnification obligations or loan transactions were mentioned for 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal disclosed that retail e-commerce sales were among several macroeconomic factors influencing transaction and credit losses, specifically affecting the funding mix and consumer spending behavior. By 2024, the company placed a more structured and explicit emphasis on retail e-commerce sales as part of the macroeconomic forecasts used in its consumer loss models, particularly for the revolving credit portfolio. This shift indicates a more direct integration of retail e-commerce trends into the credit risk modeling process. The 2024 allowance for consumer loans receivable was $341 million, with models now explicitly incorporating forecasted retail e-commerce sales sourced externally using a single economic scenario for each period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PFE reported Other (income)/deductions-net as a $4,878 million expense, largely driven by significant losses on equity securities ($1,344 million) and a $2,547 million expense related to net periodic benefit costs. By 2024, this line item reversed to a $4,388 million income, indicating major improvements or one-time gains not present in earlier filings. This transformation highlights a strategic or market-driven shift that significantly boosted non-operational income over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The significant reversal in PFE's Other (income)/deductions-net from a $4,878 million expense in 2022 to a $4,388 million income in 2024 was primarily driven by several key business factors. In 2024, higher net interest income and favorable changes in equity securities contributed positively, while 2022 had significant net losses on equity securities. Additionally, 2024 saw gains from the partial sale of investments, such as Haleon, whereas 2022 was impacted by substantial intangible asset impairment charges. The shift from net periodic benefit credits in 2022 to costs in 2024 also played a role, as did changes in legal and restructuring-related expenses. These factors collectively led to the reversal in net income/(expense).",

This growth in Household cards, alongside an overall increase in total paid members and cardholders, indicates that Costco's membership growth strategy is effectively expanding its customer base, likely through a combination of new member acquisition and retention efforts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, subscription revenue accounted for 92% of Adobe's total revenue, reflecting a dominant reliance on subscription-based income. However, by 2024, subscription revenue had declined significantly as a percentage of total revenue to just 8%. This dramatic decrease indicates a major shift in Adobe's revenue mix, suggesting a growing proportion of revenue coming from non-subscription sources such as services and other revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe's subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from 92% in 2022 to 95% in 2024. This shift indicates a continued strengthening of the company's subscription-based revenue model, reflecting sustained demand for its cloud offerings and a strategic focus on transitioning customers to higher-value subscription services.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate was 0.94%, which decreased slightly to 0.93% in 2024. This minor decrease followed an increase in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by unfavorable changes in product mix, particularly a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing, partially offset by favorable regional mix changes. In 2024, the slight decline in the rate suggests that the company may have experienced more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies, although the overall rate remained relatively stable.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate slightly decreased from 0.94% in 2023 to 0.93% in 2024. This change was driven by favorable shifts in regional mix, product mix, and third-party pricing incentives within core PayPal products and services, despite an overall increase in transaction expense due to Braintree's higher expense rate contributing more to TPV.",

At the same time, the JV loaned Pfizer £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum. In July 2022, Pfizer received £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from the JV, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion, which was used to repay the £2.9 billion loan. Following the demerger, Pfizer's indemnification obligation was terminated.

By 2024, the total paid membership grew to 76,200, with 63,700 Gold Star members (83.6%) and 12,500 Business members (16.4%).

      "question": "How did UPS's Transformation Strategy Costs evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic investment focus during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, UPS reported Transformation Strategy Costs of $95 million for 2021 and $83 million for 2020, showing a modest 14.5% year-over-year increase. By 2024, the company's total Transformation Strategy Costs had significantly increased to $322 million for 2024 from $435 million in 2023. This indicates a substantial shift in strategic investment focus, with UPS accelerating its transformation initiatives under Transformation 2.0, including efforts like 'Spans and Layers,' 'Business Portfolio Review,' and 'Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined.' The earlier phase of transformation was smaller in scale compared to the expanded and more diversified transformation initiatives undertaken in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "UPS's Transformation Strategy Costs decreased from $435 million in 2023 to $322 million in 2024. This decline indicates that the company is nearing completion of its Transformation 2.0 initiatives, which focus on reducing management layers, optimizing business portfolios, and investing in technology. The reduction in costs suggests that UPS is finalizing these strategic investments and shifting toward realizing the anticipated operational efficiencies and cost savings from these initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed that Estimated Current LTV ratios were updated monthly using a home price appreciation index and were used as part of the credit quality stratification for First Mortgages and HELOCs. By 2023, Schwab continued to update Estimated Current LTV ratios monthly using the same methodology, but expanded its disclosure to include detailed credit quality indicators that incorporated this metric, indicating a more comprehensive integration into credit reporting processes. This represents a transformation in how Estimated Current LTV is utilized, moving from a monitored metric to a disclosed and detailed credit quality component.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Schwab maintained its practice of updating Estimated Current LTV ratios on a monthly basis using a home price appreciation index. However, in 2023, there was a more explicit integration of Estimated Current LTV into credit quality reporting, with detailed stratification by origination year, borrower FICO scores, and other credit metrics. This enhanced integration reflects a more comprehensive approach to credit risk assessment and transparency in disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring significant fees or fines if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or loss of the ability to process payment cards. By 2024, the language evolved to emphasize not only the continuation of these risks but also the broader financial implications, such as materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. While the core risk remained consistent, the framing in 2024 suggests a heightened awareness and potential escalation in the severity of consequences, indicating an increased exposure or at least a more explicitly communicated risk posture.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's exposure to potential fees or fines related to payment card data security standards has remained consistent from 2022 to 2024, with the company acknowledging that failure to follow payment card industry data security standards could result in significant fees or fines, increased transaction costs, or loss of payment processing capabilities. However, in 2024, the context of regulatory scrutiny expanded, particularly in the EU under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which introduced new compliance obligations and potential penalties. This increased regulatory focus, especially in international markets, heightens Apple's financial risk profile by exposing it to greater potential liabilities and compliance costs, which could materially affect its operations and financial condition.",

By 2023, RTX not only reiterated this impact but also specified the use of the critical terms match method for assessing hedge effectiveness and introduced a €500 million euro-denominated long-term debt instrument designated as a net investment hedge against European business investments, which was deemed effective.

In 2023, the fair value of foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments increased significantly, with $225 million in Other assets, current and $143 million in Other accrued liabilities, compared to $67 million and $347 million, respectively, in 2022. Additionally, the notional amount of outstanding foreign currency hedges rose from $11.2 billion in 2022 to $15.8 billion in 2023, reflecting expanded hedging activity.

However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023.

However, in 2024, iPhone net sales were relatively flat compared to 2023, despite the launch of the iPhone 16 series.

By 2023, this expected time frame had shifted, and Schwab anticipated funding these commitments between 2024 and 2027.

      "original_answer": "In 2021, Johnson & Johnson's European sales grew by 24.3%, driven by operational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. However, by 2023, European sales had declined by 1.2%, with an operational decline of 2.2% partially offset by a smaller positive currency impact of 1.0%. The decline in 2023 was significantly influenced by the net negative impact of 9.8% from the performance of the Covid-19 Vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of Zytiga. This marks a dramatic shift from the robust growth seen in 2021, indicating both operational challenges and changing market dynamics in Europe over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Johnson & Johnson's European sales performance from strong operational growth of 20.7% in 2021 to a decline of 2.2% in 2023 was influenced by several factors. In 2021, European sales benefited from 24.3% growth driven by strong operational performance and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. However, by 2023, European sales declined operationally by 2.2%, and while a positive currency impact of 1.0% partially offset this decline, the overall sales dropped by 1.2%. Key product-specific events contributing to the 2023 decline included the loss of exclusivity for Zytiga and the waning demand for the COVID-19 Vaccine, which together had a negative 9.8% impact on operational sales in the region. These factors, combined with broader market challenges, led to the reversal in European sales performance.",

By 2023, RTX shifted focus to new legal exposures stemming from the Powder Metal Disclosure Litigation and an SEC investigation, again noting that any related loss contingency accruals were not material. The evolution reflects a transition from antitrust-related employment issues to securities disclosure and manufacturing-related litigation, while maintaining a consistent stance on materiality.",

In 2022, the company emphasized that it had made voluntary refunds, settled some allegations, and continued to litigate others, while stating that the legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition. By 2023, the disclosures included more specific accruals, such as the $300 million accrued for the DOJ investigation, reflecting a probable risk of liability. Additionally, new exposures like the Powder Metal Disclosure Litigation and SEC investigation were introduced, indicating a broader range of legal issues.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, revenue from sales outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in fiscal year 2024, this percentage decreased to 56%. This indicates a notable shift in the geographic concentration of the Compute & Networking segment's demand, with a relative increase in U.S.-based demand driving the segment's revenue. The decrease in international revenue share suggests a strategic or market-driven shift toward stronger domestic growth in Compute & Networking.",
      "llm_answer": "The geographic revenue concentration for the Compute & Networking segment increased between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, with a notable shift toward U.S.-based demand. In 2023, 69% of total revenue came from outside the U.S., while in 2024, this dropped to 56%, and further to 53% in 2025. This indicates a growing emphasis on domestic (U.S.) markets for Compute & Networking, likely driven by the segment’s Data Center and AI solutions, which are in high demand within the U.S. due to advancements in AI and cloud computing. The shift suggests a strategic or market-driven realignment, with stronger local adoption of NVIDIA’s high-performance computing technologies.",

By 2024, the Segment Income Margin had stabilized at 26.2%, slightly down from 26.3% in 2023, representing only a 0.1 percentage point decrease.

By 2024, the overall segment income margin improved to 36.4%, an increase of 2.1 percentage points from 34.3% in 2023.

      "original_answer": "In FY2023, the 'Pension and Other' component of OCI stood at $ (595) million as of December 31, 2023, indicating a negative contribution to comprehensive income. By FY2024, this figure improved slightly to $ (583) million as of December 31, 2024, showing a reduction in the adverse impact. This change suggests a marginal decrease in the company's exposure to pension-related financial volatility over the period.",

This decline indicates a deterioration in profitability, primarily driven by lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings.

By 2023, Aircraft Manufacturing contributed only $7 billion to a total increase of $52 billion in company revenue. This indicates a significant decline in the segment's contribution, suggesting a reduced strategic emphasis or operational scale in this business area compared to other divisions like Aircraft Services, which contributed $36 billion in the same year.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics' Aircraft Manufacturing Revenue decreased by $166 million from 2022 to 2023, primarily due to fewer deliveries of large-cabin aircraft caused by supply chain constraints. This decline indicates a reduced contribution from the Aerospace segment to the company's overall performance compared to the prior year, although the segment's operating margin improved due to higher aircraft services revenue and a favorable mix of services.",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A represented 13% of total revenue, specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also linked to the Compute & Networking segment.

In 2023, Aircraft Services contributed $220 million to the total services revenue increase of $1,292 million. However, the 2023 filing does not specify the same operational drivers (such as maintenance or FBO activity) that were cited in 2022, suggesting a shift in how the segment's performance was characterized between the two years.",

In 2022, the growth was driven by higher volume on international wheeled and tactical vehicle contracts, U.S. military vehicle programs, and weapons systems and munitions.

By 2023, the company projected specific annual benefit payments, starting at $70 million in 2024 and declining to $56 million by 2028 before rising again to $207 million over the following five years. This shift from asset allocation disclosure to liability payment projections indicates a transition toward more defined, forward-looking liability management, with a notable decline in near-term obligations followed by a longer-term increase.",
      "llm_answer": "The funding obligations for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan decreased from $489 million in 2022 to $480 million in 2023, indicating a slight reduction in the company's long-term pension liability. This reduction, combined with a higher discount rate in 2023 (5.20% vs. 5.67% in 2022), suggests improved funding status and effective liability management through asset allocation and actuarial assumptions. The company's focus on aligning plan assets with liability characteristics and maintaining a conservative investment strategy supports its approach to managing pension obligations sustainably.",

By 2024, this metric had decreased significantly to 13.9%, reflecting a major decline in the company's ability to maintain profitability in relation to revenue.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 38.4%, while in 2023 it decreased to 29.9%. This indicates a significant decline in the company's profitability relative to revenue, suggesting a worsening in cost management or pricing power over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 50.6% in 2022 to 41.8% in 2023. This decline indicates a weakening in the company's profitability trend, driven by lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs, which negatively impacted overall margins.",

By 2024, the company decreased its projected U.S. Defined Benefit obligations, showing $80 million for 2025 and a reduced long-term liability estimate of $193 million for 2030–2034.

By 2023, the company showed a decrease in its projected payment obligations, with U.S. Retiree Health Care payments declining from $27 million in 2024 to $22 million in 2028. This indicates a shift toward reduced liability exposure, consistent with the earlier conservative investment approach that may have helped stabilize the funding position over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the funding strategy for U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations shifted in terms of investment allocation and assumptions. The target allocation for U.S. Retiree Health Care plan assets became more conservative, with fixed income securities and cash equivalents increasing from 65%–80% to 75%–85%, while equity securities decreased from 20%–35% to 15%–25%. As of December 31, 2023, the actual allocation reflected this shift, with fixed income at 80% and equity at 20%. Additionally, the discount rate for determining benefit obligations rose significantly from 5.68% in 2022 to 5.17% in 2023, and the long-term rate of return on plan assets increased from 3.40% to 5.70%. Projected payment obligations remained relatively stable, with U.S. Retiree Health Care payments expected to decrease slightly from $27 million in 2024 to $22 million by 2028.",

By 2024, the company projected increasing annual benefit payments starting at $85 million in 2025 and rising to $92 million by 2029, with a cumulative payout of $476 million from 2030 to 2034. This indicates a growing long-term financial obligation and suggests the company anticipates sustained liability in its Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan.",

This reduction indicates a decrease in the company's long-term obligations related to these plans, likely due to a combination of factors such as improved discount rates and asset performance.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, aircraft manufacturing reported a loss of $251 million. By 2024, this segment experienced an increase in revenue due to additional aircraft deliveries, particularly the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. However, the segment also faced cost overruns linked to supplier quality escapes and late deliveries of components, which impacted profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, revenue in aircraft manufacturing increased significantly, driven by additional aircraft deliveries and strong demand across the product portfolio. In 2024, aircraft manufacturing revenue rose by $2,101 million compared to prior years. However, this growth was accompanied by challenges, including supplier quality issues and late supply chain deliveries, particularly affecting the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. These issues led to higher operating costs and a 70 basis point decrease in the Aerospace segment's operating margin in 2024. Overall, the increase in revenue was a result of robust order intake and a 1.6-to-1 book-to-bill ratio in 2021, which set the foundation for sustained demand in subsequent years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Abbott was actively streamlining operations within its Diagnostic Products segment as part of broader cost-reduction initiatives, incurring approximately $16 million in severance charges recorded under 'Cost of products sold' and an additional $4 million under 'Research and development.' This reflects a direct financial commitment to restructuring the segment for improved efficiency. By 2024, the Diagnostic Products segment was formally redefined and categorized under four distinct business units—Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics, and Point of Care Diagnostics—indicating a more structured and strategic classification within Abbott’s internal management reporting framework. This evolution from operational restructuring in 2022 to a clearly delineated, standardized segment in 2024 suggests a long-term strategic shift toward formalizing and stabilizing the diagnostic business as a core component of Abbott’s global health care portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Abbott's strategic financial involvement in its Diagnostic Products segment evolved through operational restructuring and a reclassification of its Acelis Connected Health business. In 2022, the Diagnostic Products segment reported significantly higher operating earnings of $6.64 billion, driven by high demand for COVID-19 testing. However, by 2024, operating earnings declined to $2.07 billion, reflecting reduced demand for pandemic-related tests and a shift in focus. Additionally, in January 2023, Abbott restructured its internal reporting by transferring the Acelis Connected Health business from the Diagnostic Products segment to the Medical Devices segment, which impacted the 2022 data for consistency in segment reporting. This restructuring aligned with broader efforts to streamline operations and optimize resource allocation.",

This indicates that despite fluctuations in total debt and operating cash flow over the period, the company maintained a consistent ability to service its debt through operating cash flows. The stability in this ratio suggests that Merck's cash flow generation remained proportionally aligned with its debt levels during this time.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck's 'Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Total Debt' ratio improved from 0.4:1 in 2022 to 0.6:1 in 2024, indicating stronger cash flow generation relative to its debt. Despite a slight increase in the total debt to total liabilities and equity ratio from 28.1% in 2022 to 31.7% in 2024, the company's operating cash flow has grown significantly, reflecting improved financial leverage and stronger operational performance.

      "question": "How has the structure and focus of QTL's licensing agreements evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices and royalty structures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, QTL's licensing revenues were primarily derived from per-unit royalties and lump sum payments, with the majority coming from sales of OFDMA-based products, including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices. Royalties were calculated based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of permissible deductions, with some products subject to minimums or caps. By 2024, the structure remained largely consistent, with QTL continuing to generate the 'vast majority' of its revenues from similar multimode devices. However, the 2024 filing emphasized ongoing investments in 5G and the expansion of its patent portfolio in LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro, and 5G NR, indicating a strategic shift toward reinforcing its leadership in next-generation technologies. While the royalty structure remained similar, the 2024 report placed greater emphasis on the foundational role of Qualcomm's inventions in both 3G/4G and 5G, suggesting a deepening alignment of QTL's licensing strategy with 5G innovation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, QTL's licensing agreements have continued to focus on multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices, covering 3G/4G/5G technologies. The structure of these agreements has remained consistent, with licensees obligated to pay royalties for sales of such multimode devices. Royalty structures primarily involve per-unit royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products, with certain permissible deductions. There is no indication of a significant structural change in the royalty framework during this period, and the emphasis remains on supporting the global rollout of 5G technology through these licensing arrangements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, CVS highlighted its sensitivity to the accuracy of forecasting health care costs, especially in the Medicare segment where revenue is based on bids submitted in June of the prior year. Premiums were fixed for 12-month periods, making the Health Care Benefits segment vulnerable to unanticipated cost increases, such as those caused by the lingering uncertainty of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and influenza seasons. In 2024, the company projected continued elevated utilization levels into 2025, which could pressure the Health Care Benefits segment and lead to premium deficiency reserves. Additionally, the company expected medical membership declines in Medicare and individual exchange products, contributing to financial volatility. These developments indicate an increased exposure to forecasting inaccuracies and a continuation of challenges in predicting utilization trends.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the financial risk exposure related to medical cost forecasting in the Health Care Benefits segment increased significantly, particularly due to elevated Medicare utilization trends. In 2024, the segment experienced higher-than-expected medical costs, which contributed to a $5.2 billion decrease in operating income compared to 2023. The elevated utilization persisted through the fourth quarter of 2024, pressuring the Health Care Benefits segment and leading to potential premium deficiency reserves. Additionally, the Company noted that Medicare membership disruptions and medical cost pressures, especially in Medicaid, further exacerbated the challenges in forecasting and managing medical costs accurately.",

By 2024, the company had evolved its approach by involving valuation professionals to evaluate obsolescence rates through comparisons with industry peers and historical transactions. This indicates a shift toward more externally validated and benchmarked methodologies for asset valuation.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson's approach to determining the obsolescence rate for intangible assets became more detailed and externally validated between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, the company used an independent third-party valuation specialist to assess the fair value of intangible assets acquired in the Aspen Technology acquisition, including estimating the obsolescence rate for developed technology. By 2024, this methodology was similarly applied in the National Instruments acquisition, with additional emphasis on auditor evaluation of key assumptions such as projected revenue and obsolescence rates. This evolution indicates a more rigorous and transparent valuation methodology, incorporating both internal estimates and external validation to ensure accuracy and reliability in asset valuation.",
