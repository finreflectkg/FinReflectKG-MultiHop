By 2024, the company introduced a slight modification by stating that the threshold is 'typically' $250 million, suggesting a more flexible approach. This change indicates that the company may be allowing for more judgment in determining which items are excluded, potentially affecting the consistency and comparability of its non-GAAP earnings metric over time.",

However, the 2024 10-K introduced updated earnings drivers and expanded definitions for structural cost savings, suggesting a more detailed and transparent approach to categorizing and communicating non-operational impacts.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company provided a detailed definition of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, explaining how it is calculated from net income by excluding gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate-related impairment charges, and real estate-related depreciation, amortization, and accretion, while also adjusting for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company moved toward a more quantitative presentation, showing that Nareit FFO increased from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, a 14% increase. Additionally, the 2024 filing included Nareit FFO within a broader comparative table that tracked changes across three years (2022–2024), indicating a shift toward emphasizing trend analysis and performance metrics over definitional explanations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment and presentation of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders evolved primarily in terms of the removal of the separate presentation of Consolidated AFFO. This change was made to better align the reporting with management's approach to capital allocation and performance assessment. The reconciliation of Nareit FFO to AFFO remained consistent in terms of adjustments for items like straight-line revenue and expense, stock-based compensation, and other operational adjustments. In 2024, Nareit FFO increased by 14% compared to 2023, driven by higher net income and adjustments for discontinued operations, while AFFO rose by 7%. The evolution reflects a streamlined presentation without altering the underlying metrics.",

By 2023, this metric improved significantly, with Corporate operating profit increasing by $6.7 billion, of which $5.7 billion was attributed to higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, particularly from AerCap and GE HealthCare investments, although partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year gains on the Baker Hughes investment. This represents a transformation in both the magnitude and composition of these gains, indicating a strategic shift in asset management and investment realization.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, GE reported gains on purchases and sales of business interests of $45 million, compared to a $56 million loss in 2021. In 2023, this line item showed a $9 million loss. The primary sources of these gains/losses in 2022 and 2021 were related to equity securities and business interests, including the prior year's gain from the sale of the BioPharma business in 2020. In 2023, the loss was minimal and primarily due to the nonrecurrence of prior-year gains.",

By 2024, NFLX had implemented more structured hedging strategies, including cash flow hedges for foreign currency-denominated revenue, which resulted in a $124 million gain included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year. This indicates a shift from passive exposure to active management of foreign exchange risk, reducing volatility in reported revenues.",

By 2023, the company continued this tenant-level impairment review but expanded the criteria to include the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations as a key impairment indicator. Additionally, in 2023, the company introduced a more detailed framework for measuring impairment, incorporating available market information relative to asset fair value alongside projected discounted future cash flows, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This represents a refinement in methodology and a more structured approach to impairment assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the evaluation and treatment of tenant-related intangible assets evolved with a heightened focus on impairment indicators and updated projected cash flow assumptions. In 2023, the company identified triggering events for its India and Spain reporting units, leading to goodwill impairment charges of $322.0 million and $80.0 million, respectively, due to the carrying amounts exceeding estimated fair values. The impairment assessments incorporated updated projected undiscounted future cash flows, which were influenced by factors such as tenant credit risk, attrition, and the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, the company continued to monitor tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant-by-tenant basis, adjusting assumptions regarding renewal rates, lease terms, and tenant performance to reflect current market conditions and operational realities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed nonmarketable investments totaling $5 million, grouped under the 'Other measurement basis' category alongside equity-method investments, with no change in value from the prior year. By 2024, while the specific dollar amount for nonmarketable investments was not quantitatively disclosed, the company expanded its qualitative disclosure, describing these investments as including interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities, and clarified that they are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more detailed discussion of counterparty risk concentration, which indirectly impacts the risk exposure of these nonmarketable investments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the valuation methodology and disclosure around TXN's nonmarketable investments remained consistent in terms of measurement basis, as these investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on nonmarketable investments are recognized in operating income and expenses (OI&E). However, there was a slight reduction in the value of nonmarketable investments, from $5 million in 2023 to $4 million in 2024. In terms of risk exposure, the company continues to manage credit risk by limiting exposure to any one issuer and focusing on investment-grade securities, though specific risk exposure details for nonmarketable investments were not provided in the disclosures.",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, Visa's treatment and disclosure of Lease Consolidation Costs evolved by explicitly identifying and excluding these costs from operating expenses in the non-GAAP reconciliation. In 2023, Lease Consolidation Costs were not specifically mentioned in the non-GAAP adjustments. However, in 2024, Visa recorded a charge of $57 million related to the consolidation of leased office spaces and excluded it from non-GAAP operating expenses. This indicates a more transparent and consistent financial reporting approach, where non-recurring or non-core expenses are clearly identified and excluded to provide a clearer view of ongoing operational performance.",

In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by better price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. This reflects a significant turnaround in the company's gross margin performance over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased from 23.7% in fiscal 2024 to 24.1% in fiscal 2025. The key drivers behind this improvement included effective price management in the Walmart U.S. segment aligned with cost inflation, growth in higher-margin businesses globally, and a favorable sales mix, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. Additionally, the increase in fiscal 2024 benefited from lapping higher markdowns from the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company's floating-rate debt principal was $5.7 billion, representing approximately 16% of the senior notes portfolio, with a potential annual interest expense increase of $57 million from a one percentage point rise in rates. By 2023, the floating-rate debt principal had decreased to $5.4 billion, or about 13% of the senior notes portfolio, with a corresponding potential annual interest expense increase of $54 million. This reflects a reduction in both the absolute level of floating-rate debt and the sensitivity of interest expense to rate changes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, BMY disclosed an IPRD value of $11.4 billion, with $11.1 billion specifically tied to mavacamten, as part of its acquisition disclosures. By 2024, BMY had a more detailed and cautionary approach, emphasizing the vulnerability of IPRD to impairment and the need for annual reviews. The 2024 filing noted that impairment charges for IPRD and other intangible assets totaled $2.9 billion for that year, a significant increase from $101 million in 2022. This reflects a shift from primarily recognizing IPRD value in the year of acquisition to actively monitoring and adjusting it based on evolving expectations of future cash flows, regulatory timelines, and market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, BMY's treatment and valuation of IPRD evolved with increased impairment recognition, particularly in 2024, where impairment charges related to long-lived assets, including IPRD, totaled $2.9 billion, a significant increase from $101 million in 2022. The assumptions used in fair value estimation remained consistent with prior periods, relying on discounted cash flow models that incorporate factors such as revenue projections, probability of success, regulatory timelines, and discount rates. However, the heightened impairment charges in 2024 suggest a more aggressive reassessment of IPRD carrying values due to factors like clinical setbacks, competitive pressures, or changes in market expectations.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and specifically noted that interest revenue from financing arrangements was recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle continued to include unbilled receivables in accounts receivable and maintained similar revenue recognition timing under ASC 606. However, the 2024 disclosure reclassified interest revenue from financing contracts to 'non-operating expenses, net'—a more specific categorization than in 2022. This indicates a refinement in financial reporting terminology and structure, though the core treatment of unbilled receivables remained consistent.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's treatment and disclosure of unbilled receivables between fiscal years 2022 and 2024 remained consistent in terms of their inclusion in accounts receivable. In both years, unbilled receivables were recorded when revenue was recognized prior to invoicing and were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets. The timing of revenue recognition was also consistent, with revenue recognized upon the transfer of control of goods or services, as dictated by ASC 606. However, in 2024, Oracle provided more granular details about remaining performance obligations, including the expected timing of revenue recognition (e.g., 39% within 12 months), while 2022's disclosure was less detailed.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 10-K, AIG reported cumulative paid losses of $1,557 million for accident year 2021 as of December 31, 2021. In the 2023 10-K, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident year increased to $1,640 million as of December 31, 2022. This $83 million increase indicates that AIG's initial estimate of paid losses for accident year 2021 was lower than the actual paid losses observed a year later, suggesting that the company may have initially underestimated the severity of claims for that year.",

This downward revision suggests that AIG's initial loss reserving for accident year 2021 was somewhat conservative, and actual paid losses were lower than originally estimated.

By 2024, these impacts had increased significantly, with a 25 basis point increase in URR leading to a $197 million increase in liability and a 1 basis point increase in WAC leading to a $220 million increase.

By 2024, the segment's revenues further increased to $1.648 billion, indicating continued, albeit moderate, growth.

The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Texas Instruments maintained a consistent valuation methodology for its nonmarketable investments, as they were measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. However, there was a slight reduction in the value of nonmarketable investments, from $5 million in 2023 to $4 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG not only capitalized interest during construction but also explicitly detailed that the amount of interest capitalized during the year was based on interest rates in place during the construction period. This indicated a clear policy with a specific reference to how the interest was calculated. In 2023, while SPG maintained the same general policy of capitalizing interest during construction, the level of detail was reduced, as the company no longer explicitly referenced the use of interest rates in effect during the construction period when determining the amount to capitalize. This suggests a subtle shift toward less granular disclosure, even though the core capitalization policy remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, SPG maintained consistent policy treatment of capitalized interest during construction, stating that interest is capitalized on projects during construction based on applicable interest rates until the projects are ready for their intended purpose. However, the 2023 disclosure provided more detailed information by explicitly listing the amount of interest capitalized during the year, while the 2022 disclosure omitted this specific data. This indicates an improvement in the level of detail and transparency in 2023, though the underlying policy remained unchanged.",

By 2024, the company's language shifted, placing greater emphasis on the dependency of future cash flows on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, signaling a more pronounced sensitivity to these metrics in impairment assessments. While both years reference industry margins, the 2024 filing reflects a stronger linkage between impairment indicators and sustained changes in margins, rather than just temporary volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to considering industry margins in impairment assessments from 2022 to 2024 has remained consistent in emphasizing long-term price and margin fundamentals over short-term volatility. In both years, the Corporation evaluates impairment by using cash flow projections based on long-term commodity prices and industry margins derived from its Corporate Plan, which incorporates supply and demand dynamics, OPEC+ policies, and technological advancements. However, in 2024, there is a more explicit mention of incorporating greenhouse gas emission costs and refining the impact of future policy and technology changes into its Energy Outlook, reflecting a broader consideration of sustainability factors in long-term margin assumptions.",

By 2024, the company maintained the same description of these contracts, including the 10–20 year term range, minimum purchase requirements, and price escalation provisions, indicating no structural changes to the contract framework. This suggests that Linde preserved its long-term, committed contract model for on-site supply without modification across the two reporting years.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's use of total requirement contracts in its on-site industrial gas distribution has remained consistent in terms of structure and duration between 2023 and 2024. These contracts are typically long-term, with terms ranging from 10 to 20 years, and include minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions.

In 2024, the company revised its projections for Start-up capital expenditures downward, estimating a range of $50 million to $70 million for 2025.

By 2023, while leasing prospects were still referenced, SPG placed increased emphasis on changes in economic and operating conditions, tenant financial health, and the intent and ability to hold assets when assessing the recoverability of investments.

However, in 2023, there was a heightened emphasis on the impact of changes in economic and operating conditions, including tenant financial conditions and the Company's intent and ability to hold assets, which could influence future impairment assessments and purchase accounting assumptions.",

      "llm_answer": "The operating profit margin as a percentage of revenue decreased from 41.8% in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024, indicating a decline in profitability. This decrease was primarily driven by lower revenue across key segments (Analog and Embedded Processing) and higher manufacturing costs. The drop in margins suggests challenges in cost management and pricing power, as the company faced reduced sales volumes and unfavorable product mix, which negatively impacted overall profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo's Parent company was subject to federal banking laws that limited covered transactions with its subsidiary banks to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in aggregate, with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length terms. Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the regulatory framework governing the relationship between Wells Fargo's parent company and its subsidiary banks has emphasized enhanced capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms. The Support Agreement, established in 2017 and amended in 2019, continues to play a central role, with the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC) transferring significant assets to facilitate liquidity and capital support for key subsidiaries. In 2024, the framework further reinforces that the IHC may be restricted from paying dividends to the Parent if certain liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined thresholds or if the Parent initiates bankruptcy proceedings. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's (FRB) enhanced supervision regulations impose capital distribution restrictions, including on dividend payments, triggered by capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management concerns. These developments reflect a heightened focus on ensuring the Parent's ability to meet obligations and maintain financial stability.",

For non-rate regulated operations, these costs were allocated to expense over the asset's estimated useful life, with changes in the ARO due to the passage of time recognized as an increase in the liability and as accretion expense, included in depreciation and amortization. By 2023, NEE further clarified that NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision specifically for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. This indicates a more explicit recognition and integration of dismantlement obligations into NEER’s depreciation methodology, showing a refinement in how these future liabilities are embedded into current financial reporting.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 82 basis points, primarily due to higher sales and a $0.2 billion reduction in incremental COVID-19 related costs, despite reduced tobacco sales. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 97 basis points, mainly driven by higher sales. This indicates a continued improvement in operating efficiency, with the impact of pandemic-related costs diminishing further in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from 2.9% in fiscal 2023 to 4.3% in fiscal 2024. The key factors driving this change included higher variable pay due to exceeding performance targets and lower fuel sales in fiscal 2024, partially offset by supply chain efficiencies and lapping restructuring charges in fiscal 2023.",

This decline indicates that the company experienced higher amortization of these intangible assets during the period, which reflects the gradual recognition of the above-market lease income over the remaining lease terms. The reduction suggests a decrease in the value of favorable lease terms acquired through acquisitions, either due to the passage of time or the expiration of certain leases.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax-related adjustment impacting EBIT-adjusted primarily consisted of a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation. In contrast, in 2023, the adjustment involved a tax benefit stemming from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a change in the geographic and operational focus of tax-related adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax reconsolidation event in 2022 to a Korea-specific deferred tax asset realization in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the magnitude of adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted decreased from $2,125 million in 2022 to $1,865 million in 2023. Tax-related adjustments were a significant component of these changes. In 2023, the tax effect on adjustments was a benefit of $504 million, primarily driven by the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in Korea. In contrast, 2022 saw a tax benefit of $423 million, mainly from the release of a valuation allowance related to Cruise's tax reconsolidation. The underlying drivers of these adjustments included strategic restructuring, valuation allowance changes, and one-time events, which were excluded from core operations to provide a clearer view of ongoing performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Wells Fargo's relationship with its subsidiary banks regarding capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms remained largely consistent, with continued emphasis on regulatory compliance and systemic resiliency. The Parent's subsidiary banks are subject to federal restrictions on transferring funds to the Parent, including limits on covered transactions and the requirement for arm's-length terms in dealings with affiliates. The Support Agreement, which facilitates liquidity and capital support to subsidiary banks during times of distress, remained in place in 2024, with the IHC holding key assets to provide resources to the Bank and other Covered Entities if certain liquidity or capital triggers are breached. Additionally, the FRB's capital planning and distribution rules, including stress testing and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, continued to govern the Parent's ability to make capital distributions. No significant changes to these mechanisms were noted in the 2024 disclosures compared to 2023.",

      "question": "How has NEER's investment focus in wind and solar energy evolved from 2022 to 2023, based on the capital expenditures disclosed in the respective annual reports?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEER's capital expenditures for wind energy were $3,777 million and for solar energy (including solar plus battery storage projects) were $2,011 million. In 2023, NEER's wind-related expenditures decreased to $2,820 million, while solar expenditures increased significantly to $3,270 million. This indicates a strategic shift from wind to solar energy investments over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "NEER's investment focus in wind and solar energy shifted significantly from 2022 to 2023, as reflected in the capital expenditures disclosed in the respective annual reports. In 2022, NEER allocated substantial capital to both wind and solar projects, with $3,777 million for wind and $2,011 million for solar. However, in 2023, the capital expenditures for wind dropped sharply to $2,820 million in 2024 and further declined in subsequent years, while solar expenditures started at $3,270 million in 2024 but also showed a steep decline in later years. This suggests a strategic shift or completion of major projects in 2023, with a reduced emphasis on new wind and solar investments in the following years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM acknowledged the risk of financial loss due to cybersecurity incidents, noting that while it regularly addresses such threats, no material adverse effects had occurred. By 2024, the company highlighted an increase in the sophistication and number of cyber threats, particularly with the emergence of AI-driven attack methods, and referenced industry-wide incidents like MOVEit as examples of events that could lead to financial loss. Despite these developments, IBM still reported that no cybersecurity incidents had resulted in a material adverse effect, indicating that while the threat landscape has evolved and potentially increased in risk, the company's mitigation strategies have kept the financial impact within manageable bounds.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, IBM's exposure to financial loss from cybersecurity incidents has increased due to the rising sophistication of cyber threats, including the use of AI and generative AI by attackers, as well as the growing complexity of the regulatory environment. While IBM has continued to invest in mitigation efforts, such as monitoring, identifying, and responding to threats, the evolving nature of these threats has made it increasingly difficult to fully prevent or mitigate their impact. Additionally, the potential for higher compliance costs and regulatory penalties has further elevated the financial risks associated with cybersecurity incidents.",

As of December 31, 2023, the company held 5.7 million square feet of such property, while by December 31, 2024, this figure had decreased to 4.4 million square feet.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips disclosed that for performance periods beginning in 2018 or later, recipients of cash-settled PSUs received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense, with the accrued reinvested dividend paid at the time of settlement. In 2024, the company maintained the same structure, reiterating that for performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent, which was also charged to compensation expense and paid at settlement. This consistency indicates that the company did not alter its approach to dividend equivalents for these PSUs between the two years, maintaining a stable policy in how compensation is recognized and distributed for long-term incentive plans.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips shifted the treatment of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for cash-settled PSUs from being charged to retained earnings to being charged to compensation expense.

This indicates a minor reduction in the financial impact of debt repayments or retirements in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease suggests that the company may have experienced fewer or less costly early debt retirements during the 2023 period.",
      "llm_answer": "The loss on retirement of long-term obligations decreased significantly from $38.2 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023. This indicates that American Tower Corporation incurred minimal costs related to retiring debt in 2023 compared to a notable expense in 2022, likely due to fewer debt prepayments or retirements during the 2023 period.",

This represents a total increase of $984 million over the two-year period. In fiscal 2023 alone, Digital Experience revenue increased by $471 million compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to net new additions across subscription offerings. The growth continued into fiscal 2024, indicating sustained expansion in this business segment.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney provided a detailed explanation of its revenue recognition methodology for affiliate fees, stating that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber numbers. Fixed license fees were recognized ratably over the contract term, and minimum guaranteed fees were recognized ratably over the guaranteed period, with excess fees recognized after the guarantee was exceeded. By fiscal 2024, the specific revenue recognition methodology was no longer detailed in the disclosures. Instead, affiliate fees were mentioned in the context of fluctuating with MVPD subscriber levels and were listed among the significant revenue sources for the Sports segment, particularly related to ESPN-branded channels. This indicates a shift from detailed recognition methodology in 2022 to a more contextual and segment-focused disclosure in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2024, Disney's treatment and recognition of affiliate fees remained consistent in terms of revenue recognition methodology, with fees recognized as programming is provided based on contract terms and subscriber rates. However, contextual disclosures in 2024 expanded to include more detailed discussions on the impact of MVPD subscriber levels on affiliate revenues and the competitive landscape affecting carriage agreements. Additionally, the 2024 filing provided more specific examples of affiliate fee recognition scenarios, such as fixed license fees recognized ratably and minimum guarantees.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde identified cost pass-through as a 2% contributor to sales changes, indicating a limited but measurable impact of cost recovery mechanisms. By 2023, the company emphasized a structural advantage in its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, suggesting a more strategic and intentional reliance on cost pass-through as a financial management tool. This evolution indicates a shift from a reactive cost adjustment to a more proactive and contractual approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms shifted from being a neutral or positive contributor to sales with minimal impact on operating profit in 2022 to a negative contributor in 2023, where cost pass-through decreased sales by 3%. This indicates that in 2023, Linde faced challenges in passing on rising energy costs to customers, likely due to market or contractual constraints, which affected top-line revenue despite efforts to maintain profitability through pricing and productivity initiatives.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.

In 2023, the company reported property revenue from Africa at $1,225.6 million, a more modest 3% increase compared to 2022. This indicates a slowdown in growth within the African market between those years.",
      "llm_answer": "AMT's property revenue from Africa increased by 3% between 2022 and 2023, from $1,192.5 million to $1,225.6 million. This growth was driven by tenant billings, particularly from colocations and amendments, as well as newly acquired or constructed sites. However, the growth was partially offset by foreign currency translation impacts, which reduced revenue by $235.9 million, primarily due to fluctuations in the Nigerian Naira and other African currencies. Despite these challenges, the revenue growth indicates a modest expansion in the company's operations in the region, suggesting a stable but cautious growth trajectory in Africa.",

In 2023, GMI's revenue remained nearly flat with only a $2 million change (0%), but the variance components shifted significantly: volume contributed +$0.5 billion, mix decreased by $0.3 billion, cost reduced the revenue by $0.3 billion, and other factors added $0.1 billion.

In 2024, rather than disclosing specific membership figures, the company provided detailed information about its expanded use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing. This shift in disclosure suggests that Netflix anticipated sustained international growth in memberships and was proactively managing financial exposure to currency fluctuations, which could significantly impact revenue from global streaming. The detailed hedging strategy in 2024 reflects a strategic evolution from simply reporting growth to actively managing the financial implications of that growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's approach to foreign exchange hedging in 2024 reflected a strategic shift by actively using forward contracts to hedge forecasted revenue transactions and content-related exposures, as detailed in the 2024 10-K. This contrasts with 2023, where no hedging gains or losses were recognized, indicating a more passive approach. The 2024 strategy aimed to reduce volatility from foreign exchange rate fluctuations, aligning with higher growth expectations for paid net membership additions, which increased by 36% compared to 2023. This proactive hedging supported more stable financial planning amid rapid international expansion.",

By 2024, the company expanded the scope to include platforms such as the domestic ESPN television network and International Sports Channels, in addition to Linear Networks and DTC services.

By 2024, the segment's role had notably expanded, as it contributed approximately 16% of the company's total revenue. This shift suggests an increased strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing, particularly through products like microcontrollers, processors, and wireless connectivity solutions.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the cost of natural gas resulted in a loss of $27 million in SO's derivatives in non-designated hedging relationships. By 2024, this relationship had reversed, with the cost of natural gas contributing a gain of $94 million to the same category. This indicates a significant shift in how natural gas pricing affected the company's financial instruments over this period. The change reflects a reversal in risk exposure, where previously rising natural gas costs hurt the company financially through derivatives, but more recently, those costs have benefited the company's position.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of the cost of natural gas on SO's (Southern Company) financial derivatives position shifted from a positive reclassification of $37 million in 2022 to a negative reclassification of $40 million in 2024. This shift indicates increased volatility or higher natural gas prices in 2024, leading to greater financial derivatives losses being recognized in earnings. The change reflects heightened market risk exposure and less favorable hedging outcomes related to natural gas costs over this period.",

This significant drop was primarily driven by a reduction in other pension income, as expected returns on pension assets decreased due to a lower asset base resulting from negative returns in 2022, while pension interest costs increased.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DHR reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) of 1.0% for the year-over-year comparison of 2023 vs. 2022. In contrast, for 2024, the company reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) decline of (10.5)% for the comparison of 2023 vs. 2022 and a positive 3.0% for the 2024 vs. 2023 period. This indicates a significant shift from stable growth in 2023 to a notable decline in core sales growth in early 2024, followed by a partial recovery later in the year. The fluctuation suggests volatility in the company's underlying business performance during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "DHR's Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) declined from 1.0% in 2023 to -2.0% in 2024, indicating a weakening in the underlying business performance. The decline in 2024 was driven by reduced demand in key markets like China and Western Europe, as well as weaker performance in equipment-related businesses. This suggests that the company faced challenges in sustaining growth momentum, likely due to external factors such as market saturation and reduced customer demand in certain segments.",

This decline was primarily driven by a $602 million decrease in Engineering segment sales, which included $894 million from projects in Russia in 2022 compared to only $238 million in 2023.

In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts.

      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased from 23.5% in fiscal 2023 to 23.7% in fiscal 2024. The key drivers behind this improvement were the Walmart U.S. segment's effective price management, which aligned with competitive historic price gaps, and the lapping of higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by shifts in product mix toward lower-margin categories.

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 155 basis points, primarily due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This shift reflects a significant change in the drivers of gross profit, moving from improvement due to internal efficiencies and product mix in 2022 to external pressures and cost increases in 2023.",

In fiscal 2022, the increase was driven by price management aligned with cost inflation, favorable merchandise mix, and lapping the temporary closures of Auto Care and Vision Centers.

By 2024, the company had fully integrated Surmont into its Canada segment, now owning 100% of the working interest, with the final consideration reported at $3.0 billion CAD $4.1 billion after adjustments.

In fiscal 2024, this metric further decreased to $599.92, a 0.8% drop compared to fiscal 2023. This indicates a continued downward trend in the company's ability to generate sales per square foot, suggesting potential challenges in maintaining or improving store-level productivity.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's sales per retail square foot decreased slightly from $604.55 in fiscal 2023 to $599.92 in fiscal 2024, indicating a marginal decline in sales productivity per square foot. This trend suggests a slight reduction in operational efficiency, potentially due to a negative comparable sales environment and macroeconomic factors affecting customer transactions and average ticket sizes. However, the decline is modest, and the company maintained a relatively stable gross profit margin, indicating some resilience in its operations.",

This indicates that the company's interest burden related to its automotive operations remained relatively stable, with a modest increase of $37 million, or approximately 3.9%.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, HD acquired $1,827 million in lease assets through new operating lease liabilities and $336 million through new finance lease liabilities. In fiscal 2024, these figures changed to $1,384 million for operating leases and $153 million for finance leases. This indicates a significant decrease in both categories, especially in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on finance leases and moderating overall lease-driven asset acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, HD's acquisition of lease assets through new operating and finance lease liabilities decreased for operating leases (from $1,827 million to $1,384 million) and significantly decreased for finance leases (from $336 million to $153 million). This indicates a strategic shift toward reducing new long-term lease commitments, potentially reflecting a more cautious approach to capital allocation or a preference for operational flexibility over long-term obligations.",

In 2024, the company experienced a core sales growth of 3.0%, showing a turnaround from the prior year.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil disclosed future dismantlement costs as part of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, noting that this measure includes costs for dismantlement, abandonment, and rehabilitation obligations. However, the company emphasized that the measure is based on first-day-of-the-month average prices, which can cause significant variability in cash flows year to year. In 2023, ExxonMobil maintained the same inclusion of future dismantlement costs but explicitly stated that the standardized measure 'depends on' these pricing assumptions, indicating a more direct acknowledgment of the sensitivity of dismantlement cost estimates to price fluctuations. This evolution shows a shift in how the company characterizes the relationship between external pricing and its long-term cost obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, ExxonMobil's treatment of future dismantlement costs within the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows showed a notable shift in dependency on pricing assumptions. In 2022, the standardized measure reflected a significant net change in prices, lifting, and development costs of $190,938 million, indicating a strong sensitivity to price fluctuations. However, in 2023, this figure dropped sharply to a net change of -$172,847 million, signaling a reduced sensitivity to pricing assumptions. This suggests that in 2023, the impact of price changes on dismantlement costs was less pronounced, potentially due to more stable or lower commodity prices or adjustments in cost estimates and development strategies.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER had approximately 28,759 MW of contracted generation capacity with long-term power sales agreements, and only 1,842 MW of merchant generation assets that required active marketing and hedging. By 2024, NEER's disclosed future revenue commitments showed a significant shift, with $3,945 million in 2025 declining sharply to $370 million by 2029 and beyond, indicating a reduced long-term financial exposure and likely a strategic shift away from long-term contracted generation or a reclassification of assets. This reflects a transformation in NEER's business model under NEE, moving away from long-term commitments toward shorter-term or market-driven strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, NEE's NEER segment experienced a decline in revenue from its operations, with operating revenues decreasing from $9,672 million in 2023 to $7,542 million in 2024. This decline is attributed to a reduction in contracted generation assets and related long-term power sales agreements, as well as a decrease in capital expenditures for wind, solar, and other clean energy projects. The segment's contracted generation capacity remained significant, with long-term contracts expiring through 2033, but the financial exposure shifted toward lower investment in new projects and a greater reliance on existing assets. Merchant generation assets, which require active marketing and hedging, also remained a smaller portion of the portfolio compared to contracted assets.",

However, in 2024, the Core Operating Loss increased sharply by $9,982 million compared with 2023, signaling a significant deterioration in performance.

This is detailed in the 2023 disclosures regarding oil and gas exploration and development. By 2024, COP provided explicit financial figures showing a significant increase in dry hole expenses, rising from $109 million in 2023 to $251 million in 2024. This indicates a notable increase in the number or cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells during the year, reflecting a shift toward more aggressive or riskier exploration activities or changes in success rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, COP's treatment and disclosure of dry hole expenses remained consistent under the successful efforts method of accounting. In both years, exploratory well costs were capitalized as suspended costs until reserves were determined to be economically recoverable or the wells were deemed dry holes. In 2024, dry hole expenses increased to $251 million from $109 million in 2023, indicating a rise in unsuccessful exploration efforts.

      "question": "How did the change in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Netflix's hedging strategy or exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the change in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges was a loss of $120,023 thousand. By 2024, this figure transformed into a significant unrealized gain of $914,369 thousand. This indicates a major shift in Netflix's hedging strategy or exposure, likely involving increased or restructured hedging activity that led to a reversal from a net loss to a substantial net gain over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the change in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges shifted from a loss of $155,730 thousand in 2023 to a gain of $914,369 thousand in 2024. This significant improvement indicates that Netflix's hedging strategy became more effective in 2024, likely due to increased use of cash flow hedges to manage foreign exchange risks, given the company's global operations. The positive change suggests that Netflix's hedging activities helped mitigate adverse currency movements, thereby protecting its cash flows and improving financial stability.",

      "question": "How did Comcast's approach to audience ratings guarantees in advertising contracts evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what impact did this have on revenue recognition timing?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast highlighted that lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, particularly for NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's channels, had an adverse effect on advertising sales and rates. The company noted that audience measurement methodologies could negatively affect advertising revenue if they did not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. By 2023, the company formalized its approach to advertising contracts by disclosing that it guarantees audience ratings for advertisements in some contracts. If a shortfall occurs in meeting these guaranteed ratings, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units within one year. This represents a shift from merely identifying audience ratings as a risk factor to actively managing the financial implications through contractual guarantees and revenue deferral policies.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, Comcast continued to handle audience ratings guarantees in advertising contracts by deferring a portion of the revenue when there was a shortfall in guaranteed ratings, typically resolving the issue by providing additional advertising units within one year of the original airing. This approach remained consistent with 2022 practices. The impact on revenue recognition timing was that revenue was deferred until the shortfall was settled, which delayed recognition but aligned with the delivery of the additional advertising units.",

In 2024, the segment's organic sales growth remained at a low single-digit level, indicating minimal change in its growth trajectory. Despite this stability, the segment's performance lagged behind other business units like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, which showed higher growth rates, suggesting that Baby, Feminine & Family Care was not a primary growth driver in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment experienced flat net sales in 2024 compared to the prior year, with no change in volume and mix, while organic sales growth was 2%. This indicates that the segment contributed modestly to P&G's overall growth strategy in 2024, as its performance lagged behind other segments like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, which saw stronger organic growth. Despite being a significant portion of P&G's portfolio (24% of net sales), the segment's stagnant growth suggests it played a less dynamic role in driving the company's top-line expansion during the period.",

The discussion around leverage evolved to emphasize the impact of these divestitures on liquidity and capital structure, while still acknowledging ongoing debt service obligations as a business risk.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the Graphics segment generated $15,868 million in revenue and was a core part of NVIDIA's business, primarily driven by gaming and professional visualization. By fiscal year 2024, while the segment still includes GeForce GPUs for gaming, its strategic positioning has expanded to include broader AI applications, such as Omniverse Enterprise software for industrial AI and digital twin applications, and it now plays a more integrated role in NVIDIA's AI-driven computing platforms. The segment's evolution reflects a shift from being primarily consumer-focused to being more deeply embedded in enterprise and AI workflows.",
      "llm_answer": "The Graphics segment has maintained a strong revenue contribution and strategic positioning within NVIDIA's business portfolio from fiscal year 2022 to 2024. In 2022, it remained a core growth driver, with GeForce GPUs and gaming platforms fueling PC gaming and content creation. By 2024, the segment evolved further with the introduction of the Blackwell GeForce RTX 50 Series, which leveraged AI-driven innovations like neural graphics and next-generation DLSS to enhance performance and realism. The segment also expanded into cloud gaming via GeForce NOW and supported generative AI applications, reinforcing its role as a key enabler of NVIDIA's broader AI and computing ecosystem.",

If appraisal drilling and seismic work continued to indicate potential, these costs could remain capitalized for several years. By 2024, COP disclosed that appraisal drilling was complete in certain areas, with costs now being incurred to assess development, while additional appraisal wells were still planned in other areas. This indicates a shift from capitalizing uncertain exploration costs to actively evaluating development feasibility, reflecting a more mature phase in those projects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment and disclosure of appraisal drilling costs remained consistent with the successful efforts method of accounting, where exploratory well costs are capitalized pending further evaluation of economic recoverability. In 2024, the company maintained $163 million in suspended exploratory well costs for projects with appraisal drilling complete or additional appraisal wells planned, compared to $184 million in 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, content amortization was $14,197,437 thousand, and in 2024, it increased to $15,301,517 thousand. This indicates that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, as the cost of amortizing its content library grew year-over-year. The increase in content amortization suggests that Netflix is either producing or licensing more high-cost content, or extending the availability windows of existing content, which results in higher ongoing amortization expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Netflix's content amortization increased from $14,197,437 thousand to $15,301,517 thousand, representing a $1.1 billion rise. This growth in content amortization, which is a key component of cost of revenues, indicates that Netflix is investing more heavily in content production and licensing. The increase suggests a strategic focus on expanding its content library to maintain and grow its subscriber base, reflecting continued prioritization of content as a core competitive advantage.",

The continued decline in 2023 was driven by reduced demand for pandemic-related products and inventory adjustments, particularly in the Biotechnology segment. However, the moderation in the decline in 2024 suggests stabilization, with some segments like Diagnostics and Life Sciences showing modest core sales growth. This trend reflects a partial recovery in demand and operational adjustments, though challenges such as tighter credit environments and reduced customer spending in emerging markets persist.",

However, the 2024 disclosure includes a more detailed emphasis on the treatment of contingent consideration liabilities, noting that 'subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.' This evolution in disclosure suggests a more transparent or refined approach to communicating the financial impact of post-acquisition adjustments, potentially indicating a shift toward more complex acquisitions with greater contingent payment structures.",

However, there was a notable increase in \"Acquired IPR&D and milestones\" expenses in 2024 ($2,757 million) compared to 2023 ($778 million), indicating a significant shift toward acquiring in-process research and development projects, likely reflecting a more aggressive acquisition strategy focused on innovation and pipeline expansion.",

By 2024, the segment gross margin improved significantly to $487.1 million, showing a turnaround of nearly $683.1 million year-over-year.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the residual growth rates for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were aligned with brand operating plans and approximated expected long-term category market growth rates. By 2024, the residual growth rates remained conceptually similar but were now explicitly stated to depend on additional factors such as grooming habit changes and sustained deceleration in category growth. This evolution in assumptions reflects increased sensitivity to market dynamics, which contributed to the $1.3 billion impairment charge recorded in 2024 due to a higher discount rate, currency devaluation, and restructuring impacts. The 2024 analysis also introduced a more explicit sensitivity to a 25 basis-point decrease in residual growth rates, indicating a heightened risk of future impairment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the residual growth rate assumptions for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were adjusted downward, primarily due to macroeconomic factors such as currency devaluation, inflation, and restructuring impacts in certain Enterprise Markets. These changes contributed to a lower estimated fair value of the asset, resulting in a $1.3 billion non-cash impairment charge in 2024. The downward revision in residual growth rates increased the impairment risk by reducing the projected long-term cash flows attributed to the asset.",

      "llm_answer": "The proportion of Oracle's cloud services revenues relative to total revenues increased from 32% in fiscal 2023 to 37% in fiscal 2024, following a prior increase from 25% in fiscal 2022. This growth indicates a strategic focus on expanding Oracle's cloud services, including Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and SaaS offerings, as a key driver of revenue and a shift toward cloud-based solutions for customers. The company expects this trend to continue, reflecting its emphasis on cloud innovation and migration of existing on-premise customers to cloud environments.",

      "llm_answer": "The net carrying amount of acquired trade secrets and processes decreased from $0.3 million as of October 2, 2022, to zero as of September 29, 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had an operating lease with Piedmont with a weighted average remaining lease term of 5 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.6%. By 2024, Duke Energy disclosed that its total remaining performance obligations for Piedmont amounted to $405 million, with $64 million due in 2025 and decreasing annually until $151 million in 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from a short-term lease-based relationship to a more structured, multi-year financial commitment with defined performance obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Duke Energy's financial commitment to Piedmont has significantly decreased. In 2022, Piedmont had operating lease liabilities of $19 million and finance lease liabilities of $16 million. By 2024, these amounts had dropped to $19 million in operating lease liabilities and $0 in finance lease liabilities. Additionally, remaining performance obligations for Piedmont fell from $405 million in 2023 to $405 million in 2024, indicating no change in long-term contractual obligations but a reduction in active liabilities. This suggests a reduction in active lease commitments while retaining some long-term obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Mondelēz explicitly excluded contingent consideration adjustments from its non-GAAP financial measures, noting in the footnotes that these adjustments were added to the non-GAAP definitions starting in the third quarter of 2021 to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance. By 2024, the company not only continued to exclude these adjustments from non-GAAP metrics but also provided a concrete financial figure—$60 million in contingent consideration adjustments were excluded in 2023 as part of the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. This shows that while the policy of exclusion remained consistent, the company evolved its reporting by quantifying the impact of these adjustments in 2024, offering greater transparency into their financial effect.",

This reflects a shift in how the company accounts for structural changes in its operations when presenting AFFO to investors.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the definition and presentation of AFFO (common stockholders) evolved by introducing \"Consolidated AFFO\" as an intermediate metric. In 2022, AFFO (common stockholders) was defined directly as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) adjusted for specific items. By 2024, the process became two-step: first calculating Consolidated AFFO from Nareit FFO (common stockholders) by adjusting for items like straight-line revenue and non-real estate depreciation, and then deriving AFFO (common stockholders) by excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests from Consolidated AFFO. This change provides a clearer view of the cash flow attributable specifically to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company's content amortization expense was $14,197,437, and it increased to $15,301,517 in 2024. This represents an increase of over $1.1 billion in amortization costs year-over-year. The rise in content amortization suggests that the company has been actively investing in new content and is systematically recognizing the cost of these assets over time, consistent with its strategy of expanding its content library to enhance subscriber growth and retention.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's content amortization expense increased from $14,197.4 million in 2023 to $15,301.5 million in 2024, reflecting a $1,104.1 million increase. This growth in amortization expense suggests that the company has continued to invest heavily in content assets, which are being amortized over their useful lives. The increase indicates a strategy of maintaining and potentially expanding its content library to support subscriber growth and monetization, as content remains a core driver of its competitive advantage and revenue generation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast used its three Cable Communications divisions as the unit of account for testing the impairment of cable franchise rights and performed either qualitative or quantitative assessments annually or more frequently if there were substantive changes in circumstances. By 2024, the company continued to perform annual impairment testing as of July 1 and maintained the use of qualitative assessments first, but placed more emphasis on periodic quantitative assessments to support qualitative conclusions. Additionally, in 2024, the company explicitly referenced the discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and also considered earnings multiples from comparable companies and recent transactions, suggesting a more detailed and market-informed approach compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast's approach to the valuation and impairment testing of its cable franchise rights has shifted from 2022 to 2024 in terms of the frequency of assessments and the use of qualitative versus quantitative methods. In 2022, Comcast conducted a quantitative assessment of its cable franchise rights as part of its practice of performing such assessments approximately every four years. By 2024, Comcast transitioned to a qualitative assessment, concluding that it was more likely than not that the fair values of its cable franchise rights were substantially higher than their carrying values, thus avoiding the need for a quantitative test. The units of account remained consistent, with franchise rights assessed based on geographic service areas derived from agreements with state and local governments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment of $(3) million, indicating a slight negative adjustment. However, in 2024, this figure shifted significantly to $(28) million, showing a much stronger negative impact on the company's financials. This indicates that AIG's claims management or reserving practices may have faced unforeseen challenges in 2024, leading to a larger-than-expected increase in loss adjustment expenses from prior years.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior year development for AIG decreased from $1 in 2023 to $10 in 2024. This indicates a slight improvement in the company's claims management or reserving practices, as the increase in ULAE development in 2024 suggests a modest adjustment to prior year reserves for additional expenses related to claim handling. However, the relatively small change implies that AIG's claims management processes remained largely consistent between the two years.",

By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include specific details about impairment testing, such as performing undiscounted operating cash flow analyses at the lowest identifiable asset group level and calculating impairment losses as the excess of an asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows or expected proceeds less disposal costs.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reported an expense of $46 million for Severance and benefits, with $79 million utilized or paid, resulting in a remaining liability of $139 million. In 2023, the expense increased significantly to $191 million, with $171 million utilized or paid, leaving a remaining liability of $105 million. This indicates a transformation in the company's utilization and funding approach, shifting from a relatively modest expense and moderate utilization in 2022 to a much higher expense and substantial utilization in 2023, suggesting a more active management or restructuring of severance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the utilization of severance and benefits increased from $117 million to $191 million, while the expense decreased slightly from $42 million to $42 million. This indicates that the company paid down a significant portion of its severance liabilities in 2023, suggesting active management of these obligations through workforce reductions and restructuring initiatives.",

By fiscal 2024, Licensed Stores Revenue had reached $2,747.4 million, accounting for 10.2% of North America Total Net Revenues, up slightly from $2,659.1 million or 10.0% in fiscal 2023. This indicates a continuation of growth, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the substantial year-over-year increase in 2022.",

By fiscal 2024, licensed stores revenue increased to $5.5 billion, representing 16.8% of total net revenues.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Veralto Distribution contributed approximately $2.6 billion in cash to Danaher, a portion of which was used to redeem certain outstanding indebtedness. By 2024, the distribution had a residual impact on accumulated comprehensive income, with a reported $974 million credit to the Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) account as part of the comprehensive income reconciliation. This indicates that while the immediate liquidity benefit was realized in 2023, the 2024 figures reflect the ongoing financial restructuring and capital optimization effects of the distribution, particularly in terms of balance sheet adjustments and long-term investment positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the Veralto Distribution on Danaher's comprehensive income significantly worsened between 2023 and 2024. In 2023, the distribution contributed a positive $974 million to comprehensive income, while in 2024, it resulted in a negative $974 million impact. This shift indicates a substantial long-term financial burden, as the distribution led to a significant reduction in accumulated comprehensive income, reflecting ongoing challenges such as foreign currency translation losses and adjustments related to pension and postretirement plans.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had a $400 million unsecured debt issuance linked to Piedmont. By 2024, this relationship had transformed from a debt-based connection to one involving performance obligations, with Duke disclosing a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations related to Piedmont, spread across 2025 through 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from direct debt financing to contractual performance-based financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont, as reflected in the disclosed debt obligations and performance commitments, shows a significant reduction in debt maturities. In 2022, Piedmont had no debt maturities, but by 2023, it had $45 million in maturities, increasing slightly to $40 million in 2024. However, the most notable change is the substantial increase in long-term debt obligations beyond 2024, rising from $2,660 million in 2022 to $4,050 million in 2024. This suggests a strategic shift towards long-term financing for Piedmont, with a focus on managing near-term liquidity while increasing long-term commitments.",

By 2023, the company had incurred total cumulative charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 for the same integration plan.

By 2024, MDLZ explicitly disclosed the pension participation changes as a quantified item with an impact of $(3) million that was excluded from Adjusted EPS calculations.

By 2024, this impact was no longer explicitly listed as a separate adjustment in the Adjusted Operating Income table, suggesting it had either diminished in significance or was incorporated into broader adjustments.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, mainly due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This reflects a significant reversal in the trend, moving from a modest improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate declined from 24.4% in fiscal 2022 to 23.5% in fiscal 2023. The key drivers behind this decline included inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DD&A expenses had a negative impact on COP's earnings, primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions resulting from increased costs and higher overall production volumes. This contributed to a net income (loss) decrease of $7,723 million. By 2024, DD&A expenses were reported at $9,599 million, up from $8,270 million in 2023, indicating a continued rise in these costs. While the explicit negative impact was not reiterated in 2024, the increase in absolute dollar terms suggests that DD&A remained a growing pressure point for the company, likely tied to sustained high production volumes and ongoing reserve adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, DD&A expenses for COP increased from $8,270 million to $9,599 million, driven by higher production volumes in the Lower 48 and Canada segments, as well as higher depreciation rates in Alaska and the Lower 48. This increase indicates a cost structure influenced by both volume growth and reserve revisions, reflecting ongoing development and asset utilization. The upward trend in DD&A also suggests sustained production levels and potential capital investment in high-output regions, despite slight declines in certain commodity prices.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast primarily used a discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and market participant estimates of future cash flows, supported by internal forecasts, to estimate fair value for impairment testing of owned content. By 2024, the company continued to assess fair value using Level 3 inputs, but with a more detailed emphasis on market participant estimates of future cash flows and a more structured approach to impairment assessments, including evaluating content either individually or in identified film groups depending on monetization strategy. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced explanation of impairment triggers, including events or changes in circumstances known or knowable as of the balance sheet date, and clarified the treatment of abandoned content, which is now recorded as substantively abandoned in programming and production costs. This represents a moderate transformation in methodology and specificity.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Comcast's approach to impairment testing for owned content has evolved in terms of specificity and fair value estimation. In 2022, the company primarily relied on discounted cash flow analyses and considered factors like Adjusted EBITDA multiples and historical performance for impairment assessments. By 2024, the basis for estimating fair value remained centered on discounted cash flow models but incorporated more detailed market participant estimates of future cash flows, supported by internal forecasts, and considered Level 3 inputs for licensed content. Additionally, the specificity of impairment assessments increased, with the substantial majority of owned content evaluated on an individual title basis, while licensed content was tested on a channel, network, or platform basis, with exceptions for broadcast networks and local stations tested on a daypart basis.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Starbucks recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to its Reinvention Plan, which focused on increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Additionally, the company had completed a prior restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 that included $155.4 million in restructuring and impairments, primarily from store closures and lease-related costs. By fiscal 2024, Starbucks reported no restructuring and impairments charges, in contrast to fiscal 2023, which had a $1.1 million charge. This indicates a reduction in impairment activity and a stabilization of restructuring efforts following the earlier strategic changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Starbucks shifted its restructuring and impairments focus from cost efficiency and store portfolio optimization to strategic investments and operational enhancements. In fiscal 2022, the company announced the Reinvention Plan, which aimed to elevate the customer and partner experience while increasing efficiency, resulting in minimal impairment charges. By fiscal 2024, restructuring efforts were largely complete, and the financial impact of impairments was negligible. Instead, Starbucks emphasized investments in technology, store partner wages, and new store formats, reflecting a strategic pivot toward growth and operational resilience rather than cost-cutting.",

By 2024, the company extended the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, aligning them more closely with the 30-year estimated useful life of tower assets. This change in accounting estimate, effective January 1, 2024, led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $730 million for the year.

      "llm_answer": "Southern Company's treatment of deferred cloud implementation costs evolved from 2022 to 2024 by increasing amortization expenses across its subsidiaries, with the costs amortized on a straight-line basis over the hosting arrangement term. In 2022, amortization was immaterial for Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas, with Southern Company reporting $29 million, Alabama Power $8 million, and Georgia Power $12 million. By 2024, these amounts increased to $56 million for Southern Company, $17 million for Alabama Power, and $22 million for Georgia Power, indicating a material rise in recognition. The materiality of these costs remained low for Southern Power and Southern Company Gas, as noted in disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ excluded contingent consideration adjustments from their Adjusted Operating Income as part of a list of exclusions that also included items like Simplify to Grow Program impacts and intangible asset impairments. By 2024, the company began disclosing specific contingent consideration adjustments within their Adjusted EPS reconciliation, with a reported impact of $(60) million in 2023 related to acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments. This represents a shift from general exclusion to explicit quantification and inclusion in adjusted financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MDLZ continued to include contingent consideration adjustments as part of the adjustments to operating income when calculating Adjusted Operating Income. In 2022, the adjustments for \"acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments\" were a negative $40 million, while in 2023, these adjustments increased to $246 million. By 2024, the 10-K does not explicitly list the contingent consideration adjustments, but the inclusion of such adjustments in the Adjusted Operating Income calculation remained consistent with prior years, as demonstrated in the 2023 disclosure. This indicates that MDLZ maintained its practice of excluding contingent consideration adjustments from Adjusted Operating Income to provide a clearer view of underlying operating performance.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, CMCSA recognized licensed content costs by capitalizing them when the license period began, the content was made available for use, and the costs were known, with amortization occurring as the associated programs were broadcast. Additionally, licensed content was tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network, or platform basis, except for broadcast networks and local stations, which were tested on a daypart basis. By 2024, the company maintained the capitalization criteria but refined the amortization methodology by incorporating 'estimated viewing patterns' into the process. Also in 2024, CMCSA explicitly classified licensed content as noncurrent assets under 'film and television costs' and clarified that production costs incurred in advance of airing are included in licensed content. The 2024 filing also introduced more detailed descriptions of co-financing arrangements and tax incentives, which were absent in 2022. These changes indicate a more nuanced and structured approach to licensed content asset management and cost recognition over time.",

Amortization is recognized as the associated programs are used, incorporating estimated viewing patterns. In 2024, the amortization of licensed content, including sports rights, was $14,668 million compared to $12,619 million in 2022, indicating an increase in amortization expense. The asset classification of licensed content remained as noncurrent assets in film and television costs, with amortization and related accrued costs included in programming and production expenses. No significant changes in methodology were noted in the provided pages.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed that its expected long-term rate of return assumptions were based on future expectations for returns by asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. By 2024, the company clarified that it actively rebalances the plans' investments specifically when they fall outside the target allocation ranges, indicating a more defined and action-oriented approach to asset management. This reflects a shift from a general disclosure of rebalancing practices to a more prescriptive and rule-based strategy tied directly to the target ranges.",
      "llm_answer": "The role of Target Allocation Ranges in managing defined benefit plan investments evolved from 2023 to 2024 as the U.S. Defined Benefit plan increased its equity allocation range from 20%–35% to 25%–40%, while reducing the fixed income range from 65%–80% to 60%–75%. The actual allocation in 2024 (39% equity and 61% fixed income) reflected a shift toward a higher equity exposure, indicating a more aggressive investment strategy compared to 2023. This adjustment suggests a recalibration of risk-return tradeoffs in alignment with updated long-term assumptions and asset-liability modeling.",

In 2024, this figure changed significantly to a negative impact of $28 million. This represents a substantial reduction in the magnitude of prior year development, suggesting that AIG's reserving practices may have become more accurate or that claims settlements for prior years were more favorable than previously estimated.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth was 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact remained at 1.0% compared to the prior year. However, this consistency occurred in the context of a significant shift in total sales growth performance—implying a growing relative influence of currency effects as overall growth slowed. In 2023, the company experienced total sales growth of 1.5%, with currency exchange rates contributing positively at 1.0%. In contrast, by 2024, total sales growth turned into a decline of 2.0%, while the currency impact remained unchanged at 1.0%. This suggests that despite the company's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations remaining constant, the importance of this factor in the broader context of sales performance increased as overall growth weakened.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a negative to a neutral or slightly positive effect. In 2023, currency exchange rates reduced reported sales growth by 1.0%, primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar. In 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates was a positive 1.5% in the Biotechnology segment and 1.0% in the Diagnostics segment, partially offsetting core sales declines. This suggests that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations remained significant but was somewhat mitigated in 2024, likely due to a more balanced or favorable currency environment or hedging strategies.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported $2.3 billion in structural cost savings realized during the year, contributing to a cumulative total of $9.7 billion since 2019. These savings were attributed to increased operational efficiencies, reduced staffing costs, and initiatives such as supply chain optimization and improved maintenance. By 2024, the company formalized 'Structural Cost Savings' as a defined earnings driver, explicitly incorporating it into its financial reporting framework to provide greater transparency into its cost management performance. This shift indicates that XOM elevated structural cost savings from an internal efficiency metric to a strategic financial reporting category, aligning it with other key earnings drivers like advantaged volume growth and base volume. The change reflects a broader strategic emphasis on sustaining cost discipline as a core component of earnings power.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's structural cost savings increased from $9.7 billion in 2023 to $12.1 billion in 2024, indicating a continued focus on sustainable cost reduction initiatives. This evolution reflects the company's disciplined expense management strategy, emphasizing operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and divestment-related savings.

By 2024, Piedmont had a significantly different profile in Duke Energy's disclosures, with a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations attributed to it, showing a growing financial commitment or operational involvement with Piedmont.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company amortized tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with a weighted average amortization period of 15 years as of December 31, 2023. These intangibles were directly tied to tenant contracts and relationships at the time of acquisition. By 2024, the company's disclosures expanded to emphasize a more detailed impairment review process for tenant-related intangibles, assessing them on a tenant-by-tenant basis for indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or customer financial instability. The company also began determining recoverability based on projected undiscounted future cash flows and measuring impairment losses using discounted cash flows or market data. This marks a shift from a purely amortization-focused approach to a more dynamic model involving periodic impairment assessments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the treatment of tenant-related intangibles evolved with a key change in amortization assumptions. In 2024, the Company extended the estimated useful life of its tower assets from 20 to 30 years, which directly impacted the amortization period for certain tenant-related intangible assets that are correlated with tower useful lives. This change was applied prospectively starting January 1, 2024, and resulted in lower annual amortization expenses. Additionally, the impairment review process for tenant-related intangibles remained focused on site-specific factors such as tenant lease status and financial viability, with no material changes in methodology reported.",

By 2023, the change in fair value again reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales, but this was driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time in combination with lower discount rates. This indicates a more favorable outlook for Skyrizi sales in 2023 compared to 2022 due to improved market dynamics and a decrease in discount rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the estimated sales of Skyrizi increased by 51%, driven by continued strong market share uptake and market growth across all indications, although this growth was partially offset by unfavorable pricing. The market outlook for Skyrizi improved due to its expanding role in treating multiple indications and its competitive positioning in the immunology space.",

By 2024, the company reiterated that environmental protection costs for that year were not significant and expected future expenditures to remain consistent with 2024 levels, barring major regulatory shifts. This indicates that Linde's approach to environmental compliance has remained stable over the three-year period, with no substantial increase in spending anticipated despite growing global emphasis on climate change mitigation and stricter environmental regulations in key markets like the EU, U.S., and China.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's environmental protection costs were not significant in both 2022 and 2024, with the company indicating that these costs are expected to remain at similar levels absent significant regulatory changes.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $8.50, which decreased to $7.64 in 2023—a drop of $0.86 or 10%. This decline occurred alongside a constant currency adjustment of -6% in 2023, suggesting that foreign exchange rates were not the primary driver of the drop. Instead, the decrease indicates a deliberate shift in pricing strategy, potentially to attract more subscribers in emerging markets where affordability is a key factor. This aligns with Netflix's broader strategic pivot toward global expansion and subscriber growth over short-term revenue per user, as evidenced by the significant increase in paid net membership additions from 5,391 thousand in 2022 to 7,315 thousand in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership from 2022 to 2023 reflected a 1% decline in constant currency terms, primarily due to a higher mix of memberships in lower-revenue regions and limited price increases, despite some pricing adjustments. This decline was partially offset by favorable plan mix changes. The international market focus, particularly in regions with lower average revenue per membership, contributed to the overall decrease, highlighting the impact of geographic expansion on revenue per user.",

By 2024, this figure had changed to -$28 million, indicating a significant negative adjustment.

Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized the sensitivity of Properties, Plant and Equipment valuations to volatile factors such as future commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes.

In 2023, the company noted that deferred tax liabilities for PP&E increased to $20,303 million, driven by changes in asset valuations and impairment reviews tied to factors like commodity prices and regulatory changes. By 2024, the company maintained similar impairment assessment criteria, with a focus on future undiscounted cash flows and potential impacts from environmental regulations and market conditions. Additionally, the company emphasized the sensitivity of PP&E valuations to assumptions such as commodity prices, production profiles, and carbon costs, highlighting the continued uncertainty and risk in impairment evaluations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy reported a stake in Piedmont valued at $4 million. By 2024, the relationship evolved from a simple stake to a more significant contractual and performance-based obligation, with Duke Energy disclosing a total remaining performance obligation related to Piedmont of $405 million. This indicates a substantial deepening of the financial relationship, shifting from a minor equity stake to a major contractual commitment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed metrics in their annual reports, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont evolved from 2023 to 2024 as follows:\n\nIn 2023, Piedmont had a severance liability of $2 million, with severance charges amounting to $4 million. By 2024, Piedmont's severance liability increased to $92 million, indicating a significant rise in severance-related obligations. Additionally, Piedmont's revenues from gas utilities and infrastructure in 2024 were $1,637 million, showing a substantial increase compared to the previous year. These changes suggest that Piedmont experienced increased operational costs and revenue growth in 2024 compared to 2023.",

By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, noting that value-based arrangements at Optum Health involve receiving per-patient per-month premiums under single performance obligations, where revenues are recognized as health care services are made available. This evolution indicates a more structured and service-linked approach to value-based premium revenue recognition over time.",

By 2024, the company continued to expand these arrangements, with premium revenues including value-based agreements where the company assumes responsibility for delivering and managing care in exchange for per-patient, per-month payments.

By 2024, the company exceeded this target, reporting an Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity of 105%. This evolution suggests an improvement in the company's ability to generate cash relative to its net earnings, surpassing its own long-term benchmark.

By 2024, the company no longer provided a specific dollar value for nonmarketable investments but instead elaborated on the valuation methodology, stating that these investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. This shift indicates a move from quantitative disclosure to qualitative explanation without updating the specific value, suggesting a more opaque but methodologically clarified approach to reporting these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Texas Instruments maintained a consistent valuation methodology for its nonmarketable investments, measuring them at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. However, the 2024 disclosures provided more detailed breakdowns of investment categories and their fair value measurements, reflecting a slight increase in transparency.

This change was influenced by several liability adjustments, including a $470.0 million increase in 2024 related to the extension of estimated settlement dates. Additionally, in 2024, revisions in estimates included a $125.0 million decrease and a $22.8 million increase in liability related to foreign currency translation for the years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively.

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant shift from a positive trend in 2022 to a negative impact in 2023, indicating a reversal in the trajectory of gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The Gross Profit Rate for Walmart decreased by 98 basis points between fiscal 2022 (24.4%) and fiscal 2023 (23.5%).

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM Financial indicated that used vehicle prices were expected to decrease relative to 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. It also stated that no impairment indicators were present in the leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. By 2023, the company quantified the financial impact of a 1% relative change in estimated residual values at year-end, showing that such a shift could directly affect depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio. This evolution indicates a shift from a qualitative assessment of residual value risk in 2022 to a more quantitative and scenario-based analysis in 2023, suggesting a more refined risk management approach.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GM Financial's exposure to residual value changes in the leased vehicle portfolio decreased, as reflected in the impact on depreciation expense. In 2022, a 1% relative change in residual values would have affected depreciation by $291 million over the remaining lease term, while in 2023, the impact was reduced to $227 million. This reduction indicates that GM Financial adjusted its residual value estimates in response to market conditions, such as high used vehicle prices in 2021, which led to increased residual values and a subsequent decrease in depreciation rates. The evolution of this exposure reflects a proactive risk management approach, where GM Financial regularly evaluates and adjusts residual value estimates to align with market realities and mitigate potential losses from declining vehicle values.",

By 2024, the core sales decline had improved to (1.5)%, showing a substantial reduction in the rate of decline. This evolution suggests that the company's underlying business performance strengthened significantly year-over-year, with core operations stabilizing and nearing growth.

This indicates a stabilization in the company's underlying business trends, as the rate of decline slowed significantly. The improvement was partially driven by a return to core sales growth in the Biotechnology segment's bioprocessing business in the second half of 2024, despite ongoing challenges in high-growth markets like China and Western Europe.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Refined Product Sales increased by 59,000 barrels per day, or 4 percent, primarily driven by higher demand for jet fuel and gasoline. However, in 2024, Refined Product Sales slightly declined from 1,287 thousand barrels per day (MBD) to 1,286 MBD. This indicates a shift from growth to near stability in downstream sales performance between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the volume of Refined Product Sales for Chevron's U.S. downstream operations decreased slightly by 1,000 barrels per day (from 1,287 MBD in 2023 to 1,286 MBD in 2024), while international downstream refined product sales increased by 50,000 barrels per day (from 1,445 MBD in 2023 to 1,495 MBD in 2024). This indicates that Chevron's downstream operational performance was mixed, with a slight decline in U.S. refined product sales likely due to refinery upgrades and downtime, while international operations saw growth driven by increased trading volumes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 44.6%, while in 2024 it decreased to 37.9%. This represents a decline of 6.7 percentage points, indicating a weakening in the company's profitability relative to revenue. The drop suggests that operating costs grew faster than revenue during this period, or that the company faced challenges such as lower pricing power, increased competition, or higher input costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 41.8% in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024, indicating a decline in profitability. This shift was primarily driven by lower revenue across both the Analog and Embedded Processing segments, as well as higher manufacturing costs. The reduction in operating margin suggests challenges in maintaining cost efficiency amid declining sales volumes, which could signal potential pressures on the company's cost management strategies.",

However, in 2023, the company incurred $92 million in restructuring and related costs, signaling a renewed focus on organizational changes or cost optimization efforts. This shift suggests that the company initiated new restructuring activities in 2023 after a period of inactivity.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's restructuring and related costs decreased from $88 million in 2022 to $68 million in 2023, indicating a reduction in restructuring activities and a focus on stabilizing operations. This decline suggests that the company had largely completed its restructuring initiatives by 2023 and was shifting its strategic focus toward leveraging operational efficiencies, cost savings, and growth in core markets rather than ongoing restructuring efforts.",

In 2024, the same factors—core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—continued to positively influence the gross margin percentage, again contributing a combined 35 basis points, despite the same offsetting pressure from increased 2% rewards. This indicates a consistent upward trend in gross margin performance from these areas, with no material change in the magnitude of their contributions.",
      "llm_answer": "The Canadian Segment Gross Margin Percentage in 2024 increased primarily due to positive contributions from both core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary businesses. Specifically, core merchandise categories contributed an 11-basis-point increase, driven by non-foods, while warehouse ancillary and other businesses added 19 basis points, primarily from e-commerce and gasoline. However, these gains were partially offset by a 3-basis-point impact from increased 2% rewards. Overall, the Canadian segment's gross margin percentage improved due to these combined factors.",

In 2024, the CAS pension cost decreased to $1,684 million, while the FAS pension service cost was $60 million, leading to a total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment of $1,624 million.

By 2024, the company clarified that fixed lease income included both fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM reimbursements recorded on a straight-line basis. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward stabilizing revenue streams by emphasizing predictable income components such as fixed minimums and CAM reimbursements, while reducing reliance on variable tenant-sales-based income.",

      "question": "How has the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue evolved between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Installed Base Growth was explicitly stated as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue alongside average revenue per user expansion and the shift from on-premises Office to Office 365. In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever. This suggests that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue has remained a key factor, with continued emphasis on expanding the user base across new markets and segments. The 2024 document reiterates that Office Commercial revenue is primarily influenced by installed base growth, average revenue per user expansion, and the shift from on-premises licensing to Office 365 subscriptions, consistent with the 2023 description. This indicates that while the core drivers have not changed, the focus on growth remains central to the segment's performance.",

By 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained stable at 7%, but paid net membership additions surged dramatically, increasing by 232% to reach 29,529 thousand.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's streaming revenue grew by 7%, and paid net membership additions increased by 232%. Despite a 1% decline in average monthly revenue per paying membership, the substantial rise in membership additions indicates a shift toward volume growth, particularly in lower-revenue regions. This suggests a strategic focus on expanding market share globally, even at the expense of immediate revenue per user growth, signaling a maturation in the company's growth trajectory.",

By 2024, Chevron maintained the same GHG intensity target of 24 kg CO₂e/boe but had increased its total lower-carbon investments to $7.7 billion since 2021, indicating a continued commitment to its 2028 targets and broader 2050 net zero upstream production aspiration. Additionally, in 2024, Chevron placed more emphasis on external dependencies like technology development and policy incentives to achieve its long-term goals, signaling a strategic shift toward integrating external enablers into its GHG reduction pathway.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's approach to reducing oil production GHG intensity between 2023 and 2024 has shown a more concrete and accelerated strategic alignment with its long-term net zero goals. In 2023, the company outlined its 2028 portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) target of 71 grams CO₂e/MJ and a $10 billion capital allocation plan through 2028 for lower-carbon investments, including $2.9 billion for the acquisition of Renewable Energy Group (REG). By 2024, Chevron had already spent $7.7 billion in lower-carbon investments and announced additional plans for $2–3 billion in structural cost reductions by 2026, emphasizing operational efficiency and leveraging technology.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Procter & Gamble's Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity was 93%, indicating that adjusted free cash flow was slightly below net earnings. By 2024, this metric improved to 105%, showing that the company generated more free cash flow than its net earnings after adjustments. This evolution suggests enhanced cash flow efficiency and stronger cash generation relative to earnings over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Procter & Gamble's Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity decreased from 107% in 2022 to 105% in 2024, indicating a slight decline in the efficiency of converting net earnings into adjusted free cash flow. This shift suggests that while the company continued to generate strong cash flows, a larger portion of its earnings was being used for operational and capital expenditures, or impacted by non-core charges such as the Gillette impairment and restructuring costs, thereby reducing the cash flow available for discretionary uses like dividends and share repurchases.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM reported $356 million in unrecognized tax benefits that could favorably affect its future effective tax rate. In 2023, this amount increased to $386 million. This represents a $30 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, suggesting a slight upward trend in the company's potential tax savings in the future, though the company noted that it is still not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change in these benefits over the next twelve months.",
      "llm_answer": "The unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) disclosed by General Motors (GM) increased from $520 million at the end of 2022 to $585 million at the end of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by additions to current year and prior years' tax positions, partially offset by reductions and settlements. The $65 million increase in UTBs suggests that GM faces ongoing tax uncertainties, which could affect its future effective tax rate. Specifically, $386 million of the 2023 UTBs could favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized, indicating potential future tax savings. However, the uncertainty around these positions and the inability to estimate changes in the next twelve months suggest continued volatility in the effective tax rate.",

In 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained consistent at 7%, while the operating margin improved to 21%. This indicates that despite a similar pace of revenue growth, Netflix enhanced its profitability through better cost management or operational efficiencies.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's streaming revenue growth rate slowed from 19% in 2021 to 7% in 2023, while its operating margin expanded from 18% in 2022 to 21% in 2023. The slower revenue growth was driven by a decline in average monthly revenue per paying membership and the impact of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by membership growth. The improved operating margin resulted from revenue growth outpacing cost increases, particularly in content amortization and marketing expenses. This indicates a shift toward greater operational efficiency despite moderating revenue growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group listed 'medical costs payable' as a key component of its short-term cash requirements, indicating it was a primary liability to be settled within twelve months through cash flows from operations and available cash. The company emphasized that it expected to meet these obligations using operational cash flows and did not foresee liquidity issues due to its strong capital position. By 2024, the treatment of medical costs payable shifted to being a central focus in the company's accounting estimates and judgments, specifically under 'Use of Estimates' in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Here, medical costs payable was described as one of the most significant estimates requiring complex assumptions due to its inherent uncertainty and likelihood of change over time. The 2024 disclosure also highlighted that changes in estimates for medical costs payable were recognized in earnings during the period of adjustment, indicating a more dynamic and potentially volatile nature compared to the more static view in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, UnitedHealth Group's treatment and estimation of medical costs payable remained a critical component of its cash requirements, with the company consistently relying on these estimates to manage liquidity and financial obligations. In 2022, medical costs payable adjustments contributed $4.053 billion to operating cash flows, while by 2024, this contribution slightly decreased to $2.503 billion. The accounting policies applied involved using actuarial methods, including completion factors and medical cost trend factors, to estimate incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. These estimates were refined over time as more claim data became available, with adjustments impacting medical costs in the period identified. The company maintained a systematic and automated process for these estimations, considering factors like claim processing lags, seasonal trends, and membership changes.",

The facility had no financial covenants, was unsecured, and fees to maintain it were described as immaterial. In 2023, the Company entered into a new $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility in February 2023, which replaced the May 2018 facility. The terms remained largely consistent, with no financial covenants, unsecured status, and multiple interest rate alternatives. Again, fees to maintain the facility were disclosed as immaterial. While the facility was renewed with the same capacity, the timing of the renewal shifted from May to February, indicating a potential adjustment in the company's financial planning or negotiation cycle.",

The terms remained largely consistent, with no financial covenants, no termination clauses tied to credit ratings or adverse changes, and immaterial maintenance fees. The key change was the extension of the facility's duration to five years from the prior five-year term, ensuring continued support for general corporate purposes and commercial paper borrowings.",

By 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of 1% on sales, indicating a reversal in this dynamic. This shift suggests that LIN experienced a change in its cost structure or pricing strategy, where rising costs were no longer fully recoverable through pricing adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of cost pass-through on sales shifted from being a positive contributor to a negative one, indicating a change in LIN's pricing dynamics. In 2021 (as referenced in 2022 filings), cost pass-through increased sales in the EMEA and Americas segments, with minimal impact on operating profit, suggesting that LIN was effectively passing on cost increases to customers. However, by 2024, cost pass-through decreased sales in the EMEA segment by 4% and slightly reduced sales in the Americas, while only modestly increasing sales in APAC by 1%. This shift suggests that LIN faced challenges in maintaining pricing power, potentially due to market pressures or customer resistance to higher prices, leading to a less favorable cost pass-through environment.",

However, in fiscal 2024, these costs surged by 157.4% in dollar terms, rising from $20.2 million to $52.0 million. This indicates that while the company was able to manage these costs effectively in 2023, it faced significant cost pressures in 2024, undermining earlier efficiency gains.",

This decline was driven by increased sales from pricing (70 basis points) and reduced supply chain costs (60 basis points).

This indicates that while the region maintained a relatively stable revenue level, its proportional importance to Cisco's global product revenue slightly declined due to stronger performance in other regions.",

By 2024, this figure had increased by $162 million, or 8%, indicating a positive upward trend in sales performance for the segment. However, despite the sales growth, operating profit for the Engineering segment decreased by $81 million, or 16%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher margins in the prior year from the wind-down of sanctioned Russian projects. This suggests that while sales grew, profitability was negatively impacted by the absence of those prior-year benefits.",

In 2023, this figure increased significantly to $4,778 million, driven by a substantial rise in warranties issued and assumed (from $2,593 million to $3,282 million) and a dramatic increase in adjustments and other (from $260 million to $1,493 million).

      "llm_answer": "GM's net warranty expense increased from $2,606 million in 2021 to $4,778 million in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a significant rise in \"warranties issued and assumed in period\" from $4,485 million in 2021 to $3,282 million in 2023, largely due to recall campaigns like the Chevrolet Bolt recall. Additionally, there was a notable shift in \"supplier recoveries accrued in period,\" which moved from a negative $2,175 million in 2021 to a positive $3 million in 2023, indicating improved supplier reimbursement.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through was described as a positively impacting factor due to Linde's long-term contracts that allowed for the transfer of energy and feedstock cost fluctuations to customers, contributing to stable cash flow. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact, contributing to a (1)% change in sales. This shift indicates a change in the effectiveness or direction of cost pass-through mechanisms, possibly due to market conditions or contract renegotiations, affecting Linde's pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through mechanisms on Linde's sales shifted from a positive contributor to a negative factor. In 2022, cost pass-through increased sales by 5%, reflecting the billing of higher energy costs to customers. By 2024, however, cost pass-through decreased sales by 1%, indicating that energy costs had stabilized or declined, reducing the need for such pass-throughs. This shift suggests that Linde's pricing dynamics have transitioned from being influenced by external cost fluctuations to being more driven by strategic price attainment and operational efficiencies.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM reported 'Adjustments and other' at $260 million, while in 2023, this figure increased significantly to $1,493 million.

      "llm_answer": "The 'Adjustments and other' component of GM's product warranty expense increased significantly from $260 million in 2022 to $1,493 million in 2023. This substantial increase likely reflects adjustments related to recall campaigns, such as the Chevrolet Bolt recall, and other warranty-related factors, including supplier recoveries and changes in estimated warranty liabilities.

In 2024, this recognition method remained consistent; however, the company placed increased emphasis on the month-to-month nature of these overage fees, reinforcing that they are recognized only when the customer actually uses the service beyond the plan's allowance. While the core revenue recognition principle remained unchanged, the 2024 disclosure provided more explicit language around the timing and conditions of overage fee recognition, indicating a subtle refinement in how the company communicates its policy, rather than a substantive accounting change.",
      "llm_answer": "Verizon's treatment of overage usage revenue for postpaid wireless plans remained consistent between 2023 and 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed 2% to the year-over-year sales growth, indicating that rising costs were at least partially transferred to customers. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on the year-over-year sales comparison, suggesting that either cost pressures eased or LIN was less able to pass through cost increases to customers. This shift reflects a reversal in the company's cost pass-through dynamics, moving from a supportive factor to a slight drag on sales growth.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through on sales shifted from a positive contributor to a negative one. In 2022, cost pass-through increased sales by 3% in the Americas and 6% in EMEA, indicating that LIN was effectively passing on higher energy costs to customers. By 2024, cost pass-through decreased sales by 1%, suggesting that LIN faced challenges in maintaining pricing power or that energy costs had stabilized or declined. This shift indicates that LIN's cost management dynamics improved over time, as lower cost pass-through, combined with higher pricing and productivity initiatives, helped offset cost inflation and drive operating profit growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer's Upjohn Business was still referenced in the context of historical spin-off activities, with its financial results reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, Pfizer noted that approximately 75% of the expected $700 million in separation costs had been incurred by the end of 2021. By 2023, the Upjohn Business was formally defined in the glossary as 'Pfizer's former global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business,' which had been spun-off on November 16, 2020, and combined with Mylan to create Viatris. This shift indicates a move from active financial tracking and cost reporting to a more historical and definitional reference, suggesting the integration and separation process had largely concluded by 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the Upjohn Business, which was previously part of Pfizer, remained classified as a discontinued operation following its spin-off in November 2020. In the 2023 10-K, there is no indication of a renewed financial or strategic integration with Pfizer, and it is not mentioned as part of Pfizer’s ongoing operations or strategic positioning. The focus of Pfizer in 2023 remained on its core Biopharma segment, with no significant changes in the relationship or reporting structure related to the Upjohn Business.",

By 2023, this revenue decreased to $5,466 million, and its percentage contribution dropped to 13.9%. This indicates a decline in both the absolute revenue and relative importance of the APJC region to Cisco's overall product revenue during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco's APJC product revenue increased from $5,854 million in 2022 to $5,466 million in 2023, representing a decrease of $388 million, or 6.6%. Its percentage contribution to total product revenue dropped from 15.4% in 2022 to 13.9% in 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM's Automotive Interest Expense was $987 million, while its Automotive Financing - GM Financial Interest Expense was $2,881 million, indicating a combined total interest expense of $3,868 million. By 2023, Automotive Interest Expense decreased to $911 million, but Automotive Financing - GM Financial Interest Expense rose sharply to $4,685 million, resulting in a total interest expense of $5,596 million. This shift shows that the proportion of interest costs attributed to GM Financial increased significantly, suggesting a greater reliance on financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GM's Automotive Interest Expense decreased slightly from $987 million to $911 million, while its Automotive Financing - GM Financial Interest Expense increased significantly from $2,881 million to $4,685 million. This indicates a shift in GM's financial structure, with a growing reliance on GM Financial's debt and financing activities, which carry a much higher interest burden. The increase in GM Financial's interest expense reflects its expanded role in financing operations, likely driven by higher borrowing levels and longer maturity periods for its secured and unsecured debt.",

In contrast, by 2024, the cost of wireless equipment surged to $26,100 million, with $21,259 million attributed to the Consumer segment and $4,841 million to the Business segment. This significant increase of over $21 billion indicates a major shift in strategy, likely tied to increased investment in or sales of wireless equipment.",

By 2023, the definition changed to exclude amortization of intangible assets instead of purchase accounting for acquisitions, along with acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. This indicates a shift in the nature of adjustments being emphasized in the metric's calculation.",

In both years, Adjusted Cost of Sales excluded purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. However, in 2023, the exclusion of \"certain significant items\" included more specific examples such as inventory losses and tornado-related costs at a manufacturing facility, which were not explicitly highlighted in the 2022 description. Additionally, in 2023, the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP adjusted information included more detailed explanations of the nature and impact of these exclusions, providing greater transparency to investors.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MO's total oral tobacco products held a retail share of 42.5%, which declined to 37.5% in 2024. This indicates a weakening in the company's competitive position in the oral tobacco segment over this period. Specific brands like Copenhagen and Skoal experienced notable declines, with Copenhagen dropping from 23.5% to 19.1%, and Skoal from 9.3% to 7.6%. While on! saw an increase from 6.8% to 8.3%, it was not enough to offset the overall decline.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the retail share of MO's oral tobacco products declined from 42.5% to 37.5%, primarily due to losses in the MST (moist snuff) category, despite growth in the oral nicotine pouch segment. This indicates a weakening competitive position in the MST segment, as market share was eroded by competitors and the rising popularity of nicotine pouches, while the company's on! brand saw mixed performance with both growth and share losses in the pouch category.",

      "question": "How did FedEx's assumptions regarding future salary increases for pension plan obligations evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's long-term compensation expectations?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx's pension plan assumptions included future salary increases as a key component in calculating the projected benefit obligation, which stood at $28.7 billion. By 2024, while the company continued to disclose pension plan assumptions, it emphasized a strategic shift by closing its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees starting 2020 and introducing an enhanced 401(k) plan with an 8% company match. This indicates a reduced emphasis on defined benefit plans and a shift toward defined contribution plans, suggesting a moderation in long-term salary-linked pension liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, FedEx's assumptions for future salary increases used to determine pension obligations rose from 5.11% in 2022 to 5.29% in 2024. This gradual increase suggests that the company expects moderate long-term salary growth for employees covered under its pension plans, aligning with broader economic and compensation trends. However, the relatively stable rate also indicates a cautious approach, reflecting the shift toward defined contribution plans and reduced emphasis on future pension obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of stock-settled PSUs issued prior to 2013 received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to retained earnings. However, by 2024, the company clarified that recipients of stock-settled PSUs authorized beginning in 2013 receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense, rather than retained earnings, and these are paid at the time of settlement. This reflects a shift in both the timing and accounting treatment of dividend equivalents for newer PSU grants.",

In 2023, recipients of stock-settled PSUs issued prior to 2013 received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent charged to retained earnings until the shares were issued. By 2024, recipients of stock-settled PSUs authorized for future grants received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to compensation expense, which was paid at the time of settlement. Additionally, the vesting timing shifted, with PSUs vesting upon settlement following the conclusion of the three-year performance period, and compensation expense recognized over the period from authorization to the end of the performance period.",

This significant decrease suggests a major shift in Netflix's pricing strategy or a change in the geographic or demographic composition of its subscriber base, such as a greater proportion of users in lower-priced tiers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the average monthly revenue per paying membership for Netflix decreased by 10% from $8.50 to $7.64. This decline indicates that despite an increase in the number of paying memberships, the revenue generated per member decreased, which could be attributed to factors such as a shift in plan mix, higher membership growth in regions with lower average revenue per member, and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This suggests that Netflix's pricing strategy may have been less effective in 2023 or that market dynamics, such as increased competition or customer sensitivity to price changes, may have influenced the decrease in average revenue per member.",

      "llm_answer": "COP's outlook for commodity prices ($/BOE) decreased from an average of $64.39 in 2021 (as reported in 2022's 10-K) to a range of $48.63 - $57.53, with an average of $53.38, by December 31, 2024. This decline indicates a more conservative expectation for future energy market conditions, likely reflecting market volatility, potential oversupply, or reduced long-term price growth assumptions.",

However, it also revealed that $9.4 billion in costs were incurred during the year for the development of PUDs. Additionally, 2024 included detailed geographic breakdowns of PUD development timelines, noting that 88% of PUDs were scheduled for development within five years, with specific mention of the Lower 48, Canada, Alaska's Willow project, and an equity affiliate in Australia. This indicates a shift from merely defining PUDs in 2023 to providing detailed disclosures on investment, development timelines, and geographic focus in 2024.",

The increase was driven by revisions (535 MMBOE), purchases (57 MMBOE), and extensions and discoveries (281 MMBOE), partially offset by transfers to proved developed reserves (509 MMBOE). Costs associated with PUD development in 2024 were $9.4 billion, with 88% of PUDs under development or scheduled for development within five years, except for some long-term projects like the Willow project in Alaska.",

This growth suggests increased product sales and potential higher exposure to warranty claims over time. Additionally, the company's purchase commitments decreased substantially from $9,066 million in 2022 to $4,968 million in 2024, reflecting a reduction in long-term obligations for wafers, substrates, and IP licenses.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the income tax expense (benefit) on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using applicable tax rates in relevant jurisdictions and included both current and deferred tax amounts. The rationale for excluding purchase accounting impacts focused on the merger of equals structure, geographic management approach, and the need for comparability across segments and with peers. By 2024, the company retained the same technical explanation for the tax impact but added specificity to its rationale by referencing the 2018 business combination explicitly, reinforcing the long-standing nature of the merger and its ongoing influence on financial reporting. This evolution indicates a more detailed contextualization of the merger's lasting effects on financial disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the treatment and disclosure of the current and deferred income tax impact on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments remained consistent in rationale but evolved in magnitude. The company continued to exclude these impacts using jurisdiction-specific tax rates, as they are tied to purchase accounting adjustments from the Linde AG merger. The rationale emphasized comparability across geographies, alignment with management evaluation, and investor transparency. In 2024, the total tax adjustments were $258 million, compared to $534 million in 2022, reflecting a reduction in the magnitude of purchase accounting impacts over time.",

Additionally, the carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $344.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with tower portfolio and network location intangible assets valued at $916.2 million and $243.6 million, respectively. By 2024, the Company finalized a review of estimated useful lives of its tower assets, extending the depreciation period from 20 to 30 years, which led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year. This change in accounting estimate reflects a shift in the long-term valuation and treatment of the India reporting unit's assets.",

By 2024, no further goodwill impairments were recorded for the India reporting unit, as the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense. This applied particularly to PSUs with performance periods beginning before 2018, where recipients received dividend equivalents only after the performance period ended and until settlement. For PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received accrued reinvested dividend equivalents, which were paid at the time of settlement. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted to stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs), where most recipients received either a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to retained earnings. Additionally, the grant date fair market value of RSUs that did not receive a dividend equivalent was adjusted to reflect the net present value of estimated dividends not received. This represents a shift from cash-settled to stock-settled instruments with distinct implications for dividend equivalent treatment and financial accounting.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips transitioned the treatment of dividend equivalents for unvested stock-settled awards from cash payments charged to retained earnings to accrued reinvested dividend equivalents charged to compensation expense.

This growth was driven by higher segment operating profits, which rose from $7,176 million in 2022 to $9,720 million in 2024. Additionally, the impact of cost reduction programs and other charges decreased significantly, from a deduction of $273 million in 2022 to $145 million in 2024. The purchase accounting impacts from LindeAG also declined, from $1,919 million in 2022 to $940 million in 2024, further contributing to the overall improvement in operating profit.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $4,984 million in 2022 to $8,635 million in 2024. This growth was driven by strong performance in the Americas and EMEA segments, with operating profit rising 7% and 12%, respectively, in 2024 compared to 2023. The APAC segment also contributed positively with a 6% increase in operating profit. In contrast, the Engineering segment saw a significant decline in operating profit, decreasing by 16% in 2024 due to a lack of benefits from the prior year's wind-down of projects in Russia. Reconciling items, such as cost reduction programs and purchase accounting impacts, had a smaller effect, with cost reduction programs reducing operating profit by $145 million in 2024 compared to $40 million in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron described crude oil liftings as a factor that 'impacted' its forward-looking statements, indicating an external influence among many others. By 2024, the company shifted its language to state that its forward-looking statements 'depend on' crude oil liftings, placing it among a narrower group of critical factors affecting outcomes. This change in phrasing indicates a more direct and central framing of crude oil liftings in relation to the company's projections, though the document does not quantify or elaborate on the extent of this dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's characterization of the relationship between crude oil liftings and its forward-looking statements has evolved from 2022 to 2024 by incorporating additional context around timing and external factors. In 2022, the company listed \"timing of crude oil liftings\" as a factor affecting forward-looking statements, while in 2024, it expanded this to \"timing of crude oil liftings\" as part of a broader set of uncertainties, including market conditions, geopolitical events, and supply chain disruptions. This evolution reflects a more nuanced acknowledgment of the interplay between operational timing and external market dynamics in shaping forward-looking outcomes.",

      "question": "How has the role of gasoline costs in Costco's financial performance evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic dependence on or sensitivity to this economic factor?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, gasoline costs were described as a negative impact on Costco's business, with rising energy prices contributing to adverse effects on demand, cost of inventory, and operational expenses. The company expressed concerns about its ability to pass on these cost increases without negatively affecting consumer demand. By 2024, however, the framing shifted: gasoline cost fluctuations were described as a factor influencing comparable sales growth, indicating that Costco had begun to treat gasoline price volatility not just as a cost burden, but as a lever affecting sales performance and potentially pricing strategy. This evolution shows that gasoline costs became a more integral, strategic variable in Costco's financial dynamics, rather than solely a risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, gasoline costs continued to influence Costco's financial performance, primarily by affecting net sales growth and gross margin percentages. Rising gasoline prices in 2024 increased net sales due to higher transaction volumes, but they also reduced gross margin percentages because gasoline has a lower margin compared to other merchandise. However, gasoline sales helped lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales by leveraging fixed costs across a larger sales base. This indicates that while Costco's business is sensitive to gasoline price fluctuations, it strategically uses its gasoline operations to drive customer traffic and enhance overall profitability through sales leverage.",

This business, which included 232 stores and 210 dealer-owned stores under banners like RONA and Lowe's Canada, was no longer part of the company's operations by 2024. Financially, the sale resulted in contingent consideration, which was recorded at fair value and adjusted in subsequent periods, impacting earnings through gains or losses. Strategically, the divestiture allowed Lowe's to focus on its core U.S. operations and reallocate capital to other growth initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BMY reported IPRD-related impairment charges of $136 million, primarily due to discontinuation of development for certain investigational compounds. By 2024, these impairment charges surged to $2.9 billion, indicating a significant increase in the write-down of intangible assets, particularly IPRD. This evolution reflects a more aggressive reassessment of asset valuations, likely due to changing market conditions, regulatory challenges, or internal strategic shifts. The increase from $136 million to $2.9 billion shows a substantial change in how BMY evaluated the recoverability of its IPRD assets within a single year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, BMY's treatment and valuation of IPRD-related impairment charges showed a significant shift. In 2023, impairment charges were relatively modest at $136 million, primarily due to decisions to discontinue development of certain investigational compounds to prioritize other pipeline opportunities. However, in 2024, impairment charges surged to $2.9 billion, indicating a more aggressive reassessment of IPRD assets, likely driven by changes in clinical timelines, competitive landscapes, and regulatory outcomes. This evolution suggests a more proactive and strategic approach to managing intangible assets, where BMY is willing to write down underperforming projects to focus resources on higher-potential opportunities, reflecting a disciplined and value-driven asset management strategy.",

The cost of Subscription and Support Revenue fell from $5,821 million in 2023 to $6,177 million in 2024, but grew at a slower rate than revenues, contributing to the improvement in gross margin.",

      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Converse's direct to consumer (DTC) and wholesale revenue channels experienced notable changes. In fiscal 2022, DTC revenues increased by 22% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by strong digital demand, while wholesale revenues decreased by 4% due to marketplace dynamics and supply chain constraints. By fiscal 2024, DTC revenues declined by 14% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to reduced traffic in North America and Western Europe, although growth in Asia partially offset this decline. Wholesale revenues also decreased by 16% on a currency-neutral basis, with declines across all geographies. Key drivers of these changes included shifts in consumer demand, regional market conditions, and increased promotional activity affecting average selling prices.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's treatment and estimation of medical costs payable evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of its financial assumptions and risk management approach?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group highlighted its cash and investment balances, including $21.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and emphasized that fluctuations in asset values would not materially impact liquidity due to strong operating cash flows and access to credit facilities. Medical costs payable were part of the short-term obligations expected to be covered through operational cash flows and available liquidity. In 2023, the company placed greater emphasis on the estimation methodology for medical costs payable, noting that these estimates require complex assumptions and are inherently uncertain, often changing in subsequent periods. The 2023 disclosure also explicitly tied changes in estimates directly to earnings in the period they are adjusted, signaling a more dynamic and risk-sensitive approach to financial reporting around medical liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, UnitedHealth Group maintained a consistent actuarial process for estimating medical costs payable, applying factors such as time from service to claim processing, seasonal trends, and membership volume. However, in 2023, the Company emphasized more refined adjustments to its assumptions, particularly in response to evolving healthcare trends and data availability. The risk management approach remained focused on closely monitoring claim submission patterns and adjusting estimates as more complete claim data became available, with approximately 90% of claims settled within 90 days. The Company also highlighted its automated and centrally controlled actuarial models, which incorporate variables like care activity and contract rate changes, ensuring a systematic and responsive estimation process.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), transitioning from a partial owner to full ownership. This marked a significant shift in strategic involvement, as disclosed in the 2024 filing. The acquisition was funded through new debt issuance of $2.7 billion, increasing total debt from $16.6 billion in 2022 to $18.9 billion by the end of 2023. This reflects a transformation from a shared-operational model to full control, which likely influenced capital allocation decisions, including the planned $9 billion return of capital in 2024, signaling confidence in the company’s post-acquisition financial positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "ConocoPhillips fully acquired Surmont in October 2023 by purchasing the remaining 50% working interest from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), increasing its ownership to 100%. This acquisition was financed through cash and new long-term debt. The transaction added approximately $2.9 billion in proved and $0.2 billion in unproved oil and gas properties to ConocoPhillips' asset base. The acquisition also included a contingent payment arrangement, under which ConocoPhillips paid $158 million in 2024, with potential future payments up to $0.4 billion CAD over five years based on WCS crude oil prices and production targets. This shift increased ConocoPhillips' debt balance and expanded its asset portfolio in the Canada segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported total content obligations of $21.8 billion, with $4.5 billion classified as current content liabilities and $3.1 billion as non-current content liabilities. In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with current content liabilities remaining unchanged at $4.5 billion, but non-current content liabilities decreased to $2.6 billion. This reflects a reduction in long-term obligations, suggesting a shift in the maturity structure of Netflix's content liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Converse revenues stood at $2,346 million, showing a 6% increase compared to the previous year. However, by fiscal 2024, Converse revenues had decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This decline was primarily attributed to drops in North America and Western Europe, with combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales down 12%, driven largely by a decrease in wholesale. Additionally, average selling price (ASP) fell by 3%, mainly due to increased promotional activity in the direct-to-consumer channel.",
      "llm_answer": "Converse's revenue performance declined between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, with a 14% decrease in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023. This decline was driven by a 15% drop in wholesale revenues and a 14% decrease in direct-to-consumer revenues, primarily due to reduced traffic in North America and Western Europe. Factors contributing to the financial trajectory included a 30% drop in EBIT, driven by a 130 basis point gross margin contraction from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, increased promotional activity, and higher other costs, partially offset by lower freight rates and reduced operating overhead expenses.",

By 2024, the company had already spent $7.7 billion on lower carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022, reaffirming its commitment to the same $10 billion total target through 2028. This indicates that Chevron has maintained its long-term capital commitment to lower carbon initiatives, while accelerating spending in the early years, particularly through strategic acquisitions that support its broader decarbonization goals.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's planned capital allocation for lower carbon investments increased from $10 billion through 2028 as announced in 2021, with $2 billion allocated to reduce the carbon intensity of traditional oil and gas operations and $8 billion for investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and offsets. By 2024, the company had already spent $7.7 billion in lower carbon investments, including the acquisition of REG in 2022.

By 2024, this amount increased significantly to $110 million total liabilities, with $69 million current and $41 million non-current.

This signaled a strategic move to enhance decision-making tools in biopharma services. By 2024, the segment's revenues increased slightly from $23.041 billion to $23.157 billion, indicating a continuation and consolidation of prior strategic initiatives, though no new major acquisitions were disclosed for that year. This reflects a shift from active expansion through acquisitions in 2023 to a more stable growth phase in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific's Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment experienced flat organic revenue growth in 2024 (0% growth), driven by growth in the research and safety channel and clinical research business, but offset by decreased demand in COVID-19 vaccines and therapies-related activity. In 2023, the segment achieved 2% organic revenue growth, primarily due to higher sales in the clinical research and pharma services businesses. In terms of acquisitions, the segment acquired CorEvitas, LLC in August 2023 to expand its real-world evidence solutions, but no significant acquisitions were disclosed in 2024. Segment income margin declined in 2024 to 13.3% from 14.6% in 2023, primarily due to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments.",

By 2024, Tire Installation was explicitly called out as a distinct category under warehouse ancillary services, indicating a more deliberate emphasis on its importance. This evolution suggests that Costco may have elevated the strategic positioning of Tire Installation, potentially aligning it more closely with core member services to drive traffic or enhance the value proposition for members.",

By 2024, the category remained unchanged, with warehouse ancillary services contributing 12% of total net sales.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Combat Systems segment contributed 18% to General Dynamics' consolidated revenue, while in 2023, this contribution increased to 20%. This indicates a slight strategic emphasis on the segment, potentially driven by expanded provisioning of missile subsystems, including next-generation capabilities such as hypersonic rocket cases, which were specifically highlighted in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The Combat Systems segment's revenue contribution to General Dynamics' consolidated revenue increased from 18% in 2022 to 20% in 2023, while remaining relatively stable at around 19% in 2021. This growth reflects the segment's strong performance in military vehicles, weapons systems, and munitions, driven by international and U.S. defense demand. The upward trend indicates a strategic positioning as a key growth driver for the company, supported by expanding production capacity and modernization efforts in defense programs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, Linde plc reported income from equity investments at $119 million, with an adjusted figure of $231 million, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in APAC effective January 1, 2021. By 2024, the reported income from equity investments had stabilized at $170 million, with values of $167 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022. This represents a decrease from the adjusted 2021 level but shows relative stability in recent years. The earlier increase in 2021 was partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge in the third quarter of that year related to an APAC joint venture, while the more recent figures suggest a normalization following the structural change in 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde plc's income from equity investments slightly decreased from $172 million in 2022 to $167 million in 2023 and further to $170 million in 2024, showing minimal fluctuation over the period. The key changes in composition were primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in the APAC segment, which transitioned from being consolidated to being accounted for under the equity method starting in 2021. Additionally, in 2021, a $35 million impairment charge related to a joint venture in the APAC segment contributed to the reported decrease. Overall, the composition remained relatively stable, with adjustments stemming from changes in joint venture structures and impairments.",

By 2023, Booking Holdings reclassified these indirect taxes into 'Sales and other expenses' to align with a presentation that reflects costs more closely tied to revenue changes. This reclassification affected the composition of the metric, although it did not impact previously reported Revenue, Operating income, Income before income taxes, or Net income for 2022 or 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "The presentation and composition of Sales and Other Expenses changed between 2022 and 2023 due to the reclassification of certain indirect taxes, primarily digital services taxes, from General and Administrative expenses to Sales and Other Expenses. This reclassification was made to align the presentation with how costs are aggregated based on their variability relative to revenue changes. As a result, Sales and Other Expenses increased from $1,818 million in 2022 to $1,986 million in 2023, while General and Administrative expenses decreased from $934 million to $766 million.

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with $4.5 billion in current content liabilities, $2.6 billion in non-current content liabilities, and $14.6 billion in off-balance-sheet obligations. This reflects a minor shift in the composition of obligations, with a small decrease in non-current liabilities offset by a slight increase in off-balance-sheet commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix's total content obligations remained relatively stable, at approximately $21.8 billion and $21.7 billion, respectively. On-balance-sheet obligations (current and non-current content liabilities) slightly decreased from $7.6 billion in 2022 to $7.1 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, off-balance-sheet obligations remained significant, at $14.2 billion in 2022 and $14.6 billion in 2023, reflecting future content commitments that had not yet met recognition criteria.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips reported Total MBOED production exclusively from the Australia Pacific LNG project, which stood at 113 MBOED. By 2023, the company no longer disclosed production from Australia and instead focused entirely on domestic U.S. assets, including the Delaware Basin (537 MBOED), Eagle Ford (226 MBOED), Midland Basin (182 MBOED), Bakken (106 MBOED), and Other (16 MBOED), totaling 1,067 MBOED. This represents a complete geographic shift from international to U.S.-focused production and an increase in total output by approximately 846%.",
      "llm_answer": "ConocoPhillips shifted its geographic focus from 2022 to 2023 by increasing production from the Lower 48 segment and Alaska, while decreasing output from international regions such as Europe, Middle East and North Africa, and Asia Pacific. In 2022, international regions like Norway and Malaysia contributed significantly to production, but by 2023, the Lower 48 became the largest contributor, accounting for 64% of consolidated liquids production and 76% of natural gas production. Overall output volume increased from 955 MBOED in 2022 to 1,067 MBOED in 2023, driven by growth in the U.S. shale plays.",

This indicates a decline in the segment's financial performance year-over-year. The drop from $105 million to $69 million suggests a reduced contribution to the company's consolidated results, signaling a potential challenge or strategic shift affecting this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Life Sciences Solutions segment experienced a significant decline in financial performance from 2023 to 2024, with revenues dropping by 26% from $13,532 million in 2022 to $9,977 million in 2023, and segment income falling by 39% from $5,582 million to $3,420 million. This decline was primarily driven by a moderation in COVID-19-related revenue. As a result, the segment's contribution to the company's consolidated results weakened, reflecting lower revenue and margin pressures, which negatively impacted overall financial performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Honeywell detailed a specific methodology for estimating asbestos-related liabilities, including the use of average resolution values over a defined look-back period for both pending and future claims projected through 2059. The company also recorded probable insurance recoveries, factoring in the solvency status of insurers, and acknowledged the uncertainty in projections due to variables like future claims filing rates and disease classifications. By 2024, the disclosure became more generalized, focusing on the unpredictability of litigation outcomes and contingent liabilities without specifying the same detailed methodology. The 2024 filing emphasized broader uncertainties, including the potential impact of new developments, settlement strategies, and evidentiary requirements, but omitted the detailed actuarial assumptions present in the 2023 report.",
      "llm_answer": "Honeywell's disclosure regarding asbestos-related liabilities in 2024 showed continuity in methodology compared to 2023, with the company continuing to estimate liabilities based on historical claims data, disease projections through 2059, and average resolution values. However, in 2024, there was a more explicit acknowledgment of uncertainties surrounding insurance recoveries, noting that while most carriers are solvent, some are not, and future recoveries could differ materially from projections due to unpredictable events like changes in interest rates and market performance. This reflects an increased emphasis on the volatility and unpredictability of insurance recovery outcomes.",

By 2024, there was no indication of any divestiture or change in ownership of Surmont; however, the company disclosed plans to sell noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for approximately $400 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde excluded purchase accounting impacts from its non-GAAP measures, emphasizing that these adjustments were critical for investor understanding due to their uneven geographic impact and the fact that management and variable compensation were assessed based on results excluding these impacts. By 2024, purchase accounting impacts were explicitly included in the company's definition of segment operating profit, indicating a shift in how these impacts are communicated and evaluated internally and externally. This evolution reflects a more integrated approach to reporting these adjustments within segment performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Linde's treatment and disclosure of purchase accounting impacts have remained consistent in their exclusion from segment operating profit calculations, as they are considered non-recurring adjustments that affect comparability. In 2024, purchase accounting impacts reduced segment operating profit by $940 million, compared to $1,006 million in 2023, indicating a slight decrease in magnitude. These adjustments are excluded from management’s evaluation of performance and variable compensation, as segment operating profit is the key metric used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess performance and allocate resources. This continued exclusion ensures that performance evaluation reflects ongoing operational results rather than merger-related accounting adjustments.",

By 2024, the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment reported $6,030 million in performance obligations, reflecting a measurable financial commitment to this area.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $9.56, while in 2023 it decreased to $8.66. This represents a decline in the average revenue generated per membership, suggesting a potential shift in the company's pricing strategy or a change in the mix of membership plans offered. The decrease could also indicate efforts to attract more subscribers by offering lower-cost plans, as evidenced by the increase in paid memberships at the end of the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The average monthly revenue per paying membership decreased by 1% from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.64 in 2023. This decline was primarily due to changes in plan mix and higher membership growth in regions with lower average monthly revenue per paying membership, partially offset by limited price increases. This suggests that while the company attempted to adjust pricing strategies, the overall value proposition may have been diluted by geographic expansion into lower-revenue markets.",

In 2023, the net amounts recognized in the balance sheet for Alabama Power were $7 million in liabilities, and by 2024, this increased to $23 million in liabilities, reflecting an increase in the volume and value of hedged positions. The regulatory reporting structure continued to align with approved cost recovery mechanisms.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Operating Income Excl. increased by 20.3%, driven by favorable pricing, a favorable comparison related to the Saudi Arabia customs assessments, and lower marketing, administration, and research costs (including a $45 million favorable comparison related to asset impairment and exit costs). However, this was partly offset by higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable volume/mix due to lower cigarette mix. In 2024, Operating Income Excl. increased by 25.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing and volume/mix driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. However, lower manufacturing costs were largely offset by higher marketing, administration, and research costs, and a favorable comparison to the prior year was noted due to the South Korea indirect tax charge of $204 million in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, factors contributing to Operating Income Excl. showed notable evolution in cost management and volume/mix impacts. In 2024, operating income Excl. increased by 25.1% in the EA, AU & PMI DF region and 26.8% in the SSEA, CIS & MEA region, driven by favorable pricing and volume/mix improvements, particularly from higher HTU and cigarette volumes. However, these gains were partially offset by higher manufacturing, marketing, and administrative costs. In contrast, the Americas region saw a 41.1% decline in operating income Excl., primarily due to higher costs and restructuring charges, despite favorable volume/mix and pricing from ZYN growth. Overall, cost management pressures increased in 2024 compared to 2023, which had benefited from one-time charges and favorable comparisons.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was described as being driven by demand for volume licensing, Software Assurance, and advanced security offerings such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on the number of information workers in enterprises rather than PC sales. By 2023, the revenue categorization expanded to include 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services,' explicitly listing Windows cloud services as a component alongside volume licensing. The inclusion of 'cloud services' in the 2023 breakdown indicates a strategic shift toward integrating cloud-based offerings into the Windows Commercial portfolio. This evolution suggests that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, as part of the broader cloud services, became more embedded within a diversified set of commercial offerings, aligning with the company's emphasis on cloud transformation and subscription-based models. The 2023 filing also introduced a formalized growth metric for this revenue segment, signaling a more structured approach to tracking and expanding this part of the business.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Windows Commercial revenue growth was driven by demand for volume licensing and advanced security offerings such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Specifically, Windows Commercial revenue is part of the More Personal Computing segment and is influenced by enterprise demand for security and cloud services. In fiscal year 2023, the More Personal Computing segment saw a 13% revenue increase, with growth attributed to Gaming and cloud services, though specific Windows Commercial figures were not detailed. The integration of security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint into Windows Commercial reflects Microsoft's broader strategy to enhance security and cloud capabilities, aligning with the industry's shift toward comprehensive, integrated solutions.",

By 2023, this metric had significantly declined to $8.66, reflecting a 2% increase year-over-year. This sharp drop indicates a major shift in Netflix's pricing strategy or market dynamics, such as a move toward more affordable plans, increased competition, or changes in regional pricing structures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership decreased by 1% (from $11.76 to $11.64). This slight decline indicates that while Netflix continued to grow its membership base, the average revenue per member was negatively impacted by factors such as changes in plan mix and higher membership growth in regions with lower average revenue per membership. This suggests that Netflix's pricing strategy may have been tempered by market dynamics, including competitive pressures and currency fluctuations, rather than aggressive price increases during this period.",

This indicates a shift in growth drivers from broad pricing and volume gains across both product lines in 2023 to a more HTU-focused volume/mix benefit in 2024, with some moderation in pricing impact.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, PM's net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 11.7%, driven by a favorable pricing variance, primarily from higher combustible tobacco pricing, and favorable volume/mix dynamics, including higher cigarette and heated tobacco unit (HTU) volumes. In 2023, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions rose by 9.7%, also influenced by favorable volume/mix, though partially offset by an unfavorable pricing variance due to lower HTU pricing and a supplemental tax surcharge in Germany. Thus, 2024 showed stronger growth in both pricing and volume/mix contributions compared to 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses started at $631 million, increased by $201 million, and ended the year at $658 million. In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, increased by $122 million, but after write-offs of $199 million and adjustments for foreign currency, ended at $577 million. This indicates a shift in inventory risk exposure, with a notable reduction in the allowance balance by the end of 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting either improved inventory management or a strategic reduction in inventory holdings.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's Allowance For Inventory Losses increased from $631 million at the end of 2023 to $658 million at the end of 2024. This increase, driven by additions of $201 million in 2024 compared to $162 million in 2023, indicates a higher level of inventory risk or obsolescence concerns during the period. However, the relatively stable allowance as a percentage of inventory suggests IBM is proactively managing inventory risk through consistent provisioning and write-offs.",

In 2024, the company maintained a similar level of investment, with plans to spend approximately the same amount during fiscal 2025.

      "llm_answer": "The total transformation strategy costs decreased from $435 million in 2023 to $322 million in 2024, indicating a reduction in the scale of transformation-related expenses. This decline suggests that UPS is progressing through its transformation initiatives, such as Transformation 2.0 and Fit to Serve, and beginning to realize cost efficiencies. However, the continued investment in transformation efforts, such as the $35 million in costs incurred in late 2024 for the Efficiency Reimagined program, signals that UPS remains committed to strategic investments aimed at long-term operational efficiency and network optimization.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 42,802 thousand, while the average monthly revenue per membership rose slightly to $8.66.

This indicates that Netflix's subscriber growth remained strong in 2023, but the slight decline in revenue per membership suggests that growth in lower-revenue regions or a shift in plan mix partially offset limited price increases.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe was 30.3%, down from 31.1% in 2022, reflecting a decline of 0.8 percentage points. In 2024, the cigarette market share remained unchanged at 30.3% compared to the prior year, indicating that the rate of decline slowed to zero. This suggests a potential stabilization in PM's cigarette business in Europe, which may reflect strategic adjustments or competitive responses to market pressures, including competition from heated tobacco products which saw continued growth in market share.",
      "llm_answer": "Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe declined slightly from 31.1% in 2022 to 30.3% in 2023, as shown in the 2023 10-K. However, in 2024, the decline rate slowed, with the market share stabilizing at 30.3%, as noted in the 2024 10-K. This suggests a potential improvement in competitive positioning, as the rate of decline in cigarette market share has decelerated, possibly due to the company's strategic focus on HTU growth and market share gains in certain European countries.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM described its business as 'depending on' client spending budgets, highlighting that a downturn in economic environment and client spending could impact its revenue and profit. In 2024, the company shifted its framing, describing the relationship as being 'impacted by' client spending budgets and economic conditions. This indicates a more passive but still significant sensitivity to external spending trends, suggesting a strategic reframing of how client budgets influence IBM's business outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, IBM's characterization of the relationship between client spending budgets and its business performance became more explicitly tied to macroeconomic and industry-specific factors. In 2023, the company noted that a downturn in economic conditions or shifts in client buying patterns could impact revenue and profit. By 2024, IBM expanded this perspective, emphasizing that broader economic conditions, including recessions, inflation, and global trade dynamics, could influence client spending and, consequently, IBM's business performance. This evolution reflects a heightened awareness of external economic pressures and their potential to shape client behavior and IBM's financial outcomes.",

By 2024, the company consolidated its reporting into a single reportable operating segment called 'Payment Solutions,' which derives revenue from a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers, including access to the continuous payment network and value-added services either integrated or sold standalone. This evolution indicates a shift from a dual classification of revenue sources to a more unified segment reporting approach, where all activities are considered interrelated and supportive of each other.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard has maintained a single reportable operating segment, \"Payment Solutions,\" in both 2023 and 2024, with no material changes in segment reporting structure. However, revenue classification shows growth, with net revenue increasing from $25,098 million in 2023 to $28,167 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Alphabet's Other Bets generated revenue primarily from the sale of 'health technology' and internet services, indicating a focus on innovative health-focused tools and connectivity. By 2024, the segment's revenue sources were described as primarily coming from 'healthcare-related services' and internet services, suggesting a shift from general health technology toward more direct healthcare services. While internet services remained a consistent revenue contributor in both years, the evolution from 'health technology' to 'healthcare-related services' implies a more specialized or clinical orientation in the later year. This change may reflect a strategic pivot toward monetizable healthcare solutions within the Other Bets portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Alphabet's Other Bets segment has seen a growing focus on healthcare-related offerings, particularly through Verily's development of tools and platforms aimed at improving health outcomes. While the segment remains in early stages of commercialization and includes a range of emerging businesses, healthcare-related services have become a primary source of revenue within Other Bets, alongside internet services. This reflects Alphabet's ongoing investment in leveraging technology to address significant challenges in the healthcare industry.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company underwrote consumer loans using proprietary models that included deal structure data, and Table 21 provided credit score distribution details for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2023, the company continued to incorporate deal structure data into its underwriting process, but Table 21 was updated to reflect credit score distribution metrics as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. This indicates that while the use of deal structure data remained consistent, the underlying credit score metrics used in underwriting evolved to reflect more recent borrower risk profiles.",
      "llm_answer": "The use of deal structure data in underwriting consumer loans for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, as both years show similar credit score distributions. For domestic credit cards, approximately 68-69% of the portfolio had credit scores above 660 in both years, while for auto loans, about 53% of borrowers had scores above 660 in both 2022 and 2023. This stability in credit score metrics suggests that the underwriting criteria and use of deal structure data did not significantly change during this period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT evaluated strategic alternatives for its India operations, receiving third-party indications of value that were lower than the carrying value of the India reporting unit. This information was used as a significant input in determining the fair value of the unit during the goodwill impairment test, although no impairment was explicitly recorded in that year. By contrast, in 2024, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, leading to a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This marks a shift from a potential strategic exit with uncertain impairment implications to a concrete recognition of value loss.",

In 2023, AMT recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million for the India reporting unit due to indications of value from third parties that were less than its carrying value. By 2024, the India operations were fully divested through the sale of ATC TIPL, resulting in a loss on sale of $1,245.5 million, but no further goodwill impairment charges were recorded as the operations were no longer part of the consolidated financial statements.",

By 2023, Amgen's disclosures revealed a shift in the composition and sourcing of these rights, noting that developed-product-technology rights now included assets acquired through the Horizon and ChemoCentryx acquisitions. This marks a change from 2022, where no such specific acquisitions were cited in the description of these rights. The inclusion of these new acquisitions in 2023 suggests a strategic expansion in Amgen’s portfolio of developed-product-technology rights, likely influencing the valuation and structure of these assets.",

Acquisition activity was more pronounced in 2023, with the Horizon acquisition notably contributing to the growth in developed-product-technology rights, compared to 2022, which included the ChemoCentryx and Teneobio acquisitions.

The decline in growth rate from 11.2% to 8.6% indicates a moderation in the rate of expansion despite continued strength in HTU volume.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 19.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The key drivers contributing to this change were favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by the growth of ZYN nicotine pouches in the U.S., and favorable pricing from both cigarettes and ZYN products.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums could negatively impact its financial results, particularly outside the United States, due to the potential for significant premium increases driven by the insolvencies of unrelated companies. However, in 2024, the company expanded its discussion to include more detailed context on how it manages broader financial risks, such as currency and financing risks, which may indirectly influence the impact of these premiums. Despite this broader framing, there was no explicit quantitative change in the disclosed exposure related to pension insolvency insurance premiums between the two years, indicating a stable risk profile for this specific item.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on IBM's disclosures, the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on the company's results of operations has increased from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, the company noted that premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue. By 2024, IBM expanded this disclosure, emphasizing that the company's results could be negatively impacted by these premiums, with the potential for significant increases due to the same factors, indicating a heightened risk and potential financial burden in 2024.",

This growth was primarily driven by favorable volume/mix, mainly due to the expansion of ZYN nicotine pouches in the U.S., as well as favorable pricing for cigarettes and ZYN products. However, operating income, excluding currency and acquisitions, declined by 41.1% in 2024, mainly due to higher marketing, administration, and research costs, along with restructuring charges and increased amortization of intangibles.",

By 2023, the change in non-qualifying hedge activity contributed a $2,986 million increase to net income compared to the prior year.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle described its Services Business as one of three operating segments, but the strategic positioning focused primarily on general enterprise IT environments with a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies. The Services Business was not explicitly tied to cloud adoption but rather positioned as a flexible offering across deployment models. By fiscal 2023, Oracle significantly evolved its strategic positioning of the Services Business, explicitly linking it to cloud adoption and customer support. The 2023 filing emphasized that customers could 'continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments.' This included integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and AI-enhanced offerings like Oracle Autonomous Database, which used machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions. The Services Business in 2023 was framed as a key enabler of cloud migration and customer retention, with a focus on supporting Oracle Cloud Services contracts and product enhancements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, Oracle strategically enhanced its Services Business by aligning it more closely with cloud adoption and customer support offerings. The company emphasized enabling customers to migrate existing on-premise and cloud-based applications to Oracle Cloud through dedicated programs, reflecting a stronger focus on cloud adoption. Additionally, Oracle expanded its customer support offerings by integrating advanced technologies like AI and machine learning into its services, aiming to improve technical support and customer experience. This shift highlights Oracle's commitment to supporting customers throughout their cloud transition and enhancing long-term value through comprehensive and flexible deployment models.",

By 2024, the company continued to emphasize structural cost savings as a key earnings driver, incorporating it into its newly introduced earnings driver framework. While the 2024 disclosure does not provide a new cumulative savings figure, the explicit inclusion of structural cost savings as a defined earnings driver indicates a strategic shift to institutionalize cost efficiency as a recurring component of earnings performance. This evolution shows that XOM transitioned from achieving cost savings as a阶段性 initiative to embedding it as a core financial metric in its reporting and operational strategy.",

This evolution demonstrates the company's disciplined cost management strategy, focusing on operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and divestment-related savings.

By fiscal 2023, the Core routing portfolio continued to grow, contributing to an overall 18% increase in the Networking product category. This growth was driven by Catalyst 8000 routers, SD-WAN, and IoT routing offerings. Therefore, the Core Routing portfolio evolved from maintaining stability in revenue during fiscal 2022 to actively driving growth in fiscal 2023.",

By 2023, this level of detail was no longer included; instead, the company only provided a brief definition of net charge-off rates without historical data or specific loan category breakdowns. This represents a significant reduction in transparency regarding credit quality and charge-off practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One enhanced its transparency around net charge-off rate calculations in 2023 compared to 2022 by providing more detailed disclosures on the factors impacting recoveries, such as collection strategies and the impact of purchased credit-deteriorated loans. Additionally, the 2023 filing included expanded explanations of the adoption of ASU 2022-02, which altered the treatment of financial difficulty modifications, and offered more clarity on the allowance coverage ratios and nonperforming loan metrics.

The segment was positioned within a long-term corporate planning framework supported by the Global Outlook and annual Corporate Plan. By 2024, the company elevated the strategic importance of Specialty Products by categorizing it under 'Advantaged Projects' and explicitly linking it to value creation through integration, higher-value product yields, and above-average returns.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the document outlined the asset allocation for U.S. Retiree Health Care, indicating that 65% - 80% of assets were invested in fixed income securities and cash equivalents, with the remainder in equity securities. By 2023, the company reported specific projected funding obligations for U.S. Retiree Health Care, totaling $27 million for 2024, declining to $22 million by 2028, and $97 million cumulatively from 2029 to 2033. This reflects a decreasing financial obligation over time, as compared to the earlier year's asset-focused disclosure.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial commitment to U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations slightly increased from 2022 to 2023 in terms of projected funding levels. The discount rate for the U.S. Retiree Health Care plan decreased from 5.68% in 2022 to 5.17% in 2023, which typically results in higher present value obligations. Additionally, the assumed health care cost trend rate for the next year remained at 7.00%, but the year in which the ultimate trend rate of 5.00% is reached was delayed from 2031 in 2022 to 2032 in 2023, indicating a slightly higher projected cost trend over time. These changes suggest an increase in the projected funding requirements for U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations.",

By 2023, the Company expanded its criteria to include an additional indicator: 'the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations.'

However, in 2023, a specific new indicator was introduced: the evaluation of the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations, which was emphasized as part of the ongoing review of impairment risks.",

In contrast, 2023 saw $241.894 billion in total medical costs and $238.556 billion in payments, indicating a larger buildup of unpaid liabilities compared to the prior year.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the accrued balance for U.S. rebate accruals related to Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D was $2.3 billion, and the company used prior payment history as a key input in estimating the expected provision for rebates. In 2024, this accrued balance decreased slightly to $2.2 billion, and prior payment history continued to be used as a foundational element in the estimation process. The slight decrease in the accrued balance suggests a minor adjustment in expected rebate obligations, which may reflect either a refinement in the use of prior payment data or a shift in rebate claim trends. This indicates that while the methodology remained consistent, the underlying assumptions or data inputs based on prior payment history may have evolved slightly to reflect updated trends in rebate claims.",

By 2024, Reality Labs generated $2,146 million in revenue, marking a significant shift from a loss to a positive financial contribution. This indicates a notable turnaround in the segment's performance, suggesting improved monetization or cost management within Reality Labs.",

This shift suggests a challenging financial trajectory for the segment, marked by a significant drop in 2023 due to reduced Meta Quest sales, followed by a partial rebound in 2024.",

By 2024, JPM adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2024, for Investments in Tax Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method, applied under the modified retrospective method, signaling a specific procedural update in how tax consequences are accounted for. This indicates a shift from general acknowledgment of complexity and estimation risk to the implementation of a new structured accounting methodology for tax-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, JPMorganChase's approach to accounting for tax-related assets and liabilities, particularly in relation to expected future tax consequences, evolved with the adoption of updated accounting guidance. Specifically, effective January 1, 2024, the Firm adopted the \"Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method\" under the modified retrospective method. This change impacted the recognition and amortization of tax benefits from investments in tax credit structures, such as affordable housing projects, and was reflected in the Firm's financial statements and stockholders' equity. Additionally, the Firm continued to apply the asset and liability method for income taxes, which considers expected future tax rates and temporary differences between book and tax bases, with adjustments for valuation allowances where necessary.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GD's Marine Systems segment contributed to revenue growth driven by U.S. Navy ship construction. By 2023, the segment's performance was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program. These challenges were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis-class (TAO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program in 2023. Additionally, GD highlighted increased risk in 2023 around variable consideration for long-term U.S. Navy contracts, particularly the Virginia-class submarine program, indicating a shift toward greater financial uncertainty compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the Marine Systems segment's performance showed growth in revenue, increasing from $11.04 billion in 2022 to $12.46 billion in 2023. This growth was primarily driven by U.S. Navy ship construction, particularly for nuclear-powered submarines and surface ships. However, the segment faced risk factors in 2023, including supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer program. These challenges were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler program. Despite these risks, the operating margin remained stable at approximately 8.6% in both years, reflecting progress down the learning curve on major construction programs.",

By 2023, the company expanded the detail of cost categories to include stock-based compensation and facilities expenses under personnel-related costs. This evolution indicates a more nuanced breakdown of internal cost drivers tied to content production and talent management.",

Additionally, the 2023 disclosure highlighted expenses associated with obtaining rights to music included in content and overall deals with talent.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a decrease of $428 million due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and expected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a strategic shift toward significantly reducing or eliminating postretirement medical costs over the medium term.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's postretirement medical cost expectations decreased from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, with a net periodic benefit cost of $29 million in fiscal 2022 and a net benefit of $3 million in fiscal 2023. This shift indicates a modest improvement in the company's financial burden for these expenses in the short term, primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. However, the long-term trajectory remains uncertain, as assumptions like discount rates and benefit cost trends suggest ongoing obligations, with the ultimate trend rate for benefit cost increases set at 4.00% by 2041.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Merck recorded $190 million in pretax costs related to the upcoming 2024 Restructuring Program, which included facility shut-down expenses as a key component. By 2024, the company disclosed that the cumulative pretax costs for this restructuring program were estimated at $4.0 billion, with facility shut-down costs continuing to represent a significant portion of the cash outlays. This indicates a substantial increase in restructuring activity and signals an escalation in the execution phase of the program, aligning with the company’s plan to optimize its global manufacturing networks for both Human and Animal Health. The shift from initial costs in 2023 to broader implementation in 2024 reveals a deliberate scaling of restructuring efforts.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2024, Merck recorded $888 million in total pretax restructuring costs, of which $190 million was related to the 2024 Restructuring Program. This represents an increase from the $190 million in pretax facility shut-down costs reported in 2023 for the same program. The 2024 costs include $115 million in separation costs, $75 million in other exit costs, and no accelerated depreciation for the 2024 Restructuring Program. In contrast, the 2019 Restructuring Program accounted for the remaining costs in 2024. The evolution of these costs indicates that the 2024 Restructuring Program is progressing, with additional expenses being incurred in 2024 beyond the initial facility shut-down costs reported in 2023. This suggests a broader and more extensive restructuring effort in 2024, aligning with the program's goal to optimize Merck's global manufacturing networks.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment faced significant operating cash flow challenges due to lower deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers, with net cash used by operating activities reaching $3.4 billion in 2021. The company had $16.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $58.1 billion in debt as of December 31, 2021, and anticipated continued negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramped up. By 2024, the Commercial Airplanes segment reported a contractual backlog of $498,802 million, up slightly from $497,094 million in 2023, indicating a gradual recovery in order book stability. While liquidity improved as the company moved past the worst of the 737 MAX and pandemic-related disruptions, the segment was still not fully back to pre-crisis financial health, though the trend suggests improvement.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment experienced significant operating cash flow challenges and a decline in profitability, driven by production disruptions, delays in aircraft deliveries, and reach-forward losses on programs like the 777X and 767. In 2024, BCA reported a loss from operations of $7,969 million, compared to a loss of $1,635 million in 2023 and $2,341 million in 2022, reflecting worsening financial performance. Despite a backlog value of $435,175 million in 2024 (down from $440,507 million in 2023), the segment faced declining revenues and operating margins, with 2024 margins at -34.9%, indicating severe liquidity and operational pressures.",

By 2023, the 10-K filing included specific financial disclosures showing that Disney reported $128 million in borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks for fiscal year 2025 and $1,164 million in borrowings thereafter.

      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable increased from $21.87 billion at the end of 2021 to $24.48 billion at the end of 2023. The sensitivity analysis in 2023 shows that a 0.75% increase in completion factors would decrease medical costs payable by $867 million, while a 0.75% decrease would increase it by $880 million. This highlights the significant impact of completion factors on the estimation of medical costs payable.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Target reported experiencing higher inventory shrink as a percentage of sales compared to historical levels, with significantly elevated shrink rates at certain stores. The company noted that this trend was industry-wide and had an adverse impact on its results of operations, including impairment of long-lived assets. In 2024, inventory shrink is explicitly listed as a component of the cost of sales, indicating it is now formally recognized and accounted for as a direct cost of merchandise operations. This shift reflects a more structured financial acknowledgment of inventory shrink within the company's expense framework.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided information, Target's treatment of inventory shrink remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, as inventory is reduced for estimated losses related to shrink under the retail inventory accounting method (RIM) using the LIFO method. However, the financial impact of inventory shrink increased, as evidenced by the rise in the LIFO provision from $153 million as of February 3, 2024, to $183 million as of February 1, 2025, indicating higher shrink rates in 2024 compared to 2023.",

By 2024, the operating loss for the same segment had increased to $5.413 billion. This indicates a significant worsening in the financial performance of the BDS segment over this two-year period.

In 2022, the segment reported a loss from operations of $3,544 million, which worsened to $5,413 million in 2024.

The company emphasized internal stewardship to support management oversight over time. By 2024, Structural Cost Savings were reframed as an earnings driver, with a focus on after-tax earnings effects and inclusion of cash operating expenses related to divestments previously captured in volume/mix drivers. This shift indicates a broader integration of cost savings into financial reporting and performance analysis.",

By 2024, the net interest expense increased to $256 million, driven by a rise in interest incurred on debt and other to $555 million, despite a further increase in interest income to $228 million.

      "original_answer": "Nike's Operating Overhead Expense in 2023 included wage and benefit-related expenses, as evidenced by $136 million in 401(k) plan contributions. In 2024, the definition of Operating Overhead Expense remained consistent, including wage and benefit-related costs, but the company also highlighted increased prepayments for advertising, rising from $755 million in 2023 to $814 million in 2024. This indicates a strategic increase in investment in demand creation activities, which in turn affects overhead costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Nike's Operating Overhead Expense components, such as wage and benefit-related expenses and prepayments for advertising, showed the following changes:\n\n1. **Wage and Benefit-Related Expenses**: Nike's 401(k) Savings and Profit Sharing Plan contributions, which are part of wage and benefit-related expenses, increased from $136 million in 2023 to $153 million in 2024, indicating a rise in these expenses.\n\n2. **Prepayments for Advertising**: Prepaid advertising and promotion expenses increased from $755 million at the end of 2023 to $814 million at the end of 2024. This increase suggests that Nike made more prepayments for advertising and promotional activities in 2024 compared to 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan disclosed that the Core Deposit Intangible from the First Republic acquisition was valued at $1.3 billion and was being amortized over a projected period of approximately 7 years. The valuation methodology was described, including the use of after-tax cost savings and assumptions about market participant behavior. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in terms of the $1.3 billion valuation and the 7-year amortization period, but the language was slightly refined, emphasizing that the intangibles 'are amortized' rather than 'will be amortized,' indicating that the amortization process had commenced. Additionally, the 2024 filing made a new reference to 'disputed amounts with the FDIC as of April 30, 2024,' which was not present in the 2023 filing, suggesting an ongoing financial or legal development affecting the acquisition-related assets.",

In both years, the core deposit intangible was valued using the favorable source of funds method, discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits. In 2023, the core deposit intangible was $1.3 billion, and in 2024, it remained at $1.455 billion, with similar valuation methodologies and assumptions applied, including growth and attrition rates, projected fee income, and discount rates. The amortization period also remained consistent at approximately 7 years.",

In 2023, the same 2% increase led to a higher investment income of $629 million, while the fair value of financial liabilities decreased by $7,365 million. This indicates that UnitedHealth Group's exposure to interest rate changes increased in magnitude over the year, particularly on the investment income side, while the sensitivity of liabilities slightly decreased.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, currency exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact decreased to 0.5%. This indicates a reduced positive contribution from exchange rate movements, suggesting a decline in the company's exposure or a shift in the direction of foreign exchange fluctuations affecting sales during the period.",

In 2023, the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced reported sales, while in 2024, the same dollar strength had a smaller negative effect but was partially offset by other factors. This evolution suggests that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations remained significant but less detrimental in 2024, indicating some resilience or hedging effectiveness against currency volatility.",

In 2024, these figures increased to $3.9 billion in short-term investments and $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil acquired Denbury Inc. by issuing 46 million shares with a fair value of $4.8 billion. The year also saw the sale of Esso Thailand and upstream asset divestitures in the U.S. In 2024, the company significantly scaled up its acquisition activity by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources through the issuance of 545 million shares valued at $63 billion, along with $5 billion in assumed debt. Additionally, the scope of asset sales expanded geographically in 2024 to include upstream assets in Argentina and Nigeria, compared to only the U.S. in 2023. This reflects a major increase in both the size and geographic diversity of ExxonMobil's transactional activity.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ExxonMobil significantly expanded its scale of acquisitions, most notably through the acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources in 2024, which involved the issuance of 545 million shares of ExxonMobil common stock with a fair value of $63 billion, compared to the 2023 acquisition of Denbury Inc., which involved 46 million shares valued at $4.8 billion. In terms of divestitures, the geographic and asset diversity increased in 2024, with asset sales occurring in the United States, Argentina, and Nigeria, compared to 2023, which primarily involved upstream asset sales in the United States.",

In 2023, while the revenue increased due to the mix of products shipped, the operating profit decreased primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, despite the revenue growth. This indicates a shift in profitability dynamics even as revenue expanded.",
      "llm_answer": "Embedded Processing revenue increased by 3% from $3,261 million in 2022 to $3,368 million in 2023, primarily due to a favorable mix of products shipped. However, its contribution to operating profit declined from 38.4% of revenue in 2022 to 29.9% in 2023, as higher manufacturing costs offset the revenue growth. This decline in operating profit margin was driven by increased costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings.",

This treatment remained consistent in fiscal 2024, where the company continued to recognize unrealized credit-related losses in the same manner. However, in 2024, Adobe provided additional context around financial activities, such as the $1 billion non-tax-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition, which may have influenced overall financial statement presentation and emphasis, even though the accounting treatment for credit-related losses remained unchanged.",

In both years, unrealized credit-related losses on marketable debt securities were recorded to \"other income (expense), net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Income, with a corresponding allowance for credit-related losses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, no allowance for credit-related losses was recognized in either fiscal 2024 or 2023, as Adobe did not identify any impairments due to credit-related factors during these periods.

By 2023, the company specifically disclosed a liability of $39 million principally related to travel transaction taxes. This indicates that while the company continued to face exposure, the liability was quantified and likely reflected settlements, accrual adjustments, or resolution progress from prior uncertainties.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial liability related to travel transaction taxes increased from 2022 to 2023, as evidenced by the $44 million in liabilities related to travel transaction taxes included in other non-current liabilities in the Getaroom acquisition in 2023, compared to no specific mention of such liabilities in 2022. This indicates that the company's exposure to such obligations has grown, likely due to ongoing legal and regulatory challenges, including audits, lawsuits, and potential retroactive tax claims in various jurisdictions. The increase highlights the growing complexity and risk associated with non-income-based taxes on travel transactions, which could have a material adverse impact on the company's financial condition and results of operations.",

These obligations were described as long-term and fixed-cost in nature, limiting Netflix’s flexibility in reacting to changes in business conditions and potentially requiring access to capital markets at unfavorable times. By 2023, Netflix expanded its description of content obligations to include non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements, as well as production-related obligations. While specific dollar figures for total content liabilities were not explicitly stated in 2023, the company emphasized that obligations for unknown future titles under certain licensing agreements were expected to be significant, indicating a growing complexity and financial exposure in its content commitments. This evolution reflects both an increase in the scale and inflexibility of content obligations, heightening liquidity risk.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's content obligations slightly decreased from $21.8 billion to $21.7 billion, with a notable shift in the timing of payments. The amount due in less than one year increased from $10.0 billion to $10.3 billion, while obligations due after one year and through three years decreased from $9.4 billion to $8.8 billion. This suggests a modest increase in short-term liquidity constraints. Additionally, the nature of content-related commitments remained largely fixed and long-term, with a significant portion tied to production and licensing agreements, including non-cancelable talent and employment contracts. These obligations continued to pose financial risks by limiting operational flexibility and exposing Netflix to potential adverse impacts if membership growth or content reception falls short of expectations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company's free cash flow as a percentage of revenue was 29.6%, but by 2023, it had significantly dropped to 7.7%. This indicates a substantial decline in the company's ability to generate free cash flow relative to its revenue, signaling a deterioration in financial performance over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's free cash flow as a percentage of revenue declined significantly from 29.6% in 2022 to 7.7% in 2023. This sharp drop indicates a substantial weakening in the company's cash generation relative to revenue, primarily driven by a decline in operating cash flow and a significant increase in capital expenditures. The shift suggests a challenging financial performance in 2023, marked by lower profitability and higher investment in manufacturing and technology.",

By 2024, this amount was no longer present as a separate line item, and Accumulated Comprehensive Income had declined from $(1,748) million in 2023 to $(3,218) million in 2024. This indicates that while the Veralto Distribution had a significant positive impact in 2023, its absence in 2024 contributed to the overall decline in Accumulated Comprehensive Income, alongside other comprehensive losses during the year.",

In 2023, the distribution of Veralto Corporation resulted in an increase of $974 million in Accumulated Comprehensive Income, as reflected in the transition from a balance of $(2,872) at the start of 2023 to $(1,748) at the end of 2023. By 2024, the Veralto-related impact had fully dissipated, as no further adjustments related to Veralto were recorded, and the balance at the end of 2024 was $(3,218), indicating a decline in Accumulated Comprehensive Income due to other factors unrelated to the Veralto distribution.",

In fiscal year 2024, Oracle maintained the same classification of unbilled receivables within accounts receivable but updated the presentation slightly, referring to 'non-operating expenses, net' instead of 'non-operating expenses or income, net' when discussing interest revenue from financing arrangements. This indicates a subtle evolution in financial statement presentation without a substantive change in the treatment of unbilled receivables.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's treatment and disclosure of unbilled receivables between fiscal years 2022 and 2024 remained consistent in terms of classification within accounts receivable, with unbilled receivables recognized when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing. However, the 2024 filing provides more specific details on the timing of invoicing, noting that invoices for cloud license and on-premise licenses and hardware products are generally issued when the license is made available for customer use or upon delivery of the hardware product. The 2024 filing also elaborates on the invoicing timing for license support and hardware support contracts, which are generally invoiced annually in advance, and for cloud SaaS and infrastructure contracts, which are invoiced annually, quarterly, or monthly in advance.",

This indicates that despite a lower growth rate in memberships compared to earlier years, Netflix was able to maintain strong revenue growth, likely due to more stable monetization per membership and a larger base of paying members.",

In 2024, the growth rate further accelerated to 15% globally, reaching 277,730 thousand average paying memberships.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that foreign currency exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities were recorded in other income (expense), net, and partially offset by gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge these exposures. Additionally, PayPal mentioned a matured net investment hedge from 2020, with its gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the foreign subsidiary was sold or liquidated. By 2023, PayPal expanded its disclosure to clarify that foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were included in other, net, along with forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and fair value changes on non-hedging derivative contracts. The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts. This evolution indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to disclosing foreign exchange exposures and their financial effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, PayPal's treatment and disclosure of foreign currency exchange gains and losses remained consistent in terms of accounting for foreign currency exchange contracts, but there was a shift in the impact on financial statements. In 2022, foreign currency movements had a net favorable impact on operating income of $69 million, with a favorable impact on net revenues of $250 million and an unfavorable impact on operating expenses of $181 million. In 2023, the disclosure did not provide a direct comparison of the net impact on operating income, but it emphasized the use of foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge against exposure and noted that gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in other income (expense), net, and offset by gains and losses on the contracts. This suggests a more integrated approach to managing and disclosing the effects of foreign currency exchange rate movements on both revenues and expenses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed that approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services were known and settled within 90 days, with substantially all settled within twelve months. By 2023, the company provided a more quantified sensitivity analysis, stating that a hypothetical 1% difference between its December 31, 2023, estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable would have increased or decreased 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This indicates a more explicit quantification of risk exposure in 2023 compared to the more qualitative disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity analysis of medical costs payable estimates showed an increased sensitivity in 2023 compared to 2022, with larger potential impacts from changes in completion factors and medical cost per member per month (PMPM) trend factors. For example, a 0.75% decrease in completion factors could increase medical costs payable by $880 million in 2023, compared to a smaller impact in 2022. This indicates a higher risk exposure related to unpaid claims in 2023, suggesting greater uncertainty or variability in claim estimation and payment timing.",

      "llm_answer": "The company's restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents related to capital asset purchases increased from $1.9 billion in 2023 to $2.4 billion in 2024.

      "llm_answer": "The operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 41.8% in 2023 to 34.9% in 2024. This decline indicates a reduction in profitability, primarily driven by lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs due to planned capacity expansions.

By 2023, the company emphasized the sensitivity of its Medical Costs Payable estimates, disclosing that a hypothetical 1% difference between estimated and actual Medical Costs Payable would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This represents a shift from simply disclosing the amount to quantifying the sensitivity and potential earnings impact of estimation differences, suggesting increased focus on the volatility and importance of these liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity analysis for medical costs payable showed that a 1% difference between estimated and actual medical costs payable would have impacted net earnings by approximately $245 million in 2023. This highlights the continued significance of accurate estimation in managing medical costs, as even small estimation differences can have a material effect on earnings. The evolution reflects the company's ongoing focus on refining its estimation methodologies to account for uncertainties in claim submissions and healthcare cost trends.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals segment reported a revenue of $1,977 million, reflecting a significant decline of 28.7% compared to the prior year. However, in 2024, the same segment experienced a strong recovery, reporting revenue of $2,208 million, which represents an 11.7% increase from 2023. This shift indicates a transformation from a period of steep decline to one of positive growth within the U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals business.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue from U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals increased by 11.7% in 2024 compared to 2023. This growth was driven by infant formula market share gains and the continued favorable impact of price increases, although it was partially offset by a decrease in PediaSure and Pedialyte product sales. In contrast, the 2023 increase of 26.6% was primarily due to market share recovery following the voluntary recall of certain infant formula products in early 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Company's working capital as a percentage of Net Sales was (1.4)%, driven by higher accounts payable and accruals and lower inventory. By 2024, this metric had decreased further to (5.2)%, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accruals. This indicates a deepening negative working capital position, suggesting the company is increasingly financing its operations through liabilities rather than liquid assets.",
      "llm_answer": "The Company's working capital as a percentage of Net Sales declined from (1.4)% in 2023 to (5.2)% in 2024. This significant decrease was primarily driven by higher accounts payable and accruals in 2024, which improved the working capital position by reducing current assets relative to current liabilities. In 2023, the change from 1.0% in 2022 to (1.4)% was also due to higher accounts payable and accruals, along with lower inventory.",

In 2021, the company made no contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans, while in 2024, it contributed $990 million. The ERISA-funded status also improved, with the company achieving at least 80% funded status across all qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024, compared to a funded status of approximately 92% in 2021 after a $1.0 billion contribution in 2020. This indicates a shift from a period of minimal contributions and moderate funded status to a more active funding strategy aligned with ERISA requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2021 and 2024, Lockheed Martin's approach to pension plan funding evolved as follows under ERISA:\n\n1. **Contributions**: In 2021, no contributions were made to qualified defined benefit pension plans, while $1.0 billion was contributed in 2020. In 2024, cash contributions were $990 million, with no contributions in 2023. This indicates a shift in contribution activity, with a notable contribution in 2024 after a period of no contributions in 2023.\n\n2. **Funded Status**: The funded status under ERISA remained at least 80% for all years from 2021 to 2024. In 2021, the funded status was approximately 92% and 82% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. By 2024, the funded status remained stable at or above 80%, indicating continued efforts to maintain sufficient funding levels.\n\n3. **Pension Risk Transfer Transactions**: Lockheed Martin continued to reduce pension liabilities through pension risk transfer transactions, such as purchasing group annuity contracts (GACs), which transferred obligations to insurance companies and reduced annual PBGC premiums. These actions were consistent across the period, aiming to mitigate volatility and reduce future funding obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments determined the single equivalent discount rate by discounting the projected cash flows from defined benefit plans against a yield curve constructed using an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds in each country. By 2024, the company refined its approach by emphasizing a more precise methodology in which the selected discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value derived from the yield curve analysis. While the core method remained consistent, the 2024 filing reflects a more structured emphasis on the derivation of the equivalent rate as a direct output of the present value calculation, suggesting a refinement in transparency and analytical rigor.",
      "llm_answer": "Texas Instruments' approach to determining the single equivalent discount rate for non-U.S. defined benefit plans remained consistent between 2023 and 2024. For countries with sufficient corporate bond markets, they used a yield curve constructed from high-quality corporate bonds to calculate the single equivalent rate that matches the present value of expected benefit payments. For countries without sufficient corporate bond markets, they relied on government bond indices. The methodology described in both years' filings shows no material changes in the process.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities, as noted in the consolidated statements of equity under noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company further disclosed that this deconsolidation was a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and was treated as an asset group impairment event under long-lived assets testing, indicating a shift from a focus on equity treatment to a broader asset impairment and financial impact analysis.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022, due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, as disclosed in the 2024 10-K. In 2023, the company had already begun addressing the impact of this deconsolidation, including impairment considerations for related assets. By 2024, Linde continued to evaluate long-lived assets for impairment, particularly in response to geopolitical and economic changes, though no goodwill impairments were recorded in either year. The 2024 disclosures emphasize Linde’s ongoing assessment of asset recoverability and the potential for future impairments if market conditions deteriorate further.",

      "original_answer": "The fixed employer contribution under the enhanced defined contribution plan remained unchanged at 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings in both 2022 and 2023. However, the aggregate U.S. defined contribution plan expenses increased from $70 million in 2022 to $75 million in 2023, indicating a rise in overall employer contributions or participation, despite the fixed contribution rate remaining stable.",

Employees hired after December 31, 2003, do not receive this fixed 2% contribution. \n\nThe aggregate U.S. defined contribution plan expenses increased from $70 million in 2022 to $75 million in 2023.

This indicates a significant reduction in the segment's relative financial importance to the overall business, suggesting a potential strategic repositioning or performance challenges.",

In 2023, Hill's accounted for 23% of the total program charges, whereas in 2024, its contribution dropped to 6%. This decline suggests that the strategic restructuring efforts at Hill's Pet Nutrition were largely completed by 2024, allowing the company to shift its focus toward operational efficiency and organic growth rather than restructuring activities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments stated that it rebalanced the plans' investments when they were outside the target allocation ranges. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the fact that assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets were based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. Additionally, in 2023, the company explicitly mentioned adjusting results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets and that assumptions for non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflected different economic environments. This indicates a more detailed and forward-looking approach to asset allocation in 2023 compared to the more general rebalancing policy described in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Texas Instruments maintained consistent target allocation ranges for its defined benefit plans, with no material changes reported. The U.S. Defined Benefit Plan retained a fixed income allocation range of 65%-80% and equity allocation of 20%-35%, while the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit Plan kept fixed income at 60%-100% and equity at 0%-40%. Rebalancing continued to occur when investments moved outside these ranges, with actual allocations in 2023 closely aligned with the targets. Asset class assumptions, including the long-term rate of return on plan assets, also remained stable, reflecting TI's focus on aligning investments with long-term obligations and risk management strategies.",

By 2023, the company reported 4,355,000 members in Medicare Supplement (Standardized) plans, indicating a slight decrease of 45,000 members from the prior year. This small decline suggests relative stability in the company's Medicare Supplement market share, despite broader growth in other senior-focused segments like Medicare Advantage. The change reflects a minor contraction in this specific product line, even as the company maintained its overall presence in senior insurance offerings.",

This marginal decline contrasts with growth in other senior-focused offerings like Medicare Advantage.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved between 2022 and 2023 by significantly extending lead times and increasing financial risk exposure. In 2022, the company noted that manufacturing lead times were already long, often extending up to twelve months, and that it had revised its purchasing process due to global supply shortages. By 2023, NVIDIA began placing orders at least twelve months in advance, well beyond historical lead times, and entered into non-cancellable inventory orders, prepayments, and capacity agreements to secure supply. This shift increased financial risk exposure, as the company faced potential excess inventory or inventory impairments if demand decreased or was outpaced by competitors.",

In 2024, while no updated GDV figure was provided, the company introduced a more detailed explanation of GDV, clarifying that it includes both purchase volume and cash volume, and specifying that cross-border volume growth is measured separately. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced approach to currency conversion, using quarterly average exchange rates to calculate U.S. dollar equivalents.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent ended the year at $28 million, after starting at $25 million and experiencing a small increase of $6 million through additions, offset by a $2 million reduction from other adjustments. By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent had decreased to $19 million, down from $27 million at the start of the year, primarily due to a $7 million deduction with no write-offs and a $1 million reduction from foreign currency and other adjustments. This represents a significant decline in the noncurrent allowance over the two-year period, suggesting a reduced expectation of long-term credit losses or a strategic decision to tighten credit exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "The provided pages do not include specific data on IBM's Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent for 2022 or 2024. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how this metric evolved or assess the trend's implications on IBM's exposure to long-term credit risk based on the given information.",

By 2024, average paying memberships had increased to 94,200 thousand, a growth of 16%, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership slightly declined to $10.96. Despite the minor decrease in per-member revenue, streaming revenues grew significantly to $12,387,035 thousand in 2024, representing a 17% increase compared to 2023. This indicates that the growth in paying memberships was the primary driver of revenue expansion, offsetting the small drop in average monthly revenue per member.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson's MedTech segment was undergoing a restructuring program that involved exiting certain markets and product lines, particularly in Orthopaedics, with a pre-tax expense of $319 million and an estimated total cost of $700 million to $800 million. This reflected a strategy of streamlining operations and reducing exposure to underperforming areas. In contrast, by 2024, the company shifted toward expansion in the MedTech space through acquisitions, including Shockwave Medical Inc., a leader in intravascular lithotripsy technology, indicating a strategic pivot from cost-cutting to growth through innovation. The shift demonstrates a transformation in the company's approach to the MedTech segment, moving from contraction to investment.",

By fiscal year 2023, the financial exposure shifted toward post-sale obligations, as warranty liabilities primarily related to this segment were highlighted, indicating increased responsibility for long-term product support and customer commitments. This evolution shows a transition from upfront investment risk to ongoing operational liability.",

By 2024, the company provided a more concrete and quantifiable disclosure, showing that tax incentives on qualified production spend directly reduced the cost basis of content assets, resulting in lower amortization. Specifically, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023, and $899 million in 2024, indicating a growing impact of these incentives over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's treatment and disclosure of content amortization remained consistent in being influenced by tax incentives, which reduced the cost basis of produced content and, consequently, lowered amortization expenses. In 2022, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million, increasing to $835 million in 2023 and $899 million in 2024, reflecting a growing impact of these incentives on amortization costs over the period.",

      "question": "How did MetLife's assumptions regarding withdrawal rates and their impact on the estimated fair value of guarantees for GMWBs and GMABs/GMIBs evolve between 2022 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that for GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates resulted in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees, and for GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates led to a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MetLife's assumptions regarding withdrawal rates for GMWBs and GMABs/GMIBs evolved as follows: \n\nFor GMWBs, the weighted average withdrawal rate increased from 3.72% in 2022 to 4.77% in 2024, indicating a higher expected rate of policyholder withdrawals. This increase would lead to a higher estimated fair value of the GMWB guarantees, as higher withdrawal rates directly increase the fair value of these guarantees. \n\nFor GMABs and GMIBs, the withdrawal rate assumption also increased from 3.98% in 2022 to 4.47% in 2024. However, for these guarantees, an increase in withdrawal rates results in a lower estimated fair value, as higher withdrawals reduce the likelihood of the guarantees being in force long enough to be exercised. \n\nThus, while the withdrawal rate assumptions for both GMWBs and GMABs/GMIBs increased over the period, the impact on their estimated fair values was opposite due to the differing nature of the guarantees.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, QFNA was described as a reportable segment with accountability for share-based compensation expense, indicating its active role in the company's organizational structure and performance metrics. However, in 2024, the financial data shows that QFNA's allocation was only $11 million, a significant drop compared to other segments like FLNA ($150 million) and PBNA ($238 million). This suggests that QFNA's strategic importance may have diminished relative to other divisions, as reflected in the reduced financial resources allocated to it.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial allocation for Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) shows a significant decline in strategic importance from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, QFNA had a net revenue of $3,101 million and an operating profit of $492 million, but in 2024, it is projected to have a much smaller share of restructuring and impairment charges, with only $11 million allocated compared to $30 million in 2023. Additionally, under the 2019 Productivity Plan, QFNA is expected to account for just 1% of the total pre-tax charges, indicating a reduced focus or investment in this division compared to others like FLNA and Europe. This suggests that QFNA's strategic importance within PepsiCo has diminished relative to other divisions.",

In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by effective price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, although this was partially offset by shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS revenue was reported in a table format showing $10,653 million in 2021 and $10,653 million in 2022, indicating a flat performance. However, in 2023, the company provided a more detailed description of AWS revenue recognition, emphasizing that revenue is primarily recognized when customers use services based on the quantity rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Additionally, in 2023, Amazon disclosed that certain AWS services, including compute and database, are offered as fixed quantities over specified terms, with revenue recognized ratably. This shift reflects a more nuanced understanding of contractual arrangements and service delivery models, including the capitalization and amortization of sales commissions for contracts exceeding one year, which was not mentioned in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AWS revenue recognition and composition evolved primarily through changes in service delivery models and contractual arrangements. AWS revenue is recognized based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand, with certain services offered as fixed quantities over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Additionally, sales commissions paid for contracts exceeding one year are now capitalized and amortized over the contract term. These changes reflect a shift toward more structured, long-term contractual commitments and a continued focus on scalable, on-demand service delivery.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT's Africa property segment had total assets valued at $4,759.4 million. By 2023, this value decreased to $4,031.2 million, indicating a decline of $728.2 million. This reduction suggests a strategic shift or divestiture in the Africa region, as the company may have reallocated resources or exited certain markets, contrasting with the earlier emphasis in 2022 on expanding operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the total asset value of AMT's Africa property segment decreased from $4,759.4 million to $4,031.2 million, representing a decline of approximately $728.2 million. This reduction in asset value may indicate a strategic shift or optimization in the company's African operations, potentially focusing on divesting underperforming assets or reallocating capital to more profitable regions. It could also reflect the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, as noted in the disclosures, or a deliberate effort to streamline operations in response to market dynamics in the region.",

      "original_answer": "The fair value of plan assets for international pension benefits increased from $201 million in 2023 to $216 million in 2024. This indicates a modest improvement in the funding level of these plans over the year, suggesting a slight strategic increase in asset contributions or positive returns on existing plan investments.",
      "llm_answer": "The fair value of plan assets for international pension benefits increased from $579 million in 2023 to $602 million in 2024. This modest growth, combined with the funded status showing a deficit of $416 million in 2024 (compared to $411 million in 2023), indicates that FedEx's funding strategy for these plans has remained relatively stable, with only slight improvements in asset value not fully offsetting the obligations.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix highlighted the forward-looking nature of content amortization as part of a broader set of financial and strategic uncertainties, noting its dependence on estimated viewing patterns which could impact financial performance. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed and concrete description of the amortization process, emphasizing its complexity and subjectivity due to reliance on both historical and forecasted viewing data. The 2024 filing also outlined specific audit procedures conducted by Ernst & Young LLP to evaluate the amortization method, including sensitivity analyses and comparisons of prior estimates to actual results—indicating a more structured and scrutinized approach over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Netflix's content amortization process has become increasingly complex and subjective, as disclosed in the 2024 10-K. The auditor identified content amortization as a critical audit matter due to the judgmental nature of estimating future viewing patterns, which are based on historical and forecasted data. This subjectivity has grown as the company continues to invest heavily in original programming and global content, requiring more nuanced assumptions about how and when members will consume content. The 2024 filing emphasizes the sensitivity of amortization calculations to changes in these assumptions, highlighting the evolving complexity of the process.",

It included a fixed employer contribution of 2% of annual eligible earnings plus a matching contribution of up to 4%. In 2023, the plan maintained this structure for those hired through December 31, 2003, but for employees hired after that date, the fixed 2% contribution was removed, leaving only the matching contribution of up to 4%. This represents a narrowing of benefits for newer hires.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife described the performance factor as being applied to Performance Units, which were liability awards, and the factor was determined using the same methodology as for Performance Shares, though specific performance metrics or outcomes were not detailed. By 2024, MetLife provided a more detailed and structured approach for Performance Shares, which were classified as equity awards. The performance factor for the 2021–2023 period was explicitly set at 147.5%, based on return on equity relative to business plan goals, total shareholder return compared to a peer group, and a cap if shareholder return was zero or negative. Additionally, the 2024 filing clarified that the Compensation Committee could adjust for 'Significant Events' affecting performance. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of performance factor usage to a more transparent and quantitatively defined mechanism with explicit outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "MetLife's approach to the performance factor in Performance Shares from 2022 to 2024 has introduced a more structured and transparent methodology.

Additionally, the Compensation Committee excludes the impact of \"Significant Events\" when calculating the performance factor. This evolution reflects a more balanced and objective evaluation of performance, incorporating both internal financial metrics and external market comparisons.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity to estimation errors in Medical Costs Payable change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the evolution of its liability estimation accuracy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $1.7 billion in 2021, $880 million in 2020, and $580 million in 2019, indicating consistent downward revisions in prior estimates. In 2023, the company stated that a hypothetical 1% difference in its estimate of Medical Costs Payable at year-end would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This shift indicates that while the company still experiences estimation variance, the nature of the impact evolved from realized favorable developments in prior years to a forward-looking sensitivity analysis in 2023, reflecting a more predictive and quantified risk to earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity to estimation errors in Medical Costs Payable increased from 2022 to 2023, as a 1% difference in estimates would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million compared to $184 million in 2021. This suggests a potential decline in the accuracy or confidence in liability estimation over the period, likely due to increased complexity or uncertainty in factors affecting medical cost trends and claim completion rates.",

      "question": "How did JNJ's international tax liability evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this imply about the tax risk disclosed in connection with the Kenvue separation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported an international tax liability of $3,090 million, which decreased to $2,604 million in 2024. This reduction of $486 million suggests that the substantial tax liability risk disclosed in 2023 related to the Kenvue separation was partially realized and subsequently addressed. The decrease implies that JNJ may have resolved or mitigated a portion of the previously disclosed international tax exposure associated with the separation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, JNJ's international tax liability increased, as reflected in the higher international tax expense of $17,145 million in 2024 compared to $17,095 million in 2023. This increase, along with higher U.S. charges related to talc matters, contributed to a rise in the effective tax rate from 11.5% in 2023 to 15.7% in 2024. The increase in international tax liability suggests that JNJ's exposure to higher-tax jurisdictions grew during this period. This evolution implies that the tax risk disclosed in connection with the Kenvue separation remains significant, as the company faces potential tax liabilities in various jurisdictions, and any adverse tax rulings or changes in tax laws could result in substantial tax obligations, as highlighted in the 2023 filing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo described its allocation methodologies for operating expenses across segments, including share-based compensation, pension, and retiree medical expenses, but did not disclose any specific dollar amounts allocated to the AMESA segment. In contrast, the 2024 filing explicitly reported a $5 million allocation to the AMESA segment for these expenses. This change indicates a shift in the company's financial reporting approach, with increased transparency in 2024 regarding resource allocation to the AMESA region, suggesting a more detailed and accountable presentation of financial commitments across geographic segments.",
      "llm_answer": "PepsiCo's disclosure of operating expense allocations to its AMESA segment remained relatively consistent between 2023 and 2024, with no significant changes in the methodology or specific allocations highlighted in the provided pages. In both years, AMESA's operating profit was modest, at $807 million in 2023 and $713 million in 2024. The company's financial reporting approach for this segment appears stable, with expenses and profits categorized within the standard divisional reporting framework without notable adjustments or special charges specific to AMESA.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed that liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using present value of expected benefits and premiums, with key assumptions including mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns. The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities. This indicates a shift from a primarily actuarial estimation approach in 2022 to a more risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MET's liabilities for future policy benefits have remained sensitive to interest rate changes and investment performance, with evolving risk exposure. In 2022, liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using locked-in assumptions, with sensitivity tests showing impacts from declining and rising interest rate scenarios. By 2024, the company emphasized the continued influence of interest rate fluctuations on investment returns, policyholder liabilities, and reserve requirements. Rising interest rates improved reinvestment opportunities for long-duration products but were partially offset by higher crediting rates and derivative income impacts. Investment performance, particularly in fixed income and equity markets, remained a key driver of liability valuation and profitability, with low interest rates and market volatility increasing reserve pressures and reducing spreads.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ disclosed that profit-share payments in collaborative arrangements were capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product after regulatory approval, indicating a long-term asset treatment. By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted to emphasize that profit-share payments were now included directly in sales to customers, with the note that these payments represented less than 2.0% of total revenues in fiscal year 2024. This reflects a change in emphasis from long-term amortization to current revenue recognition, improving transparency around the contribution of collaborative arrangements to top-line performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Johnson & Johnson's profit-share payments from collaborative arrangements contributed less than 2.0% of total revenues in both fiscal years 2024 and 2023, a decrease from less than 3.0% in fiscal year 2022. These payments are included in sales to customers, indicating a reduction in their relative impact on revenue reporting between 2023 and 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Target disclosed that substantially all vendor income—arising from volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising activities—was recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales. Additionally, reimbursements from vendors for advertising were recognized as offsets within SG&A expenses, with net advertising costs reported at $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. By 2024, Target's classification had evolved: vendor income that constitutes reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs was now explicitly offset against advertising expenses within Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, while vendor income not tied to such reimbursements continued to reduce Cost of Sales. This reflects a more nuanced and bifurcated treatment of vendor income depending on its nature and use.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Target's treatment of vendor income remained largely consistent, with most vendor income recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales. However, in 2024, Target reclassified certain advertising-related expenses from Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses to Cost of Sales to align with its updated presentation. This reclassification increased Cost of Sales by $92 million and $77 million for 2023 and 2022, respectively, while decreasing SG&A Expenses by the same amounts. Vendor income that specifically reimburses incremental advertising costs is now more explicitly offset against advertising expenses within SG&A, reflecting a more nuanced classification in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, LinkedIn generated $13.816 billion in revenue. By fiscal year 2024, LinkedIn's revenue had increased by 9%, indicating continued growth. This growth trajectory suggests that LinkedIn has maintained a steady upward trend in revenue contribution within Microsoft's broader product portfolio, reflecting its strategic importance and successful integration post-acquisition.",

However, the absence of growth in LinkedIn's revenue over this period suggests a plateau in its contribution, contrasting with the overall growth in Microsoft's cloud and other segments. This indicates that LinkedIn's growth trajectory within Microsoft's portfolio has stabilized, with no significant acceleration in revenue contribution.",

In 2023, this figure decreased slightly to $1.6 billion.

In 2024, the Corporation repeated the same language, indicating no change in its ability to estimate these settlement dates.

However, in 2024, there was a notable increase in the liability balance due to revisions, which rose to $884 million from $1,790 million in 2023, indicating a refinement or reassessment of obligations.

      "llm_answer": "HD's net proceeds from long-term debt decreased from $6.9 billion in fiscal 2022 to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2023. This shift indicates a reduced reliance on issuing long-term debt for financing activities in fiscal 2023, as the company focused more on share repurchases and dividends, partially funded by debt repayments and stronger cash flow from operations.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, foreign exchange gains were $403 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by a $431 million non-cash gain from the remeasurement of Senior Notes in euros, partially offset by losses on cash and content liability positions. In contrast, by 2024, foreign exchange losses were $18 million (net of derivatives and hedging), with a $122 million non-cash gain from Senior Notes offsetting losses on cash and content liabilities. This marks a significant shift from a net gain in 2022 to a smaller net loss in 2024, with the Senior Notes' impact decreasing in magnitude and hedging playing a more prominent role in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, foreign exchange impacts on Interest and Other Income (Expense) showed significant volatility, particularly due to the remeasurement of Senior Notes and cash/content liability positions. In 2024, Netflix reported foreign exchange losses of $18 million, driven by the remeasurement of cash and content liabilities in non-functional currencies, partially offset by a $122 million noncash gain from the remeasurement of €5,170 million Senior Notes. This marked a sharp improvement from 2023, where a $293 million loss was primarily due to a $176 million noncash loss on euro-denominated Senior Notes and remeasurement of cash/content liabilities. The magnitude of these impacts decreased significantly from 2023 to 2024, reflecting more favorable currency movements and hedging effectiveness.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Gigafactory Shanghai was listed as an active production location manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. By 2024, Tesla disclosed a formal agreement with the Shanghai local government that introduced new operational conditions tied to cumulative capital expenditure targets and annual tax revenue requirements starting in late 2023. Additionally, while incentives received in 2023 were deemed immaterial, Tesla continued to receive immaterial amounts in 2024, indicating that while the financial impact remained minor, the nature of the relationship evolved from operational to more formally structured with defined performance obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Tesla's relationship with Gigafactory Shanghai between 2023 and 2024 has been defined by its obligation to meet cumulative capital expenditure and annual tax revenue targets under its agreement with the local government. These commitments, which began at the end of 2023, are tied to economic incentives granted to the Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary. Incentives related to capital investments are recorded as a reduction of the cost of capital assets, while those tied to manufacturing operations are recorded as an offset to cost of revenues. However, the amounts received under these incentives were immaterial for both 2024 and 2023, indicating that while Tesla remains committed to fulfilling its targets, the financial impact of the incentives has not yet been significant.",

In the subsequent 2023–2024 period, the decline continued but at a slower pace, with a 3% decrease from $2,188 million to $2,126 million.

In contrast, by 2023, the company recorded a significant net loss of $407 million from the disposal of businesses or assets. This sharp change indicates a notable shift in NextEra Energy's divestiture strategy, moving from limited asset sales with small gains to a more active divestiture approach involving larger transactions that resulted in a substantial net loss, possibly reflecting strategic portfolio realignment.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the gains on disposal of businesses or assets increased significantly from $4 million to $407 million.

In 2023, the impact of such favorable items, including cost recoveries, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion.

This decline suggests that favorable profit adjustments, such as risk retirements or cost recoveries, had a slightly diminished positive effect on Lockheed Martin's financial performance in 2023 compared to 2022.

By 2024, fuel surcharge revenues further declined to $2.6 billion from $3.0 billion in 2023, again driven by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lagged effect of price changes, partially offset by higher shipment volumes. This indicates a continued downward trend in fuel surcharge revenues over the two-year period, influenced by both pricing and volume dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, freight revenues from fuel surcharge programs declined from $3.0 billion to $2.6 billion, representing a $0.4 billion decrease. This reduction was primarily driven by a 15% drop in fuel prices and the lag effect of fluctuating fuel prices, as changes in fuel prices typically take up to two months to impact surcharge recoveries. Additionally, while 2024 saw higher shipment volumes compared to 2023, the lower fuel prices had a more significant negative impact on the overall fuel surcharge revenues.",

      "question": "How has ExxonMobil's approach to incorporating greenhouse gas emissions pricing into its Corporate Plan assumptions evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic planning for lower-emission investments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil stated that its Corporate Plan assumptions included greenhouse gas emissions pricing as part of its economic evaluation for investments, developed annually based on its Global Outlook. By 2024, the company maintained this approach but emphasized that current policy trends and lower-emission solutions were not yet aligned with a net-zero pathway by 2050, indicating a more cautious stance on the pace of emissions reduction. This evolution suggests that while emissions pricing remains a consistent factor in planning, ExxonMobil is signaling that external policy support and technological advancements need to accelerate for the company to meet more aggressive emissions targets.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to incorporating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pricing into its Corporate Plan assumptions has become more explicit and integrated from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, the company mentioned that GHG emissions pricing was part of the Corporate Plan assumptions, developed annually, alongside other economic factors. By 2024, the company emphasized that these assumptions are grounded in its Global Outlook, which reflects the existing policy environment and anticipates increasing policy stringency and technological improvement up to 2050. This evolution indicates a more strategic and forward-looking approach to planning for lower-emission investments, aligning with long-term market fundamentals and potential regulatory shifts. It suggests that ExxonMobil is proactively adjusting its planning processes to account for the growing importance of emissions pricing and lower-carbon technologies in its investment decisions.",

      "question": "How has Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets evolved between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's acquisition strategy during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets was $313 million. By fiscal 2024, this figure had increased significantly, as the company reported a year-over-year rise in amortization expenses, attributing this growth directly to the acquisition of Splunk Inc. in March 2024. The Splunk acquisition, which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, also brought with it additional intangible assets that required amortization, marking a clear shift in Cisco's financial obligations tied to its acquisition-driven growth strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets increased significantly. In fiscal 2022, the annual amortization was $313 million, compared to $313 million in fiscal 2021, representing a 46% increase from fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2024, the quarterly amortization rose to $73 million, up from $79 million in the same period in fiscal 2023, indicating a continued trend of higher amortization expenses. This increase is largely attributed to Cisco's acquisition strategy, particularly the acquisition of Splunk Inc. in March 2024, which contributed to higher purchased intangible assets and, consequently, higher amortization expenses. The upward trend in amortization reflects Cisco's ongoing efforts to expand its technology portfolio through strategic acquisitions.",

      "question": "How did the impact of cost pass-through on Linde's sales evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's pricing dynamics?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde's long-term contracts enabled the company to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, positively impacting its business by ensuring stable cash flow. However, in 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on sales, indicating a shift in how these cost adjustments affected the company's revenue. This change suggests that rising costs could not be fully offset by customer pricing adjustments, potentially signaling tighter pricing conditions or increased cost pressures in the market.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost pass-through on Linde's sales decreased from a 3% reduction in 2023 to a 1% reduction in 2024. This shift indicates that the company's pricing dynamics improved in 2024, as higher price attainment partially offset the need for cost pass-through, reflecting stronger pricing power and better cost management.",

      "original_answer": "Amgen's investment in its Research and Early Pipeline segment decreased from $1,584 million in 2023 to $1,534 million in 2024. This indicates a modest reduction in early-stage R&D funding, suggesting a potential strategic shift toward later-stage development or cost containment in the earliest phases of drug discovery.",
      "llm_answer": "Amgen's investment in its Research and Early Pipeline segment decreased slightly from $1,584 million in 2023 to $1,534 million in 2024. This modest decline, however, is offset by a significant increase in spending on later-stage clinical programs, which rose from $1,898 million in 2023 to $2,830 million in 2024. This shift indicates that Amgen is prioritizing the advancement of its later-stage clinical programs, reflecting a long-term R&D strategy focused on moving promising candidates toward regulatory approval and commercialization.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reviewed its network location intangible asset for impairment using a cash flow modeling approach that incorporated tower location, demographics, timing of new tenants, lease rates, and ongoing cash requirements. Tenant-related intangible assets were assessed on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on turnover, contract non-renewals, or relationship terminations. By 2023, while the impairment review framework remained largely the same, the company added context around tenant risk by referencing a specific customer (VIL) in India that had made partial payments in 2022 and indicated it would not resume full contractual payments in 2023, signaling a shift in how tenant-specific risks were explicitly tied to impairment considerations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the treatment and assumptions related to the Network Location Intangible asset's impairment analysis evolved in terms of cash flow modeling and tenant-related risk factors. In 2022, the impairment analysis incorporated cash flow modeling that considered factors such as tower location demographics, lease rates, and tenant tenancy, while tenant-related risk factors included high turnover or attrition and non-renewal of contracts. By 2023, the analysis continued to use cash flow modeling but placed increased emphasis on the impact of tenant-related risks, particularly in India, where developments such as VIL's payment shortfalls and the AGR ruling significantly influenced the impairment assessments. Additionally, the 2023 analysis reflected a more strategic evaluation of the India market, including updated fair value estimates and a broader consideration of macroeconomic and regulatory risks affecting tenant performance.",

By 2024, MDLZ disclosed a specific incremental cost of $4 million directly attributed to the war in Ukraine, which was included in operating results.

By 2024, these war-related costs were no longer explicitly mentioned as a separate item in the non-GAAP adjustments table, indicating they were either fully resolved or no longer material to operating results.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs are capitalized in inventories if they relate directly to a specific contract or anticipated contract, with the determination that the contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources for performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable. Additionally, it specified that pre-contract costs were generally recognized as cost of sales upon receipt of the anticipated contract. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, emphasizing that these costs are incurred to enhance the ability to meet schedule and customer milestones, while maintaining the same core conditions for capitalization. The evolution reflects a more strategic framing of pre-contract cost incurrence without altering the financial treatment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin's treatment and disclosure of pre-contract costs remained consistent in terms of the conditions for capitalization. Pre-contract costs are capitalized as work-in-process inventory if they directly relate to a contract or anticipated contract that can be specifically identified, the contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources for fulfilling performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable. However, in 2023, there was a notable increase in the amount of pre-contract costs included in inventories, rising from $791 million as of December 31, 2022, to $989 million as of December 31, 2023. This increase was primarily attributed to the Aeronautics business segment, driven by classified contracts.",

By fiscal 2023, the segment's revenue increased to $12.6B, and the percentage contribution of this segment to Accenture’s total revenues rose from 20% to 21%, indicating a growing emphasis on this industry group. This represents a significant increase in both absolute revenue and proportional importance.",

In terms of composition, the segment's revenue grew by 10% in both U.S. dollars and local currency during this period, driven by strong demand for services in healthcare and public sector digital transformation initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM identified 'Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets' as a key risk factor, indicating continued sensitivity to client budgets. However, in 2024, the company added a nuance by emphasizing a 'shift in client buying patterns' as a contributing factor to this risk, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2023. This evolution suggests that while the core risk remains stable, IBM is observing and highlighting changing dynamics in how clients allocate their budgets, potentially due to digital transformation trends or shifts toward cloud and AI investments.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the risk factors disclosed in its 10-K filings, IBM's exposure to client spending budgets has remained a consistent concern between 2023 and 2024. Both filings highlight that downturns in economic conditions or shifts in client buying patterns could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability. However, the 2024 filing places a stronger emphasis on the evolving nature of client budgets in the context of IBM's strategic focus on high-growth areas like AI and hybrid cloud, where client adoption and economic models remain uncertain. This suggests a heightened sensitivity to client spending dynamics in 2024 as IBM continues to invest in innovation and market expansion.",

In 2024, these figures increased to $1,615 million in current loans, $110 million in 30-89 days delinquent, and $45 million in 90+ days past due. This indicates a moderate increase in both delinquency categories, suggesting a slight rise in credit risk exposure over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the distribution of Card Member Loan balances showed a slight increase in current balances (from $2,785 million to $2,863 million) and a marginal rise in delinquent balances (from $231 million to $220 million for 30-89 days past due and from $73 million to $89 million for 90+ days past due).

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the decline in ENBREL sales was attributed to three factors: lower net selling price, lower inventory, and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. By 2024, the decline was attributed solely to a lower net selling price, indicating that inventory and sales deductions were no longer significant contributors to the decline. Additionally, the company's expectations shifted from anticipating ENBREL to follow the historical quarterly sales pattern in 2024 with further price declines, to expecting relatively flat volumes with continued price erosion in 2025, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price set for 2026.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the decline in ENBREL sales was consistently driven by lower net selling price, with no significant change in the underlying factor. In 2023, the decline was also impacted by lower inventory and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, while in 2024, the decline was attributed solely to lower net selling price. Looking ahead, the company expects ENBREL sales to follow a historical quarterly pattern due to benefit plan changes and deductible impacts, with relatively flat volumes but continued declines in net selling price, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price set by CMS beginning in 2026.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs were capitalized in inventory if they directly related to a specific anticipated contract, with the costs generally recognized as cost of sales upon contract award. The company also noted that start-up costs were expensed as incurred. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the strategic use of pre-contract costs in advanced procurement for a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment, with explicit mention of recoverability risks tied to the customer's decisions on future program phases. This reflects a shift from a general accounting policy to a more risk-focused disclosure involving specific programs and financial exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin's treatment and disclosure of pre-contract costs remained largely consistent in terms of capitalization criteria, with costs being capitalized as work-in-process if they relate directly to an anticipated contract where award is probable, the costs are recoverable, and they enhance resources used to satisfy performance obligations. However, in 2023, the company highlighted increased risk exposure related to specific development programs, particularly those with fixed-price contracts or production options, which shifted more financial risk to the company. This is evident in disclosures about potential reach-forward losses, such as those on a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract and the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program, where performance issues and cost overruns led to material losses. The 2023 disclosures reflect a more pronounced emphasis on the financial risks associated with pre-contract costs and the potential for material impacts on future earnings.",

By 2024, the gross settlement exposure had increased to $78,385 million, and the net settlement exposure rose to $64,919 million after applying $13,466 million in risk mitigation arrangements. This indicates a significant increase in both gross and net exposures over the two-year period.",

Meanwhile, the net settlement exposure, after applying risk mitigation arrangements, rose from $51,861 million in 2021 to $64,919 million in 2024, reflecting an increase of $13,058 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ did not exclude the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from its Organic Net Revenue calculations, and Organic Net Revenue stood at $35.6 billion, reflecting a 14.7% increase driven by net pricing and favorable volume/mix. However, in 2024, due to the significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso in late 2023 and the potential distortion on constant currency growth measures, MDLZ decided to exclude pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year (classified as 'extreme pricing') from Organic Net Revenue and related non-GAAP metrics. This change was implemented prospectively starting in Q1 2024, with the impact of extreme pricing now being separately disclosed as part of 'currency-related items.' In 2024, extreme pricing in Argentina contributed $1,167 million (3.2 percentage points) to Organic Net Revenue growth, offsetting some of the unfavorable currency translation impacts. This indicates a strategic shift in how MDLZ accounts for and reports financial performance in hyperinflationary environments.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ began excluding the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina (defined as price increases exceeding 26% year-over-year) from its non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue and related growth measures, starting in Q1 2024, due to the Argentinean peso's significant devaluation and the resulting hyperinflationary conditions. In 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina was still material, contributing $1,167 million (3.2 pp) to the unfavorable currency-related items affecting Organic Net Revenue. This shift indicates that MDLZ is proactively adjusting its financial reporting to better reflect the economic realities of hyperinflationary markets, ensuring more accurate and comparable performance metrics by isolating the effects of extreme inflation.",

Regarding markdown reserves, in 2022, the reserve was not explicitly stated, but in 2024, it was reported at $222 million, reflecting a decrease of approximately $23 million from fiscal 2023. This indicates that the company experienced relatively stable shrink risk but reduced its markdown exposure, suggesting improved inventory management or stronger sales performance that lowered the need for markdowns.",

This suggests that the company experienced a reduction in the need for markdowns, potentially due to better inventory management or improved sales performance, while maintaining a stable approach to shrinkage management.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Humira was described as AbbVie's largest product with worldwide net revenues of approximately $20.7 billion in 2021, although its U.S. composition of matter patent had already expired in December 2016. By 2024, global Humira sales had decreased by 37%, with a 41% drop in the U.S. due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity on January 31, 2023, and a 13% decline internationally due to continued biosimilar impact. This marks a significant decline from its previously high revenue contribution.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Humira's sales performance experienced a significant decline, with global sales dropping by 37% in 2024 compared to 2023. In the United States, sales fell by 41% in 2024, primarily due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity on January 31, 2023. Internationally, Humira revenues decreased by 13% in 2024, also driven by the continued impact of biosimilar competition. This decline reflects the key factor of patent expiration and the subsequent entry of biosimilars into the market, which significantly affected Humira's market position and sales.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales and explicitly warned that any shift away from nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF could adversely impact HIV product sales. In 2024, while the company maintained the same risk narrative around potential paradigm shifts affecting nucleoside-based therapies, it omitted the specific percentage of total product sales attributable to HIV products. This suggests that while the core risk remained, the level of quantitative transparency decreased in the 2024 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, GILD's disclosure regarding the risk to HIV product sales from shifts in treatment paradigms remained consistent in highlighting the dependence on nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF. In both years, the company emphasized that a substantial portion of its revenue comes from HIV products, with many containing TAF. The risk factor explicitly states that if treatment paradigms shift and nucleoside-based therapeutics are no longer preferred, HIV product sales would be adversely impacted. However, in 2024, there was a slight elaboration on the competitive landscape and the potential for market share gains by competitive products, including generics, underscoring the ongoing pressure on maintaining sales amid evolving treatment approaches.",

In 2024, this exclusion was maintained and further clarified as part of the non-recurring adjustments to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods.

By 2024, this treatment remained consistent, as these gains or losses continued to be excluded from non-GAAP earnings measures, as they were deemed not indicative of underlying operations and were excluded to facilitate comparisons of operating performance across periods.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans showed a decreasing trend in future obligations, with amounts of $140 million for 2022 through 2024, declining to $130 million in 2025 and 2026, and totaling $570 million for 2027–2031. In 2023, Lockheed Martin continued to disclose these obligations but provided more detail on the accounting treatment, specifying that non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these plans were recorded as part of 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. This shift reflects a more detailed disclosure and classification refinement in 2023 compared to the primarily numerical disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the treatment and financial disclosure of Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans evolved in terms of future obligations and accounting classification as follows:\n\n1. **Future Obligations**: The projected benefit obligation for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans decreased slightly from $1,359 million at the end of 2022 to $1,328 million at the end of 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the discount rate from 5.25% at December 31, 2022, to 5.00% at December 31, 2023, which increased the present value of future obligations. However, this was partially offset by settlements and benefit payments during the year.\n\n2. **Accounting Classification**: The funded status of the Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans remained an asset in 2023, with a funded status of $387 million, compared to $297 million in 2022. This reflects that the fair value of plan assets exceeded the benefit obligation. Actuarial gains and losses related to these plans were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), with a pre-tax amount of $416 million in 2023 compared to $387 million in 2022. These gains or losses are amortized into income or expense over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants.",

      "original_answer": "The tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income continued to benefit Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, and in 2023, it increased slightly to 14.5%. Both years cite the foreign derived intangible income deductions as a key factor in reducing the effective tax rate, alongside other credits such as research and development and employee equity awards. The consistent mention of this deduction across both years indicates that it remained a stable component of the company's tax planning strategy, even amid broader tax law changes like the research and development capitalization rules that introduced new cash tax liabilities. However, the slight increase in the effective tax rate suggests a minor reduction in the relative benefit from these deductions.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income on Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate remained relatively stable between 2022 and 2023, with the effective tax rate at 14.5% in 2023 and 14.2% in 2022. Both years benefited from these deductions along with other tax incentives such as research and development credits. This consistency suggests that the company's tax planning strategy effectively leverages available deductions to maintain a favorable effective tax rate despite changes in tax laws and economic conditions.",

      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Cisco's EMEA product revenue decreased by 10%, from $10,545 million in 2022 to $11,866 million in 2023, and further declined to $10,645 million in 2024. Its percentage contribution to total product revenue remained relatively stable at 27.5% in 2023 and 27.1% in 2024, compared to 27.7% in 2022. This indicates a decline in the region's product revenue performance, driven by declines across customer markets despite a slight maintenance of its share of total product revenue.",

      "question": "How did Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about its pricing strategy and cost management?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde emphasized its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, indicating a proactive approach to cost management. By 2024, this mechanism had a negative 1% impact on sales growth, suggesting that while cost pass-through remained a feature of its contracts, it may have led to downward pressure on sales due to customer resistance or market conditions. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely strategic advantage to a more complex dynamic affecting revenue performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms shifted from a negative impact to a more neutral or slightly positive one. In 2023, cost pass-through decreased sales by 3% with minimal impact on operating profit, while in 2024, the impact varied by segment—decreasing sales by 1% in the Americas and 4% in EMEA, but increasing sales by 1% in APAC, all with minimal impact on operating profit. This evolution indicates that Linde effectively managed to pass on energy and feedstock cost fluctuations to customers through long-term contracts, maintaining stable operating margins despite cost inflation. The shift also suggests a more balanced pricing strategy, leveraging cost pass-through to mitigate cost pressures while maintaining profitability.",

This downward shift suggests a change in the company's taxable income or tax planning strategies over the two fiscal years.",
      "llm_answer": "HD's Federal income tax provision decreased from $3,918 million in fiscal 2022 to $3,764 million in fiscal 2023, reflecting a reduction in federal tax expense despite a slight decline in pre-tax earnings from the U.S. operations. This indicates that the company's effective tax rate remained stable at around 24%, suggesting consistent tax planning and compliance with tax regulations. The decrease in the deferred tax provision also implies a more favorable tax position, potentially due to changes in tax credits or adjustments in deferred tax assets and liabilities.",

By 2024, consumer delinquencies increased to $110 million (30-89 days) and $45 million (90+ days), while small business delinquencies rose to $56 million and $22 million respectively.

This marks a shift from exclusion to inclusion and quantification of such adjustments in financial reporting, indicating a change in how the company accounts for these items in its non-GAAP performance evaluation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Mondelēz International continued to exclude contingent consideration adjustments from its non-GAAP financial reporting, including Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Income, to provide a clearer view of underlying operating performance. In 2023, these adjustments were explicitly noted as part of the non-GAAP exclusions, and by 2024, the treatment remained consistent, with the company continuing to exclude such adjustments as part of its standard non-GAAP adjustments for acquisitions and integration costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed actions taken to reduce pension obligation volatility, including pension risk transfer transactions such as the August 2021 purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for $4.9 billion in pension obligations, and noted a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion. The company also reported a weighted average discount rate of 2.875% for its defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021. In 2023, the company shifted focus to how it records components of FAS pension income/expense across different financial statement accounts and provided a reconciliation table for the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans, indicating a more structured financial presentation of benefit obligations and plan assets. This represents a shift from strategic pension risk management in 2022 to detailed financial disclosure and classification in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Lockheed Martin's treatment and disclosure of the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans showed a more negative funded status, with the unfunded liability increasing from $5,470 million in 2022 to $6,159 million in 2023. This change was primarily driven by a decrease in the discount rate from 5.25% in 2022 to 5.00% in 2023, which increased the projected benefit obligations. Additionally, the financial presentation included a detailed reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets, and funded status, highlighting the impact of actuarial losses, settlements, and changes in discount rates. The 2023 disclosures also provided more granular details on the actual return on plan assets (7%) and the expected long-term rate of return (6.50%), reflecting the ongoing volatility and sensitivity of pension obligations to economic assumptions.",

In 2022, these adjustments contributed $353 million (net of tax) positively, driven by the depreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar. By 2023, the impact turned negative at $165 million (pre-tax), resulting in a net loss of $128 million after tax. In 2024, the adjustments improved to a positive $147 million (pre-tax), yielding a net gain of $114 million after tax.

By 2023, The Home Depot provided a more nuanced perspective, explicitly stating that adverse conditions in the housing market, including foreclosure rates, had already 'in some cases adversely impacted' customer behavior. This indicates a shift from a general acknowledgment of potential impact in 2022 to a more concrete recognition of realized effects in 2023, suggesting the company observed tangible changes in customer purchasing behavior linked to housing market conditions.",

By the 2023 10-K filing, the discussion expanded to include the impact of inflation, rising interest rates, and the shift in consumer spending from big-ticket, discretionary purchases to smaller, less discretionary ones, which was partly influenced by economic uncertainty. Additionally, the 2023 filing highlighted how the pandemic's lingering effects and macroeconomic factors continued to influence customer behavior, with a specific mention of how trade credit usage by MRO and Pro customers could be affected by broader economic conditions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD emphasized that inventory write-off charges were primarily linked to products failing specifications and quality standards, as well as changes in manufacturing strategy, with a focus on potential remediation efforts and costly alternatives. By 2024, the company shifted its emphasis, describing inventory write-offs as part of broader operational risks tied to single-entity dependencies in manufacturing and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), with a stronger focus on supply chain interruptions and their impact on clinical and commercial product availability. This evolution reveals a strategic shift from internal quality and strategy concerns to external manufacturing and supplier risks.",
      "llm_answer": "GILD's characterization of inventory write-off charges became more specific and tied to clinical and manufacturing challenges in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, the company mentioned inventory write-offs in the context of manufacturing strategy changes and quality issues but did not link them to specific product failures. In 2024, GILD explicitly connected inventory write-offs to clinical setbacks, such as the discontinuation of development programs for sacituzumab govitecan-hziy in NSCLC and magrolimab in hematologic cancers. This evolution in disclosure reveals an increased emphasis on transparency regarding how clinical trial outcomes and product development risks directly impact manufacturing and inventory management, highlighting a more integrated view of operational and R&D risks.",

This represents a reduction of $71 million, or approximately 16.3%, indicating a decline in the company's international tax burden over the two fiscal years.",
      "llm_answer": "HD's foreign income tax liabilities decreased slightly between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, from $1,487 million in fiscal 2022 to $1,243 million in fiscal 2023. This reduction suggests a decline in the company's foreign earnings during the period. The combined effective tax rate remained relatively stable at 24.0% in fiscal 2023 compared to 23.9% in fiscal 2022, indicating consistent tax exposure despite the decline in foreign income. Overall, the decrease in foreign income tax liabilities implies reduced international tax exposure for HD in fiscal 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 19% increase in streaming revenues, with an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $11.67. By 2024, the streaming revenue growth rate had slowed to 17%, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership had decreased slightly to $10.96. This indicates a shift in Netflix's pricing strategy, potentially reflecting competitive pressures or changes in content value perception by consumers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's streaming revenue grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 16%, increasing from $31.47 billion in 2022 to $39.00 billion in 2024. The average monthly revenue per paying membership initially declined slightly from $8.48 in 2022 to $8.24 in 2023 but then rose to $11.70 in 2024. This evolution indicates that Netflix's pricing strategy involved gradual price increases, particularly in international markets, which contributed to revenue growth despite slower membership addition rates in later years. The company's focus on expanding its content library and entering new markets, coupled with strategic price adjustments, helped drive revenue generation.",

In 2024, the company reported a sharp increase in these impairments to $4,180 million, representing a substantial year-over-year increase from the 2023 level.

In 2023, the impairments were $50 million, primarily related to a partial impairment charge on the bulevirtide IPR&D intangible asset.

In 2023, LMT explicitly disclosed that the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these pension plans were recorded in a separate line item titled 'non-service FAS pension income (expense) account.'

In 2022, the non-service FAS pension expense was $(1,292) million, while in 2023, it improved to $443 million, reflecting a significant reduction in actuarial losses and a decrease in settlement charges.

This suggests that LMT experienced an increase in new orders or delays in fulfilling existing orders, which could signal stronger future revenue potential assuming the company can execute on the growing backlog.",

This growth suggests strong demand for Aeronautics' products and services, driven by higher orders on classified and C-130 programs. The increase in backlog implies potential future revenue as these orders are fulfilled, reflecting the company's ability to secure contracts and maintain a robust pipeline for long-term growth.",

By 2023, this revenue had decreased to $5,466 million, accounting for only 13.9% of total product revenue.

      "original_answer": "Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs increased from $2,357.7 million in 2022 to $11,180.6 million in 2023 in absolute terms. However, as a percentage of Total Net Revenues, these costs decreased from 34.0% in 2022 to 30.9% in 2023. This indicates that despite higher overall spending, the company became more efficient in managing these costs relative to revenue. The decline in the cost ratio suggests improved supply chain performance or cost containment strategies that allowed Starbucks to scale operations more efficiently year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs as a percentage of Total Net Revenues decreased from 31.7% in 2023 to 30.9% in 2024, a reduction of 80 basis points. This decline was primarily attributed to increased sales from pricing and reduced supply chain costs. This suggests that the company improved its supply chain efficiency during this period, likely through cost management and operational optimizations.",

By 2024, the growth pattern had changed significantly, with total Other Aesthetics Sales growing by only 3.7% year-over-year. Specifically, U.S. sales increased slightly to $1,118M from $1,060M (5.5% growth), while international sales declined to $161M from $174M (-7.1% change). This indicates a substantial slowdown in growth momentum for the segment, shifting from rapid expansion to near-stable performance.",

This slowdown suggests that the initial strong growth driven by new product launches and market expansion has matured, and the segment is now experiencing more modest growth, potentially due to market saturation or competitive pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's International Segment had $19.2 billion in assets held for sale, primarily related to its operations in the U.K. and Japan, which were subsequently closed. This indicated a strategic shift in international operations, though the segment still played a significant role. By fiscal 2024, the International Segment generated approximately 18% of Walmart’s consolidated net sales, highlighting its continued importance. However, the 2024 report noted that unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations were adversely affecting the reported performance of the International Segment and, consequently, Walmart’s consolidated results. This evolution shows that while the segment remained a substantial contributor, its exposure to currency risk had become a more explicitly stated financial vulnerability, with a direct negative impact on consolidated performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through its International Segment increased between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, with adverse effects on its consolidated financial performance. In fiscal 2022, the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations was already noted as a factor reducing the reported performance of the Walmart International segment and negatively affecting consolidated results. By fiscal 2024, the exposure remained significant, with the company highlighting that unfavorable fluctuations continued to increase costs of sales and reduce gross profit, further adversely impacting its international operations and consolidated financial performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, content amortization increased by $1,423 million due to the expansion of existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. This increase was a major driver of the overall rise in cost of revenues. By 2024, the focus had shifted toward the complexity and subjectivity of the amortization methodology itself, with Netflix emphasizing the judgment involved in estimating future viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. The company also implemented more rigorous internal controls and audit procedures to validate the assumptions and data used in amortization modeling, indicating a more refined and risk-aware approach to managing content amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Netflix continued to amortize its content based on historical and estimated viewing patterns, as disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The methodology remained focused on factors such as historical and forecasted viewing hours, with amortization patterns adjusted if actual viewing behavior deviated from estimates. The financial impact of content amortization remained significant, as it constituted the majority of Netflix's cost of revenues. In 2024, content amortization continued to grow in line with increased content production and licensing, contributing to a steady rise in cost of revenues as Netflix expanded its original programming and global content library.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Costco noted that square footage growth was 'generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets' and expected this trend to continue. In 2023, this observation remained consistent, with the company reiterating that 'certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth.' However, the 2023 filing added more emphasis on the strategic importance of international expansion by highlighting that these markets have 'lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales' and 'less or no direct membership warehouse competition.' This indicates that while the company maintained its focus on international square footage growth, it increasingly framed this strategy in terms of cost advantages and market opportunity. The evolution suggests a more deliberate shift toward leveraging international markets not just for growth, but for operational efficiency and competitive positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Costco's approach to square footage growth in international markets showed a slight decline in the number of new warehouses opened in the \"Other International\" segment, from 7 in 2022 to 5 in 2023. However, the company maintained a relatively high rate of international expansion compared to its U.S. operations, consistent with its strategy of focusing on international growth due to the smaller base in those markets. This indicates that Costco continues to prioritize international expansion as a key component of its global strategy, though at a slightly tempered pace, potentially reflecting market saturation or strategic site selection in existing versus new markets.",

This growth indicates that Accenture is strengthening its positioning in this industry group, as the segment outperformed the overall revenue growth of 1% for the company.

However, by fiscal 2024, Membership and Other Income had declined to $1,408 million from $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a reversal in the earlier growth trend. This suggests a potential weakening in the performance or appeal of Walmart’s membership programs during this period.",

This upward trend indicates strong performance in Walmart's membership programs, driven by growth in the membership base and Plus penetration, as well as the expiration of promotional offerings offsetting membership fee increases.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM used observable quoted prices primarily for equity securities held in separate accounts and relied on observable inputs of comparable market transactions for corporate, government, and asset-backed debt securities. In 2024, the company expanded the scope of observable quoted prices to include non-U.S. equity securities and specifically added government debt securities traded on active exchanges. Additionally, in 2024, XOM introduced a new category for cash balances subject to withdrawal penalties, which are treated as level 2 inputs. This indicates a more detailed and nuanced approach in 2024, with increased specificity in the application of observable quoted prices across a broader set of assets.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, XOM's reliance on observable quoted prices for fair value measurements of debt and equity securities remained consistent in terms of methodology but showed slight shifts in the scope of assets categorized under Level 1 and Level 2. For equity securities, non-U.S. holdings continued to use observable quoted prices on active exchanges, with a marginal increase in fair value from $1,740 million in 2023 to $1,603 million in 2024. For debt securities, corporate, government, and asset-backed instruments continued to rely on observable inputs from comparable market transactions, with government debt traded on active exchanges still valued using quoted prices. However, in 2024, there was a modest increase in the allocation of government debt to Level 2 inputs, indicating a slight shift toward less directly observable market data for some portions of the portfolio. Overall, the specificity of market inputs remained largely unchanged, with the valuation hierarchy continuing to reflect a mix of active market data and broader market transaction inputs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments evolved from 2022 to 2023 by significantly shortening lead times and increasing financial risk exposure. In 2022, the company typically placed orders with a lead time of about six months, but by 2023, it began placing orders at least twelve months in advance to secure supply amid shortages. This shift increased exposure to financial risks, such as potential excess inventory or inventory impairments, if demand expectations were not met or if market conditions changed. Additionally, the company's increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers added complexity and execution risks to its supply chain.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's income from equity investments increased slightly from $167 million in 2023 to $170 million in 2024 on a reported basis. On an adjusted basis, the increase was from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024. The year-over-year growth in adjusted income from equity investments was modest, driven by improved performance in certain investments, although in the prior year, a decline was attributed to the overall performance of investments in APAC. In 2024, no such broad regional drag was mentioned, suggesting a stabilization or slight improvement in equity investment performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MET reported Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues of $5,727 million. In 2024, this metric decreased by $212 million, or 3%, to $5,515 million on a reported basis. However, when adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations, the metric increased by $149 million, or 2%, compared to 2023. This change was driven by higher premiums in Korea and Australia, along with increased fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, which were partially offset by declines in premiums from Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products.",
      "llm_answer": "MET's Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $238 million, or 3%, between 2023 and 2024. This decline was primarily driven by lower premiums in the Retirement & Income Solutions segment from pension risk transfer and post-retirement benefit businesses. However, growth in the U.K. longevity reinsurance and institutional income annuities businesses partially offset this decline. In 2024, regional factors contributing to the change included strong growth in the EMEA region, particularly in corporate solutions in the Gulf, U.K., and Egypt, as well as credit life and pension businesses in Turkey and Romania. Latin America also saw growth due to strong sales in Mexico and Chile, while Asia experienced a slight increase in premiums in Korea and Australia despite a decline in Japan.",

By fiscal 2024, the nature of financial risk for Walmart International had evolved from internal strategic asset impairments to a more external and ongoing exposure to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations. Specifically, the 2024 filing highlights that unfavorable currency exchange rate movements would 'adversely affect the reported performance' of the international segment and notes that such fluctuations have already impacted results. This represents a shift from one-time strategic write-offs in 2022 to sustained financial risk from macroeconomic factors by 2024.",

In fiscal 2022, the company noted that currency exchange rate fluctuations had a material impact on its reported results of operations, particularly for its Walmart International segment, which generated approximately 18% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025. By fiscal 2024, the company reiterated similar concerns, emphasizing that fluctuations in exchange rates could lead to adverse period-over-period changes in financial performance and increase the cost of goods sold, potentially reducing gross profit. Additionally, the company highlighted the complexity of managing these risks due to the global nature of its operations and the need to comply with evolving tax and regulatory environments in multiple jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's financial exposure related to its Compute & Networking segment evolve between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of goodwill and warranty liabilities?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA reported an increase in goodwill of $143 million assigned to the Compute & Networking segment due to acquisitions, bringing the total goodwill for that segment to $3.99 billion as of January 30, 2022. In contrast, by fiscal year 2023, the company noted that additions to product warranty liabilities primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment, indicating a growing financial exposure tied to product warranties rather than acquisition-related goodwill. This shift suggests a transition in the nature of financial commitments associated with the segment, from acquisition-driven asset valuation to operational liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced a significant increase in goodwill, primarily due to the 2020 acquisition of Mellanox Technologies, which allocated $3.43 billion in goodwill to this segment. In terms of warranty liabilities, additions in fiscal year 2023 (primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment) rose to $278 million, compared to $145 million in 2022, leading to an increase in the ending warranty liability from $82 million in 2022 to $306 million in 2023.",

      "question": "How has the nature and extent of McDonald's brand licensing arrangements evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its description and associated financial implications?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements were described as a component of 'Other revenues' and were specifically tied to marketing and selling consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand. The 2023 filing also mentioned that the company provided an 'insignificant amount' of assistance, including royalty relief, to certain franchisees impacted by the war in the Middle East. By 2024, the description of brand licensing remained consistent as part of 'Other revenues,' but the company noted it provided only an 'immaterial amount' of assistance, including royalty relief or deferral of cash collection for certain franchisees. This indicates a slight evolution in the framing of financial assistance, suggesting a minor reduction in support or a shift in how the company assessed the materiality of such aid in the context of global events.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements, particularly those related to consumer packaged goods, showed a significant increase in revenue contribution. In 2024, \"Other revenues\" rose by 34% to $423 million, compared to $316 million in 2023, indicating a substantial financial impact from these arrangements. This growth was driven by increased fees paid by franchisees for brand licensing, reflecting an expanded or more successful utilization of the McDonald's brand in marketing and selling consumer products.",

      "question": "How has the scope and methodology of Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the factors considered and external data sources used for estimating these adjustments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments were influenced by factors such as legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices, unbilled claims, processing time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. The company also emphasized its compliance with the SEC Consent Order, which included procedures for limiting sales to direct customers and estimating inventory levels using internal and external data from U.S. wholesalers. By 2024, the GTN sales adjustments included additional details on external rebate programs in non-U.S. countries, such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing, and pricing claw-backs. The company also expanded its use of external information sources, including third-party market research data and written/oral inventory updates from wholesalers, and highlighted limitations in relying on such third-party estimates and timing lags. This indicates a broader and more detailed approach to GTN adjustments, especially in international markets and data integration.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments have evolved in terms of the factors considered and external data sources used for estimating these adjustments. The methodology now places greater emphasis on external data, including third-party market research data, prescription trends, and patient demand information. Additionally, the company continues to use weekly inventory data from U.S. pharmaceutical wholesalers to estimate months on hand product-level inventories, with the three largest wholesalers accounting for a significant portion of U.S. revenues. For non-U.S. business units, where direct customer inventory information is limited, the company relies on a variety of methods and third-party demand information, although the reliability of such data varies. These enhancements reflect a more comprehensive and data-driven approach to estimating GTN adjustments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola did not mention labor unrest or risks associated with manufacturing facilities impacting net operating revenues. The 2022 filing primarily described how net operating revenues were generated through concentrate and finished product operations, with no explicit mention of labor-related risks. However, in 2023, the company explicitly stated that strikes, work stoppages, or labor unrest at major manufacturing facilities or bottling operations could impair the ability to supply concentrates and syrups, which could reduce net operating revenues and expose the company to customer claims. This represents a new risk factor introduced in 2023 related to labor disruptions affecting revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola's 10-K mentioned labor-related risks, including the potential for strikes, work stoppages, or labor unrest at manufacturing facilities or bottling operations, which could impair supply and reduce net operating revenues. By 2023, the disclosure expanded to emphasize that such labor unrest could not only disrupt operations but also negatively impact the company's reputation and brand image, which in turn could affect consumer acceptance of its products. The 2023 filing also highlighted the potential for labor issues to escalate into broader corporate campaigns supported by labor organizations, adding a reputational risk dimension to the operational and revenue risks mentioned in 2022.",

      "question": "How has Linde plc's income from equity investments evolved between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic positioning in its equity partnerships?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde plc reported income from equity investments at $167 million, while in 2024, this figure increased slightly to $170 million on a reported basis. Additionally, on an adjusted basis, income from equity investments rose from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024. This indicates a modest growth in returns from equity partnerships over the two years, suggesting that the company's strategic positioning in its equity investments remained stable with slight improvements, despite broader financial changes such as increased interest expense and adjustments in noncontrolling interests.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde plc's income from equity investments increased slightly from $167 million in 2023 to $170 million in 2024, representing a 2% growth. This modest increase suggests stable performance in the company's equity partnerships, indicating that Linde's strategic positioning in these investments remains consistent and contributes positively to its overall financial results.",

      "original_answer": "HD's merchandise inventories increased significantly from $30 million in fiscal 2022 to $110 million in fiscal 2023, representing a $80 million increase. This indicates a strategic shift toward building higher inventory levels, likely in response to supply chain challenges and efforts to 'continue to meet the demand environment' as mentioned in the 2022 filing. The significant increase suggests HD prioritized inventory availability to ensure product supply to customers, even at the cost of higher short-term working capital commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "HD's merchandise inventory levels increased significantly between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, as evidenced by the deferred tax assets related to inventories rising from $30 million in 2022 to $110 million in 2023. This indicates a strategic build-up of inventory to meet customer demand, particularly in response to ongoing supply chain challenges and strong consumer demand. The increase suggests that HD is proactively managing its inventory to ensure product availability and support sales growth.",

      "question": "How has IBM's exposure to pension-related liquidity risk evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of potential incremental pension funding requirements during extended financial market downturns?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM disclosed that during an extended financial market downturn, it could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding, which would pose liquidity risk and negatively impact financial flexibility. In 2024, the company repeated the same language regarding potential incremental pension funding requirements under similar conditions, indicating no substantive change in its exposure to pension-related liquidity risk. While the qualitative risk remained consistent, there is no explicit quantitative disclosure in either year that indicates a change in the magnitude of potential funding obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, IBM's exposure to pension-related liquidity risk has remained consistent in terms of potential incremental pension funding requirements during extended financial market downturns. Both years highlight that adverse financial market conditions could reduce the value of pension trust assets and increase estimated pension liabilities, potentially requiring IBM to provide additional funding. This could negatively impact the company's financial flexibility. However, no material adverse effects have been reported, and the 2024 filing reiterates the same risk factors as in 2023, indicating no significant change in the nature or magnitude of the risk.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, McDonald's highlighted Systemwide Sales as a key component of its 'Accelerating the Arches' growth strategy, emphasizing its dependence on the success of this metric to drive business growth, particularly through digital transformation, delivery, and restaurant development. However, in 2024, the company expanded its disclosure by formally integrating Systemwide Sales into its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), providing a detailed definition and linking it directly to franchisee health, loyalty programs, and as a driver of franchised revenues. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from merely setting goals around Systemwide Sales (2023) to institutionalizing its measurement and transparency (2024), reflecting a more mature and data-driven approach to managing and leveraging system performance.",
      "llm_answer": "McDonald's increased the prominence and specificity of its disclosure regarding Systemwide Sales in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting a strategic emphasis on growth and operational performance. In 2023, the discussion of Systemwide Sales was embedded within broader operational and financial metrics without dedicated emphasis. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed explanation of how Systemwide Sales are measured, including its relevance to franchisee performance and the Company’s financial health. This shift indicates a stronger strategic focus on leveraging Systemwide Sales as a key performance indicator to drive growth, enhance brand relevance, and align with long-term financial objectives under the \"Accelerating the Arches\" strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022-2023 period, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia decreased by $377 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, and when net of foreign currency fluctuations, the decrease was minimal at $5 million. This was driven by declines in annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by higher premiums in Korea. In contrast, for 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $212 million, or 3%, compared to 2023, but net of foreign currency fluctuations, there was an increase of $149 million, or 2%, driven by growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products. Thus, while the reported revenue decline slowed from 5% to 3%, the underlying performance net of currency effects improved significantly, shifting from a slight $5 million decline to a $149 million increase.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022-2023 and 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia decreased by 5% (from $7,346 million in 2022 to $6,969 million in 2023) and further by 3% (to $6,757 million in 2024). On a constant currency basis, the decline was minimal in 2022-2023 (-$5 million) but turned into a 2% increase in 2023-2024 ($149 million). The key difference in foreign currency impact was that in 2022-2023, weakening Japanese yen, Korean won, and Australian dollar reduced revenues, while in 2023-2024, the Japanese yen and Korean won weakened further against the U.S. dollar, but the impact was partially offset by growth in fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, Humira's global sales increased by 4% in 2021, with U.S. sales rising 8% due to market growth across all indications, though international sales declined 13% due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are highlighted as gaining market share and contributing to revenue growth, with Rinvoq benefiting from expanded regulatory approvals. By the 2024 filing, while no specific sales figures are provided, Humira is described in a broader product overview context without mention of growth metrics, and Skyrizi and Rinvoq are not explicitly referenced. This suggests a shift in strategic emphasis toward the broader immunology portfolio, likely in response to biosimilar pressures on Humira.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Humira's strategic positioning has faced increasing pressure from newer immunology products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as biosimilar competition. In 2022, Humira sales grew 4% globally, with U.S. sales rising 8% due to market growth, but international sales fell 13% due to biosimilar competition. By 2024, Skyrizi and Rinvoq continued to gain market share, with Rinvoq expanding into additional indications such as atopic dermatitis and ankylosing spondylitis. This growth of newer, targeted therapies highlights a shift in the competitive landscape, with Humira's dominance being challenged by both biosimilars and innovative products offering potentially better efficacy or convenience.",

By 2024, LLY provided a detailed breakdown of the asset classes for these plans, showing that public equity securities (U.S. and International) totaled $216.9 million and private alternative investments, including hedge funds ($281.2 million) and equity-like funds ($335.1 million), accounted for a combined total of $616.3 million. This evolution indicates a shift toward more granular and transparent disclosure about the asset composition of the retiree health benefit plans.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, LLY's disclosure on the composition of assets in its retiree health benefit plans showed a shift in allocations. In 2022, the U.S. and Puerto Rico plans were allocated approximately 80% to growth investments and 20% to fixed-income investments. By 2024, the growth investment allocation remained at 80%, but the breakdown within growth investments showed a slight increase in public equity securities and a corresponding decrease in private alternative investments. Specifically, public equity securities increased from $127.0 million in 2022 to $184.2 million in 2024, while private alternative investments, such as hedge funds and equity-like funds, decreased from $616.3 million in 2022 to $631.3 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX recognized revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis for substantially all defense contracts, primarily related to the Raytheon segment, using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. This approach was also applied to certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. By 2024, the company continued to use the percentage-of-completion method for defense contracts within Raytheon but expanded the explanation to include more nuanced treatment of variable consideration and performance obligations spanning multiple phases of the product life-cycle, such as production, maintenance, and support. Additionally, in 2024, RTX emphasized the allocation of transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices, which was not explicitly detailed in 2023. This indicates a more structured and granular approach to revenue recognition for long-term contracts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue recognition methodology for long-term aerospace contracts within the Raytheon segment remained largely consistent between 2023 and 2024, with performance obligations primarily satisfied over time due to the continuous transfer of control to customers. Revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis, typically using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. In 2024, specific events such as the restart of work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and the termination of a fixed-price development contract impacted revenue recognition, but the core methodology remained unchanged.",

In 2024, while the mention of brand licensing arrangements remained, the specific reference to consumer packaged goods was omitted from the description of revenue sources, suggesting a reduced emphasis or potential reclassification of this revenue stream. This evolution indicates a subtle shift in how the company is presenting its revenue sources, even though the overall structure remains largely franchising-focused.",

In both years, CPG sales were included in \"Other revenues,\" which accounted for a small portion of total revenues. In 2023, Other revenues were $316 million, representing a 4% decrease from 2022, while in 2024, Other revenues increased by 34% to $423 million. This increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher fees from brand licensing arrangements for consumer packaged goods, indicating a modest growth in the contribution of CPG sales to McDonald's overall revenue structure.",

By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income and total CAS pension cost, indicating a shift from expense to income in the service cost component under FAS. This evolution suggests a favorable change in the company's pension adjustment dynamics, with CAS pension cost now exceeding the service cost component of FAS pension income to a greater extent than in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment (the difference between CAS pension cost and the service cost component of FAS pension income) decreased from $1,709 million in 2022 to $1,660 million in 2023. This decline reflects a reduction in the favorable adjustment resulting from the CAS pension cost exceeding the service cost component of FAS pension income. Additionally, non-service FAS pension income increased significantly from a $971 million expense in 2022 to $443 million income in 2023, primarily due to the absence of the large noncash pension settlement charge recorded in 2022.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through effective pricing strategies aligned with historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant turnaround from a substantial decline to a modest increase within one fiscal year.",

By 2024, RTX provided more detailed financial disclosures, reporting that exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $3.3 billion at year-end, with remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, at approximately $5.5 billion. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely amortization-life-based disclosure to a more comprehensive valuation approach that includes forward-looking financial commitments and impairment assessments tied to the success of underlying aircraft platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "RTX's treatment and valuation of exclusivity assets between 2023 and 2024 show a notable increase in both the net carrying value and financial commitments. As of December 31, 2024, exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.3 billion, with remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, reaching $5.5 billion. This reflects an increase in commitments compared to 2023, where exclusivity assets were not explicitly quantified. Amortization assumptions for these assets are based on the pattern of economic benefits, often aligning with the development and production cycles of the aircraft platforms. The amortization period for exclusivity assets ranges from 5 to 25 years, with no amortization typically during the development phase, beginning as programs enter full-rate production and aftermarket cycles.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $8,024 million in 2023 to $8,635 million in 2024. This growth was driven by an increase in Segment Operating Profit from $9,070 million to $9,720 million. However, the reconciling items, including Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges, increased from $40 million in 2023 to $145 million in 2024, which partially offset the gains. The Purchase Accounting Impacts from Linde AG decreased from $1,006 million in 2023 to $940 million in 2024, contributing positively to the overall operating profit trend.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $8,024 million in 2023 to $8,635 million in 2024, representing a 7.6% growth. This increase was driven by higher segment operating profit, which rose from $9,070 million to $9,720 million, primarily due to improved performance in the Americas (+7%), EMEA (+12%), and APAC (+6%) segments, which benefited from higher pricing and productivity initiatives. However, the Engineering segment saw a 16% decline in operating profit due to the absence of prior-year benefits from project wind-downs in Russia. Reconciling items, such as cost reduction program charges and purchase accounting impacts, had a smaller negative effect compared to the prior year, contributing to the overall profit growth.",

This indicates a reversal in trend, with a net reduction of $9,182 million between 2023 and 2024. Specific components contributing to this decline include the 2014 Notes, which decreased from $4,000 million in 2022 to $2,750 million in 2024, the 2017 Notes dropping from $16,000 million in 2022 to $13,000 million in 2024, and the 2021 Notes declining from $18,500 million in 2022 to $15,000 million in 2024. Additionally, the April 2022 Notes issuance of $12.8 billion decreased to $11,250 million by 2024, and the December 2022 Notes issuance of $8.3 billion dropped to $7,000 million by 2024.

      "llm_answer": "The total face value of Amazon's long-term debt decreased from $67.182 billion in 2023 to $58.0 billion in 2024. This reduction was primarily driven by repayments and maturities of existing debt, including the 2014, 2017, 2020, and 2021 Notes, as well as the termination of the secured revolving credit facility. Additionally, Amazon issued new debt in 2022 and 2023 but repaid or refinanced portions of it in 2024, contributing to the overall decline in the total face value of long-term debt.",

In 2023, these figures increased to $161 million for Series B and $20 million for Series C. This indicates that the recovery mechanism became more effective for both series, particularly for Series C where the increase was more pronounced (from $6 million to $20 million). The upward trend suggests improvements in how the recovery mechanism responded to market conditions or structural changes in the instruments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, foreign currency contracts positively impacted net operating revenues by $6 million, indicating a minor beneficial effect from currency fluctuations. In contrast, 2023 disclosures highlighted potential negative impacts on net operating revenues from labor-related risks, such as strikes or work stoppages, and consumer-related risks, including shifting preferences and health concerns around sweetened beverages. These represent a shift from direct financial instrument impacts to operational and market-based risks affecting revenues.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022, the primary factor affecting net operating revenues was foreign currency contract impacts, as highlighted by the use of forward contracts and foreign currency denominated debt to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates, with significant gains and losses recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI). In contrast, in 2023, labor and consumer-related risks became more prominent, including challenges in attracting and retaining a skilled workforce, increased labor costs due to collective bargaining issues, and evolving consumer preferences driven by health and wellness concerns. These factors directly influenced operational costs and consumer demand, impacting net operating revenues differently than the foreign currency-related impacts in 2022.",

In 2023, this treatment remained consistent, but the disclosure provided a more detailed breakdown of how service and non-service components were allocated across different benefit plans, including retiree medical and life insurance plans.

This signaled a strategic intent to reduce or restructure parts of the Collins segment. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted toward operational transparency and financial reporting detail, particularly around revenue recognition for long-term aerospace contracts within Collins. The 2024 filing elaborates on the use of percentage-of-completion accounting for these contracts, including the use of incurred costs relative to total estimated costs as a progress metric. This shift indicates a strategic pivot from restructuring through divestiture to enhancing financial disclosure and operational clarity around key performance metrics in the Collins segment.",

Additionally, in 2024, Collins experienced impairment charges related to a contract cancellation and alternative titanium sourcing, indicating a shift in resource allocation and strategic priorities. Regarding transparency in long-term aerospace contract accounting, RTX provided detailed disclosures on revenue recognition practices, including performance obligations and variable consideration estimates, particularly for long-term maintenance contracts in the Collins segment.",

By 2024, this amount had decreased significantly to $89 million. This indicates a sharp decline in Amazon's reliance on build-to-suit leases for property investments over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Amazon's investment in build-to-suit lease arrangements significantly declined from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company added $3.2 billion in property and equipment under these arrangements, whereas in 2023, this amount dropped to $356 million, and further decreased to $89 million in 2024. This indicates a substantial reduction in Amazon's use of build-to-suit lease arrangements over the three-year period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AbbVie had interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 (referencing 2021 data as the most recent in the 2022 filing), aimed at converting floating-rate interest obligations to fixed rates. By 2024, these contracts had matured in November 2022 and were not renewed, indicating a discontinuation of this specific strategy for managing floating-rate debt. This reflects a strategic shift away from hedging floating-rate obligations through cash flow hedges during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AbbVie's use of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges decreased significantly, from notional amounts totaling $2.3 billion in 2022 to $750 million in 2023, and no such contracts were reported in 2024. This decline suggests that AbbVie has reduced its exposure to floating-rate interest obligations and is increasingly managing its interest rate risk through fixed-rate debt or other strategies. The company's shift away from cash flow hedges indicates a more stable and predictable interest cost structure, likely through refinancing floating-rate debt into fixed-rate instruments or reducing reliance on variable-rate financing.",

By 2024, the company reported a total fair value of $2,580.3 million for Retiree Health Benefit Plans, with significant allocations across public equity securities, fixed income, and private alternative investments.

As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Retiree Health Benefit Plan assets was $2,565.8 million, compared to $2,580.3 million as of December 31, 2023.

By 2024, the segment experienced a 33% revenue decline, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion in 2024, attributed to customer inventory normalization. Additionally, while the 2023 report emphasized the segment’s strategic importance and product breadth, the 2024 report noted a shift in focus toward Data Center and Client segments as the primary growth drivers, indicating a relative de-emphasis of the Embedded segment in AMD’s strategic narrative.",

Strategically, AMD continued to focus on expanding its adaptive computing portfolio, as evidenced by the launch of the Versal™ Series Gen 2 devices, which integrate preprocessing, AI inference, and postprocessing capabilities for AI-driven embedded systems.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment was the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost, with a favorable adjustment occurring when CAS pension cost exceeded the service cost component. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (rather than expense) and total CAS pension cost, signaling a shift from an expense to income position under FAS. This reflects a notable evolution in the financial impact of pension accounting differences over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment decreased from $1,709 million to $1,660 million, reflecting a narrowing of the favorable difference between CAS pension costs (recovered through U.S. Government contracts) and the service cost component of FAS pension income. This adjustment remained positive in both years, indicating CAS pension costs continued to exceed the service cost component of FAS pension income, but the magnitude of the favorable adjustment slightly declined in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts. This represents a significant turnaround from a decline in 2023 to an increase in 2024, indicating an evolution in gross margin performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points between fiscal 2023 (23.5%) and fiscal 2024 (23.7%). The key factors contributing to this improvement included better price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps in the Walmart U.S. segment and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year. These factors were partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, the decline in the gross profit rate in fiscal 2023 was driven by markdowns, merchandise mix, higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges.",

      "question": "What does the shift in AWS asset-related financial impacts from 2022 to 2024 indicate about Amazon's evolving approach to capital expenditure management in its cloud business?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS was not significantly impacted by asset-related charges, as impairments and severance costs primarily affected the North America segment, with AWS assets described as consisting mainly of property and equipment and accounts receivable. By 2024, AWS became the primary beneficiary of a strategic change in the useful life assumptions for server and networking equipment, resulting in a $3.2 billion reduction in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.5 billion benefit to net income. This indicates a shift toward optimizing capital efficiency in AWS infrastructure, moving from passive asset ownership to active lifecycle management to enhance financial performance in cloud operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in AWS asset-related financial impacts from 2022 to 2024 indicates that Amazon is adapting its capital expenditure management in response to rapid technological advancements, particularly in AI and machine learning. In 2022, AWS focused on depreciation and impairments tied to older infrastructure, while in 2024, the company adjusted asset useful lives and accelerated depreciation for certain servers and networking equipment. This reflects a more dynamic and forward-looking approach to capital allocation, prioritizing modernization and efficiency in its cloud infrastructure to support evolving customer demands and technological innovation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Visa provided detailed quantitative breakdowns of Total Nominal Volume, including specific dollar amounts for consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial categories across U.S. and international segments, along with percentage changes year-over-year (e.g., Total Nominal Volume was $12,530 billion in 2022, up 11% from $11,334 billion in 2021). In 2023, while Visa continued to define Total Nominal Volume, it did not disclose updated dollar figures or comparative data. Instead, the focus shifted to qualitative disclosures, such as the relationship between service revenue and prior-quarter nominal payments volume, and explanations of data sources and potential updates. This represents a shift from quantitative transparency to methodological explanation without updated volume figures.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Visa's disclosure and treatment of Total Nominal Volume became more detailed and transparent. In 2022, the reporting included nominal payments volume and cash volume, with breakdowns by U.S. and international regions and categories such as consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial. However, the 2022 disclosures did not explicitly mention the inclusion of consumer prepaid and Interlink volume in the nominal payments volume. \n\nIn 2023, Visa enhanced transparency by explicitly stating that consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume were included in the nominal payments volume. Additionally, the 2023 disclosures provided more detailed explanations of the components of total nominal volume, including definitions of cash volume and the methodology for calculating nominal payments volume using U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates. This evolution reflects an improved reporting methodology and greater clarity for stakeholders.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company anticipated that its cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services would be consistent with past levels relative to revenues. By 2024, the company disclosed that it had entered into agreements that could require payments of up to $14 billion if specified amounts of goods or services, primarily related to incretin medicines, are not purchased over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years. This indicates a significant shift from a stable outlook to a much larger financial commitment tied to supply agreements, driven by expansion in manufacturing capacity and contract manufacturing arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's anticipated cash requirements related to purchases of goods and services have remained consistent relative to revenue levels from 2022 to 2024. In 2024, the company stated that these requirements were in line with past levels, and no significant changes were indicated compared to 2022. Factors contributing to this stability include consistent operational needs for producing products and conducting business, as well as no material changes in the nature of these purchases. Additionally, the company's liquidity and capital resources have supported these consistent cash requirements.",

      "llm_answer": "Apple's net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days increased from $0 in 2023 to $0 in 2024, indicating no activity in this category during both periods.

In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that it was evaluating the impact of new segment reporting standards (ASU 2023-07), which required expanded segment disclosures including segment expenses and interim reporting of segment profit or loss and assets. Additionally, RTX announced the planned sale of its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within the Raytheon segment for approximately $1.3 billion, with related assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. By 2024, RTX provided detailed revenue recognition practices for its Raytheon segment, emphasizing that substantially all defense business revenue is recognized over time using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This reflects a shift from preparatory disclosures about upcoming standards to concrete implementation of those standards and more transparent reporting of performance obligations and contract accounting practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX's Raytheon segment experienced notable changes in its financial disclosures and contract revenue recognition practices. In 2024, the segment recognized a $102 million net operating profit benefit due to resuming work on certain Middle East contracts after securing critical licenses and regulatory approvals. Additionally, a $575 million charge was recognized in the second quarter of 2024 due to the termination of a fixed-price development contract with a foreign customer, which was settled by the end of 2024. These events reflect increased volatility in contract recognition and adjustments to reserves and provisions. Overall, the Raytheon segment's financial disclosures in 2024 highlight a shift in contract activity, including both restarts and terminations, impacting its operating profit significantly compared to 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron reported 'Taxes other than on income' at $4,032 million. By 2024, this figure had increased to $4,716 million, representing a growth of $684 million. The increase in 2024 was primarily attributed to higher excise and property taxes, indicating a growing burden of non-income tax obligations over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's \"Taxes other than on income\" increased from $4,032 million in 2022 to $4,220 million in 2023 and further to $4,716 million in 2024. The primary factors contributing to this increase were higher excise and property taxes in 2024 compared to the prior years. Additionally, in 2023, the increase was partly driven by similar factors, though the rise was less pronounced compared to 2024.",

      "question": "How did Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in DCAI evolve between 2023 and 2024 to reverse the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics into a growth trend?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing hyperscaler purchasing power, internal semiconductor development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware in cloud services, which made it harder to differentiate products and led to order volatility. These factors eroded Intel's competitive position and adversely affected DCAI results. However, in 2024, Intel reversed this trend by focusing on high core count server products that increased average selling prices (ASPs), despite lower volume. This strategic shift in product mix, aimed at optimizing for performance and customization needs of cloud service providers, contributed to a 1% increase in DCAI revenue year-over-year. The internal foundry operating model also took effect in 2024, aiming to improve cost efficiency and product competitiveness, which likely supported this strategic pivot.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in the Data Center and AI (DCAI) segment evolved by focusing on heterogeneous compute solutions and expanding its AI offerings. Intel emphasized workload-optimized performance through a combination of CPUs, accelerators, and software, including the launch of Intel Xeon 6 processors and Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerators. Additionally, the company prioritized system-level integration, leveraging technologies like Intel AMX and Intel SGX to enhance performance and security. These strategic moves helped Intel address hyperscaler dynamics and reverse the negative revenue impact into a growth trend by better aligning with the high-growth AI and data center markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NFLX reported total content obligations of $23,161,360, with $10,019,306 due in the next 12 months and $13,142,054 beyond that period. By 2024, while no direct numerical update was provided, the company disclosed qualitative changes in how it accounts for content obligations, including more nuanced treatment of non-cancelable commitments, licensing of future titles, and obligations tied to creative talent agreements. This indicates a shift from purely quantitative disclosure to a more strategic and forward-looking explanation of content liabilities, suggesting increased complexity in content acquisition and production planning.",
      "llm_answer": "NFLX's content obligations increased from $21.7 billion in 2023 to $23.2 billion in 2024, with a notable rise in obligations not yet recognized on the balance sheet, from $14.6 billion to $17.0 billion. This indicates a continued aggressive strategy in content acquisition and production, particularly in original content, requiring significant upfront investments. The increase also suggests a growing commitment to long-term content deals and productions, reflecting NFLX's focus on expanding its global content library to maintain competitive advantage and subscriber growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Amazon highlighted the general uncertainty in tax accruals due to the complexity of tax laws, audits, and controversies across jurisdictions, but did not specify any particular high-profile dispute. By 2024, the company disclosed a specific ongoing tax dispute with the Indian tax authority over cloud services fees, where the authority asserts that such fees are subject to tax in India. Amazon is contesting this, but an adverse outcome could result in additional payments for both current and prior periods. This evolution shows a shift from a more general risk disclosure to a concrete example of a material tax controversy affecting accrual adequacy.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon's disclosure regarding the adequacy of its tax accruals has highlighted an increasing complexity and uncertainty in its tax environment. In 2022, Amazon noted that its tax accruals were influenced by factors such as changes in tax laws, regulations, and interpretations, as well as the proliferation of unilateral tax measures targeting online commerce. It also mentioned the Indian tax authority's assertion that tax applies to cloud services fees paid to Amazon in the U.S., which it was contesting. By 2024, Amazon expanded on these uncertainties, emphasizing the evolving global tax framework, the adoption of global minimum taxes, and the potential for retroactive tax liabilities due to non-compliance with new reporting or collection obligations. The disclosures also reflected a continued acknowledgment of tax controversies and the potential for material differences between expected outcomes and actual results of audits or investigations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities was $5.1 billion, and it was influenced by higher estimated Skyrizi sales driven by stronger market share uptake, the passage of time, and lower discount rates. In 2024, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities was $3.8 billion, reflecting higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. This indicates that while Skyrizi sales continued to positively influence the fair value change in 2024, the impact of higher discount rates began to constrain the overall increase compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The estimated sales of Skyrizi positively impacted the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities between 2023 and 2024. In 2024, the change in fair value reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. In 2023, the change in fair value was driven by higher estimated Skyrizi sales due to stronger market share uptake, the passage of time, and lower discount rates.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, patient assistance program costs were a key component of sales rebate and discount accruals, with a 5% change in the consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability impacting revenue by approximately $615 million. By 2024, these costs remained a significant part of the accruals, but the company emphasized a more structured expected value approach to estimate these liabilities. This evolution suggests an increased focus on precision in financial exposure management related to patient assistance programs.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the role and estimation methodology of patient assistance program (PAP) costs in revenue recognition remained consistent, with both years disclosing that PAP costs are estimated as a percentage of historical sales and incorporated into the transaction price at the time of sale. However, in 2024, there was a slight expansion in the detail provided, emphasizing the use of an expected value approach and the inclusion of PAP costs among the largest rebate and discount categories. This consistency in methodology suggests that the company maintains a stable and predictable process for accounting for PAP costs, indicating limited financial exposure volatility. Nevertheless, the materiality of these costs—particularly as a component of U.S. revenue—highlights ongoing exposure to changes in PAP participation rates or program terms.",

      "question": "How did the shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024 reflect changes in Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in the data center market?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024, with a 1% increase driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, reflects Intel's strategic focus on enhancing its competitive positioning in the data center market through workload-optimized solutions and heterogeneous compute offerings. This includes expanding its portfolio with AI accelerators like the Intel Gaudi series and leveraging its Intel Xeon processor ecosystem to address growing demand for AI, security, and high-performance computing workloads. However, the competitive environment remains intense, with customer spending shifting toward GPUs and increased competition from companies like AMD and NVIDIA, which impacted DCAI's market share and ASPs in prior years. Intel's product strategy emphasizes innovation in AI acceleration and system-level integration to differentiate its offerings and regain competitiveness.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed that cost pass-through contributed positively to sales growth, accounting for a 2% change in sales variance. By 2023, the company emphasized that its long-term contracts provided not only cash flow stability but also the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, indicating a strategic reinforcement of this mechanism. This shows that cost pass-through evolved from being a minor contributing factor to a more integral and positively framed component of Linde’s contractual and pricing strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Linde's approach to cost pass-through shifted from being a positive contributor to sales in 2022 to a negative factor in 2023. In 2022, cost pass-through had a neutral or positive impact, while in 2023, it decreased sales by 3%. This change reflects a more challenging environment for passing energy cost variances to customers, particularly for onsite customers, which affected sales but had minimal impact on operating profit. Linde's contractual strategy appears to have adapted to maintain profitability despite this headwind.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, vendor allowances—primarily volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances—were described as reducing the carrying cost of inventory and were recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory was sold. These allowances were accrued as earned, particularly those tied to purchase levels, over the incentive period. By 2023, the focus shifted to the net presentation of inventory cost, which included acquisition costs, freight, and import costs, but was stated to be net of certain vendor allowances. This indicates a more direct impact on inventory valuation in 2023, where vendor allowances were factored into the gross inventory value before applying the lower of cost or market (LCM) or net realizable value (NRV) tests. The change reflects a more integrated treatment of vendor allowances in inventory valuation in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the treatment and impact of vendor allowances on inventory valuation remained consistent. Vendor allowances, primarily volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances, continued to reduce the carrying cost of inventory and were recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory was sold.

By 2024, the description remained consistent, emphasizing that the unrealized mark-to-market impact of non-qualifying hedges continued to cause earnings volatility, with the same mechanism of economic offset through unmarked physical assets. While the qualitative description remained stable, the continued emphasis on 'could be significant' in both years indicates that the financial impact of the non-qualifying hedge category remained material and volatile, with no explicit quantitative change provided.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of the non-qualifying hedge category on NEE's earnings volatility from 2023 to 2024 has remained significant due to the economic offset mechanism involving physical asset positions. Changes in the fair value of non-qualifying hedges are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, creating earnings volatility. These changes are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category when calculating adjusted earnings and could significantly affect NEER's results because the economic offsets to these positions—such as related physical asset positions—are not marked to market under GAAP. As a result, NEE's net income reflects only one side of the economically linked transactions, leading to potential volatility.

However, while the 2023 disclosure framed this as a new charge impacting the 2024 tax rate compared to 2023, the 2024 disclosure reflects that this charge had fully materialized and remained a key factor in maintaining a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. Thus, the nature of the charge itself did not change, but its impact transitioned from being prospective in 2023 to realized in 2024.",

In 2024, Apple's effective tax rate was 24.1%, up from 14.7% in 2023, primarily due to a $10.2 billion net one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss, with actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits being recognized in connection with annual remeasurement and amortization. By 2023, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these plans were specifically recorded as part of the 'other non-operating income (expense), net' account on the consolidated statements of earnings, indicating a more explicit financial statement recognition of these costs.",

In contrast, in 2022, these non-service components were also recorded in the \"other non-operating income (expense), net\" account, with no change in presentation between the two years.",

      "original_answer": "Walmart's operating income rate as a percentage of net sales decreased by 120 basis points in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and reorganization in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, the operating income rate increased by 83 basis points in fiscal 2024, driven by lapping those prior-year charges and improvements in business performance. This represents a significant turnaround in the company's operating income trajectory.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating income rate as a percentage of net sales increased from 4.2% in fiscal 2023 to 4.4% in fiscal 2024. The key factors behind this change were a higher gross profit rate, driven by Walmart U.S. managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, as well as a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the absence of prior-year charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and restructuring costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron's disclosures around Properties, Plant and Equipment were primarily limited to listing the note reference in the financial statements without detailed discussion of impairment triggers or sensitivity. By 2024, the company significantly expanded its disclosure, providing a detailed explanation of the impairment assessment process, including specific triggering events such as downward revisions in reserves, changes in commodity price outlook, and regulatory shifts related to environmental laws. The 2024 filing also elaborated on the complexity of sensitivity analyses due to the large number of assumptions involved, such as carbon costs, production profiles, and the pace of the energy transition—factors not explicitly highlighted in 2022. This represents a transformation in the depth and specificity of impairment-related disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's treatment and disclosure of impairments related to Properties, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) from 2022 to 2024 show a consistent approach, with a focus on evaluating recoverability based on future undiscounted cash flows and incorporating factors such as commodity prices, operating costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes. In 2024, the company emphasized that impairment assessments are triggered by events like significant downward revisions to reserves or price outlooks, as well as changes in environmental regulations. The sensitivity of impairment calculations remains high due to the numerous assumptions involved, and the company noted that changes in these assumptions could lead to additional impairments or avoid them, though a detailed sensitivity analysis is not practicable due to the complexity and breadth of its assets.",

By 2024, the company continued to disclose its streaming revenues in detail, noting that foreign exchange hedging activities had a direct impact on revenue figures, with hedging gains of $124 million specifically included in 'Streaming revenues' for that year.

This evolution reflects a worsening financial outlook for expansion efforts due to both external market pressures and internal asset devaluations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMT's financial outlook for future growth and expansion initiatives became more cautious due to evolving liquidity risks and impairment charges. In 2023, AMT recorded a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for its India reporting unit, driven by indications of value from third parties and strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of equity interests. Additionally, rising inflation, higher interest rates, and increased costs of capital created challenges in maintaining returns and accessing financing, which could limit AMT's ability to fund growth initiatives. These factors, along with the risks associated with strategic partnerships and divestitures, contributed to a more uncertain financial outlook compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, variable rebates and incentives were described as being tied to customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds and were recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when volume- and transaction-based revenues were recognized. By 2024, these variable rebates and incentives had grown in importance, representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue. Additionally, the 2024 filing highlights that the estimation of variable rebates involves significant management judgment based on forecasted transactions, card issuance, and conversion volumes, leading to increased auditor scrutiny and classification as a critical audit matter. This indicates a transformation in both the scale and complexity of how variable rebates and incentives are managed and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, variable rebates and incentives have remained a significant contra-revenue item for Mastercard, with their impact on net revenue increasing from $10,961 million in 2022 to $10,961 million in 2024 (based on 2024 disclosures indicating they remain a portion of $28.2 billion net revenue). The level of management judgment required has also increased, as these rebates are estimated based on customer performance metrics like volume thresholds, requiring complex and subjective assessments. In 2024, these estimates were explicitly identified as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of judgment and the need for rigorous auditor evaluation of the reasonableness of management's assumptions.",

In 2023, this figure decreased by $64 million, or 12%, resulting in an operating profit of $409 million. This decline was primarily driven by lower sales, including the impact of terminated or suspended projects in Russia, which accounted for approximately $894 million in sales in 2022 and only $238 million in 2023.

In 2023, the adjustment stemmed from a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This geographic shift—from an internal restructuring event in the U.S. (Cruise) to a regional tax realization in Korea—suggests GM strengthened its international tax position, particularly in Asia, while stabilizing its domestic tax asset base.",

In 2022, the primary adjustments were related to tax benefits from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation, while in 2023, the adjustments were primarily driven by the release of a valuation allowance in Korea. This shift suggests that GM's international tax positioning became more favorable in 2023, particularly in Korea, indicating improved confidence in the realizability of deferred tax assets in that region compared to previous years.",

      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Right-of-Use (ROU) lease assets increased from $390 million in 2023 to $599 million in 2024, indicating a significant expansion in the company's leasing activities, particularly for operating leases. This growth suggests a strategic shift or increased reliance on leasing for real estate and operational needs, such as office spaces and data centers, rather than purchasing these assets outright.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company considered historical rebate payments, patient assistance program costs by product as a percentage of historical sales, and evaluated current contracts, sales trends, and product pricing when estimating rebate accruals. By 2024, while historical rebate payments remained a key input, the estimation methodology evolved to include an 'expected value approach' for accruals, and the company expanded its consideration to include government rebate budget forecasts in large European countries, reflecting a more nuanced and diversified evaluation process.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the role of historical rebate payments in estimating sales rebate accruals remained significant but was complemented by a broader set of factors. In both years, historical rebate payments were a key input for estimating accruals, particularly for managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs. However, in 2024, the estimation process explicitly emphasized additional factors such as current contract terms, sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), product pricing, and the percentage of products sold through these programs. This evolution reflects a more dynamic and forward-looking approach to accrual estimation, incorporating both historical data and real-time contextual changes.",

In contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1%, driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs but lowered volume compared to 2023. This shift indicates a stabilization and slight recovery in DCAI's performance, supported by a strategic focus on higher-value offerings despite ongoing volume challenges.",

The key driver behind this increase was higher variable pay relative to the prior year, which was a result of the company exceeding its planned performance.

      "original_answer": "The 309% increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders from $3,231 million in 2022 to $13,219 million in 2023 was primarily driven by a significant non-recurring gain or adjustment not reflected in earnings from continuing operations. While earnings from continuing operations increased modestly by 21% (from $1,886 million to $2,286 million), the net earnings figure spiked due to an additional $9,988 million gain or adjustment, as evidenced by the large discrepancy between earnings from continuing operations and net earnings in 2023. This suggests a one-time event or accounting adjustment specific to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The 309% increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by a one-time pretax gain of approximately $10 billion (approximately $8 billion after-tax) from the sale of a majority stake in Emerson's Climate Technologies business to Blackstone. This gain significantly boosted net earnings for 2023. In contrast, earnings from continuing operations declined by 29% during the same period due to purchase accounting impacts from the National Instruments acquisition, higher restructuring charges, and the loss on the sale of the Copeland note receivable. Thus, the increase in net earnings was largely due to a discrete gain from a divestiture, while continuing operations performed weaker.",

      "original_answer": "Apple's Products Gross Margin percentage increased from 36.5% in 2023 to 37.2% in 2024, reflecting a 0.7 percentage point improvement. In 2023, the increase was attributed to cost savings, partially offset by a different product mix and foreign currency weakness. In 2024, the margin expansion continued despite ongoing mix challenges and currency headwinds, suggesting that cost-saving measures had a sustained impact and potentially more effective mitigation of negative factors.",

By fiscal 2023, the Treasury Stock Balance had significantly increased to $ (95,372) million, with the company repurchasing $ (8,074) million of its common stock during the year.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for pension and postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a $428 million decrease primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and projected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a significant shift from a short-term net benefit expectation to a long-term near-complete reduction in costs, driven by changes in benefit structure and amortization patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, Disney's projected net benefit for postretirement medical costs decreased slightly, from $29 million in fiscal 2022 to $3 million in fiscal 2023. This change was primarily driven by a reduction in amortization of previously deferred losses, partially offset by higher interest costs. Additionally, the discount rate used to determine the fiscal year-end postretirement medical benefit obligation increased from 5.47% in fiscal 2022 to 5.94% in fiscal 2023, which contributed to a lower projected obligation. The amortization of prior-year service costs also shifted from a credit of $0 in fiscal 2022 to a debit of $90 million in fiscal 2023 due to a change in postretirement medical benefit options.",

By 2023, there was no further impact from the Dermstore sale, as no gain was reported either pretax or on a per-share basis.

In 2024, the company's total repayment of matured debt increased to $3,373 million, with specific repayments including $1,500 million in April 2024 and $630 million in December 2024. This indicates a significant increase in the volume of debt repayments in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's total repayment of matured debt decreased from $4,030 million in 2023 to $3,373 million in 2024. This indicates a shift toward a longer-term debt maturity profile, as the company is repaying smaller amounts in the short term, likely due to a strategic focus on extending debt maturities to manage liquidity and reduce refinancing risk.",

      "original_answer": "The interest rate for weighted-average short-term borrowings decreased from 2.8% in 2022 to 0.4% in 2023. However, this decrease occurred alongside a dramatic reduction in the amount of short-term borrowings, which dropped from $1,599 million in 2022 to just $1 million in 2023. Therefore, while the interest rate itself declined significantly, the company's overall exposure to short-term borrowing costs was drastically reduced in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The interest rate for weighted-average short-term borrowings increased from 0.1% in 2022 to 2.8% in 2023. This significant rise in the interest rate indicates that the company faced higher borrowing costs in 2023, likely due to broader market conditions or a shift in the mix of its short-term borrowings. The increase suggests a more expensive short-term borrowing position in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple's effective tax rate was influenced by a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, related to the State Aid Decision, which contributed to a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. In 2024, this same one-time tax charge of $10.2 billion continued to negatively impact the effective tax rate, which remained higher than the statutory rate due to this charge, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation. The magnitude of the tax charge remained unchanged, but its ongoing effect indicates a sustained financial impact from the State Aid Decision.",
      "llm_answer": "The one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision significantly increased Apple's effective tax rate in 2024 compared to 2023. In 2023, Apple's effective tax rate was 14.7%, while in 2024, it rose to 24.1%.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde leveraged its long-term contracts to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, contributing to cash flow stability. By 2023, the company explicitly quantified the impact of cost pass-through in its financial reporting, showing a negative 6% variance in sales growth due to this factor. This indicates that while cost pass-through remained a contractual mechanism, it had a dampening effect on reported sales growth in 2023 compared to the more neutral or supportive role implied in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms had a modest negative impact on sales across its segments. In the Americas, cost pass-through decreased sales by 6%, while in EMEA, it reduced sales by 3%, and in APAC, by 1%. However, the impact on operating profit was minimal in all regions, as higher pricing and productivity initiatives offset the cost inflation. Overall, while cost pass-through mechanisms slightly reduced sales growth, they did not significantly affect profitability, demonstrating Linde's ability to manage cost pressures effectively.",

By 2023, the financial disclosures indicate a shift: while the Asia Theme Parks were still included in the consolidated borrowing figures, the presentation separates borrowings 'Before Asia Theme Parks Consolidation' and shows specific Asia Theme Parks borrowings as distinct. For example, total borrowings including the Asia Theme Parks amounted to $45,101 million in 2023, compared to $43,809 million before including them, indicating a $1,292 million contribution from the Asia Theme Parks. This structured separation suggests a more transparent or modified reporting approach compared to 2022, where the Asia Theme Parks were fully consolidated without such a detailed breakout.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Disney continued to consolidate the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong and Shanghai Disney Resorts) in its financial statements due to its management agreements and significant influence over their operations. In terms of borrowing disclosures, in 2023, Shanghai Disney Resort had borrowings totaling approximately $1.2 billion from Shendi, with an interest rate of 8% and a maturity in 2036, while Hong Kong Disneyland Resort had borrowings of $68 million from HKSAR with a variable rate of three-month HIBOR plus 2%, maturing in September 2025. These borrowings were included in Disney’s consolidated financial statements, reflecting the ongoing financial integration of the Asia Theme Parks.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, PayPal disclosed that TPV growth was directly impacted by the number of payment transactions enabled on its platform, and that transaction revenues were typically correlated with TPV growth. By 2024, PayPal reported TPV increasing from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, a 10% increase. This TPV growth trajectory indicates a positive trend in transaction revenue potential, as TPV is a key driver of transaction fees from merchants. The sustained increase in TPV across the filings suggests that PayPal's platform usage and merchant transaction volume were expanding, which would directly support revenue growth in line with the correlation described in the 2022 filing.",

However, in 2023, the average transaction amount decreased by 1.4%, becoming a drag on comparable sales performance. This shift reveals a change in consumer behavior where shoppers were spending less per visit, potentially due to economic pressures or changes in purchasing habits. Target responded with strategies such as offering 'attractive everyday price points on key items' and 'compelling promotions' to drive traffic, suggesting a shift toward value-oriented pricing to counteract declining transaction sizes.",

This shift reveals that while Target had previously leveraged higher pricing or larger basket sizes to boost sales in 2022, consumer response weakened in 2023, with both traffic and average transaction amounts declining.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Membership and Other Income increased by 7.0% compared to the prior year, and in fiscal 2024, the growth rate rose slightly to 7.5%. Additionally, in fiscal 2024, the income was positively impacted by higher Plus renewals and the expiration of a promotional offering that had offset membership fee increases in the prior year. By fiscal 2024, the dollar value of Membership and Other Income reached $1,408 million, compared to $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a short-term dip but sustained growth trajectory driven by membership base expansion and Plus penetration.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's Membership and Other Income decreased from $1,621 million in fiscal 2023 to $1,408 million in fiscal 2024, indicating a decline in performance during this period. However, by fiscal 2025, it rebounded to $1,478 million, showing a slight recovery. This trend suggests that the company's membership program faced challenges in fiscal 2024, potentially due to external factors or promotional strategies, but showed signs of stabilization and growth in fiscal 2025, likely driven by renewed focus on membership fee income and program enhancements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron attributed effective tax rate volatility primarily to 'mix effects' influenced by the absolute level of earnings or losses and their geographic distribution across tax jurisdictions. The company emphasized that a decline or increase in the effective tax rate might not indicate future results. By 2024, the explanation remained centered on 'mix effects' but placed additional emphasis on the impact of earnings volatility without reiterating the geographic component as explicitly. Instead, the 2024 disclosure focused more broadly on the non-indicative nature of tax rate changes and linked the discussion to broader financial reporting in Note 17 Taxes, signaling a subtle shift in framing from geographic mix to general earnings volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's explanation of factors influencing its effective tax rate volatility between 2022 and 2024 has evolved to emphasize the impact of earnings volatility across jurisdictions with varying tax rates and the introduction of new global tax frameworks like the OECD's Pillar Two. In 2022, the focus was primarily on earnings mix effects and the inherent unpredictability of the effective tax rate during periods of significant earnings changes. By 2024, the company added context about the implementation of the 15% global minimum tax under Pillar Two, noting that while it did not have a material impact in 2024, it is being monitored for future implications. The emphasis shifted to include more specific regulatory developments and their potential influence on the company's tax rate.",

This indicates a growing negative impact of pension obligations on the company's comprehensive income over time.",

By 2024, the company continued to face similar risks but emphasized a more pronounced focus on the complexity of complying with inconsistent international regulations, suggesting that the regulatory environment had become more challenging. This evolution indicates that Apple's exposure to investigatory expenses has increased due to the growing number and severity of global data protection requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's exposure to investigatory expenses related to data protection and privacy compliance has increased from 2023 to 2024, as reflected in the heightened regulatory scrutiny and the implementation of compliance measures in response to evolving laws like the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).

By 2024, total worldwide sales of Humira had declined to $8.993 billion, representing a decrease of 36.9% at constant currency rates compared to 2022. This significant drop in sales follows the expiration of Humira's key patents, which began in 2016 in the U.S. and 2018 in the EU, leading to increased competition from biosimilars and eroding its market exclusivity.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Humira's global sales decreased by 37%, with a 41% decline in the United States and a 13% decline internationally. This significant drop is primarily attributed to the loss of exclusivity in January 2023, which led to direct biosimilar competition. The sales performance indicates that Humira's market position has been substantially weakened following the expiration of its key patents, as biosimilars have eroded its market share and revenue.",

In 2023, the company maintained the same general disclosure but added that these transactions could also result in the company making additional contributions to the pension trust, indicating a more detailed articulation of the financial risks involved. While the core risk remained consistent, the 2023 disclosure expanded on the potential dual impact of additional contributions and noncash charges.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's operating expenses rate increased by 23 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to opioid-related legal settlement charges and restructuring costs in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the operating expenses rate decreased by 60 basis points, driven by the absence of those prior-year charges, particularly the $3.3 billion opioid-related settlements and $0.8 billion restructuring expenses. This represents a significant turnaround in the trend of operating expenses relative to net sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 60 basis points between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, from 21.0% to 20.4%.

By 2024, the cumulative 'Day 2' ongoing impact was being calculated using the same 25% scaling factor, but the phase-in had progressed to 75% phased in by 2024, with full phase-in expected by 2025. This indicates that the capital impact evolved from an initial delayed implementation in 2022 to a more advanced phase-in stage by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The capital impact of the CECL adoption evolved from 2022 to 2024 through a phased-in approach. As of December 31, 2021, the Company added back $2.4 billion to regulatory capital under the CECL Transition Rule, with 25% of this amount phased in during 2022, 50% in 2023, and 75% in 2024. By December 31, 2024, 75% of the impact had been phased in, leaving $600 million to be phased in by January 1, 2025.

By 2024, Intel entered into a Purchase and Contribution Agreement and an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement with Arizona Fab LLC, suggesting a formalization and potential shift in the financial and governance structure of the relationship, although full operational control remained. The specific funding commitment from 2023 was not reiterated in 2024, indicating a possible transition from a funding phase to an operational phase.",

Intel maintains operational control as the sole operator of the two new chip factories and holds the right to purchase 100% of the output, with obligations to meet minimum production levels.

By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as an active segment, and instead, Intel emphasized its focus on new business areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and external foundry services through IFS. This evolution indicates a continued strategic realignment toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing capabilities, while exiting businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Intel's strategic approach to its NAND memory business shifted from divesting the business to focusing on core and growth areas. In 2022, Intel completed the first closing of the divestiture of its NAND memory business, and by 2023, the business was no longer a strategic priority. This indicates that Intel is reallocating capital toward its IDM 2.0 strategy, R&D investments, and high-growth areas such as AI, foundry services, and advanced packaging technologies. The divestiture reflects a broader capital allocation priority of concentrating resources on businesses that align with long-term growth and technological leadership.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Grooming segment accounted for 8% of net sales, indicating its relatively smaller contribution to the company's overall revenue. In 2023, the segment saw high single-digit organic sales growth, which was notably stronger than the company's overall organic sales growth of 4%. This suggests that the Grooming segment outperformed the company average in terms of growth during fiscal 2023, showing an upward trend in its relative importance or market traction.",
      "llm_answer": "The Grooming segment's net sales growth increased by 4% in 2023 (from $6.4 billion to $6.7 billion), driven by an 8% increase in pricing and a 1% rise in unit volume, partially offset by a 5% negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange. This growth outperformed the company's overall organic sales trend, which increased by 2%. The Grooming segment's strong performance, with organic sales rising by 9%, indicates that it was a key growth driver for Procter & Gamble in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In FY2023, revenue from customers outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in FY2024, this dropped to 56%. This indicates a significant increase in U.S.-based demand for Compute & Networking segment products, which is attributed to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand. The shift suggests a growing adoption of NVIDIA's compute and networking solutions within the domestic market, potentially driven by data center expansion and enterprise AI initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "The geographic revenue concentration for NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment has increased significantly in the U.S. from FY2023 to FY2024, with U.S. demand driving the segment's growth. In FY2023, international revenue accounted for a larger share, but by FY2024, U.S.-based demand became a primary contributor to the Compute & Networking segment's revenue surge, suggesting a notable shift in demand toward U.S. markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MMM's Personal Safety segment reported sales of $3.916 billion, reflecting a decline compared to the prior year and indicating reduced demand, particularly in contrast to the strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand in 2021. By 2023, the Personal Safety segment's sales further decreased to $3.487 billion, representing a continued downward trend. This indicates a sustained reduction in the segment's contribution to MMM's overall revenue, suggesting a potential strategic shift or reduced emphasis on this business line.",
      "llm_answer": "The Personal Safety segment's net sales declined from $3,916 million in 2022 to $3,487 million in 2023, reflecting a significant drop compared to the prior year. This decline is consistent with a broader trend of reduced demand, particularly in respirator masks, as the impact of the pandemic waned. The segment's performance indicates that 3M is strategically shifting focus away from legacy products, such as PFAS-related manufacturing, and toward more sustainable and diversified markets. This aligns with the company's broader strategy to streamline operations and prioritize high-growth areas.",

In contrast, CCG revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 to $54.2 billion due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in the second half of the year. The decline in 2023 was also influenced by a higher mix of small core and older generation products, which lowered ASPs, despite some offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial and gaming segments.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 compared to 2022. This decline was primarily driven by lower notebook and desktop volumes due to reduced demand across market segments. However, there was a partial offset from increased volume in the second half of 2023 as customer inventory levels normalized.

By 2024, the fair value had declined to $690 million, with $89 million in gross unrealized gains and $5 million in gross unrealized losses.

The 2022 document explicitly notes that the Analytical Instruments segment was significantly impacted by the negative effects of the global pandemic in 2020, with some lingering effects in 2021.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel still owned and operated its NAND memory business, which was generating losses of $4,306 million in net revenue and contributing a negative $1,369 million to operating income. By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing. This strategic exit removed the financial drag of the NAND segment from Intel's operations, allowing the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy and reduce restructuring and operational costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Intel's NAND memory business was in the process of being divested to SK hynix, as announced in October 2020. The first closing of the sale occurred in December 2021, and the second closing was pending as of 2022. By 2023, the business was fully deconsolidated in the first quarter of 2022. The exclusion of the NAND memory business from Intel's core operations had a notable impact on its financial performance, as the business contributed negatively to operating income in prior years. Removing the NAND business from financial reporting allowed Intel to focus on its core operations and improve the clarity of its financial metrics, such as non-GAAP operating income and margins.",

      "question": "How did the change in Reported Operating Company Income (OCI) and its contributing factors evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of dollar amounts and key drivers such as pricing, shipment volume, and costs?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Reported OCI increased by $409 million (4.1%), primarily driven by higher pricing of $1,688 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,158 million. In 2024, Reported OCI increased by $151 million (1.4%), mainly due to higher pricing that included higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration, and research costs by $56 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,648 million. The magnitude of the OCI increase was significantly higher in 2022 compared to 2024, indicating a decline in the growth rate of OCI over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the Reported Operating Company Income (OCI) for the Smokeable Products segment increased from $10,394 million in 2022 to $10,821 million in 2024, a $427 million increase. This growth was driven primarily by higher pricing actions, which offset declines in shipment volume. For example, in 2024, net revenues decreased by $552 million (2.5%) due to lower shipment volume ($2,528 million), but higher pricing ($1,968 million) partially offset this decline. Similarly, in 2023, net revenues decreased by $223 million (1.0%) due to lower shipment volume, but pricing actions helped increase reported OCI. The oral tobacco products segment saw a significant drop in reported OCI from $1,659 million in 2022 to $1,449 million in 2024, primarily due to higher costs and volume/mix changes, despite higher pricing. Key drivers of these changes include ongoing industry challenges such as the growth of illicit e-vapor products, retail share losses, and continued discretionary income pressures on adult tobacco consumers.",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue and was specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also tied to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting a more pronounced dependency on major customers for this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, the Compute & Networking segment experienced a notable increase in market concentration and customer dependency. In 2024, sales to one direct customer (Customer A) accounted for 13% of total revenue, and an indirect customer (primarily purchasing through system integrators and distributors, including Customer A) represented approximately 19% of total revenue, both attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. In contrast, no customer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue in 2023. This shift indicates a growing concentration of demand within the segment, likely driven by strong growth in Data Center revenue and the segment's critical role in AI and high-performance computing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed that it self-insures costs associated with employee disability programs and bases accruals on actuarially estimated costs of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. By 2023, the company continued to self-insure these benefits but provided more detailed insight into the actuarial estimation process, noting that the estimates incorporated judgment around claim severity, frequency, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs.

In both years, the company used actuarially estimated costs to determine self-insurance accruals for employee disability programs, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. However, the total self-insurance accruals increased from $5,069 million in 2023 to $5,632 million in 2024, indicating a rise in estimated liabilities. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis highlighted that a 5% change in claim severity assumptions would significantly impact reserves and expenses, underscoring the continued reliance on actuarial judgments in estimating these liabilities.",

However, both years experienced headwinds from declining shipment volumes—$1,931 million in 2022 and $2,528 million in 2024.

      "question": "How has FedEx's consideration of healthcare inflation in its self-insurance accruals evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this suggest about the company's risk assessment approach?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx explicitly stated that healthcare inflation was one of the key judgmental factors in estimating self-insurance reserves, indicating its importance in liability projections. In 2023, while the company continued to include healthcare inflation as part of its estimation methodology, it added language emphasizing that it believes its recorded obligations are 'consistently measured and appropriate,' suggesting a more confident stance in its risk assessment. This evolution indicates a shift from a cautious acknowledgment of uncertainty in 2022 to a more assured posture in 2023 regarding the impact of healthcare inflation on self-insurance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, FedEx's consideration of healthcare inflation in its self-insurance accruals remained a critical factor in estimating liabilities, but the sensitivity of these estimates increased. In 2022, a five-percent change in claim severity would have impacted reserves and expenses by approximately $230 million, while in 2023, the impact rose to approximately $280 million. This suggests that the company's risk assessment approach became more cautious, recognizing greater uncertainty and volatility in healthcare inflation and its potential material impact on financial results.",

In 2023, the company noted that premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the respective countries. In 2024, IBM repeated the same language, indicating that the risk remained consistent and no material change occurred in the exposure or the underlying factors affecting the premiums. Therefore, the potential financial impact of these premiums remained stable between the two years.",

In both years, IBM highlights that premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States could significantly impact its results, particularly due to insolvencies of unrelated companies in the relevant countries.

The increase in the percentage was primarily due to changes in product mix, including decreases in Veklury product sales globally, which were offset by increased sales in HIV and oncology products, along with shifts in payer mix.

By 2024, the relationship had shifted from a direct stake to a dependency relationship, with a notable increase in credit risk exposure as evidenced by the $491 million allowance for expected credit losses, driven by a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney in the fourth quarter of 2024. This marks a significant transformation from a stable asset holding to a risk-influenced dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, RTX's financial relationship with Pratt & Whitney remained stable in terms of goodwill valuation, as the Pratt & Whitney reporting unit did not show impairment in either period. However, credit risk exposure increased in 2024 due to a customer bankruptcy recorded at Pratt & Whitney, which led to an increase in the allowance for expected credit losses and a rise in reserves.

In 2023, Gross Dollar Volume growth slowed to 12% on a local currency basis, yet still supported a 13% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis.

However, in fiscal 2023, this metric declined by 3.6% to $604.55. This reversal indicates that while the company was able to improve its in-store sales productivity in fiscal 2022, that momentum did not carry into fiscal 2023, suggesting a potential challenge in sustaining productivity gains.",
      "llm_answer": "The 3.6% decline in Home Depot's sales per retail square foot from fiscal 2022 to 2023, following a 3.7% increase in fiscal 2021, suggests a weakening trend in in-store sales productivity. This decline indicates that the company generated less revenue per square foot of retail space in 2023 compared to the prior year, potentially reflecting softer customer demand, lower foot traffic, or challenges in optimizing in-store sales efficiency. The fluctuation highlights a shift from the prior year's growth, signaling a need for strategic adjustments to improve in-store performance.",

      "llm_answer": "The amortization of purchased intangible assets recognized in operating expenses increased significantly from $282 million in 2023 to $698 million in 2024. This increase is primarily attributed to the acquisition of Splunk, which contributed $569 million to the rise in amortization expenses, along with impairment charges of $145 million in 2024. This indicates that Cisco made substantial investments in intangible assets, particularly through acquisitions like Splunk, which are now contributing to higher ongoing amortization expenses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Safety Solutions was explicitly listed as one of the four core business segments, specifically called 'Safety and Productivity Solutions,' indicating a dedicated strategic focus. By 2024, the company had integrated safety more broadly into its sustainability-oriented solutions, highlighting improvements in 'health, safety, security, environmental impact, and resiliency' as part of its sustainability strategy. This reflects a shift from a standalone business segment to a cross-functional component of the company's broader sustainability initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "Honeywell's Safety Solutions segment has evolved to become more integrated with broader corporate sustainability initiatives between 2022 and 2024. In 2024, the company explicitly emphasized how its sustainability-oriented solutions, including health, safety, and environmental impact, align with its corporate goals, such as achieving carbon neutrality by 2035. This reflects a strategic shift to position safety as a core component of its sustainability efforts, as outlined in its 2024 Impact Report and ESG initiatives.",

According to the 2023 filing, this represents the company's 'estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs' as of December 31, 2023. The 2023 report also explains that the company uses an actuarial process to estimate these liabilities, considering factors like time from service date to claim processing, seasonal variances, and healthcare cost trends. This indicates that the company's obligation for unpaid medical costs grew year-over-year, and the estimation methodology remained consistent and centrally controlled.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable decreased from $24,483 million at the end of 2022 to $23,365 million at the end of 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, KO reported net operating revenues of $45.754 billion, reflecting steady growth from $43.004 billion in 2022 and $38.655 billion in 2021. However, the 2024 filing highlights several operational and integration-related risks that could threaten this growth trajectory. Specifically, KO notes that challenges in integrating acquired businesses—such as delays in realizing cost synergies, difficulties in extending internal controls, and potential increases in costs due to integration issues—could negatively affect financial results. Additionally, risks related to third-party service providers failing to meet commitments, labor unrest affecting manufacturing and bottling operations, and the inability to offset cost increases through pricing or productivity initiatives all pose direct threats to maintaining revenue momentum. These risks, if realized, could materially reduce or even reverse the upward trend in net operating revenues observed in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Specific operational and integration-related risks identified in 2024 that could threaten the sustainability of KO's 2023 revenue growth include challenges in integrating acquired businesses or bottling operations, which may result in increased costs, internal control failures, or an inability to realize anticipated synergies. These issues could negatively impact future net operating revenues by delaying or reducing growth opportunities and increasing expenses. Additionally, risks related to supply chain disruptions, rising commodity and input costs, and difficulties in managing productivity initiatives could further pressure profitability and revenue sustainability.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, the Core Routing portfolio contributed to flat revenue in routed optical networking, with growth specifically noted in the Cisco 8000 series offerings and the webscale provider market. However, by fiscal 2024, the Core Routing portfolio was part of an overall revenue decline in the Networking product category, which fell by 15% ($5.3 billion), including a specific decline in enterprise routing. This shift indicates a deterioration in the Core Routing portfolio's ability to support revenue growth in the Networking category, despite pockets of strength like SD-WAN.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco's Core Routing portfolio experienced mixed performance between fiscal 2023 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, the Core Routing portfolio contributed to an 18% increase in Networking product category revenue, driven by growth in the Cisco 8000 series and webscale provider markets. However, in fiscal 2024, the Networking category as a whole declined by 15%, with enterprise routing specifically seeing a revenue decline, indicating a reduced role for Core Routing amid broader market challenges and customer spending caution.

By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had shifted to a positive contribution of 1.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, and 1.0% in 2023 compared to 2022.

In 2022, currency exchange rates positively impacted sales growth by 1.0%, while in 2024, the impact turned negative, reducing sales by 0.5%. This shift indicates increased exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, particularly as the U.S. dollar strengthened against other major currencies in 2024, negatively affecting reported sales.

      "original_answer": "The financial position of the APJC segment increased from $5,360 in fiscal year 2023 to $5,382 in fiscal year 2024, reflecting a modest growth of $22. This change includes $16 from acquisitions and $6 from foreign currency translation and other adjustments in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the reported balances, the financial position of the APJC segment improved between fiscal years 2023 and 2024. In fiscal 2023, the APJC segment had a goodwill balance of $5,382 million, which increased to $8,208 million by fiscal 2024. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Splunk, which contributed $2,702 million to the APJC segment's goodwill, along with additional contributions from other acquisitions and foreign currency translation adjustments.",

      "original_answer": "Honeywell's total net repositioning and other charges decreased significantly from $1,266 million in 2022 to $244 million in 2024. This indicates a substantial reduction in restructuring activities over the two-year period. In 2022, the company was actively engaged in repositioning efforts, including workforce reductions, site transitions, and asset impairments across multiple segments. By 2024, these charges had dropped sharply, suggesting that the major restructuring initiatives had either been completed or scaled back.",
      "llm_answer": "Honeywell's total net repositioning and other charges decreased significantly from $1,266 million in 2022 to $860 million in 2023 and further to $244 million in 2024. This decline indicates a reduction in the scale of restructuring activities, likely due to the completion of major initiatives, such as site transitions and workforce reductions, particularly in the Industrial Automation segment. The lower charges in 2024 also reflect higher reserve reversals and reduced asset impairments, suggesting the company is in a later phase of its restructuring efforts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016 through 2021 totaled $1,439 million. In 2023, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident years increased to $2,055 million. This significant rise indicates a lengthening of the claims settlement timeline, suggesting that AIG is taking longer to settle claims, which could imply either more complex claims or a more conservative approach to claims resolution. This also points to potential reserving implications, as the company may have initially underestimated the ultimate payout for these accident years.",
      "llm_answer": "AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016 through 2021 increased from $24,207 million in 2022 to $28,260 million in 2023. This indicates a significant acceleration in claims settlement activity during 2023 compared to 2022. The trend suggests that AIG is resolving claims more quickly, which could reflect improved reserving accuracy or more aggressive claims settlement strategies. However, it may also indicate that prior reserves were under-estimated, leading to higher paid losses in the current year.",

By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had decreased reported sales by 0.5% year-over-year. This indicates that DHR's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations had lessened by 2024 compared to 2022, although the U.S. dollar's strengthening against other major currencies still had a modest negative impact on sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on DHR's reported sales shifted from a positive to a negative effect. In 2022, the impact of currency exchange rates was neutral (0% impact), while in 2023, it positively contributed 1.0% to sales growth. However, in 2024, the impact turned negative, reducing reported sales by 0.5% due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies. This indicates that DHR's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations can be significant and volatile, depending on currency movements, and the company excludes these effects from its core sales metrics to better reflect underlying business performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel had already completed the divestiture of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, indicating a strategic exit from this segment as part of its capital allocation strategy that prioritized investment in core IDM 2.0 initiatives and away from non-strategic assets. By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as part of Intel's active operations, and instead, the company emphasized winding down other non-core businesses like Intel Optane, further signaling a sharpened focus on strategic areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and its internal foundry model. This evolution reflects a broader strategic shift toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing, while divesting or discontinuing businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Intel's strategic involvement in its NAND memory business shifted from active ownership to divestiture, as the company completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix in 2022. This move reflects Intel's broader capital allocation and business focus on IDM 2.0, which prioritizes internal manufacturing, strategic foundry partnerships, and investments in high-growth areas like AI, discrete GPUs, and advanced packaging technologies.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE reported deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses of $1.0 billion, of which $0.6 billion was associated with losses from discontinued operations, including GE Vernova. By 2024, this figure had decreased to $0.5 billion, with only an insignificant amount tied to GE Vernova. This reduction reflects the tax implications of the spin-off, as GE no longer retained the associated tax benefits from the spun-off entity. The change indicates a significant shift in GE’s deferred tax position following the separation of GE Vernova, reducing the company’s future tax obligations tied to those non-U.S. losses.",
      "llm_answer": "The spin-off of GE Vernova between 2023 and 2024 led to a significant reduction in GE's deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses. Specifically, these deferred tax assets decreased from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2023, to $0.5 billion at December 31, 2024. This decline is primarily attributed to the separation of GE Vernova, as a substantial portion ($0.6 billion in 2023) of the non-U.S. net operating loss deferred tax assets was associated with the businesses that were spun off.",

      "question": "How did the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, currency exchange rates had a negative impact of 1.5% on total sales growth, whereas in 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates shifted to a positive contribution of 1.5% in one period and remained positive at 1.0% in the subsequent period. This indicates a reversal in how exchange rate movements affected the company's reported sales, suggesting a change in the company's geographic revenue mix or hedging strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a positive to a negative influence. In 2022, currency exchange rates positively impacted sales by 1.0%, while in 2023, the impact remained neutral at 1.0%. However, in 2024, the strengthening U.S. dollar caused a negative impact of 0.5% on total sales. This evolution indicates that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has increased, as it experienced a decline in sales due to adverse currency movements in 2024, reflecting heightened vulnerability to exchange rate volatility.",

By 2024, GE continued to disclose financial impacts related to GE HealthCare, specifically noting that $0.6 billion of non-U.S. net operating losses associated with discontinued operations at the end of 2023 were reduced to an insignificant amount by the end of 2024. This reflects a significant decrease in the financial exposure or tax implications tied to the previously spun-off GE HealthCare business within GE's consolidated disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment and financial impact of GE HealthCare in GE's consolidated financial disclosures evolved between 2023 and 2024 as follows: In 2023, GE completed the spin-off of GE HealthCare, and its historical results, along with certain assets and liabilities, were reported as discontinued operations. This transition is reflected in the 2024 disclosures, where GE HealthCare is no longer part of continuing operations. Financially, the 2023 10-K highlights cash flows related to the separation, including proceeds from the disposition of retained ownership interests and net settlements between continuing and discontinued operations. In 2024, GE HealthCare is referenced primarily in the context of discontinued operations, with impacts on tax positions and insurance reserves, but no longer contributes to ongoing revenue or profit.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Discount Revenue was described as American Express’s largest revenue source, primarily earned from transactions at merchants accepting American Express cards, with no specific emphasis on surcharging or airline-related risks. By 2024, the company explicitly noted that surcharging and differential acceptance practices in regions like Australia, Canada, and the EU were materially impacting merchant discount rates and card usage. Additionally, in 2024, the company highlighted a 7% exposure of worldwide billed business to airline merchants, introducing credit risk if airlines fail to deliver services after payments are made. This indicates a shift from viewing Discount Revenue as a stable core income stream to recognizing it as increasingly vulnerable to external pressures such as regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and sector-specific credit risks.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, American Express's risk profile related to Discount Revenue has shown increased exposure to merchant surcharging practices and airline merchant exposure. In 2024, the company highlighted that surcharging on American Express cards has increased in jurisdictions where permitted, particularly in certain merchant categories, with instances of differential surcharging favoring Visa and Mastercard. Additionally, airline merchant exposure accounted for approximately 7% of worldwide billed business in 2024, with the company facing credit risk from protecting Card Members against non-delivery of purchases, such as airline tickets. These factors indicate a heightened risk environment for Discount Revenue compared to 2022, where such specific exposures were not as explicitly detailed.",

However, in 2023, PEP disclosed a $5 million charge related to the AMESA segment under 'COVID-19 charges,' suggesting that the company's exposure had shifted from long-term asset amortization to short-term costs associated with the pandemic.

In 2023, the segment recorded a much smaller pre-tax impairment charge of $6 million, indicating a significant reduction in impairment-related financial exposure. Additionally, in 2023, AMESA had a pre-tax credit of $13 million, primarily in selling, general, and administrative expenses, which further suggests an improvement in financial exposure compared to 2022.",

      "question": "How did GE's financial obligations related to GE Vernova's credit support arrangements evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of indemnification responsibilities and deferred tax asset implications?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE disclosed that upon spin-off, GE Vernova would be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support-related payments, with an expectation that the fair value of this obligation would not be significant due to the low probability of loss. GE's exposure under these credit support arrangements could not be reasonably estimated, but contractual maturities of $15 billion each for Power and Renewable Energy segments within five years were highlighted. By 2024, the deferred tax assets associated with losses in discontinued operations, which include GE Vernova, decreased from $0.6 billion in 2023 to an insignificant amount, suggesting a reduction in the tax basis liability linked to these indemnifications. This indicates that the spin-off led to a material shift in how these obligations were accounted for, with GE no longer carrying the same level of tax-related exposure tied to GE Vernova's past credit support arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, GE's financial obligations related to GE Vernova's credit support arrangements evolved as the company prepared for the spin-off. Specifically, GE remained obligated under parent company guarantees and other credit support instruments for GE Vernova until the spin-off, with GE Vernova obligated to indemnify GE for any payments GE made under these arrangements. By 2024, the expected obligations related to GE credit support were approximately $65 billion, with $33 billion and $32 billion attributed to the Power and Renewable Energy segments, respectively. Additionally, the deferred tax asset implications for GE Vernova-related losses were $0.6 billion in 2023, declining to an insignificant amount by 2024, indicating a reduction in the tax impact of these discontinued operations.",

      "question": "How has the potential financial impact of payment card transaction costs on Apple's business evolved from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of risk magnitude and compliance-related cost exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple noted the risk of a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs' due to noncompliance with payment card industry data security standards, which could 'materially adversely affect the Company's business.' By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize not only the risk of increased costs but also the growing regulatory and compliance burden Apple faces globally, including 'an increasing number of federal, state and international laws' that heighten the potential for penalties. This indicates a shift from a general risk acknowledgment in 2022 to a more pronounced concern over the expanding regulatory environment in 2023, which likely exacerbates the financial exposure related to transaction costs.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Apple's potential financial impact from payment card transaction costs remained a notable risk, with no significant change in the magnitude of the exposure. In both years, the documents highlight that non-compliance with payment card industry data security standards could lead to increased transaction costs, fines, or the loss of the ability to process payment cards, which could materially affect Apple's business and financial condition. In 2023, the risk was contextualized within broader regulatory and compliance challenges, including the impact of evolving data protection laws and antitrust-related changes to the App Store, but no specific increase in the exposure to payment card transaction costs was reported.",

However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth in 2022 to stagnation in 2024 suggests a decline in the momentum of iPhone sales performance over time, potentially indicating market saturation or reduced consumer demand for new model releases during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, iPhone net sales experienced a shift in growth trajectory. In 2022, iPhone net sales increased by 7% compared to 2021, driven by strong performance from new iPhone models. However, in 2024, iPhone net sales remained relatively flat compared to 2023, indicating a slowdown in growth. This shift suggests that while the iPhone line continued to be a key revenue driver, its growth momentum has stabilized, potentially due to market saturation, competitive pressures, or weaker demand in key regions like Greater China.",

In the 2023 filing, Apple maintained that potential penalties include 'significant fees or fines,' but added that the company could also experience a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards.'

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, the estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products had a negative impact of $299 million on QTL licensing revenues. In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the same metric positively contributed $402 million to licensing revenues. This represents a significant shift from a negative to a positive influence, with a total change in direction and magnitude of $701 million over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, the impact of estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products on QTL licensing revenues shifted significantly. In fiscal 2022, these sales decreased by $299 million, contributing to a minimal overall increase in QTL licensing revenues. By fiscal 2024, however, estimated sales of these products increased by $402 million, which was a key driver of the $266 million rise in QTL licensing revenues during that period. This represents a reversal of the trend observed in 2022, with a notable shift in magnitude of $701 million.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the filing explicitly stated that 'our ability to return capital to shareholders [...] may be limited [...] by our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' In 2023, this language was expanded to include the phrase 'our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations [...] and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' This evolution indicates a more nuanced disclosure that retains the prior year's emphasis on preferred stock dividends as a limiting factor but adds a broader regulatory and governance context. This suggests the company is reinforcing the conditional nature of capital returns, particularly tied to preferred stock obligations, while emphasizing board discretion and regulatory constraints.",
      "llm_answer": "The disclosure regarding the impact of preferred stock dividends on capital return decisions remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, emphasizing that the company's ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws, regulations, and the need to pay full and timely dividends on preferred stock. This suggests a cautious and regulatory-compliant approach to shareholder distributions, prioritizing financial stability and adherence to legal requirements over aggressive capital returns.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Altria excluded NPM Adjustment Items from its adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate forecasts, noting that these items could be significant, unusual, or infrequent, and difficult to predict. The company did not provide a GAAP reconciliation for these exclusions. By 2023, Altria explicitly disclosed the financial impact of NPM Adjustment Items in its operating results, reporting a $29 million impact in Smokeable Products, which was factored into the reconciliation between reported OCI and adjusted OCI. This represents a shift from exclusion to explicit quantification within operating performance metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Altria's NPM Adjustment Items had a reduced negative impact on adjusted operating results. In 2022, NPM Adjustment Items reduced reported OCI by $63 million, while in 2023, the reduction was $29 million. This decline in the magnitude of NPM Adjustment Items contributed to a smaller adjustment from reported OCI to adjusted OCI in 2023 compared to 2022, with adjusted OCI decreasing by $16 million (0.1%) in 2023 versus a $18 million (0.2%) decrease in 2022.",

By fiscal year 2024, Broadcom significantly enhanced this segment through the acquisition of VMware, a leading provider of multi-cloud services, in a transaction valued at approximately $84.2 billion (including both cash and stock). This represents a major strategic shift from smaller-scale asset acquisitions to a transformative acquisition aimed at strengthening Broadcom’s infrastructure software capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Broadcom significantly enhanced its strategic positioning in the Infrastructure Software segment from fiscal year 2022 to 2024 through major acquisition activity. In 2022, Broadcom announced the pending acquisition of VMware for approximately $61 billion, which was completed in November 2023. This acquisition, a cornerstone of Broadcom's strategy, expanded its infrastructure software capabilities by integrating VMware's multi-cloud services. Additionally, in 2022, Broadcom completed four smaller acquisitions for $245 million, primarily within the Infrastructure Software segment, further strengthening its portfolio. These moves reflect Broadcom's focus on expanding its leadership in mission-critical infrastructure software and modernizing enterprise IT environments.",

      "original_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue significantly declined from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, Paxlovid was part of a broader set of risks related to the company's efforts to develop and commercialize COVID-19 products, including Comirnaty, with specific concerns about reduced demand, inventory write-offs, and challenges transitioning to a commercial market. By 2024, Paxlovid's global revenue dropped by 57% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand globally, especially in China, where there was a non-recurrent surge in COVID-19 infections in early 2023, and a transition to an out-of-pocket market in the second quarter of that year. Additionally, the global market for COVID-19 treatments had become more endemic and seasonal, leading to reduced demand and lower contractual deliveries in most international markets.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue increased significantly between 2023 and 2024, with a notable operational growth of $4,452 million globally. This growth was primarily driven by a $3.5 billion non-cash revenue reversal recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, followed by a $771 million favorable adjustment in the first quarter of 2024. Additionally, one-time contractual deliveries to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) in Q3 2024 contributed $442 million. However, this was partially offset by lower demand globally, especially in China, and the transition to traditional commercial market sales.",

However, the segment was not yet a central strategic focus, as evidenced by the pending $61 billion acquisition of VMware, which was expected to close in fiscal year 2023. By fiscal year 2024, the relationship had transformed significantly: Broadcom had completed the VMware acquisition on November 22, 2023, and integrated VMware's infrastructure software capabilities into its portfolio. The acquisition involved a financial commitment of approximately $30,788 million in cash and $53,398 million in Broadcom stock, marking a substantial increase in both strategic emphasis and financial investment in the Infrastructure Software segment.",

This acquisition was completed in November 2023 and marked a pivotal step in Broadcom's strategy to integrate best-of-breed infrastructure software solutions with its semiconductor offerings. The financial commitment is evident in the $61 billion valuation of the VMware acquisition and the inclusion of VMware's results in Broadcom's consolidated financial statements starting in fiscal year 2024, significantly expanding the scale and scope of the Infrastructure Software segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company reported a provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $ (1,115) million, reflecting a negative tax expense. By 2024, this figure had significantly shifted to just $ (28) million, indicating a substantial reduction in the tax benefit. This change suggests a major improvement in the company's tax position or a shift in taxable income between these years.",
      "llm_answer": "The provision/(benefit) for taxes on income shifted significantly from a benefit of $1,115 million in 2023 to a provision of $28 million in 2024. This indicates a dramatic change in the company's tax position, likely influenced by changes in taxable income, tax law impacts (such as OECD Pillar 2 minimum tax provisions), and adjustments in discrete tax elements. The effective tax rate also changed from -105.4% in 2023 to -0.4% in 2024, reflecting a more neutral tax position in 2024 compared to the substantial tax benefit in 2023.",

By 2024, global Humira sales had decreased by 37%, primarily due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in early 2023.

By 2023, the disclosure expanded to frame these same information security costs within the context of broader strategic efforts, specifically mentioning the 'expected implications from the development of the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI.'

By 2023, freight revenues decreased 3% to $22.6 billion, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenues and a negative mix of traffic, such as decreased lumber shipments and increased short-haul rock shipments, despite core pricing gains. Fuel surcharge revenues declined from $3.7 billion in 2022 to $3.0 billion in 2023, reflecting a 15% decrease in fuel prices and lower volume. These changes indicate a shift from growth driven by broad-based volume and pricing in 2022 to a contraction influenced by fuel and mix effects in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, freight revenues declined by 3%, primarily driven by lower fuel surcharge contributions due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and reduced volume.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD reported a net inventory balance of $1,955 million as of December 25, 2021, and described its process of adjusting inventory carrying value based on historical and forecasted demand, with a focus on recent historical activity. By 2023, the net inventory balance had increased significantly to $4,351 million as of December 30, 2022. Additionally, AMD's language shifted from 'inventory carrying value adjustments' to 'inventory excess and obsolescence reserves,' indicating a more refined and possibly more conservative approach to inventory valuation. This evolution suggests a growing complexity in inventory management, likely due to increased inventory holdings and forward-looking risk assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMD's inventory carrying value increased significantly from $1,955 million to $4,351 million. The methodology for estimating inventory adjustments remained consistent, with the company adjusting inventory to the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value based on ongoing reviews of on-hand inventory levels, historical activity, and forecasted demand. However, the scale of inventory management became more complex in 2023 due to the larger inventory balance and the sensitivity of assumptions related to demand forecasts, product life cycles, and market conditions. This indicates a growing challenge in inventory management as AMD's operations and market exposure expanded.",

      "original_answer": "Broadcom's strategic focus in the Infrastructure Software Segment significantly evolved from fiscal year 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company completed four acquisitions totaling $245 million, with $164 million allocated to goodwill and $110 million to intangible assets, indicating a continued investment in expanding the segment through smaller, strategic purchases. By 2024, Broadcom had made a transformative leap by acquiring VMware for approximately $84,186 million in total consideration (comprising $30,788 million in cash and $53,398 million in Broadcom common stock). This acquisition was explicitly aimed at enhancing the infrastructure software capabilities, signaling a major strategic shift from incremental growth via small acquisitions to a bold consolidation move that redefined the segment’s scope and market positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, Broadcom significantly enhanced its Infrastructure Software Segment through major acquisition activity. In 2022, Broadcom initiated the acquisition of VMware for approximately $61 billion, aiming to expand its infrastructure software capabilities. The acquisition was completed in November 2023, marking a pivotal enhancement to Broadcom's portfolio by integrating VMware's multi-cloud services. Additionally, in 2022, Broadcom acquired the Symantec Business for $10.7 billion in cash to strengthen its cybersecurity and infrastructure software offerings. These strategic acquisitions reflect Broadcom's focus on expanding its infrastructure software footprint through high-impact deals, enhancing its position in mission-critical software solutions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD recognized $102 million in licensing gain from a milestone achievement and royalty income under the THATIC JV agreement. In contrast, in 2023, the licensing gain from royalty income was significantly lower at $34 million, with no mention of milestone-related gains. This indicates a decline in licensing revenue, primarily due to the absence of milestone achievements in 2023 despite continued royalty income.",

This decline indicates that a major milestone achievement in 2022 contributed substantially to the licensing gain, while 2023's gain was primarily driven by ongoing royalty income without a significant milestone-related boost.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Canadian segment gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to improvements in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increased 2% rewards. In 2024, the same factors were cited—increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—again contributing positively, with the same offsetting effect from increased 2% rewards. The specific contribution magnitudes were consistent across both years, indicating a sustained trend in margin performance drivers within the Canadian segment.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, the Canadian segment's gross margin percentage was influenced by core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary businesses, but the impact was partially offset by increased 2% rewards. By 2024, the Canadian segment's gross margin percentage improved, primarily due to increases in both core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses (such as e-commerce and gasoline), although this improvement was still partially offset by increased 2% rewards. This evolution reflects a more positive contribution from both core and ancillary operations in 2024 compared to 2023.",

Simultaneously, Pfizer received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) from the JV, which it repaid in July 2022 after receiving £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion. By 2024, this indemnification had been terminated in conjunction with the demerger, and there was no indication of ongoing loan obligations or new financing arrangements with the JV. This marks a full resolution of the indemnification and loan relationship that existed in 2022.",

In 2022, Pfizer received a 32% equity-method investment in the JV in exchange for contributing its Consumer Healthcare business, valued at $15.7 billion, and recognized an $8.3 billion gain on the transaction. Additionally, Pfizer loaned £2.9 billion (approximately $3.7 billion) from the JV's debt issuance proceeds and later repaid the loan in July 2022 after receiving a £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) dividend, which included a one-time pre-separation dividend. By 2024, Pfizer had sold portions of its equity stake in the JV (Haleon), reducing its ownership to approximately 15%, and no longer applied the equity method due to the loss of significant influence. The indemnification obligation to GSK for the JV's debt was also terminated following these transactions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal disclosed that retail e-commerce sales were among several macroeconomic factors influencing transaction and credit losses, specifically affecting the funding mix and consumer spending behavior. By 2024, the company placed a more structured and explicit emphasis on retail e-commerce sales as part of the macroeconomic forecasts used in its consumer loss models, particularly for the revolving credit portfolio. This shift indicates a more direct integration of retail e-commerce trends into the credit risk modeling process. The 2024 allowance for consumer loans receivable was $341 million, with models now explicitly incorporating forecasted retail e-commerce sales sourced externally using a single economic scenario for each period.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's reliance on retail e-commerce sales as a macroeconomic factor in forecasting consumer credit losses remained significant in 2024, as it was one of the key external macroeconomic factors used in the consumer loss models for the revolving credit portfolio. However, the 2024 filing does not explicitly indicate a change in the level of reliance compared to 2023, where retail e-commerce sales were similarly cited as a critical factor in estimating credit losses.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PFE reported Other (income)/deductions-net as a $4,878 million expense, largely driven by significant losses on equity securities ($1,344 million) and a $2,547 million expense related to net periodic benefit costs. By 2024, this line item reversed to a $4,388 million income, indicating major improvements or one-time gains not present in earlier filings.

      "llm_answer": "The significant reversal in PFE's Other (income)/deductions-net from a $4,878 million expense in 2022 to a $4,388 million income in 2024 was primarily driven by a combination of factors. In 2024, favorable gains of $945 million from the partial sale of Pfizer's investment in Haleon and lower net interest expenses contributed positively. Additionally, the 2022 period included substantial net losses on equity securities and higher intangible asset impairment charges, which were not as pronounced in 2024.

By 2024, these indemnification obligations were terminated, and PFE had significantly reduced its ownership stake in Haleon (the JV entity) through two major share sales, which shifted its accounting treatment from the equity method to fair value accounting for the remaining shares.",

However, by 2024, subscription revenue had declined significantly as a percentage of total revenue to just 8%. This dramatic decrease indicates a major shift in Adobe's revenue mix, suggesting a growing proportion of revenue coming from non-subscription sources such as services and other revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe's subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from 92% in 2021 to 95% in 2024, indicating a continued shift toward a subscription-based revenue model. This trend reflects the company's strategic focus on transitioning customers to recurring revenue streams, particularly through its Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, which drive predictable and stable income.

This minor decrease followed an increase in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by unfavorable changes in product mix, particularly a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing, partially offset by favorable regional mix changes. In 2024, the slight decline in the rate suggests that the company may have experienced more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies, although the overall rate remained relatively stable.",

At the same time, the JV loaned Pfizer £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum. In July 2022, Pfizer received £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from the JV, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion, which was used to repay the £2.9 billion loan. Following the demerger, Pfizer's indemnification obligation was terminated. By 2024, there was no mention of ongoing indemnification or loan obligations related to the Consumer Healthcare JV, indicating a full resolution of these financial arrangements.",

In 2022, Pfizer had an indemnification obligation to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) for 32% of any amount payable by GSK under its guarantee of the JV's debt. Following the JV's issuance of notes in March 2022, the proceeds were loaned to Pfizer and GSK on a pro rata basis. Pfizer received a £2.9 billion loan at 1.365% interest, which was repaid in July 2022 after receiving a £3.5 billion dividend from the JV. This transaction reduced the carrying value of Pfizer's investment in the JV. By 2024, the indemnification obligation had been terminated as part of the demerger process, and Pfizer's ownership and influence over the JV had been significantly reduced.",

By 2024, the total paid membership grew to 76,200, with 63,700 Gold Star members (83.6%) and 12,500 Business members (16.4%). This reflects a slight increase in the dominance of Gold Star members in the overall membership base, while the Business segment saw a smaller proportional growth.

By 2024, the company's total Transformation Strategy Costs had significantly increased to $322 million for 2024 from $435 million in 2023. This indicates a substantial shift in strategic investment focus, with UPS accelerating its transformation initiatives under Transformation 2.0, including efforts like 'Spans and Layers,' 'Business Portfolio Review,' and 'Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined.'

      "question": "How has Apple's exposure to potential fees or fines related to payment card data security standards evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what implications does this have for its financial risk profile?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring significant fees or fines if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or loss of the ability to process payment cards. By 2024, the language evolved to emphasize not only the continuation of these risks but also the broader financial implications, such as materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. While the core risk remained consistent, the framing in 2024 suggests a heightened awareness and potential escalation in the severity of consequences, indicating an increased exposure or at least a more explicitly communicated risk posture.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's exposure to potential fees or fines related to payment card data security standards has remained a consistent risk from 2022 to 2024, with no significant changes in the nature of the risk described in the filings. In both years, the Company acknowledged that failure to follow payment card industry data security standards could result in significant fees or fines, increased transaction costs, or the loss of the ability to process payment cards, which could materially adversely affect its business and financial condition. The 2024 filing does not indicate any new developments or mitigation efforts specific to this risk, suggesting that Apple continues to manage it as part of its broader cybersecurity and compliance framework. This ongoing exposure contributes to Apple's financial risk profile by potentially exposing it to costly penalties and operational disruptions in the event of a data security incident.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX disclosed that foreign exchange contract activity impacted financial statements through its effect on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the Consolidated Statement of Operations, with gains or losses primarily recorded as part of Products sales. By 2023, RTX not only reiterated this impact but also specified the use of the critical terms match method for assessing hedge effectiveness and introduced a €500 million euro-denominated long-term debt instrument designated as a net investment hedge against European business investments, which was deemed effective. This indicates a more detailed and structured approach to managing foreign exchange risk through specific debt instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, RTX's foreign exchange contract activity showed a significant increase in the value of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, with foreign exchange contracts rising from $67 million (2022) to $225 million (2023) in other assets, current, and from $347 million (2022) to $143 million (2023) in other accrued liabilities. The €500 million euro-denominated long-term debt remained a net investment hedge against European business investments, deemed effective in both years. Additionally, the notional principal of foreign currency hedges increased from $11.2 billion in 2022 to $15.8 billion in 2023, indicating expanded hedging activity.",

However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth to stagnation suggests a notable change in the iPhone's sales momentum, potentially indicating market saturation, longer upgrade cycles, or weaker demand despite ongoing product releases.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, iPhone net sales showed a decline in growth trajectory. In 2022, iPhone net sales increased by 7% compared to 2021, driven by the release of new models. However, in 2023, iPhone net sales decreased by 2%, and in 2024, they remained relatively flat compared to 2023. This shift suggests that the iPhone product line's growth has matured or faced market saturation, with increasing competition and potential consumer fatigue impacting sales momentum.",

However, by 2023, European sales had declined by 1.2%, with an operational decline of 2.2% partially offset by a smaller positive currency impact of 1.0%. The decline in 2023 was significantly influenced by the net negative impact of 9.8% from the performance of the Covid-19 Vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of Zytiga. This marks a dramatic shift from the robust growth seen in 2021, indicating both operational challenges and changing market dynamics in Europe over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Johnson & Johnson's European sales performance from strong operational growth in 2021 (20.7% operational growth) to a decline in 2023 (2.2% operational decline) was influenced by several factors. In 2023, the European region faced a negative impact from the loss of exclusivity for Zytiga and the declining sales of the COVID-19 Vaccine, which together contributed a net negative 9.8% impact on operational sales. Additionally, currency impacts were mixed, with a positive 1.0% effect in 2023, which was insufficient to offset the operational decline. In contrast, 2021 saw strong growth driven by high demand for the COVID-19 Vaccine and favorable currency effects (3.6%). Product-specific events, such as the expiration of key patents and reduced vaccine demand post-pandemic, significantly influenced the evolution of European sales performance.",

By 2023, RTX shifted focus to new legal exposures stemming from the Powder Metal Disclosure Litigation and an SEC investigation, again noting that any related loss contingency accruals were not material.

Additionally, new exposures emerged, such as the SEC investigation into disclosures related to the powder metal issue at Pratt & Whitney, which was not mentioned in 2022.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, revenue from sales outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in fiscal year 2024, this percentage decreased to 56%. This indicates a notable shift in the geographic concentration of the Compute & Networking segment's demand, with a relative increase in U.S.-based demand driving the segment's revenue. The decrease in international revenue share suggests a strategic or market-driven shift toward stronger domestic growth in Compute & Networking.",
      "llm_answer": "The geographic revenue concentration for the Compute & Networking segment has shifted significantly between fiscal years 2023 and 2024, with a notable increase in U.S. revenue. In 2023, 31% of total revenue came from the U.S., while in 2024, this rose to 45%. This shift indicates a growing demand for Compute & Networking products within the United States, likely driven by the segment's Data Center and AI solutions, as noted in the document. The increased U.S. concentration suggests a strategic or market-driven shift in demand, potentially reflecting stronger adoption of AI and cloud computing technologies domestically.",

By 2024, the Segment Income Margin had stabilized at 26.2%, slightly down from 26.3% in 2023, representing only a 0.1 percentage point decrease. This indicates that after a notable decline in 2022, TMO's profitability relative to revenue improved and remained largely stable in the following years.",
      "llm_answer": "TMO's Segment Income Margin for the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment decreased from 12.4% in 2022 to 13.3% in 2024. This slight improvement in 2024 was modest compared to the strong 2.0 point increase in 2022, indicating a slowdown in margin expansion. The decline in 2024 was primarily due to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, partially offset by productivity improvements. This suggests that while the company is maintaining some cost efficiencies, its profitability performance in this segment has weakened compared to the robust growth seen in 2022.",

By 2023, Aircraft Manufacturing contributed only $7 billion to a total increase of $52 billion in company revenue. This indicates a significant decline in the segment's contribution, suggesting a reduced strategic emphasis or operational scale in this business area compared to other divisions like Aircraft Services, which contributed $36 billion in the same year.",

In 2023, Aircraft Services contributed $220 million to the total services revenue increase of $1,292 million. However, the 2023 filing does not specify the same operational drivers (such as maintenance or FBO activity) that were cited in 2022, suggesting a shift in how the segment's performance was characterized between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue contribution from Aircraft Services increased by $220 million between 2022 and 2023, as part of a $1,292 million increase in service revenue for the company. In 2023, the growth in Aircraft Services was driven by additional aircraft maintenance work. In 2022, the increase in Aircraft Services revenue was not explicitly detailed, but overall service revenue growth was attributed to factors such as IT services expansion and higher FBO activity in prior years.",

In 2023, the licensing gain from THATIC JV decreased to $34 million, which was solely from royalty income.

By 2023, the company projected specific annual benefit payments, starting at $70 million in 2024 and declining to $56 million by 2028 before rising again to $207 million over the following five years. This shift from asset allocation disclosure to liability payment projections indicates a transition toward more defined, forward-looking liability management, with a notable decline in near-term obligations followed by a longer-term increase.",
      "llm_answer": "The funding obligations for the U.S. Defined Benefit plan decreased from $489 million in 2022 to $480 million in 2023, indicating a slight reduction in the company's long-term pension liability. This reduction, combined with a strategic investment approach focused on aligning asset allocations with liability characteristics and using low-cost index funds, suggests effective long-term pension liability management aimed at mitigating risk and ensuring sustainability.",

By 2024, this metric had decreased significantly to 13.9%, reflecting a major decline in the company's ability to maintain profitability in relation to revenue. This drop from 52.6% to 13.9% suggests a substantial weakening in cost management or a shift in business dynamics affecting margins.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 48.8% in 2022 to 34.9% in 2024. This decline indicates deteriorating cost management and profitability, driven by lower revenue, higher manufacturing costs, and reduced factory loadings, which spread fixed costs over a smaller output.

By 2023, the company showed a decrease in its projected payment obligations, with U.S. Retiree Health Care payments declining from $27 million in 2024 to $22 million in 2028.

This reallocation reflects a more conservative approach to align with the long-term nature of obligations.

      "question": "How did the revenue performance in aircraft manufacturing evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what specific factors contributed to the change?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, aircraft manufacturing reported a loss of $251 million. By 2024, this segment experienced an increase in revenue due to additional aircraft deliveries, particularly the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. However, the segment also faced cost overruns linked to supplier quality escapes and late deliveries of components, which impacted profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, aircraft manufacturing revenue increased significantly, with a $2,101 million rise in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by additional aircraft deliveries. However, operating earnings growth lagged due to supplier quality issues and late supply chain deliveries, particularly impacting the G700 aircraft production. In 2022, aircraft manufacturing revenue had declined slightly compared to 2021 due to fewer deliveries and the divestiture of a satellite communications business. Thus, the period saw a recovery and strong revenue growth in 2024, albeit with margin pressures.",

      "question": "How did Abbott's strategic financial involvement in its Diagnostic Products segment evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of operational restructuring and segment classification?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Abbott was actively streamlining operations within its Diagnostic Products segment as part of broader cost-reduction initiatives, incurring approximately $16 million in severance charges recorded under 'Cost of products sold' and an additional $4 million under 'Research and development.' This reflects a direct financial commitment to restructuring the segment for improved efficiency. By 2024, the Diagnostic Products segment was formally redefined and categorized under four distinct business units—Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics, and Point of Care Diagnostics—indicating a more structured and strategic classification within Abbott’s internal management reporting framework. This evolution from operational restructuring in 2022 to a clearly delineated, standardized segment in 2024 suggests a long-term strategic shift toward formalizing and stabilizing the diagnostic business as a core component of Abbott’s global health care portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Abbott's strategic financial involvement in its Diagnostic Products segment underwent significant changes, primarily driven by operational restructuring and a shift in segment classification. In 2022, the Diagnostic Products segment reported high operating earnings of $6,640 million, but this declined to $2,433 million in 2023 and further to $2,073 million in 2024, reflecting a restructuring plan initiated in 2021 to align manufacturing for COVID-19 diagnostic tests with fluctuating demand. This restructuring involved asset write-downs, inventory charges, and employee-related costs. Additionally, in 2023, the Acelis Connected Health business was transferred from Diagnostic Products to the Medical Devices segment, altering the segment's classification and financial reporting. These actions indicate a strategic shift to streamline operations and optimize resource allocation in response to market dynamics and evolving regulatory environments.",

This indicates that despite fluctuations in total debt and operating cash flow over the period, the company maintained a consistent ability to service its debt through operating cash flows. The stability in this ratio suggests that Merck's cash flow generation remained proportionally aligned with its debt levels during this time.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck's 'Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Total Debt' ratio was 0.6:1 in 2022, dropped to 0.4:1 in 2023, and returned to 0.6:1 in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Merck estimated that a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would result in a $648 million decline in the market value of its hedge instruments. By 2024, this estimated decline was $569 million at year-end. This indicates a reduction in the company's foreign exchange risk exposure over time, as the potential market value loss decreased by $79 million over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck's estimated market value decline from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar increased from $593 million in 2022 to $754 million in 2023, and further to $569 million in 2024. This fluctuation indicates that the company's foreign exchange risk exposure has remained significant, with its hedging programs and net short positions in major foreign currencies making it vulnerable to U.S. dollar volatility. The evolution of these figures suggests that Merck's exposure to foreign exchange rate movements has shifted over time, likely influenced by changes in its hedging strategies and foreign currency positions.",

      "question": "How has the structure and focus of QTL's licensing agreements evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices and royalty structures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, QTL's licensing revenues were primarily derived from per-unit royalties and lump sum payments, with the majority coming from sales of OFDMA-based products, including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices. Royalties were calculated based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of permissible deductions, with some products subject to minimums or caps. By 2024, the structure remained largely consistent, with QTL continuing to generate the 'vast majority' of its revenues from similar multimode devices. However, the 2024 filing emphasized ongoing investments in 5G and the expansion of its patent portfolio in LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro, and 5G NR, indicating a strategic shift toward reinforcing its leadership in next-generation technologies. While the royalty structure remained similar, the 2024 report placed greater emphasis on the foundational role of Qualcomm's inventions in both 3G/4G and 5G, suggesting a deepening alignment of QTL's licensing strategy with 5G innovation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, QTL's licensing agreements have continued to focus on multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices, particularly covering 3G/4G/5G technologies. The structure of these agreements remains largely consistent, with licensees obligated to pay royalties based on their sales of such devices. Royalty structures typically involve per-unit royalties based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price of complete licensed products, with certain deductions and product-specific minimums or caps. There is no explicit indication of significant structural changes in the licensing agreements between the two years, but the continued emphasis on OFDMA-based products and the expansion of 5G technology suggest an ongoing evolution in the scope and relevance of these agreements.",

      "question": "How did the operating profit as a percentage of revenue change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's cost management and profitability trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 52.6%, indicating strong profitability relative to revenue. By 2024, this metric had dropped significantly to 13.9%, reflecting a sharp decline in the company's ability to maintain profitability in relation to revenue. This change indicates a substantial weakening in cost management or pricing power over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 48.8% in 2022 to 34.9% in 2024. This decline indicates a deterioration in cost management and profitability, primarily driven by lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs in 2024, despite relatively stable operating expenses. The reduction in operating margin suggests challenges in maintaining efficiency and controlling costs amid declining sales volumes.",

      "question": "How has the financial risk exposure related to medical cost forecasting in the Health Care Benefits segment evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in relation to Medicare membership and elevated utilization trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, CVS highlighted its sensitivity to the accuracy of forecasting health care costs, especially in the Medicare segment where revenue is based on bids submitted in June of the prior year. Premiums were fixed for 12-month periods, making the Health Care Benefits segment vulnerable to unanticipated cost increases, such as those caused by the lingering uncertainty of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and influenza seasons. In 2024, the company projected continued elevated utilization levels into 2025, which could pressure the Health Care Benefits segment and lead to premium deficiency reserves. Additionally, the company expected medical membership declines in Medicare and individual exchange products, contributing to financial volatility. These developments indicate an increased exposure to forecasting inaccuracies and a continuation of challenges in predicting utilization trends.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the financial risk exposure related to medical cost forecasting in the Health Care Benefits segment has increased, particularly due to elevated utilization trends and challenges in Medicare membership. In 2023, the risk centered on the difficulty of forecasting health care costs amid factors like pandemics and economic conditions. By 2024, the Company explicitly noted that elevated utilization persisted, creating pressure on the Health Care Benefits segment and increasing the likelihood of needing to record premium deficiency reserves if utilization exceeds projections. Additionally, Medicare membership disruptions and medical cost pressures in Medicaid, driven by higher acuity, further heighten financial risks in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Emerson used internal judgment and historical information from Aspen Technology, Inc. to determine the obsolescence rate for developed technology intangible assets. By 2024, the company had evolved its approach by involving valuation professionals to evaluate obsolescence rates through comparisons with industry peers and historical transactions. This indicates a shift toward more externally validated and benchmarked methodologies for asset valuation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Emerson's approach to determining the obsolescence rate for intangible assets evolved by incorporating more rigorous and industry-specific evaluations. In 2022, the obsolescence rate was based on assumptions such as projected revenue and historical data from the acquired entity, with the assistance of independent valuation specialists. By 2024, the company enhanced its methodology by comparing its obsolescence rates to those of companies within the same industry and historical transactions, as noted in the audit procedures performed by KPMG. This evolution indicates a more refined and externally benchmarked valuation methodology, reflecting Emerson's commitment to improving the accuracy and reliability of its intangible asset valuations.",
