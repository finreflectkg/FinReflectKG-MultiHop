In fiscal 2023, Sales to Wholesale Customers were $3,736 million, accounting for about 58% of total revenues ($6,431 million).

By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Current had decreased further to $254 million, despite additions and foreign currency adjustments, primarily driven by significant write-offs.

By 2024, the company introduced a slight modification by stating that the threshold is 'typically' $250 million, suggesting a more flexible approach. This change indicates that the company may be allowing for more judgment in determining which items are excluded, potentially affecting the consistency and comparability of its non-GAAP earnings metric over time.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's threshold for identifying items excluded from earnings has remained consistently at a minimum $250 million corporate‑wide earnings impact per quarter. In the 2022 filing (page 51), items were removed when they affected earnings by at least $250 million, and the same $250 million benchmark is applied in the 2024 filing (page 40). This unchanged threshold indicates that ExxonMobil continues to use a fixed quantitative rule to isolate “Identified Items,” preserving a stable framework for earnings transparency while still allowing the company to highlight and separate significant non‑operational events from core profitability.",

      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, Oracle’s cloud services revenue grew from 32 % of total revenue to 37 % of total revenue, while the share of cloud services within its overall cloud‑services and license‑support revenue rose from 47 % to 54 %. This upward shift shows that a larger and growing portion of Oracle’s business is now driven by cloud offerings, indicating accelerating adoption of its cloud platforms (particularly SaaS and OCI) across its customer base.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 55 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the lapping of elevated markdowns from the prior year, although partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories.

The change in direction was therefore driven by a mix of supply‑chain efficiency gains and higher‑margin business mix in fiscal 2024, versus continued expansion of lower‑margin formats and channel shifts in fiscal 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company provided a detailed definition of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, explaining how it is calculated from net income by excluding gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate-related impairment charges, and real estate-related depreciation, amortization, and accretion, while also adjusting for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company moved toward a more quantitative presentation, showing that Nareit FFO increased from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, a 14% increase. Additionally, the 2024 filing included Nareit FFO within a broader comparative table that tracked changes across three years (2022–2024), indicating a shift toward emphasizing trend analysis and performance metrics over definitional explanations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased by 14% to $5,233.2 million, up from $4,610.0 million in 2023, as shown in the reconciliation on page 47. This growth was driven by adjustments including the exclusion of straight-line revenue ($277.6 million), straight-line expense ($46.8 million), stock-based compensation ($192.7 million), and deferred tax adjustments ($88.7 million), while also incorporating gains from discontinued operations and noncontrolling interest adjustments. The presentation was streamlined in 2024 to remove the separate Consolidated AFFO metric, aligning reporting with management's capital allocation approach, but the underlying Nareit FFO (common stockholders) metric remained consistent in its reconciliation methodology.",

      "original_answer": "The company's approach to using market-based measures for expected volatility remained consistent from 2023 to 2024, as it continued to rely on implied volatility from market data for all options granted. Additionally, the method for determining expected option lives also remained unchanged, using a rolling 10-year average of historical exercise behavior. Therefore, there was no change in the company's reliance on market-based measures for these purposes during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's use of market-based measures for determining expected volatility on options granted remained consistent in methodology but evolved in the reported percentage. In 2023, the weighted average expected volatility was 31%, and in 2024, it was 27%, reflecting a decrease in the assumed volatility level. This adjustment aligns with the company's practice of using market-based measures of implied volatility, as noted in the fair value methods and assumptions section. The change indicates a refinement in their volatility estimation approach over the two years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GE's Corporate operating profit was negatively impacted by a $12.5 billion decrease in gains on purchases and sales of business interests, primarily due to the absence of a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of the BioPharma business in 2020. By 2023, this metric improved significantly, with Corporate operating profit increasing by $6.7 billion, of which $5.7 billion was attributed to higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, particularly from AerCap and GE HealthCare investments, although partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year gains on the Baker Hughes investment. This represents a transformation in both the magnitude and composition of these gains, indicating a strategic shift in asset management and investment realization.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the magnitude of GE’s gains on purchases and sales of business interests shifted dramatically: in 2022, the company recorded a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of its BioPharma business, driving a $12.5 billion increase in gains on purchases and sales of business interests; by 2023, those gains had fallen to $5.8 billion (primarily from retained and sold ownership interests in AerCap and GE Healthcare), while the overall corporate operating profit rose by $6.7 billion due to those higher gains and lower restructuring costs. Consequently, the sources of the gains evolved from a single large BioPharma divestiture in 2022 to a mix of smaller equity‑related gains and the non‑recurrence of prior‑year impairments and charges in 2023.",

By 2024, NFLX had implemented more structured hedging strategies, including cash flow hedges for foreign currency-denominated revenue, which resulted in a $124 million gain included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year. This indicates a shift from passive exposure to active management of foreign exchange risk, reducing volatility in reported revenues.",

During this period, the weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants, and rights increased slightly from $144.81 (2022) to $135.35 (2024), indicating a modest decrease in the average exercise price despite the overall reduction in outstanding awards. This trend suggests a shift toward lower-priced equity instruments or a higher proportion of awards with lower exercise prices in the later period.",

By 2023, the company continued this tenant-level impairment review but expanded the criteria to include the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations as a key impairment indicator. Additionally, in 2023, the company introduced a more detailed framework for measuring impairment, incorporating available market information relative to asset fair value alongside projected discounted future cash flows, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This represents a refinement in methodology and a more structured approach to impairment assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the Company's evaluation and treatment of tenant-related intangible assets remained focused on impairment assessment using projected undiscounted cash flows on a tenant-by-tenant basis, with impairment indicators including high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or cancellation of relationships. The Company continued to assess recoverability by comparing carrying amounts to projected future cash flows, and recorded impairment charges when cash flows were insufficient. In 2023, the Company also performed goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level using discounted cash flow analyses, which included tenant-related cash flow assumptions, and recognized $402 million in goodwill impairment charges (India and Spain). The Company was finalizing reviews of estimated useful lives of tower assets and intangible assets, with expected changes to depreciation and amortization impacting future periods, but no significant changes to the core impairment methodology occurred between 2022 and 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed nonmarketable investments totaling $5 million, grouped under the 'Other measurement basis' category alongside equity-method investments, with no change in value from the prior year. By 2024, while the specific dollar amount for nonmarketable investments was not quantitatively disclosed, the company expanded its qualitative disclosure, describing these investments as including interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities, and clarified that they are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more detailed discussion of counterparty risk concentration, which indirectly impacts the risk exposure of these nonmarketable investments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, TXN’s nonmarketable investment disclosures remained consistent in methodology—nonmarketable securities continue to be measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and gains/losses are recognized in other income (OI&E). However, the 2024 filing (page 40) expands the presentation of fair‑value hierarchy tables to include 2024 balances, showing that nonmarketable investments totaled $5 million (measured at cost) as of December 31, 2024, compared with $5 million as of December 31, 2023, indicating no material change in the measurement basis. Risk exposure related to these nonmarketable investments is still limited to credit risk from venture‑capital fund interests, with no Level 3 inputs used, and the company continues to disclose that unrealized gains/losses and credit losses are immaterial. Consequently, while the valuation approach has not shifted, the 2024 filing provides more granular fair‑value level disclosures and updated aggregate carrying amounts for nonmarketable investments.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Visa did not disclose any specific charge related to Lease Consolidation Costs. However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Visa's treatment of lease consolidation costs evolved from being excluded as a non-core, non-recurring item in fiscal 2023 to continuing to be explicitly excluded in fiscal 2024, maintaining its consistent approach of omitting these costs from performance metrics. This reflects a sustained financial reporting strategy of isolating operational performance by removing one-time restructuring expenses, reinforcing the company's emphasis on non-GAAP measures to provide clearer insights into underlying business trends.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 55 basis points primarily due to shifts into lower-margin formats and the impact of divested markets. In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by better price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. This reflects a significant turnaround in the company's gross margin performance over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Walmart’s consolidated gross profit rate rose modestly from roughly 24.3 % to 24.4 % (an increase of about 1 percentage point). The key drivers were price‑management initiatives and a shift toward higher‑margin merchandise categories in the U.S. segment, which offset lower‑margin mix shifts and supply‑chain cost pressures elsewhere. In the International segment, the gross profit rate fell in fiscal 2022 (‑55 bps) due to divestitures and lower‑margin formats, but later recovered as currency gains and improved margin mix offset those headwinds. Overall, the improvement reflects better pricing discipline and a higher‑margin business mix, while the earlier decline was driven by structural shifts and lower‑margin international operations.",

      "original_answer": "CMCSA's Domestic Wireless Revenue increased from $3.664 billion in 2023 to $4.273 billion in 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of $609 million, or approximately 16.6%. In the 2023 filing, the company cited an increase in the number of customer lines as the primary driver of this segment's growth during that year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, the year-over-year change in Domestic Wireless Revenue from 2023 to 2024 was **$609 million (16.7% increase)**, and the primary driver of growth in this segment was **the increase in the number of customer lines** (as cited in the Business Services Connectivity segment description on page 71, which states wireless revenue growth was \"primarily due to an increase in the number of customer lines\"). \n\n*(Note: The query requested \"2023 to 2024,\" but SEC filings report fiscal years ending December 31. The 2024 fiscal year (ended December 31, 2024) shows Domestic Wireless revenue of $4,273 million versus $3,664 million in 2023 (2023 fiscal year), representing a $609 million increase. The growth driver explicitly identified in the document is the rise in customer lines.)*",

By 2023, the floating-rate debt principal had decreased to $5.4 billion, or about 13% of the senior notes portfolio, with a corresponding potential annual interest expense increase of $54 million. This reflects a reduction in both the absolute level of floating-rate debt and the sensitivity of interest expense to rate changes.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2022 filing, the company reported $5.7 billion of floating‑rate debt and noted that a 1 % rise in the floating‑rate would increase annual interest expense by roughly $57 million. In the 2023 filing, after swapping LIBOR for SOFR, floating‑rate debt fell to $5.4 billion and the estimated impact of a 1 % rate increase was about $54 million. Thus, the floating‑rate principal declined slightly, and the potential annual interest expense from a one‑percentage‑point rate hike dropped from approximately $57 million to $54 million.",

      "question": "How did BMY's treatment and valuation of IPRD evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of impairment recognition and assumptions used in fair value estimation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, BMY disclosed an IPRD value of $11.4 billion, with $11.1 billion specifically tied to mavacamten, as part of its acquisition disclosures. By 2024, BMY had a more detailed and cautionary approach, emphasizing the vulnerability of IPRD to impairment and the need for annual reviews. The 2024 filing noted that impairment charges for IPRD and other intangible assets totaled $2.9 billion for that year, a significant increase from $101 million in 2022. This reflects a shift from primarily recognizing IPRD value in the year of acquisition to actively monitoring and adjusting it based on evolving expectations of future cash flows, regulatory timelines, and market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, BMY’s approach to IPRD valuation and impairment recognition remained anchored in its critical accounting policies for intangible assets, which require ongoing assessment of fair value using discounted cash flow models and significant assumptions about future revenues, market share, pricing, and probability of regulatory success. As disclosed on page 68, intangible assets—especially newly acquired ones tied to recent product launches or IPRD—are highly vulnerable to impairment, with fair value estimates incorporating variables such as competitive landscape changes, exclusivity timelines, and development costs. This framework persisted through 2024, with impairment charges for long-lived assets (including intangibles) totaling $2.9 billion in 2024 (page 68), reflecting heightened scrutiny of asset recoverability amid evolving market dynamics. Concurrently, the company continued to allocate substantial resources to late-stage pipeline developments (e.g., Breyanzi’s expanded FL indications and mavacamten for HCM), where fair value assessments for IPRD projects like those from the MyoKardia acquisition (page 117) relied on similar assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates. The consistent emphasis on rigorous valuation—particularly for assets tied to clinical outcomes and regulatory milestones—underscores that IPRD accounting practices remained stable, with impairment risks directly tied to the commercialization prospects of products like Breyanzi and Augtyro, whose FDA/EMA approvals and label expansions between 2024–2025 were contingent on the very assumptions used in their fair value estimates.",

In 2024, the reported income increased slightly to $170 million, while the adjusted income rose to $242 million. This reflects a $3 million increase in both the reported and adjusted figures, indicating a minor upward trend in income from equity investments when accounting for adjustments.",

The year‑over‑year change therefore was roughly $7 million reported and $5 million adjusted.",

This shift shows that the company’s revenue mix moved away from the OEM/Other category toward higher‑growth segments such as Data Center and Gaming, indicating a strategic emphasis on compute‑intensive markets rather than traditional OEM sales.",

By fiscal year 2024, Oracle continued to include unbilled receivables in accounts receivable and maintained similar revenue recognition timing under ASC 606. However, the 2024 disclosure reclassified interest revenue from financing contracts to 'non-operating expenses, net'—a more specific categorization than in 2022. This indicates a refinement in financial reporting terminology and structure, though the core treatment of unbilled receivables remained consistent.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's treatment of unbilled receivables has remained consistent between fiscal 2022 and 2024: it records unbilled receivables (included within accounts receivable) when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, and it continues to recognize revenue ratably for license support and hardware support contracts over their contractual periods.

This upward movement indicates that the company’s loss reserving for that accident year was initially understated and has since been adjusted upward, suggesting that prior loss estimates were too low and have been corrected.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel's CCG revenue was up 1% year-over-year, driven by strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, despite lower notebook ASPs due to a stronger consumer and education market segment. However, in 2023, CCG revenue decreased by 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year as customer inventory levels normalized. The decline reflects a significant shift in market conditions and demand dynamics over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue declined by 8% to $14.3 billion, driven by lower notebook and desktop volumes due to reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by higher desktop ASPs from increased commercial and gaming sales. This decline occurred alongside a broader 14% drop in total company revenue to $54.2 billion, with CCG's performance reflecting weaker consumer demand and inventory adjustments, though Intel noted some recovery in the second half of 2023. The revenue contraction was part of a strategic shift toward AI-focused growth and investments in IDM 2.0 manufacturing expansion.",

By 2024, these impacts had increased significantly, with a 25 basis point increase in URR leading to a $197 million increase in liability and a 1 basis point increase in WAC leading to a $220 million increase.

During this period, the gross margin percentage for Products rose from 36.3% in 2022 to 37.2% in 2024, while the gross margin percentage for Services increased more significantly from 71.7% in 2022 to 73.9% in 2024.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Apple's total gross margin percentage rose from **43.3% to 46.2%**, driven by higher gross margin percentages for both Products (36.3% → 37.2%) and Services (71.7% → 73.9%). The composition shifted toward Services, which contributed more to gross margin growth: Services gross margin increased to **$71.05 billion** in 2024 (up from $56.05 billion in 2023 and $56.05 billion in 2022), while Products gross margin remained relatively stable at **$109.63 billion** in 2024 (vs. $108.80 billion in 2023 and $114.73 billion in 2022).

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' financial commitment and disclosure around the Surmont asset in Canada evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of acquisition cost and contingent payment structure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips acquired the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $2.7 billion in cash, with an additional contingent payment arrangement of up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion USD) over five years. By 2024, the company disclosed that the final consideration for the Surmont acquisition was higher, at $3.0 billion USD (CAD $4.1 billion) after adjustments, though the contingent payment structure was not reiterated in the 2024 disclosure. This indicates a slight increase in the total acquisition cost with less clarity on the contingent payment in the following year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, ConocoPhillips’ commitment to the Surmont asset evolved from a contingent‑payment structure tied to WCS oil prices to a fully settled, cash‑based acquisition. In 2023, the company acquired the remaining 50 % working interest in Surmont for a total consideration of $2.955 billion, which included $2.635 billion cash paid at closing and a contingent payment of up to $0.4 billion CAD (approximately $0.3 billion USD) that was payable based on oil‑price thresholds and production targets. By the end of 2024, the contingent payments had been partially realized—$158 million USD was paid under the arrangement—and the final fair‑value allocation of the purchase was completed, with the contingent consideration recorded at $320 million on the acquisition date. Consequently, the 2024 financial statements no longer reflect any ongoing contingent payment liability for Surmont, marking the transition from a conditional, performance‑linked payment to a settled acquisition cost.",

The growth was primarily attributed to an 8% increase in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership due to plan mix changes and foreign exchange fluctuations.

The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",

The company continued to classify all debt investments as available‑for‑sale measured at fair value, using Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, while nonmarketable investments were not marked to market and were only adjusted for observable price changes or impairments.

This indicates a substantial upward revision in planned investments for NEER, reflecting a strategic shift or expansion in NEER's role within NEE's portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2022 and 2023 10-K filings, NEER's capital expenditure commitments for 2024 are projected to decline significantly from 2023 levels. In 2022, NEER's estimated 2024 capital expenditures were $570 million (as shown in the 2022 table on page 110), while in 2023, the projected 2024 capital expenditures for NEER are $570 million (as shown in the 2023 table on page 108, under \"NEER: (d)\" with \"Wind (e)\" at $55 million, \"Solar (f)\" at $10 million, \"Other clean energy (g)\" at $55 million, \"Nuclear, including nuclear fuel\" at $255 million, \"Rate-regulated transmission (h)\" at $705 million, and \"Other (i)\" at $225 million, totaling $1,570 million for 2024 in the 2023 forecast). However, the key change is that the 2023 forecast for 2024 shows a substantial decrease compared to the 2022 actual and projected figures, with the 2023 table indicating a much lower 2024 estimate for NEER's capital expenditures relative to prior years. Specifically, the 2023 forecast for 2024 capital expenditures at NEER is $1,570 million, but this represents a significant reduction from the 2022 actual and projected capital expenditures for NEER, which were $7,205 million in 2022 (as per the 2022 table on page 110). The question specifically asks about the change from 2022 to 2023 in the 2024 forecast year, and the data shows that the 2024 forecast for NEER in the 2023 filing (page 108) is $1,570 million, which is lower than the 2022 actual capital expenditures for NEER of $7,205 million, indicating a substantial decrease in the 2024 commitment from the 2022 level. The 2023 forecast for 2024 is presented as a projection that is lower than the 2022 actuals, reflecting a strategic reduction in planned capital spending for NEER in the 2024 timeframe.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG not only capitalized interest during construction but also explicitly detailed that the amount of interest capitalized during the year was based on interest rates in place during the construction period. This indicated a clear policy with a specific reference to how the interest was calculated. In 2023, while SPG maintained the same general policy of capitalizing interest during construction, the level of detail was reduced, as the company no longer explicitly referenced the use of interest rates in effect during the construction period when determining the amount to capitalize. This suggests a subtle shift toward less granular disclosure, even though the core capitalization policy remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 SPG’s accounting policy for capitalizing interest during construction remained unchanged – it continues to capitalize interest on projects while they are under construction until they are ready for their intended use, using the same methodology described in both years. However, the level of disclosure became more concise in 2023: the 2022 filing (pages 101‑105) provides a detailed narrative on the criteria for capitalizing interest, the amounts capitalized each year, and the related depreciation rules, whereas the 2023 filing (pages 96‑100) simply restates the same policy in a shorter paragraph without the detailed quantitative examples or the explicit “interest‑capitalized during each year is as follows” table. Thus, while the underlying policy is consistent, the 2023 disclosure offers less granular detail.",

By 2024, this estimate increased slightly to $58 billion, but the time horizon for earning half of this amount was extended from five to six years.

      "question": "How has ExxonMobil's consideration of industry margins in impairment assessments evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to their long-term price assumptions?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil explicitly stated that it did not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment, emphasizing that long-term prices must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. By 2024, the company's language shifted, placing greater emphasis on the dependency of future cash flows on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, signaling a more pronounced sensitivity to these metrics in impairment assessments. While both years reference industry margins, the 2024 filing reflects a stronger linkage between impairment indicators and sustained changes in margins, rather than just temporary volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to impairment assessments has consistently emphasized long-term price assumptions over short-term fluctuations, though the framing of these assumptions has evolved. In 2022, the company explicitly stated it does not view temporarily low prices or margins as indicative of impairment, stressing that long-term prices must support investment to meet global demand amid supply constraints and demand volatility. By 2024, this perspective remained anchored in the Corporate Plan’s Energy Outlook, which uses long-term commodity price and margin assumptions—including projected refining margins and greenhouse gas cost impacts—to assess cash flow recoverability. While the methodology for impairment testing (e.g., undiscounted cash flow modeling with discount rates reflecting asset characteristics) has remained consistent, the 2024 disclosures reaffirm that impairments are triggered only when events or changes in circumstances (such as sustained low prices or margin compression) align with a revised long-term view of prices and margins, not transient market dips. This reflects a continued focus on strategic, forward-looking assumptions rather than cyclical industry volatility.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde described its on-site product supply contracts as generally being total requirement contracts with terms typically ranging from 10–20 years, containing minimum purchase requirements and price escalation provisions. By 2024, the company maintained the same description of these contracts, including the 10–20 year term range, minimum purchase requirements, and price escalation provisions, indicating no structural changes to the contract framework. This suggests that Linde preserved its long-term, committed contract model for on-site supply without modification across the two reporting years.",

In 2024, the company revised its projections for Start-up capital expenditures downward, estimating a range of $50 million to $70 million for 2025.

In 2023, these figures decreased significantly to $3.4 billion in unrealized gross gains and $159.2 billion in fair value of securities in an unrealized gain position.

By 2023, while leasing prospects were still referenced, SPG placed increased emphasis on changes in economic and operating conditions, tenant financial health, and the intent and ability to hold assets when assessing the recoverability of investments. This reflects a more dynamic and condition-sensitive approach to leasing prospects in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, SPG’s assumptions regarding leasing prospects were refined to incorporate more current market data and economic conditions when evaluating investment properties for impairment and purchase accounting. The company increasingly relied on observable market rent comparisons, updated lease-up assumptions, and revised capitalization and discount rates to assess fair value, reflecting a more dynamic and market-responsive approach to impairment testing and acquisition accounting. This evolution allowed for more accurate valuation of in-place leases and land improvements, particularly in assessing the recoverability of asset carrying values amid shifting economic environments.",

This indicates an improvement in the company's operational performance over the period. The increase of more than $2 billion suggests that GM was able to enhance its earnings before interest and taxes, adjusted for certain items, reflecting stronger financial performance in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, streaming revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which acted as a drag on overall growth. However, in 2024, Netflix introduced a more detailed financial hedging strategy involving forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions. This strategy included the use of cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, and net investment hedges, with specific recognition of $124 million in hedging gains included in streaming revenues, indicating a proactive approach to mitigating currency risk.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on streaming revenues shifted from a negative drag in 2023—where unfavorable currency movements reduced streaming revenue growth—to a neutral or positive effect in 2024, as hedging gains were recognized in streaming revenue for the first time. To manage this risk, Netflix introduced a formal financial strategy in 2024 involving the use of derivative instruments, including forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue and fair value hedges for foreign-currency-denominated debt, to reduce earnings volatility from currency fluctuations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo's Parent company was subject to federal banking laws that limited covered transactions with its subsidiary banks to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in aggregate, with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length terms. Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the regulatory framework governing Wells Fargo’s parent‑company relationship with its subsidiary banks has become more restrictive around capital distributions and liquidity support. The Federal Reserve now requires large bank holding companies to submit annual capital plans and imposes explicit limits on dividend payments, share repurchases, and other capital distributions if capital, stress‑test, or liquidity metrics fall below defined triggers; additionally, any breach can compel the parent to divest subsidiaries or cease non‑bank activities. At the same time, the Support Agreement that ties the parent’s liquidity to its intermediate holding company introduces further constraints—if certain capital or liquidity ratios deteriorate, dividend payments from the IHC to the parent are prohibited, directly affecting the parent’s ability to fund debt service, dividends, and share buybacks. These rules collectively tighten oversight of capital distribution and reinforce the need for the parent to maintain sufficient liquidity buffers to support its banking subsidiaries.",

By 2024, the company expanded this approach to include estimated greenhouse gas emission costs even for jurisdictions without current greenhouse gas pricing policies, and specifically accounted for costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including the goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin and Pioneer assets by 2035.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil’s approach to incorporating greenhouse‑gas emission prices into its upstream production‑volume estimates using risk‑adjusted unproved reserves has remained consistent from 2022 through 2024.  In the 2022‑2024 notes on impairment and cash‑flow testing, the company repeatedly states that its cash‑flow models for reserve‑related assessments include “greenhouse gas emission prices” (or “estimated greenhouse gas emission costs”) as part of the projected operating costs, and that these costs are applied to both proved and risk‑adjusted unproved reserve quantities when estimating future cash flows.  The language is essentially unchanged across the 2022, 2023 and 2024 filings, indicating a continuous methodology that treats GHG emission pricing as a recurring cost input in the valuation of unproved reserves.",

      "question": "How did NextEra Energy's (NEE) approach to dismantlement obligations for NEER's wind and solar facilities evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of accounting treatment and expense allocation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE disclosed that NEER's asset retirement obligations (AROs) included dismantlement liabilities for certain wind and solar facilities, with the associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. For non-rate regulated operations, these costs were allocated to expense over the asset's estimated useful life, with changes in the ARO due to the passage of time recognized as an increase in the liability and as accretion expense, included in depreciation and amortization. By 2023, NEE further clarified that NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision specifically for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. This indicates a more explicit recognition and integration of dismantlement obligations into NEER’s depreciation methodology, showing a refinement in how these future liabilities are embedded into current financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, NextEra Energy’s dismantlement obligations for NEER’s wind and solar facilities continued to be accounted for as asset‑retirement obligations (AROs) that are capitalized as part of the related long‑lived assets and then allocated over the assets’ useful lives. For NEER’s rate‑regulated wind and solar projects, the associated asset‑retirement costs are charged to a regulatory liability/asset and amortized (or reversed) in accordance with the reserve‑amortization methodology used to meet the targeted regulatory ROE under the 2021 rate agreement; this reserve amortization can increase or decrease the carrying amount of the ARO and the related regulatory balance. For NEER’s non‑rate‑regulated wind and solar assets, the ARO is expensed over the useful life, with accretion expense recorded in depreciation and amortization, and any revisions to the estimated cash‑flow timing or amount are recognized as adjustments to the ARO (or to income when the cost is depleted). Thus, the accounting treatment remained consistent, but the amount of reserve amortization—and therefore the expense allocation—was updated each period to reflect the new depreciation studies and regulatory ROE targets approved in the 2021 rate agreement.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 97 basis points, mainly driven by higher sales. This indicates a continued improvement in operating efficiency, with the impact of pandemic-related costs diminishing further in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Walmart’s consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales fell from roughly **24.1 % to 23.6 %** – a decline of about **0.5 percentage points** (≈ 20 basis points).  \n\nThe key drivers of this improvement were:  \n\n* **Lower incremental COVID‑19 costs** – $1.9 billion of pandemic‑related expenses were avoided in 2022, compared with $3.2 billion in 2021.  \n* **Higher sales volume** – strong comparable‑sales growth spread the fixed cost base over a larger revenue base, reducing the expense ratio.  \n* **Reduced wage‑related investments** – while wages continued to rise, the increase was modest relative to the sales uplift, and the company noted “lower incremental COVID‑19 related costs” as a partial offset.  \n\nThese factors together offset the impact of higher supply‑chain costs and a shift toward lower‑margin merchandise mixes, resulting in a modest but measurable reduction in operating expenses as a share of net sales.",

In contrast, in 2023, the adjustment involved a tax benefit stemming from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a change in the geographic and operational focus of tax-related adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax reconsolidation event in 2022 to a Korea-specific deferred tax asset realization in 2023.",

In 2022, the adjustments were largely tied to pandemic‑related cost reductions, the Buick dealer transition, and Cruise restructuring, while in 2023 they reflected a voluntary separation program, Cruise stock‑incentive modifications, and the release of a Korean tax‑valuation allowance—tax‑related items that altered the composition of the adjustments.

      "question": "How has Wells Fargo's relationship with its subsidiary banks evolved in terms of capital distribution restrictions and liquidity support mechanisms between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Wells Fargo’s capital‑distribution rules and liquidity‑support mechanisms remained anchored in the same regulatory framework that limits fund transfers from subsidiary banks to the parent and its affiliates (generally capping covered transactions at 10 % of a subsidiary’s capital and surplus, and 20 % in the aggregate). The FRB’s “source‑of‑strength” policy still obligates the holding company to provide capital and liquidity support to its banks, and the OCC can impose assessments or force a stock sale if a subsidiary’s capital becomes impaired. Capital‑distribution restrictions were further tightened by the FRB’s enhanced‑supervision rules for large BHCs (including Basel III, leverage and liquidity ratios, and a G‑SIB surcharge), which require annual capital plans and impose limits on dividends and share‑repurchases when capital, stress‑test or liquidity triggers are breached. The 2024 “Support Agreement” reinforces these limits by restricting dividend payments from the intermediate holding company if liquidity or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, and it obligates the IHC to use transferred assets to support subsidiary banks in a resolution scenario. Thus, while the underlying legal limits have not changed materially, the supervisory expectations and the conditions under which capital can be distributed or liquidity support is provided have become more stringent and closely monitored.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEER's capital expenditures for wind energy were $3,777 million and for solar energy (including solar plus battery storage projects) were $2,011 million. In 2023, NEER's wind-related expenditures decreased to $2,820 million, while solar expenditures increased significantly to $3,270 million. This indicates a strategic shift from wind to solar energy investments over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the capital expenditure tables in Note 15 of the 2022 and 2023 10-K filings, NEER's wind and solar investment focus evolved as follows: In 2022, NEER allocated $9,835 million to wind ($2,820M in 2024) and $3,270 million to solar ($3,270M in 2024), with solar representing a significant portion of its clean energy spending. By 2023, NEER's estimated capital expenditures for wind decreased to $2,820 million (2024) while solar increased to $3,270 million (2024), reflecting a strategic shift toward greater solar investment relative to wind. This is further evidenced by the 2023 table showing solar commitments totaling $4,660 million (including $3,270M for 2024) versus wind's $3,545 million total, indicating a stronger near-term emphasis on solar development.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM acknowledged the risk of financial loss due to cybersecurity incidents, noting that while it regularly addresses such threats, no material adverse effects had occurred. By 2024, the company highlighted an increase in the sophistication and number of cyber threats, particularly with the emergence of AI-driven attack methods, and referenced industry-wide incidents like MOVEit as examples of events that could lead to financial loss. Despite these developments, IBM still reported that no cybersecurity incidents had resulted in a material adverse effect, indicating that while the threat landscape has evolved and potentially increased in risk, the company's mitigation strategies have kept the financial impact within manageable bounds.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's exposure to financial loss from cybersecurity incidents has remained material but unchanged in magnitude between 2022 and 2024, with both filings emphasizing that while no incident has yet had a material adverse effect, the risk has grown due to increasingly sophisticated threats—including AI-enabled attacks—and the expanding attack surface from remote work and third-party ecosystems. The 2024 filing specifically highlights heightened regulatory scrutiny, supply chain security requirements, and the potential for disruptions from critical infrastructure attacks (e.g., referencing incidents like MOVEit), but does not indicate any significant shift in the company's risk profile or financial exposure compared to 2022. IBM continues to invest in mitigation through continuous monitoring, patching, and compliance programs, yet reaffirms that such measures cannot eliminate risk entirely, leaving the company vulnerable to future incidents with potential financial, reputational, and regulatory consequences.",

      "original_answer": "LinkedIn's revenue growth rate significantly slowed down from 34% in fiscal year 2022 to 9% in fiscal year 2024. This indicates a moderation in LinkedIn's performance and expansion within Microsoft's broader product portfolio during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "LinkedIn's revenue growth rate increased from 34% in fiscal year 2022 (as reported in the 2022 10-K covering the year ended June 30, 2022) to 9% in fiscal year 2024 (as reported in the 2024 10-K covering the year ended June 30, 2024), indicating a significant slowdown in growth. This deceleration suggests LinkedIn's performance has weakened relative to other high-growth areas within Microsoft's portfolio, such as Azure (30% growth) and Dynamics 365 (24% growth), though it remains a strategic asset within the More Personal Computing segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, the net pension and OPEB benefit was $192 million, an increase from $177 million in 2020, driven by a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred losses. In 2024, the benefit was $190 million, up from $164 million in 2023, with the increase attributed to a higher expected return on assets and lower interest costs due to a decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. The benefit remained relatively stable in magnitude but evolved in terms of its underlying drivers, shifting from primarily asset return and interest cost dynamics in 2021 to a more pronounced impact of reduced obligations in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The net pension and OPEB benefit (excluding service cost) increased from $177 million in 2020 to $192 million in 2021—a modest rise driven mainly by a higher expected return on plan assets and lower interest costs, partially offset by greater amortization of deferred losses. Key drivers of this change were improved asset performance and a more favorable discount‑rate environment, which together boosted the benefit despite ongoing pension expense pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This represents a significant shift from a slight improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased 14 basis points from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, rising from 24.3% to 24.4%. The primary drivers of this improvement were price management that aligned with competitive historic gaps and cost inflation, as well as a favorable merchandise mix that offset higher supply‑chain costs.",

      "question": "How did the treatment and compensation expense classification of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about ConocoPhillips' approach to PSU compensation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips disclosed that for performance periods beginning in 2018 or later, recipients of cash-settled PSUs received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense, with the accrued reinvested dividend paid at the time of settlement. In 2024, the company maintained the same structure, reiterating that for performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent, which was also charged to compensation expense and paid at settlement. This consistency indicates that the company did not alter its approach to dividend equivalents for these PSUs between the two years, maintaining a stable policy in how compensation is recognized and distributed for long-term incentive plans.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips transitioned cash‑settled performance share units (PSUs) from being classified as liabilities with accrued reinvested dividend equivalents charged to compensation expense to being settled in cash (and ultimately, beginning in 2020, settled in stock) with no remaining unrecognized compensation cost. The 2024 filing shows “no remaining unrecognized compensation cost to be recorded” for the unvested cash‑settled PSUs, indicating that the company has completed the settlement of these awards and ceased recognizing ongoing compensation expense for them. This reflects a shift toward simplifying its PSU compensation approach, moving away from periodic accruals and toward settled, stock‑based or cash‑based payouts with no future expense recognition.",

This indicates a minor reduction in the financial impact of debt repayments or retirements in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease suggests that the company may have experienced fewer or less costly early debt retirements during the 2023 period.",
      "llm_answer": "The loss on retirement of long‑term obligations declined sharply from $0.4 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction in debt‑retirement costs.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney provided a detailed explanation of its revenue recognition methodology for affiliate fees, stating that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber numbers. Fixed license fees were recognized ratably over the contract term, and minimum guaranteed fees were recognized ratably over the guaranteed period, with excess fees recognized after the guarantee was exceeded. By fiscal 2024, the specific revenue recognition methodology was no longer detailed in the disclosures. Instead, affiliate fees were mentioned in the context of fluctuating with MVPD subscriber levels and were listed among the significant revenue sources for the Sports segment, particularly related to ESPN-branded channels. This indicates a shift from detailed recognition methodology in 2022 to a more contextual and segment-focused disclosure in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2024, Disney’s treatment of affiliate fees shifted from recognizing them as revenue based on per-subscriber rates and fixed license fees ratably over the contract term (with minimum guarantees recognized straight-line and excess recognized when earned) to a more detailed methodology that emphasizes revenue recognition for affiliate agreements as earned when the underlying subscriber counts are met, while still applying minimum guaranteed fee recognition ratably and deferring excess until the guarantee is exceeded. Disclosures now explicitly tie affiliate fee revenue to subscriber levels and minimum guarantee accounting, and contextualize the treatment within broader revenue recognition policies for affiliate fees, advertising, and content licensing, reflecting a more transparent and standardized approach to revenue recognition across its segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde identified cost pass-through as a 2% contributor to sales changes, indicating a limited but measurable impact of cost recovery mechanisms. By 2023, the company emphasized a structural advantage in its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, suggesting a more strategic and intentional reliance on cost pass-through as a financial management tool. This evolution indicates a shift from a reactive cost adjustment to a more proactive and contractual approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Linde increasingly leveraged cost pass-through mechanisms to offset inflationary pressures, particularly in energy costs, by contractually billing customers for energy cost variances—most notably in the EMEA segment where cost pass-through contributed 6% to sales growth in 2021 and remained a key driver in 2023. This approach reflects a strategic emphasis on preserving margins amid fluctuating input costs, as evidenced by its integration into pricing and volume strategies across segments, with adjusted operating profit rising 15% in 2023 despite volume declines, underscoring its reliance on pass-through mechanisms to manage cost volatility.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a transformation in performance from a decline to an improvement in gross margin trends.",
      "llm_answer": "The gross profit rate increased by 40 basis points from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024. The key drivers were Walmart U.S.’s pricing strategies that absorbed cost increases rather than passing them fully to customers, a shift toward higher‑margin private‑label and grocery categories, and lapping higher markdowns and supply‑chain cost pressures experienced in the prior year. These actions helped lift gross profit as a percentage of net sales.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to higher inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges.

In 2023, GMI's revenue remained nearly flat with only a $2 million change (0%), but the variance components shifted significantly: volume contributed +$0.5 billion, mix decreased by $0.3 billion, cost reduced the revenue by $0.3 billion, and other factors added $0.1 billion. This reflects a transition from growth driven by pricing and mix in 2022 to a more neutral position in 2023 with offsetting effects across variance components.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2023, GMI’s revenue growth was driven primarily by a $0.5 billion favorable volume effect and a $0.1 billion favorable mix effect, while cost pressures (mainly higher warranty and EV‑related charges) and unfavorable other factors partially offset these gains.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Netflix reported paid net membership additions of 29,529 thousand, a significant 232% increase compared to 2022, indicating rapid subscriber growth. In 2024, rather than disclosing specific membership figures, the company provided detailed information about its expanded use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing. This shift in disclosure suggests that Netflix anticipated sustained international growth in memberships and was proactively managing financial exposure to currency fluctuations, which could significantly impact revenue from global streaming. The detailed hedging strategy in 2024 reflects a strategic evolution from simply reporting growth to actively managing the financial implications of that growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s 2024 foreign‑exchange hedging strategy was expanded to cover more of its foreign‑currency‑denominated content licensing and production cash flows, and the gains from those cash‑flow hedges were now being recognized directly in “Revenues” (rather than being deferred in AOCI) as the underlying content assets were amortized. This shift reflects a more proactive approach to stabilizing revenue growth and protecting the forecasted cash flows that underpin its paid‑membership expansion targets, allowing the company to better align its hedging activities with the timing of its membership‑addition expectations compared with the more limited hedging exposure in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney's amortization policy for licensed rights to film and television content applied to content used on Linear Networks or DTC streaming services. By 2024, the company expanded the scope to include platforms such as the domestic ESPN television network and International Sports Channels, in addition to Linear Networks and DTC services. This indicates a broader application of the amortization policy across more platforms, reflecting a strategic evolution in how licensed content is managed and monetized as part of a group.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, Disney's amortization approach for licensed rights to film and television content remains consistent between 2022 and 2024 in that licensed content is amortized over its useful life or the number of times it is expected to be aired, typically using an accelerated or straight-line basis. However, the key change lies in the **monetization grouping** used for impairment testing and amortization patterns. In the 2024 filing (page 87), Disney explicitly states that content initially intended for DTC streaming services or Linear Networks is generally classified as a \"group\" asset, while content intended for theatrical release or third-party licensing is classified as \"individual.\" This classification directly impacts amortization: group content is amortized based on projected usage (often accelerating or straight-lining), whereas individual content uses a revenue-based ratio method. The 2022 filing (page 87) similarly notes that content distributed on Disney+ (post-2020) is typically treated as group content, but the 2024 filing reinforces that this grouping framework—where DTC/Linear distribution defines the \"group\" for amortization and impairment—has been maintained without fundamental change. Thus, while the *structure* of grouping and amortization methods remains unchanged, the *application* now explicitly includes DTC streaming services as a core component of the \"group\" monetization strategy for content released after fiscal 2019, ensuring consistent treatment of streaming-driven revenue streams.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Embedded Processing segment had a goodwill value of $172 million, indicating its relatively smaller asset base compared to other segments. By 2024, the segment's role had notably expanded, as it contributed approximately 16% of the company's total revenue. This shift suggests an increased strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing, particularly through products like microcontrollers, processors, and wireless connectivity solutions. The rise from a segment with modest goodwill to one generating a significant portion of revenue reflects a meaningful evolution in its importance to TXN's overall business model.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures, the Embedded Processing segment's financial significance has grown materially from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, Embedded Processing revenue was $2.53 billion (representing approximately 16% of total revenue), while in 2024 it increased to $2.53 billion (explicitly stated as 16% of total revenue), and the segment was highlighted as one of TI's two core reportable segments alongside Analog. This growth is further underscored by the strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing as a key driver of long-term free cash flow per share growth, with the company noting that customers' software investments in these products increase relationship longevity and create recurring revenue opportunities. The segment's revenue now represents a larger, more strategically important portion of TI's overall business compared to prior periods.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the cost of natural gas resulted in a loss of $27 million in SO's derivatives in non-designated hedging relationships. By 2024, this relationship had reversed, with the cost of natural gas contributing a gain of $94 million to the same category. This indicates a significant shift in how natural gas pricing affected the company's financial instruments over this period. The change reflects a reversal in risk exposure, where previously rising natural gas costs hurt the company financially through derivatives, but more recently, those costs have benefited the company's position.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of natural‑gas price volatility on Southern Company’s (SO) financial‑derivatives position shifted markedly between 2022 and 2024. In 2022 the company recorded a $117 million pre‑tax loss on non‑designated energy‑related derivatives (mostly from natural‑gas positions) and a $27 million loss in cost of natural gas, reflecting the sharp rise in gas prices. By 2024 those losses had largely reversed: the same line items showed a $94 million pre‑tax gain on natural‑gas derivatives and a $94 million gain in cost of natural gas, indicating that falling gas prices and effective hedging reduced the earlier exposure. This swing signals a diminishing price‑risk environment and a more favorable hedging outcome, suggesting that SO’s risk management is adapting to calmer gas‑price conditions and lower counterparty‑credit risk.",

This indicates a substantial reduction in the amortization burden over this period, suggesting a potential shift in the company's debt management strategy, such as refinancing or restructuring of acquired debt.",
      "llm_answer": "The amortization expense on acquired debt decreased from $35 million in 2022 to $3 million in 2024, reflecting a substantial reduction in the amortization of debt‑related costs. This decline indicates that the company is managing its debt more efficiently, likely by refinancing or reducing higher‑cost borrowings, and suggests a more favorable debt‑management strategy over the period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney detailed its revenue recognition methodology for Affiliate Fees, explaining that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber counts, with guaranteed fees recognized ratably over the contract term. By 2024, the company disclosed specific financial figures showing total Affiliate Fees reached $17,525 million, with $7,739 million attributed to Entertainment and $10,796 million to Sports. This indicates a shift from detailed policy description in 2022 to quantitative disclosure and segmentation in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to 2024, Disney’s reporting of Affiliate Fees remained consistent in methodology—recognizing them as revenue when programming is provided based on per‑subscriber rates, with fixed‑fee contracts recognized ratably and any excess over minimum guarantees recognized when the guarantee is exceeded.  The 2024 Form 10‑K (page 92) shows total affiliate fee revenue of **$16.1 billion**, up from $16.9 billion in 2023 and $17.6 billion in 2022, reflecting the continued use of the same recognition approach but with modest growth in the underlying fee amounts.  (All figures are drawn from the segment revenue tables on pages 92‑93 of the 2024 filing and the comparable tables for 2023 and 2022.)",

This consistent growth in Payment Network Revenue—rising from $14,358 million in 2022 to $15,824 million in 2023 and further to $17,335 million in 2024—indicates a stable and sustained performance in the company’s core payment services over the two-year period.",

In contrast, for 2024, the company reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) decline of (10.5)% for the comparison of 2023 vs. 2022 and a positive 3.0% for the 2024 vs. 2023 period. This indicates a significant shift from stable growth in 2023 to a notable decline in core sales growth in early 2024, followed by a partial recovery later in the year. The fluctuation suggests volatility in the company's underlying business performance during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in Danaher’s non‑GAAP Core Sales Growth shows a modest rebound: after a sharp decline in 2023, core sales grew about 3% year‑over‑year in 2024 (up from a 10.5% decline in 2023), indicating that the company’s underlying business is stabilizing and beginning to recover.

This decline was primarily driven by a $602 million decrease in Engineering segment sales, which included $894 million from projects in Russia in 2022 compared to only $238 million in 2023.

      "question": "How did the factors influencing Walmart's Gross Profit Rate evolve between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and what were the key drivers behind the contrasting trends in each year?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's Gross Profit Rate increased by 65 basis points, driven by favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses, despite price investments and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 155 basis points, primarily due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This shift reflects a significant change in the drivers of gross profit, moving from improvement due to internal efficiencies and product mix in 2022 to external pressures and cost increases in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 the gross‑profit rate moved in opposite directions: it fell sharply in 2022 (down 68 bps) because of higher fuel sales, cost inflation and supply‑chain pressures, then rebounded in 2023 (up 20 bps) as supply‑chain efficiencies and a more favorable sales mix offset lower‑margin formats. The key drivers were therefore (1) inflation, fuel‑mix and markdown pressures that depressed 2022 margins, and (2) supply‑chain improvements and a shift toward higher‑margin categories that lifted 2023 margins.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for approximately $2.7 billion in cash, with potential future contingent payments of up to $0.4 billion CAD. By 2024, the company had fully integrated Surmont into its Canada segment, now owning 100% of the working interest, with the final consideration reported at $3.0 billion CAD $4.1 billion after adjustments. This represents a strategic consolidation of ownership in the Surmont asset.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ strategic position in the Surmont oil sands asset evolved from a 50% working interest to 100% ownership following the October 2023 acquisition of the remaining stake from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. The final purchase price was $3.0 billion CAD (approximately $2.955 billion USD), comprising $2.635 billion cash and up to $0.4 billion CAD in contingent consideration tied to WCS price thresholds. By the end of Q1 2024 the company finalized the purchase‑price allocation, assigning roughly $3.082 billion to oil‑and‑gas properties and recording a $320 million fair‑value for the contingent liability. Ongoing contingent payments under the arrangement have already totaled $158 million USD through 2024, reflecting the company’s continued financial commitment to the asset.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Company monitored tenant-related intangible assets for impairment based on high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. By 2023, the Company expanded its criteria to include an additional indicator: the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations. This reflects a more comprehensive approach to assessing impairment risk, incorporating both behavioral and financial indicators of tenant health.",
      "llm_answer": "The Company’s monitoring of tenant‑related intangible assets remained focused on indicators such as high turnover, loss of contracts, non‑renewal or termination of relationships, and the ability of tenants to meet contractual obligations. In 2023 it introduced additional assessment criteria, including the evaluation of projected undiscounted future cash flows and the use of available market information to determine recoverability, and it began measuring any impairment loss based on discounted cash‑flow estimates rather than solely on undiscounted cash flows. This evolution reflects a more detailed impairment methodology that incorporates both cash‑flow and market‑based fair‑value considerations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Theme Park Admissions was described as a key revenue stream under the Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP) segment, specifically listing 'Sales of tickets for admission to our theme parks and for premium access to certain attractions (e.g. Genie+ and Lightning Lane).' It was presented alongside other DPEP revenue categories like merchandise, food and beverage sales, and resort stays. By 2024, Theme Park Admissions was explicitly quantified at $11,171 million and categorized under the 'Experiences' segment, showing a distinct and separate reporting structure from other revenue streams such as Subscription fees ($18,796 million) and Advertising ($7,506 million). This indicates a shift toward more granular and segmented financial reporting, with Theme Park Admissions now clearly distinguished and directly measured against other major revenue categories.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Theme Park Admissions revenue increased from $8.6 billion to $11.2 billion, reflecting higher park attendance and pricing, and its share of total revenue grew from about 10% of total segment revenue in 2022 to roughly 12% in 2024. While still a smaller component than entertainment, sports or experiences revenue, admissions now represent a larger, steadily expanding portion of the Company’s overall income stream.",

      "question": "How has the proportion of Oracle's cloud services revenues relative to total revenues evolved between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic direction?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, while in fiscal 2024, this proportion increased to 37%. This indicates a strategic shift toward cloud-based offerings, as Oracle emphasizes growth in cloud infrastructure and customer migration to the Oracle Cloud.",
      "llm_answer": "The proportion of Oracle’s cloud services revenue rose from 25% of total revenue in fiscal 2022 to 32% in fiscal 2023 and then to 37% in fiscal 2024. This steady increase shows that Oracle is shifting its business focus toward cloud‑based offerings and positioning cloud services as a larger share of its overall revenue stream.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Adobe disclosed that unrealized credit-related losses were recorded to 'other income (expense), net' in the Consolidated Statements of Income with a corresponding allowance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2024, the company maintained the same accounting treatment for unrealized credit-related losses, indicating consistency in recognition and presentation methodology. However, the context of significant financial activity—such as the $1 billion non-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition—suggests increased scrutiny on financial disclosures, though this did not alter the accounting approach for credit-related losses.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe’s approach to credit‑related losses on its marketable‑debt investments remained consistent between fiscal 2023 and 2024: it continues to record unrealized credit‑related losses directly in income with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet, but in both years it concluded that no such allowance was needed and therefore recognized no credit‑loss expense. The presentation of these losses (recorded in “other income (expense)” with an offsetting allowance in “allowance for credit‑related losses”) and the related disclosures in Note 5 (Fair Value Measurements) were unchanged across the two periods.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, General Motors reported an Automotive Interest Expense of $950 million. In 2023, this expense slightly increased to $987 million. This indicates that the company's interest burden related to its automotive operations remained relatively stable, with a modest increase of $37 million, or approximately 3.9%. The small change in interest expense suggests that GM's financing strategy for its automotive segment did not undergo significant alterations during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2022 10‑K (page 79) the “Automotive interest expense” line shows $950 million for 2022 and $1,098 million for 2021 – a decline of roughly $148 million (about 13 %).  This reduction reflects GM’s strategy of lowering debt‑related costs, refinancing higher‑rate borrowings, and repaying portions of its floating‑rate senior notes, which together eased the expense burden and improved overall financial flexibility.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, HD acquired $1,827 million in lease assets through new operating lease liabilities and $336 million through new finance lease liabilities. In fiscal 2024, these figures changed to $1,384 million for operating leases and $153 million for finance leases. This indicates a significant decrease in both categories, especially in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on finance leases and moderating overall lease-driven asset acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, HD’s operating‑lease assets grew from $6.94 bn to $7.88 bn and operating‑lease liabilities rose from $7.17 bn to $7.63 bn, while finance‑lease assets held near $2.84 bn and finance‑lease liabilities fell slightly from $3.05 bn to $2.75 bn.  This expansion reflects a deliberate increase in lease‑based growth, as the company added new operating‑lease assets (particularly in its primary merchandising segments) and modestly reduced its finance‑lease exposure, indicating a strategic shift toward leveraging operating leases to support its acquisition‑driven growth (e.g., the SRS purchase) while maintaining a relatively stable financing structure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Danaher reported a core sales decline of 10.5%, indicating a contraction in sales from existing businesses. In 2024, the company experienced a core sales growth of 3.0%, showing a turnaround from the prior year. This shift from decline to growth suggests an improvement in the company's underlying business performance, potentially reflecting stronger demand, pricing power, or operational execution.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher's core sales growth turned positive in 2024, rising 3% year-over-year (up from a 10% decline in 2023), driven by strong performance in Diagnostics (2% total sales growth, 3% core growth) and Life Sciences (2.5% total sales growth, though core sales declined 2%). This marks a reversal from the double-digit core sales declines seen in 2023, indicating improving underlying business momentum, particularly in high-growth markets and core segments, despite ongoing headwinds from currency and weak demand in bioprocessing. The 3% core sales growth in 2024 suggests the company is emerging from its post-pandemic demand slump, with core growth now outpacing total sales growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil disclosed future dismantlement costs as part of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, noting that this measure includes costs for dismantlement, abandonment, and rehabilitation obligations. However, the company emphasized that the measure is based on first-day-of-the-month average prices, which can cause significant variability in cash flows year to year. In 2023, ExxonMobil maintained the same inclusion of future dismantlement costs but explicitly stated that the standardized measure 'depends on' these pricing assumptions, indicating a more direct acknowledgment of the sensitivity of dismantlement cost estimates to price fluctuations. This evolution shows a shift in how the company characterizes the relationship between external pricing and its long-term cost obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, ExxonMobil’s standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows declined from $189.6 billion to $116.4 billion for consolidated subsidiaries and from $69.2 billion to $37.9 billion for equity companies. This reduction was primarily driven by lower future cash inflows and higher future income tax expenses, both of which are directly tied to pricing assumptions used in the discounted cash‑flow calculations. Consequently, the measure’s sensitivity to price fluctuations increased, making it more dependent on those assumptions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER had approximately 28,759 MW of contracted generation capacity with long-term power sales agreements, and only 1,842 MW of merchant generation assets that required active marketing and hedging. By 2024, NEER's disclosed future revenue commitments showed a significant shift, with $3,945 million in 2025 declining sharply to $370 million by 2029 and beyond, indicating a reduced long-term financial exposure and likely a strategic shift away from long-term contracted generation or a reclassification of assets. This reflects a transformation in NEER's business model under NEE, moving away from long-term commitments toward shorter-term or market-driven strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, NEE's NEER segment shifted toward a higher proportion of contracted generation assets, as evidenced by the table of contracted capacity and minimum payments (page 110). In 2024, contracted capacity commitments totaled $3,945 million for 2025, declining sharply to $815 million for 2026 and further to $250 million for 2027, while merchant‑type commitments were relatively small ($70 million in 2029 and $370 million thereafter). This reflects an increasing reliance on long‑term power‑sales agreements and firm capacity contracts, with the contracted obligations representing the majority of NEER’s future revenue stream, whereas merchant generation assets represent only a modest, declining share of its portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, while in fiscal 2024, this proportion increased to 37%. This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on cloud-based offerings, aligning with Oracle's strategy to provide flexible deployment options and migrate customer workloads to the Oracle Cloud. The consistent rise in cloud services' revenue share suggests that Oracle's pivot toward cloud technologies is gaining traction and is expected to continue.",
      "llm_answer": "The proportion of Oracle's cloud services revenues relative to total revenues increased from 37% in fiscal 2023 to 37% in fiscal 2024 (the document notes that cloud services represented 37% of total revenues in fiscal 2024, up from 32% in fiscal 2023). This shift indicates a growing contribution of cloud services to the company's overall revenue base. Strategically, the rise underscores Oracle's emphasis on expanding its cloud‑based offerings and suggests that future growth and margin improvement will increasingly depend on continued expansion of its cloud services and related support contracts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Boeing's Core Operating Loss decreased by $2,833 million compared with 2022, indicating an improvement in segment operating performance. However, in 2024, the Core Operating Loss increased sharply by $9,982 million compared with 2023, signaling a significant deterioration in performance. This reversal reflects a shift from operational improvement to substantial operational challenges across key business segments, particularly BCA and BDS, driven by production disruptions, program losses, and contract adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's Core Operating Loss widened dramatically from $(1,829) million in 2023 to $(11,811) million in 2024—a more than six‑fold increase—driving the operating margin down from (2.4 %) to (17.8 %). This deterioration signals that the company's segment operating performance weakened sharply in 2024, with losses expanding across Commercial Airplanes, Defense & Space, and the unallocated items, reflecting lower deliveries, higher reach‑forward charges, and increased production disruptions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP accounted for dry hole expenses under the successful efforts method of accounting, where exploratory well costs are capitalized pending evaluation and expensed as dry holes if economically recoverable reserves are not found. This is detailed in the 2023 disclosures regarding oil and gas exploration and development. By 2024, COP provided explicit financial figures showing a significant increase in dry hole expenses, rising from $109 million in 2023 to $251 million in 2024. This indicates a notable increase in the number or cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells during the year, reflecting a shift toward more aggressive or riskier exploration activities or changes in success rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ treatment of dry hole expenses remained consistent with its historical accounting approach, continuing to expense such costs as incurred under the successful efforts method. In 2024, dry hole expenses were reported as part of exploration expenses, totaling $40 million (compared to $109 million in 2023), reflecting a decrease in dry hole costs. These expenses were not capitalized and were included in \"General and administrative; geological and geophysical, lease rental, and other\" expenses, maintaining the same categorization as in prior years. The company continues to expense exploratory well costs as dry holes when it judges further investment unwarranted, without separate disclosure of dry hole expenses beyond their inclusion in total exploration expenditures.",

      "question": "How did the change in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Netflix's hedging strategy or exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the change in unrealized gains (losses) on cash flow hedges was a loss of $120,023 thousand. By 2024, this figure transformed into a significant unrealized gain of $914,369 thousand. This indicates a major shift in Netflix's hedging strategy or exposure, likely involving increased or restructured hedging activity that led to a reversal from a net loss to a substantial net gain over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2024 10‑K (page 64), the “OCI hedging gains” line shows a net deferred tax liability of **$220,009 (thousands)** as of December 31 2024, compared with **$35,707 (thousands)** of OCI hedging losses (a valuation‑allowance offset) as of December 31 2023. This shift indicates that the company’s cash‑flow hedge positions moved from an unrealized loss position in 2023 to an unrealized gain position in 2024, reducing the deferred tax liability for those hedges. The change suggests that Netflix’s hedging program generated net gains during 2024, reflecting either more favorable foreign‑exchange contracts or a reassessment of hedge effectiveness, and that the related tax benefit is now being recognized in the deferred tax balance.",

      "question": "How did Comcast's approach to audience ratings guarantees in advertising contracts evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what impact did this have on revenue recognition timing?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast highlighted that lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, particularly for NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's channels, had an adverse effect on advertising sales and rates. The company noted that audience measurement methodologies could negatively affect advertising revenue if they did not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. By 2023, the company formalized its approach to advertising contracts by disclosing that it guarantees audience ratings for advertisements in some contracts. If a shortfall occurs in meeting these guaranteed ratings, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units within one year. This represents a shift from merely identifying audience ratings as a risk factor to actively managing the financial implications through contractual guarantees and revenue deferral policies.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast’s audience‑rating guarantees in advertising contracts remained largely unchanged from 2022 to 2023, but the company began deferring a portion of advertising revenue when guaranteed ratings were not met, recognizing the shortfall as additional advertising units within the same reporting period. This adjustment delayed the timing of revenue recognition for affected contracts, causing a modest shift of revenue to later periods rather than immediate recognition in the year the ads aired.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips acquired the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $2.7 billion in cash, with an additional contingent payment arrangement of up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion) over five years. By 2024, the company disclosed the final consideration as $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion) after customary adjustments, indicating a slight increase in the total acquisition cost compared to the initial 2023 disclosure, though the contingent payment structure remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips' financial commitment and disclosure around the Surmont asset evolved from a contingent payment structure tied to WCS crude oil prices to full ownership and subsequent contingent payments under a new arrangement. In 2023, the company acquired the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for $3.0 billion CAD ($2.955 billion USD), which included $2.635 billion in cash paid and $320 million in fair value of contingent consideration. This contingent consideration was structured as up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion USD) over a five-year term, with payments triggered by WCS pricing exceeding $52 per barrel, subject to production targets. By 2024, following the acquisition, ConocoPhillips fully owned Surmont and made payments of $158 million USD under the contingent arrangement during the year, reflecting the ongoing financial commitment tied to the asset's performance. The company accounted for the acquisition as a business combination under ASC 805, with the contingent consideration initially measured at fair value and adjusted as needed.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AbbVie disclosed an upfront payment of $130 million related to the acquisition of Syndesi Therapeutics SA, with additional future contingent payments mentioned but not quantified. By 2024, AbbVie provided a significantly more detailed disclosure, specifying that the agreement includes potential additional payments of up to $870 million contingent on development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. This represents a substantial increase in the visibility and scale of financial commitments tied to the acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "The nature and scale of AbbVie's financial commitments related to the Syndesi Therapeutics acquisition evolved from a $130 million upfront payment recorded as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense in 2022, with the agreement also providing up to $870 million in future payments tied to development, regulatory and commercial milestones; by 2024, the company continued to reference this contingent consideration but disclosed no new upfront cash outflows or significant changes in the milestone structure, indicating that the financial commitment remained anchored to the original $130 million investment plus potential milestone payments, while the scale of related expenses was now reflected within broader acquisition‑related spending that totaled $3.0 billion in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment contributed 2% to organic sales growth. In 2024, the segment's organic sales growth remained at a low single-digit level, indicating minimal change in its growth trajectory. Despite this stability, the segment's performance lagged behind other business units like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, which showed higher growth rates, suggesting that Baby, Feminine & Family Care was not a primary growth driver in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The organic sales growth for the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment was low single‑digit (approximately 2 % growth in net sales, with organic sales up about 2 % year‑over‑year), reflecting modest expansion in that category. This modest growth contributed to the overall 4 % organic sales growth for the company and supported Procter & Gamble’s broader strategy of achieving organic sales growth above market rates, underpinning its long‑term goal of mid‑to‑high single‑digit core EPS growth and strong cash generation.",

In fiscal year 2024, this growth rate slowed to $3,142 million, or 10%.

This substantial growth in earnings directly contributed to retained earnings, which rose from a beginning balance of $28,053 million in 2022 to $40,070 million in 2023 before dividends and other adjustments.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Corporate G&A expenses increased by $113 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by mark-to-market adjustments associated with certain compensation programs. In contrast, the 2024 increase of $359 million compared to 2023 was mainly due to $432 million in transaction expenses linked to the acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including reduced mark-to-market impacts of key employee compensation programs. This reflects a shift from compensation-driven growth in 2023 to acquisition-driven growth in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The Corporate G&A expenses rose sharply in 2024, climbing $359 million from 2023’s $357 million to $716 million, driven largely by $432 million of transaction costs tied to the Marathon Oil acquisition and other compensation‑related adjustments.  By contrast, 2023’s G&A of $357 million was lower and reflected only routine compensation and mark‑to‑market impacts, so the increase from 2023 to 2024 represents both a larger absolute dollar amount and a higher composition of G&A that includes significant transaction‑related expenses.",

However, in the 2024 10-K filing, the company's projected spending on Start-up capital projects for 2025 was lowered to a range of $50 million to $70 million.

By 2024, the segment maintained its dual focus on solar and storage but provided more detailed emphasis on specific products like Powerwall and Megapack, with Powerwall being explicitly positioned for homes and small commercial facilities, and Megapack targeting large-scale commercial and utility customers with installations reaching gigawatt-hour capacities. Additionally, Tesla introduced real-time energy control and optimization platforms to manage these systems remotely. This indicates a strategic evolution toward more sophisticated integration and software capabilities in energy storage solutions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment shifted its focus from primarily solar retrofit systems and residential solar offerings toward a stronger emphasis on energy storage products and integrated solutions. The 2022 filing describes selling \"retrofit solar energy systems\" and \"Solar Roof\" to consumers and channel partners, while the 2024 filing highlights energy storage products (Powerwall, Megapack) as core offerings, detailing their modular design, grid-interconnection capabilities, and software-driven dispatch functions, alongside continued solar energy system sales but with less emphasis on retrofit systems. The segment's description also expanded to include \"energy storage products\" as a distinct category within energy generation and storage, reflecting a strategic pivot toward battery storage as a primary growth driver.",

By 2024, this price increased to $54.18 per share, while the aggregate intrinsic value decreased to $165 million. This indicates that although the exercise price per share significantly increased, the intrinsic value of exercisable options declined over the period.",

By 2024, the total backlog slightly declined to $435,175 million, with contractual backlog increasing modestly to $498,802 million, while unobligated backlog decreased to $22,534 million.

However, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the company elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for the SB405 PSC and relinquished the block. This marks a shift from active exploration and evaluation to a strategic decision to discontinue further investment in the block.",

However, in the fourth quarter of 2024, the company elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for the SB405 PSC and relinquished the block. This decision was part of its broader strategic evaluation of international exploration opportunities, as reflected in its 2024 disclosures where it maintained exploration interests in other Malaysian blocks (like Block WL4-00 and SK304) but explicitly discontinued further development plans for SB405.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT's forward-looking statements included references to the 'Pending ATC TIPL Transaction' in relation to its substantial leverage and debt service obligations, indicating a specific transactional context for its financial risk disclosures. By 2024, the disclosure no longer mentioned the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction, suggesting that the company had either completed or abandoned this specific agreement, and instead focused on broader financing activities and debt service obligations without tying them to a named transaction. This evolution reflects a shift from a transaction-specific risk to a more generalized disclosure around leverage and financing.",
      "llm_answer": "The discussion of AMT’s substantial leverage and debt service obligations appears in the “Special Note Regarding Forward‑Looking Statements” section of both 2023 and 2024 filings, where the company repeatedly describes its “substantial leverage” and the associated risks. In the 2023 filing the language emphasizes the ongoing risk of high leverage, while the 2024 filing updates this narrative to reflect recent strategic transactions (e.g., the ATC TIPL sale) that have been used to repay debt, but still reiterates that the company’s leverage remains a key risk factor. Thus, the conversation has shifted from a general warning about leverage to a more specific, transaction‑driven context, though the underlying risk framing remains consistent.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the Graphics segment generated $15,868 million in revenue and was a core part of NVIDIA's business, primarily driven by gaming and professional visualization. By fiscal year 2024, while the segment still includes GeForce GPUs for gaming, its strategic positioning has expanded to include broader AI applications, such as Omniverse Enterprise software for industrial AI and digital twin applications, and it now plays a more integrated role in NVIDIA's AI-driven computing platforms. The segment's evolution reflects a shift from being primarily consumer-focused to being more deeply embedded in enterprise and AI workflows.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024 the Graphics segment’s contribution to NVIDIA’s overall revenue has continued to shrink as the company’s strategic focus has shifted toward data‑center and AI‑centric businesses.  In the 2022 10‑K the Graphics segment is still listed as one of two reporting segments (Compute & Networking and Graphics), but the 2024 10‑K’s “Our Businesses” description emphasizes Compute & Networking (Data‑Center, Networking, Automotive, Omniverse, etc.) while positioning Graphics primarily as the legacy consumer‑gaming and workstation GPU business.  Consequently, while Graphics still generates revenue from GeForce, RTX and related services, its share of total sales has declined and the segment is now treated as a peripheral, non‑core line of business rather than a primary growth driver.",

This growth offset a decline in automotive sales revenue, which fell $6.03 billion (8%) due to lower average selling prices and reduced Model 3/Y deliveries, partially offset by higher FSD revenue and Cybertruck volume.

      "llm_answer": "The tax‑related asset position improved markedly: taxes receivable rose from $715 million at the end of 2023 to $853 million at the end of 2024, a $138 million increase. This growth indicates that the company’s current tax receivables are expanding, reflecting a stronger tax‑benefit position relative to the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP capitalized appraisal drilling costs as part of its successful efforts method of accounting, suspending exploratory well costs on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of economically recoverable reserves. If appraisal drilling and seismic work continued to indicate potential, these costs could remain capitalized for several years. By 2024, COP disclosed that appraisal drilling was complete in certain areas, with costs now being incurred to assess development, while additional appraisal wells were still planned in other areas. This indicates a shift from capitalizing uncertain exploration costs to actively evaluating development feasibility, reflecting a more mature phase in those projects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips maintained consistent accounting for appraisal drilling costs under the successful‑efforts method: costs are capitalized when they relate to exploratory wells that show potentially economic reserves and remain suspended on the balance sheet until further appraisal determines economic viability, at which point they may be re‑classified to proved properties or expensed as dry‑hole costs if deemed non‑viable. The 2024 filing (pages 93‑97) shows a $196 million ending balance of suspended exploratory well costs, with $163 million capitalized for more than one year, reflecting ongoing appraisal drilling in Norway, Alaska and Canada, while the 2023 filing (pages 81‑85) similarly reports suspended well balances and disclosures of dry‑hole expenses, indicating no substantive change in capitalization policy, only the amounts have shifted. Disclosure practices remain aligned, presenting dry‑hole and suspended well expenses separately in the income statement and providing detailed aging of capitalized costs in Note 6.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE had significant commitments tied to natural gas transportation agreements and joint venture obligations, including $415 million in 2022 for firm commitments related to Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection, and $610 million in joint obligations between NEECH and NEER. By 2024, NEE had transitioned toward a more structured and larger-scale use of equity units and debentures through NEECH, issuing $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in equity units in June and October 2024, respectively, and later selling $4.5 billion in fixed-rate and $500 million in floating-rate debentures in February 2025. This reflects a strategic shift from project-based commitments to more complex capital market instruments involving NEECH as a financing vehicle.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, NEE's use of equity units and associated debt financing evolved significantly in structure and scale. In 2022 and 2023, NEE issued equity units tied to Series M, L, and K debentures (with reset rates of 4.60%, 5.749%, and 6.051% respectively), raising $2.0B, $2.0B, and $2.5B respectively, with reset mechanisms and equity purchase contracts maturing in 2025–2027. By 2024, NEE expanded this model with new equity units tied to Series N and O debentures (4.635% and 4.635% interest rates), raising $2.0B and $1.5B, while also issuing $4.5B of new NEECH debentures (4.85–5.90% fixed rates, 2028–2055 maturities) and $2.5B of junior subordinated debt. This reflects a strategic shift toward larger, longer-term debt issuances with reset features and enhanced flexibility in settling equity purchase obligations through debt remarketing, scaling total debt commitments substantially beyond prior years.",

This change was primarily driven by worsening losses in key segments, especially Commercial Airplanes, which faced forward losses on major programs, production disruptions, and grounding-related costs. Defense, Space & Security also experienced increased losses due to unfavorable contract adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "The Core Operating Loss increased by $9,982 million in 2024 compared with 2023, reflecting a deeper GAAP operating loss of $10,707 million versus $773 million in 2023 and a non‑GAAP Core operating loss of $11,811 million versus $1,829 million. This deterioration indicates that Boeing’s underlying operational performance weakened substantially, driven by lower revenues, heightened production disruptions, higher contract‑related charges and rising costs across its commercial and defense segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, content amortization was $14,197,437 thousand, and in 2024, it increased to $15,301,517 thousand. This indicates that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, as the cost of amortizing its content library grew year-over-year. The increase in content amortization suggests that Netflix is either producing or licensing more high-cost content, or extending the availability windows of existing content, which results in higher ongoing amortization expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Netflix’s content amortization expense rose from $14.20 billion to $15.30 billion—a $1.10 billion increase (about 7.7 %). This acceleration reflects a faster deployment of its content budget, as the company amortizes licensed and produced assets over shorter windows (often under four years) and is front‑loading spending to secure a larger library of titles. Consequently, the higher amortization signals that Netflix is intensifying its content investment strategy, prioritizing a broader and more quickly refreshed slate to sustain subscriber growth and maintain its expanding operating margin.",

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, DHR's core sales growth declined sharply: it fell 10.5% in 2023 (as noted in the 2023 vs. 2022 core sales decline) and then turned negative again in 2024, with core sales down 1.5% year-over-year (per the 2024 vs. 2023 core sales decline table). This trend indicates weakening underlying demand across key segments—particularly bioprocessing and diagnostics—driven by reduced customer inventory, cautious spending in emerging biotech, and lower demand for COVID-19-related products, outweighing price increases and acquisitions. Consequently, the decline in core sales suggests deteriorating organic business performance, despite stable total sales in 2024.",

      "question": "How has the company's exposure to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases evolved from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about its procurement strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company reported $17.8 billion in market-based contracts for commodity product purchases, while in 2024, this figure decreased slightly to $16.8 billion. This represents a $1.0 billion reduction in exposure to market-based commodity contracts year-over-year. The slight decline suggests a more cautious or strategic adjustment in procurement commitments, potentially reflecting a shift toward more stable or long-term agreements, or a response to market volatility and pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s exposure to market‑based contracts for commodity product purchases has risen sharply—from $9.8 billion of purchase obligations tied to such contracts at the end of 2023 to $16.8 billion at the end of 2024 (with $7.5 billion expected to be fulfilled in 2025). This increase reflects a strategic shift toward securing external commodity supplies through longer‑term, market‑based agreements rather than relying primarily on internal production. Consequently, the company’s procurement strategy is moving toward greater reliance on external commodity purchases to meet demand and manage price volatility.",

By 2024, the distribution rates had increased significantly to 7.299% and 7.234%, with corresponding debenture interest rates rising to 5.15% and 4.635%.

      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, NEE's equity units (Corporate Units) evolved through successive issuances with updated terms and reset interest rates on the underlying NEECH debentures. The 2022 issuance (Series M Debentures) carried a 4.60% interest rate, which was reset higher to 5.15% for the 2024 Series N Debentures and further to 4.635% for the 2024 Series O Debentures, reflecting rising rates. Annual distribution rates increased accordingly: 6.926% for 2022 units, 7.299% for 2024 Series N units, and 7.234% for 2024 Series O units, driven by higher debenture interest (e.g., 5.15% vs. prior 4.60%) and adjusted stock purchase contract components. Earlier 2020–2021 units had lower rates (e.g., 1.84%–5.279% for 2020 Series K), with resets occurring on or after specified dates (e.g., September 2022 for Series K).

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, AbbVie consistently expensed business valuation costs as incurred in connection with business combinations. However, the 2024 disclosure includes a more detailed emphasis on the treatment of contingent consideration liabilities, noting that 'subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.' This evolution in disclosure suggests a more transparent or refined approach to communicating the financial impact of post-acquisition adjustments, potentially indicating a shift toward more complex acquisitions with greater contingent payment structures.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie's accounting for business valuation costs related to acquisitions has remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with both years explicitly stating that \"Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred\" under the business combinations section. This indicates that AbbVie continues to expense all such costs immediately upon incurrence rather than capitalizing them, reflecting a conservative accounting approach that avoids capitalizing transaction costs. The company's acquisition strategy appears to prioritize immediate expense recognition for these costs, which may signal a focus on maintaining clean financial statements and avoiding complexities in balance sheet valuation, rather than signaling a shift in acquisition strategy itself. The consistent treatment across both years suggests no material change in their accounting practices regarding acquisition-related expenses.",

By 2023, the company's variable-rate debt had shifted significantly to $200 million maturing in 2024, with no debt scheduled for 2025 onward, and the average interest rate increased to 6.0% for 2024. This indicates a substantial reduction in variable-rate debt exposure and a rise in borrowing costs in the later year.",

The 2022 filing (page 73) indicates that in 2022 the company had $0.2 billion of variable‑rate debt (also maturing in 2024) at a 6.0 % average rate, and that the company entered into interest‑rate swaps on $1.3 billion of fixed‑to‑variable exposure in 2023 and $0.3 billion in 2024, with average pay rates of about 6.2 % and receive rates of about 3.3 % in 2023, rising to 6.5 % pay and 4.2 % receive in 2024.  Thus, the composition shifted from a modest $0.2 billion variable‑rate tranche in 2022 to essentially the same $0.2 billion tranche in 2023, while the related fixed‑to‑variable swaps expanded to cover additional notional amounts in 2024, reflecting a modest evolution of the variable‑rate profile but no major change in the overall mix.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Block SB405 was described as an 'operated exploration block acquired in 2021' with no mention of plans to relinquish or pause exploration. By 2024, the company had completed a 3D seismic survey (acquired in 2022) and processed the data, but in the fourth quarter of 2024, it elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration and relinquished the block. This indicates a strategic decision to exit the block after initial evaluation yielded insufficient promise.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips shifted its exploration strategy in Block SB405 from active development to relinquishment. In 2023, the company held an 85% working interest and completed a 3D seismic survey, but by the fourth quarter of 2024, it elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration and formally relinquished the block. This decision is explicitly noted in the 2024 10-K filing under \"Exploration\" for Block SB405, where it states: \"In the fourth quarter of 2024, we elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration for SB405 PSC and relinquished the block.\" The shift reflects a strategic withdrawal from further investment in this specific exploration area.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the residual growth rates for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were aligned with brand operating plans and approximated expected long-term category market growth rates. By 2024, the residual growth rates remained conceptually similar but were now explicitly stated to depend on additional factors such as grooming habit changes and sustained deceleration in category growth. This evolution in assumptions reflects increased sensitivity to market dynamics, which contributed to the $1.3 billion impairment charge recorded in 2024 due to a higher discount rate, currency devaluation, and restructuring impacts. The 2024 analysis also introduced a more explicit sensitivity to a 25 basis-point decrease in residual growth rates, indicating a heightened risk of future impairment.",
      "llm_answer": "The assumptions for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset’s residual growth rates were revised downward in 2024, reflecting expectations of slower long-term market growth and heightened macroeconomic pressures. This reduction, coupled with a higher discount rate and currency devaluation impacts, lowered the asset’s estimated fair value, triggering a $1.3 billion non‑cash impairment charge and increasing the risk of future impairments if adverse conditions persist.",

Additionally, Piedmont's current maturities of long-term debt decreased from $160 million in 2022 to $160 million in 2021 (though the 2022 table shows $160 million as a total for Piedmont), and the 2024 lease maturity data shows Piedmont's total lease liabilities at $19 million (down from $23 million in 2020), reflecting reduced financial commitments. The decline is primarily driven by the reduction in remaining performance obligations for Piedmont's gas utilities, which fell from $48 million (2022) to $151 million total in 2024 (with $64 million in 2025 and $51 million in 2026), indicating a strategic scaling back of its Piedmont operations.",

      "question": "How did ABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what was the percentage change in its total revenue during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, ABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue totaled $747 million, with $399 million from the United States and $348 million from international markets. In 2023, this revenue increased to $803 million, driven by a rise in both U.S. revenue to $433 million and international revenue to $370 million. This represents a 7.6% increase in total 'Other Eye Care' revenue from 2022 to 2023. The growth was primarily observed at actual currency rates, with a similar trend at constant currency rates.",
      "llm_answer": "\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased from $747 million in 2022 to $803 million in 2023, representing a 7.5% increase. During the same period, the company's total revenue decreased by 6.4%, from $58,054 million in 2022 to $54,318 million in 2023.",
      "llm_thought": "ABBV's \"Other Eye Care\" revenue increased from $803 million in 2022 to $803 million in 2023? Wait, let me check the data again.\n\nLooking at the document pages, I need to find information about \"Other Eye Care\" revenue. Let me search through the provided pages.\n\nIn page_44, I can see a section about \"Eye Care\" which includes:\n- Ozurdex\n- Lumigan/Ganfort\n- Alphagan/Combigan\n- Restasis\n- Other Eye Care\n\nUnder \"Other Eye Care\", it shows:\n- United States: $433 million in 2023, $399 million in 2022, $393 million in 2021\n- International: $370 million in 2023, $348 million in 2022, $358 million in 2021\n- Total: $803 million in 2023, $747 million in 2022, $751 million in 2021\n\nSo \"Other Eye Care\" revenue increased from $747 million in 2022 to $803 million in 2023. The percentage change would be (803 - 747) / 747 = 56 / 747 ≈ 7.5%.\n\nNow, for the percentage change in total revenue during this period, I need to look at the total net revenues. From page_42, I can see:\n- Total net revenues: $54,318 million in 2023, $58,054 million in 2022, $56,197 million in 2021\n- The percentage change from 2022 to 2023 is (54,318 - 58,054) / 58,054 = -3,736 / 58,054 ≈ -6.4%\n\nSo the percentage change in total revenue from 2022 to 2023 is a decrease of 6.4%.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I'm answering the question correctly:\n- How did ABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue evolve from 2022 to 2023? It increased from $747 million to $803 million, a 7.6% increase.\n- What was the percentage change in its total revenue during this period? It decreased by 6.4%.\n\nWait, I need to be careful with the wording. The question asks \"how did ABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue evolve from 2022 to 2023\" - this refers to the change from 2022 to 2023, so we're looking at 2023 vs 2022. The revenue increased from $747 million in 2022 to $803 million in 2023, which is a 7.6% increase.\n\nThe percentage change in total revenue during this period (2022 to 2023) is a decrease of 6.4%.\n\nLet me confirm the exact numbers:\n- Other Eye Care revenue: $747 million in 2022, $803 million in 2023\n- Percentage change: (803 - 747) / 747 = 56 / 747 ≈ 7.5%\n\n- Total revenue: $58,054 million in 2022, $54,318 million in 2023\n- Percentage change: (54,318 - 58,054) / 58,054 = -3,736 / 58,054 ≈ -6.4%\n\nSo the answer should be:\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased by 7.5% from 2022 to 2023, while its total revenue decreased by 6.4% during the same period.\n\nWait, I need to be precise with the percentage change. Let me calculate it more accurately:\n- Other Eye Care: (803 - 747) / 747 = 56 / 747 ≈ 0.075 or 7.5%\n- Total revenue: (54,318 - 58,054) / 58,054 = -3,736 / 58,054 ≈ -0.064 or -6.4%\n\nSo the answer is:\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased by 7.5% from 2022 to 2023, while its total revenue decreased by 6.4% during the same period.\n\nActually, let me check the exact numbers again to make sure I'm using the right figures. Looking at page_44, under \"Other Eye Care\", it shows:\n- Total: $803 in 2023, $747 in 2022, $751 in 2021\n\nSo the revenue increased from $747 million in 2022 to $803 million in 2023, which is a 7.5% increase.\n\nFor total revenue, looking at page_42, it shows:\n- Net revenues: $54,318 in 2023, $58,054 in 2022, $56,197 in 2021\n\nSo the total revenue decreased from $58,054 million in 2022 to $54,318 million in 2023, which is a 6.4% decrease.\n\nSo the answer is:\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased by 7.5% from 2022 to 2023, while its total revenue decreased by 6.4% during the same period.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything. The question asks \"how did ABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue evolve from 2022 to 2023\" - this means the change from 2022 to 2023, so we're looking at 2023 vs 2022. The revenue increased from $747 million to $803 million, which is a 7.5% increase.\n\nThe percentage change in total revenue during this period (2022 to 2023) is a decrease of 6.4%.\n\nSo the answer is:\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased by 7.5% from 2022 to 2023, while its total revenue decreased by 6.4% during the same period.\n\nWait, I should check if there's any other mention of \"Other Eye Care\" in the document. Let me scan through the pages again.\n\nIn page_44, under \"Eye Care\", it shows:\n- Other Eye Care: United States $433, International $370, Total $803 in 2023\n- Other Eye Care: United States $399, International $348, Total $747 in 2022\n- Other Eye Care: United States $393, International $358, Total $751 in 2021\n\nSo the \"Other Eye Care\" revenue increased from $747 million in 2022 to $803 million in 2023, which is a 7.5% increase.\n\nFor total revenue, it's $58,054 million in 2022 and $54,318 million in 2023, which is a 6.4% decrease.\n\nSo the answer is:\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased by 7.5% from 2022 to 2023, while its total revenue decreased by 6.4% during the same period.\n\nI think I have the correct answer now. Let me make sure I'm not confusing the years. The question asks about the evolution from 2022 to 2023, so we're looking at the change from 2022 to 2023, which means comparing 2023 to 2022.\n\nSo the answer is:\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased by 7.5% from 2022 to 2023, while its total revenue decreased by 6.4% during the same period.\n\nActually, let me double-check the calculation for the percentage change in total revenue:\n- 2022 total revenue: $58,054 million\n- 2023 total revenue: $54,318 million\n- Change: $54,318 - $58,054 = -$3,736 million\n- Percentage change: (-$3,736 / $58,054) * 100 = -6.43%\n\nSo it's a 6.4% decrease.\n\nFor \"Other Eye Care\":\n- 2022: $747 million\n- 2023: $803 million\n- Change: $803 - $747 = $56 million\n- Percentage change: ($56 / $747) * 100 = 7.5%\n\nSo the answer is:\nABBV's 'Other Eye Care' revenue increased by 7.5% from 2022 to 2023, while its total revenue decreased by 6.4% during the same period.\n\nI think that's the correct answer based on the document.\n",

      "question": "How did Mondelēz International's treatment and disclosure of contingent consideration adjustments evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of their inclusion in non-GAAP financial measures and specific financial impact in 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Mondelēz explicitly excluded contingent consideration adjustments from its non-GAAP financial measures, noting in the footnotes that these adjustments were added to the non-GAAP definitions starting in the third quarter of 2021 to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance. By 2024, the company not only continued to exclude these adjustments from non-GAAP metrics but also provided a concrete financial figure—$60 million in contingent consideration adjustments were excluded in 2023 as part of the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. This shows that while the policy of exclusion remained consistent, the company evolved its reporting by quantifying the impact of these adjustments in 2024, offering greater transparency into their financial effect.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Mondelēz International increasingly incorporated contingent consideration adjustments into its non‑GAAP metrics. In 2023, the company disclosed that acquisition‑related costs and contingent consideration adjustments reduced Adjusted Operating Income by $72 million (and reduced Adjusted EPS by $0.09), reflecting a specific financial impact that was excluded from GAAP results but included in the non‑GAAP reconciliation. Earlier filings (2022) mention these adjustments only in footnote references, but the 2023 disclosures explicitly quantify their effect and show they were a driver of the $939 million increase in Adjusted Operating Income on a constant‑currency basis. Thus, the treatment evolved from a largely implicit reference to a transparent, quantified exclusion in non‑GAAP measures, with a measurable $72 million drag on Adjusted Operating Income in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD recognized $12 million of licensing gain from royalty income under the agreement with the THATIC JV. By 2024, this amount had increased to $48 million, indicating a significant growth in the financial benefits derived from the licensing arrangement. This fourfold increase suggests that the THATIC JV's product sales based on AMD's licensed IP have expanded, despite the Entity List designation in 2019.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, AMD's licensing gain from the THATIC JV has evolved as follows:  \n- In 2023, the Company recognized $34 million of licensing gain from royalty income under the February 2016 agreement with THATIC JV (as noted in AMD_10k_2024.pdf, page 51).  \n- In 2024, this increased to $48 million (also cited in AMD_10k_2024.pdf, page 51), reflecting higher royalty income from the same licensing arrangement.  \n\nThis growth indicates a strengthening financial relationship with THATIC, as the licensing gain has risen steadily year-over-year. However, the document also confirms that the Company maintains no equity investment in THATIC JV (carrying value of $0 as of 2021 and 2020, per AMD_10k_2024.pdf, page 49), and the licensing gain is derived solely from royalty income under the 2016 IP licensing agreement. The ongoing financial relationship remains contractual and revenue-based, with no equity exposure or shared profitability beyond the agreed royalty terms.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company's content amortization expense was $14,197,437, and it increased to $15,301,517 in 2024. This represents an increase of over $1.1 billion in amortization costs year-over-year. The rise in content amortization suggests that the company has been actively investing in new content and is systematically recognizing the cost of these assets over time, consistent with its strategy of expanding its content library to enhance subscriber growth and retention.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's content amortization expense increased from $14,197 million in 2023 to $15,301 million in 2024, reflecting a higher allocation of capital to content assets. This rise indicates that Netflix is investing more aggressively in acquiring and producing programming, aiming to expand its library and drive subscriber growth, while the accelerated amortization schedule suggests an expectation of stronger near‑term viewership and monetization of that content.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast used its three Cable Communications divisions as the unit of account for testing the impairment of cable franchise rights and performed either qualitative or quantitative assessments annually or more frequently if there were substantive changes in circumstances. By 2024, the company continued to perform annual impairment testing as of July 1 and maintained the use of qualitative assessments first, but placed more emphasis on periodic quantitative assessments to support qualitative conclusions. Additionally, in 2024, the company explicitly referenced the discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and also considered earnings multiples from comparable companies and recent transactions, suggesting a more detailed and market-informed approach compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Comcast’s approach to valuing and testing impairment of cable franchise rights shifted from performing quantitative assessments roughly every four years (most recently in 2022) to relying primarily on qualitative assessments in 2024, with a quantitative test only conducted for goodwill in the Media segment; the company continues to evaluate cable franchise rights using discounted cash flow models that involve significant judgment about future cash flows and discount rates, but it now determines that it is more likely than not that their fair values exceed carrying values, making additional quantitative testing unnecessary unless market conditions or assumptions change.",

However, in 2024, this figure shifted significantly to $(28) million, showing a much stronger negative impact on the company's financials. This indicates that AIG's claims management or reserving practices may have faced unforeseen challenges in 2024, leading to a larger-than-expected increase in loss adjustment expenses from prior years.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior‑year development was $ (57) million in 2023 and $ (13) million in 2024. The decline from a negative $57 million to a smaller negative $13 million indicates that the company’s prior‑year reserve development improved (i.e., less adverse development was being recorded) in 2024, suggesting better claims management or reserving practices compared with the prior year.",

By 2024, the company maintained a similar framework but placed a more explicit emphasis on 'past payment experience' as a core component of its credit risk assessment, suggesting a strategic refinement in prioritizing historical payment behavior in determining creditworthiness.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ disclosed that definite-life intangible assets were evaluated for impairment in the same manner as other long-lived assets and that amortization occurred over their estimated useful lives. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include specific details about impairment testing, such as performing undiscounted operating cash flow analyses at the lowest identifiable asset group level and calculating impairment losses as the excess of an asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows or expected proceeds less disposal costs. This evolution indicates a more detailed and structured approach to impairment evaluation in 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the treatment of definite-life intangible assets remained consistent in its core methodology but saw refinements in impairment testing and disclosure practices. Both 2022 and 2024 documents confirm that definite-life intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and evaluated for impairment using undiscounted operating cash flow analyses at the lowest level where cash flows are identifiable, with impairment losses measured as the excess of carrying value over estimated fair value (often derived from discounted cash flows or expected proceeds). The 2024 filing (page 76) explicitly reiterates this approach, aligning with the 2022 methodology described on page 90, though it adds greater detail on the use of market-based discount rates and residual value estimates in fair value calculations. Notably, the 2024 filing (page 78) expands on impairment disclosures, including the impact of highly inflationary economies (e.g., Egypt and Nigeria) on remeasurement losses, but does not alter the fundamental impairment framework for definite-life intangibles. Amortization policies remained unchanged, continuing to use straight-line methods over estimated useful lives, with no shift in accounting policy between 2022 and 2024. The evolution lies in enhanced quantitative disclosures around fair value estimation and the inclusion of inflation-driven remeasurement impacts in global operations, rather than a change in core accounting policy.",

In 2021 the company reported $419 million of present‑value operating lease liabilities (with $71 million current) and projected minimum payments of $471 million over the next few years.  By the 2024 filing, long‑term operating lease liabilities had grown to $491 million (with $109 million current) and projected payments increased to $724 million, reflecting longer weighted‑average lease terms (6.1 years → 7.3 years) and higher discount rates (3.7 % → 4.6 %).  This expansion indicates that AMD is making larger, longer‑term real‑estate and facility commitments, which increases its fixed‑cost obligations and exposes the firm to greater cash‑flow risk if market conditions or lease‑exit options change.",

In 2023, the expense increased significantly to $191 million, with $171 million utilized or paid, leaving a remaining liability of $105 million. This indicates a transformation in the company's utilization and funding approach, shifting from a relatively modest expense and moderate utilization in 2022 to a much higher expense and substantial utilization in 2023, suggesting a more active management or restructuring of severance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "The utilization and expense patterns for Severance and benefits increased significantly between 2022 and 2023, with restructuring expense rising from $86 million in 2022 to $228 million in 2024 (and $150 million in 2023), while the related liability grew from $176 million to $145 million in 2022 and then to $112 million in 2024 after utilization. This indicates that the company is actively managing its workforce and cost structure—executing larger-scale reductions and facility exits—resulting in higher severance outlays but a declining accrued liability as the costs are paid out.",

Its share of total net revenue also shrank, from roughly 11.3 % of consolidated revenue in fiscal 2022 to about 24 % of International revenue (and roughly 2.4 % of overall Starbucks revenue) in fiscal 2024, indicating a declining proportional contribution despite modest absolute dollar figures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Veralto Distribution contributed approximately $2.6 billion in cash to Danaher, a portion of which was used to redeem certain outstanding indebtedness. By 2024, the distribution had a residual impact on accumulated comprehensive income, with a reported $974 million credit to the Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) account as part of the comprehensive income reconciliation. This indicates that while the immediate liquidity benefit was realized in 2023, the 2024 figures reflect the ongoing financial restructuring and capital optimization effects of the distribution, particularly in terms of balance sheet adjustments and long-term investment positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the Veralto Distribution on Danaher's comprehensive income shifted from a $450 million decrease in 2023 to a $983 million increase in 2024, reflecting the reversal of the distribution‑related earnings that had previously depressed comprehensive income. This swing indicates that the long‑term financial implications of the distribution are now positive, as the cash inflow from Veralto is boosting comprehensive income and offsetting earlier declines.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had a $400 million unsecured debt issuance linked to Piedmont. By 2024, this relationship had transformed from a debt-based connection to one involving performance obligations, with Duke disclosing a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations related to Piedmont, spread across 2025 through 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from direct debt financing to contractual performance-based financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Duke Energy’s financial relationship with Piedmont evolved through changes in debt covenants and credit facility capacity. The Master Credit Facility’s covenant requires Piedmont’s debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 70%, while other Duke Energy subsidiaries are subject to a 65% cap. As of December 31, 2021, all Duke Energy Registrants, including Piedmont, were in compliance with these covenants. Additionally, Piedmont’s available credit capacity under the Master Credit Facility decreased from $228 million in 2021 to a lower level, reflecting reduced borrowing flexibility compared to other subsidiaries like Duke Energy Ohio ($656 million) and Duke Energy Indiana ($369 million). This reduction was partly due to Piedmont’s smaller sublimit ($700 million) relative to other entities and its reliance on the money pool arrangement for short-term financing.",

By 2023, the company had incurred total cumulative charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 for the same integration plan.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ excluded the impact from pension participation changes as part of the adjustments to derive Adjusted Operating Income, but did not provide a specific dollar amount for this exclusion. By 2024, MDLZ explicitly disclosed the pension participation changes as a quantified item with an impact of $(3) million that was excluded from Adjusted EPS calculations. This represents a shift from a general exclusion to a specific, numerically disclosed adjustment, indicating more transparent and detailed reporting of pension-related impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MDLZ’s treatment of pension participation changes shifted from being excluded as a non‑GAAP adjustment in 2022 (noted in the 2022 Adjusted Operating Income table as a $(3) million impact that was omitted from Adjusted Operating Income) to being explicitly included as a distinct adjustment item in the 2024 Adjusted Operating Income reconciliation, where it appears as a $‑3 million charge that is removed from operating income to arrive at Adjusted Operating Income. Consequently, while earlier disclosures only mentioned the impact in the context of “non‑GAAP adjustments” and excluded it from Adjusted Operating Income, the 2024 filing now lists the pension‑participation charge as a separate line item that is explicitly excluded from the Adjusted Operating Income calculation. This evolution reflects a more granular presentation of the adjustment, making the pension participation impact a visible component of the non‑GAAP metrics used to reconcile operating results.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Emerson's Measurement & Analytical segment had a financial allocation of $3 billion, which increased to $9 billion in 2023. This tripling of financial resources indicates a significant shift in strategic focus toward the segment, highlighting its growing importance in the company's portfolio and suggesting an intent to expand its capabilities or market presence.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Emerson increased its financial allocation to the Measurement & Analytical segment from $3 million in 2022 to $26 million in 2023 (as shown in the restructuring‑costs table), reflecting a strategic shift to prioritize this segment. This heightened investment signals that the segment was viewed as increasingly critical to the company’s growth and operational focus during that period.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's gross profit rate trend evolve between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and what were the key drivers behind the change?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, mainly due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This reflects a significant reversal in the trend, moving from a modest improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate declined slightly from 24.4% in fiscal 2022 to 23.7% in fiscal 2023, a drop of 70 basis points. The decrease was driven primarily by shifts toward lower‑margin formats and the impact of divestitures in the International segment, as well as higher supply‑chain costs and inventory markdowns that offset price‑management gains in the U.S. business.",

      "question": "How did the impact of DD&A expenses on COP's financial performance evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's cost structure and production trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, DD&A expenses had a negative impact on COP's earnings, primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions resulting from increased costs and higher overall production volumes. This contributed to a net income (loss) decrease of $7,723 million. By 2024, DD&A expenses were reported at $9,599 million, up from $8,270 million in 2023, indicating a continued rise in these costs. While the explicit negative impact was not reiterated in 2024, the increase in absolute dollar terms suggests that DD&A remained a growing pressure point for the company, likely tied to sustained high production volumes and ongoing reserve adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of depreciation, depletion and amortization (DD&A) on ConocoPhillips' financial performance shifted significantly between 2023 and 2024. In 2023, DD&A expenses rose by $766 million year-over-year, driven by higher reserve revision rates and increased production volumes, which contributed to a $7.7 billion decline in net income. By 2024, DD&A expenses surged further to $1,299 million (up $1,329 million from 2023), reflecting higher production volumes (particularly from acquisitions like Marathon Oil), elevated rates from ongoing reserve revisions, and the impact of new production assets. This escalation in DD&A, alongside lower commodity prices and higher operating costs, directly pressured profitability, contributing to a $1.7 billion drop in net income from $10.96 billion in 2023 to $9.245 billion in 2024. The trend indicates a deteriorating cost structure where rising production volumes and reserve revisions are increasingly offsetting revenue gains from price movements, signaling that the company's cost base is expanding faster than its production growth can offset.",

      "question": "How has Comcast's approach to impairment testing for owned content evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the basis for estimating fair value and the level of specificity in impairment assessments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast primarily used a discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and market participant estimates of future cash flows, supported by internal forecasts, to estimate fair value for impairment testing of owned content. By 2024, the company continued to assess fair value using Level 3 inputs, but with a more detailed emphasis on market participant estimates of future cash flows and a more structured approach to impairment assessments, including evaluating content either individually or in identified film groups depending on monetization strategy. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced explanation of impairment triggers, including events or changes in circumstances known or knowable as of the balance sheet date, and clarified the treatment of abandoned content, which is now recorded as substantively abandoned in programming and production costs. This represents a moderate transformation in methodology and specificity.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast's approach to impairment testing for owned content has remained consistent in its reliance on discounted cash flow models and Level 3 inputs for fair value estimates, but the 2024 documentation shows a more explicit linkage between impairment triggers and specific content-level assessments. Unlike the 2022–2023 filings, which emphasized qualitative assessments for goodwill and cable franchise rights and only performed quantitative tests when necessary, the 2024 filing (page 77) states that owned content is \"assessed either individually or in identified film groups\" for impairment, with fair value primarily derived from \"discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment, including market participant estimates of future cash flows.\" The 2024 filing (page 78) further clarifies that impairment testing for owned content is triggered by \"events or changes in circumstance known or knowable as of the balance sheet date\" indicating fair value is below unamortized costs, and that \"the substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis.\" This represents a shift from the broader qualitative approach in 2022–2023 to a more granular, content-specific quantitative assessment methodology, though the core valuation technique (discounted cash flows) remains unchanged. The 2022 filing (page 73) noted that quantitative assessments were not required due to \"estimated fair values substantially exceeding carrying values,\" but the 2024 documentation confirms that impairment testing now explicitly targets individual titles and groups when such thresholds are approached.",

      "question": "How did Starbucks' approach to restructuring and impairments evolve between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, particularly in terms of financial impact and strategic focus?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Starbucks recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to its Reinvention Plan, which focused on increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Additionally, the company had completed a prior restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 that included $155.4 million in restructuring and impairments, primarily from store closures and lease-related costs. By fiscal 2024, Starbucks reported no restructuring and impairments charges, in contrast to fiscal 2023, which had a $1.1 million charge. This indicates a reduction in impairment activity and a stabilization of restructuring efforts following the earlier strategic changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2024, Starbucks’ restructuring and impairment approach shifted from significant charges tied to the 2021–2022 store portfolio repositioning (e.g., $155.4M in fiscal 2021 impairments and closures) to a more streamlined, strategic focus under its \"Reinvention Plan.\" By fiscal 2024, impairment and restructuring costs were minimal and largely tied to incremental investments in technology, partner wages, and proxy costs—not asset write-downs—reflecting a strategic pivot toward operational efficiency and growth rather than large-scale closures. Financially, this evolution reduced the drag on earnings from prior impairments, allowing operating margin expansion (e.g., 120 bps improvement in Channel Development) and stronger cash returns to shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to fund capital expenditures and dividends.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT amortized its acquired intangible assets, including tenant-related intangibles, on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of 15 years. By 2024, the company extended the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, aligning them more closely with the 30-year estimated useful life of tower assets. This change in accounting estimate, effective January 1, 2024, led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $730 million for the year. The evolution reflects a strategic shift in how the company accounts for and values tenant-related intangibles in relation to long-term tower asset utilization.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, AMT continued to amortize tenant‑related intangibles on a straight‑line basis, but it extended the estimated useful lives of these assets (and of related tower intangibles) from their prior periods to up to 20 years, reflecting the longer expected benefit from the acquired tower infrastructure. This change, implemented prospectively on January 1 2024, increased the carrying value of right‑of‑use assets and reduced depreciation/amortization expense (approximately $730 million lower expense in 2024).

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that deferred cloud implementation costs were amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected hosting arrangement term once the software was placed into service, with amortization reflected alongside associated cloud hosting fees in other operations and maintenance expenses. These costs were included in other deferred charges and assets on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2024, the company noted that amortization of these costs was immaterial for Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of accounting treatment in 2022 to a more specific, quantitative assessment of materiality across subsidiaries by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Southern Company's treatment of deferred cloud implementation costs evolved from 2022 to 2024 in terms of amortization and materiality across its subsidiaries. In 2022, the company amortized deferred cloud costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected hosting arrangement term, including renewal options, and these costs were immaterial for Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas, while being material for Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power. By 2024, the amortization amounts increased significantly—$56 million for Southern Company, $17 million for Alabama Power, and $22 million for Georgia Power—reflecting the ongoing expensing of previously deferred costs as they were amortized over their respective terms. The disclosure in 2024 also expanded to include detailed tables of deferred cloud implementation costs net of amortization at December 31, 2024 and 2023, showing balances and amortization expenses across all subsidiaries, underscoring that while the costs were not material for some entities, they were systematically tracked and amortized in accordance with regulatory guidance and accounting policies across the corporate system.",

By 2024, the company began disclosing specific contingent consideration adjustments within their Adjusted EPS reconciliation, with a reported impact of $(60) million in 2023 related to acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments.

In 2023, the company reported $0.14 of acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments as part of Adjusted EPS (up from $0.05 in 2022), and this adjustment was also reflected in Adjusted Operating Income calculations. By 2024, contingent consideration adjustments were consistently integrated into non-GAAP metrics, with the company disclosing specific impacts (e.g., $0.14 in 2023) as part of its standardized Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Income frameworks, indicating a formalized inclusion in adjusted financial reporting.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's Gross Profit Rate increased by 51 basis points, primarily due to price management in response to cost inflation and a favorable merchandise mix, including the impact of lapping temporary closures of Auto Care and Vision Centers. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This reflects a significant shift in the trajectory of the Gross Profit Rate, moving from a period of improvement in 2022 to a decline in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart’s gross profit rate fell 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 but rose 27 basis points in fiscal 2024. The decline in 2023 was driven mainly by higher inventory markdowns, elevated supply‑chain and e‑commerce fulfillment costs, and inflation‑related LIFO charges. The rebound in 2024 stemmed from lapping those prior‑year markdowns and improved supply‑chain efficiencies, though this was partially offset by shifts toward lower‑margin product mixes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips was involved in appraisal and development activities at Montney and was developing and optimizing the Surmont asset in Canada. In October 2023, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), bringing its total ownership to 100%. This marked a significant shift in its involvement in Surmont, transitioning from a joint interest to full ownership.",

The transaction was accounted for as a business combination, allocating roughly $3.082 billion to oil‑and‑gas properties and $0.2 billion to unproved assets. To fund the purchase, the company issued $2.7 billion of new debt and refinanced existing borrowings, and it recorded contingent payments of $158 million in 2024 (the contingent consideration is $2 million CAD for each $1 CAD that WCS price exceeds $52 per barrel). This capital commitment—$3 billion cash outlay plus potential additional contingent payments—marked the evolution of ConocoPhillips’ role from minority investor to sole owner of Surmont.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and recognition of Licensed Content Costs evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of amortization methodology and asset classification?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, CMCSA recognized licensed content costs by capitalizing them when the license period began, the content was made available for use, and the costs were known, with amortization occurring as the associated programs were broadcast. Additionally, licensed content was tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network, or platform basis, except for broadcast networks and local stations, which were tested on a daypart basis. By 2024, the company maintained the capitalization criteria but refined the amortization methodology by incorporating 'estimated viewing patterns' into the process. Also in 2024, CMCSA explicitly classified licensed content as noncurrent assets under 'film and television costs' and clarified that production costs incurred in advance of airing are included in licensed content. The 2024 filing also introduced more detailed descriptions of co-financing arrangements and tax incentives, which were absent in 2022. These changes indicate a more nuanced and structured approach to licensed content asset management and cost recognition over time.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of licensed content costs has remained consistent in classification (recorded as “Film and television costs” on the balance sheet) but the amortization methodology has been refined over the period. In 2022 the company amortized owned content using the individual‑film forecast method and licensed content on a usage‑based basis; by 2024 it continues to apply the same individual‑film forecast approach for owned titles and still amortizes licensed content as the programs are broadcast, but it now explicitly includes estimated relative‑value assessments for multiyear sports rights and incorporates production‑tax‑incentive offsets into the capitalized cost basis. Thus, while the asset class has not changed, the company’s amortization schedule and the factors driving the timing of expense recognition (e.g., updated revenue forecasts, relative‑value calculations, and tax‑incentive adjustments) have evolved between 2022 and 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed that its expected long-term rate of return assumptions were based on future expectations for returns by asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. By 2024, the company clarified that it actively rebalances the plans' investments specifically when they fall outside the target allocation ranges, indicating a more defined and action-oriented approach to asset management. This reflects a shift from a general disclosure of rebalancing practices to a more prescriptive and rule-based strategy tied directly to the target ranges.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures in TXN’s 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, the role of Target Allocation Ranges in managing defined benefit plan investments remained consistent in structure but shifted slightly in emphasis. The target allocation ranges—60%–75% fixed income (75%–85% for retiree health care) and 25%–40% equity (15%–25% for retiree health care) for U.S. plans, with non-U.S. plans allowing up to 100% fixed income—were maintained as the framework for asset allocation. However, the 2024 weighted average allocations showed a modest increase in fixed income holdings (61% vs. 65% in 2023 for U.S. plans) and a corresponding decrease in equities (39% vs. 35%), reflecting a more conservative tilt. Rebalancing continued to occur when allocations fell outside these ranges, ensuring alignment with liability-matching objectives and risk management. The core strategy of using low-cost index funds within these ranges to mitigate concentration risk and match interest rate sensitivity persisted, with no structural changes to the target ranges themselves.",

In 2024, this figure changed significantly to a negative impact of $28 million. This represents a substantial reduction in the magnitude of prior year development, suggesting that AIG's reserving practices may have become more accurate or that claims settlements for prior years were more favorable than previously estimated.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth was 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact remained at 1.0% compared to the prior year. However, this consistency occurred in the context of a significant shift in total sales growth performance—implying a growing relative influence of currency effects as overall growth slowed. In 2023, the company experienced total sales growth of 1.5%, with currency exchange rates contributing positively at 1.0%. In contrast, by 2024, total sales growth turned into a decline of 2.0%, while the currency impact remained unchanged at 1.0%. This suggests that despite the company's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations remaining constant, the importance of this factor in the broader context of sales performance increased as overall growth weakened.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth remained consistently at +1.0% year-over-year in both 2023 and 2024, indicating stable foreign exchange exposure despite overall sales volatility. This suggests the company maintains predictable currency-related sales impacts, though Diagnostics' total sales declined 11.5% in 2023 and grew only 2.0% in 2024, with core sales growth (excluding currency) driving the modest 2024 recovery.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported $2.3 billion in structural cost savings realized during the year, contributing to a cumulative total of $9.7 billion since 2019. These savings were attributed to increased operational efficiencies, reduced staffing costs, and initiatives such as supply chain optimization and improved maintenance. By 2024, the company formalized 'Structural Cost Savings' as a defined earnings driver, explicitly incorporating it into its financial reporting framework to provide greater transparency into its cost management performance. This shift indicates that XOM elevated structural cost savings from an internal efficiency metric to a strategic financial reporting category, aligning it with other key earnings drivers like advantaged volume growth and base volume. The change reflects a broader strategic emphasis on sustaining cost discipline as a core component of earnings power.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's structural cost savings accelerated from $2.3 billion in 2023 to an estimated $12.1 billion cumulative savings versus 2019, reflecting ongoing initiatives in supply‑chain efficiency, maintenance and turnaround improvements, modernized data management, and simplified business processes. This progression demonstrates a deliberate, sustained focus on cost‑management that underpins earnings growth and resilience across varying price environments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's relationship with Piedmont was characterized by an allocation of 4% of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets, indicating a relatively minor role in the company's pension and post-retirement benefit structure. By 2024, Piedmont had a significantly different profile in Duke Energy's disclosures, with a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations attributed to it, showing a growing financial commitment or operational involvement with Piedmont. This evolution reflects a shift from a minor stakeholder role in retirement funding to a more substantial contractual obligation.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures in the 2022 and 2024 10-K filings, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont evolved as follows: Piedmont's retained interests in receivables sold to CRC were reduced from $208 million (as of December 31, 2023) to $150 million (as of December 31, 2024), reflecting a $58 million decrease in retained interests, while net receivables sold declined from $143 million (2023) to $0 (2024), indicating CRC's termination in March 2024. This reduction in retained interests and cessation of receivables sales demonstrates a strategic wind-down of the Piedmont-related VIE arrangements, with Duke Energy no longer maintaining significant exposure to Piedmont's financial performance through these mechanisms after March 2024.",

These intangibles were directly tied to tenant contracts and relationships at the time of acquisition. By 2024, the company's disclosures expanded to emphasize a more detailed impairment review process for tenant-related intangibles, assessing them on a tenant-by-tenant basis for indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or customer financial instability. The company also began determining recoverability based on projected undiscounted future cash flows and measuring impairment losses using discounted cash flows or market data. This marks a shift from a purely amortization-focused approach to a more dynamic model involving periodic impairment assessments.",

The 2024 analysis incorporated updated renewal assumptions and market-driven cash flow projections, while impairment reviews now explicitly assess tenant contract attrition and renewal likelihood on a tenant-by-tenant basis, aligning with the broader goodwill impairment framework that now reflects higher weighted-average cost of capital assumptions. This evolution enhances the precision of amortization schedules and ensures impairment testing more closely mirrors current market conditions and strategic realignments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the change in fair value of contingent consideration for Skyrizi reflected higher estimated sales driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates. By 2023, the change in fair value again reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales, but this was driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time in combination with lower discount rates. This indicates a more favorable outlook for Skyrizi sales in 2023 compared to 2022 due to improved market dynamics and a decrease in discount rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Skyrizi's estimated sales evolved as follows between 2022 and 2023:\n\n1.  **Revenue Growth:** Skyrizi's net revenues increased by **51%** in 2023 (from $276 million in 2022 to $416 million in 2023, as reported on page 43 of the 2023 10-K). This growth was driven by continued strong market share uptake across all indications and market growth, partially offset by unfavorable pricing.\n\n2.  **Market Outlook Factors:** The market outlook for Skyrizi was positively impacted by its strong market share and uptake, particularly as Humira faced significant biosimilar competition (leading to a 35% decline in Humira sales in the US in 2023). However, this growth was partially offset by unfavorable pricing pressures. The document specifically states: \"Net revenues for Skyrizi increased 51% in 2023 primarily driven by continued strong market share uptake as well as market growth across all indications, partially offset by unfavorable pricing.\"",

In 2024, the company disclosed that the final consideration for this Surmont acquisition was $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion) after customary adjustments, indicating a significant financial commitment to the asset.

      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips increased its ownership stake in the Surmont oil sands asset from 50% to 100% through a $3.0 billion acquisition completed in October 2023, which included $2.635 billion in cash and $320 million of contingent consideration. The company continued to invest in the asset, reporting $572 million in revenues and $119 million in net income from Surmont for 2023, and by the end of 2024 it had finalized the purchase‑price allocation, recognizing $3.082 billion of oil‑and‑gas properties and making payments of $158 million on the contingent consideration. This full acquisition gave ConocoPhillips complete operational and financial control over Surmont, while also expanding its overall asset base through the broader 2024 Marathon Oil acquisition.",

By 2024, the company reported that the termination dates for these office leases now extend from 2025 to 2034.

The lease commitments table shows that office leases have termination dates extending through 2028, and the weighted‑average remaining lease term has slightly shortened (32.7 years in 2022 to 32.0 years in 2024), indicating that some leases are approaching their end dates.

By 2024, the company reiterated that environmental protection costs for that year were not significant and expected future expenditures to remain consistent with 2024 levels, barring major regulatory shifts. This indicates that Linde's approach to environmental compliance has remained stable over the three-year period, with no substantial increase in spending anticipated despite growing global emphasis on climate change mitigation and stricter environmental regulations in key markets like the EU, U.S., and China.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's environmental protection expenditures are projected to remain at a similar, non‑material level in both 2022 and 2024, with management stating that such costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s financial position or results of operations. The company anticipates that future annual environmental protection spending will be comparable to the $‑level amounts reported in 2021 and 2024, subject to any significant regulatory changes.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $8.50, which decreased to $7.64 in 2023—a drop of $0.86 or 10%. This decline occurred alongside a constant currency adjustment of -6% in 2023, suggesting that foreign exchange rates were not the primary driver of the drop. Instead, the decrease indicates a deliberate shift in pricing strategy, potentially to attract more subscribers in emerging markets where affordability is a key factor. This aligns with Netflix's broader strategic pivot toward global expansion and subscriber growth over short-term revenue per user, as evidenced by the significant increase in paid net membership additions from 5,391 thousand in 2022 to 7,315 thousand in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.64 in 2023—a 1% decline—reflects a deliberate pricing strategy that prioritized international market expansion over domestic price hikes, even as constant currency adjustments revealed a 6% underlying revenue growth. This was driven by growth in lower-priced regional plans (e.g., UCAN's $10.87 vs. global $11.64) and unfavorable foreign exchange rates, offsetting limited price increases globally.",

      "question": "How did the core sales decline of DHR evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's underlying business performance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, DHR reported a core sales decline of (10.5)%, indicating a significant contraction in its underlying business performance after adjusting for acquisitions and currency exchange effects. By 2024, this decline had improved substantially to (1.5)%. This marks a notable improvement in the company's core sales trend, suggesting stabilization or recovery in its primary business operations during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The core sales decline in the Biotechnology segment deepened from 18.0% in 2023 to a 6.0% decline in 2024, reflecting continued weakness in demand for bioprocessing equipment and reduced customer inventory levels, particularly in China and North America. This sustained core sales erosion across key geographies indicates deteriorating underlying business performance in Danaher's life sciences operations, despite price increases and acquisitions partially offsetting the decline.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Properties, Plant and Equipment had a net deferred tax liability value of $20,303 million, showing an increase from $18,295 million in 2022, indicating a growing asset base. By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted focus from quantitative values to a more qualitative discussion around impairment risks and dependencies on uncertain assumptions. Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized the sensitivity of Properties, Plant and Equipment valuations to volatile factors such as future commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes. This reflects a strategic shift from reporting stable asset growth to highlighting increased exposure to external risks and uncertainties, particularly in the context of the energy transition and potential impairments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the company’s approach to PP&E impairments remained consistent: it assesses assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (e.g., significant downward revisions to reserves, commodity‑price outlooks, regulatory changes, or a decision to sell) indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and it records an impairment charge for the excess of carrying value over estimated fair value. The key risk factors that drive these reviews—future commodity prices, production forecasts, carbon costs, the pace of the energy transition, and market supply‑demand conditions—were unchanged, but the 2024 disclosures emphasized that any unfavorable shift in these assumptions could trigger additional impairments, while favorable shifts might avoid them. Valuation of PP&E continues to depend heavily on management’s estimates of undiscounted cash flows and fair‑value measurements, which are subject to considerable uncertainty and are reviewed each reporting period until disposal.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy reported a stake in Piedmont valued at $4 million. By 2024, the relationship evolved from a simple stake to a more significant contractual and performance-based obligation, with Duke Energy disclosing a total remaining performance obligation related to Piedmont of $405 million. This indicates a substantial deepening of the financial relationship, shifting from a minor equity stake to a major contractual commitment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed severance metrics in the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont evolved as follows: Piedmont's severance-related liabilities increased from $2 million at December 31, 2022 to $2 million at December 31, 2023 (with a $1 million cash reduction in 2023), while Piedmont's share of the total $102 million 2023 severance charges was $4 million (as shown in the severance table). This represents a continuation of Piedmont's historical pattern of receiving modest severance allocations compared to other Duke Energy subsidiaries, with no significant change in its relative financial exposure to Duke Energy's severance obligations.",

      "question": "How has the composition and risk assumption in UnitedHealth Group's premium revenues evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to value-based arrangements?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group emphasized that premium revenues from risk-based products comprised nearly 80% of total consolidated revenues, with Optum Health negotiating value-based arrangements where it received a fixed percentage of third-party payers' premiums to cover defined portions of medical costs. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, noting that value-based arrangements at Optum Health involve receiving per-patient per-month premiums under single performance obligations, where revenues are recognized as health care services are made available. This evolution indicates a more structured and service-linked approach to value-based premium revenue recognition over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 UnitedHealth Group’s premium revenue has continued to be driven primarily by risk‑based arrangements, with Medicare Advantage and Medicaid contracts priced as fixed monthly rates per member and commercial commercial policies priced one to six months in advance of the contract year.  The company’s 2024 filing notes that premium revenue on commercial and Medicaid policies is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual for a 12‑month period, while Medicare Advantage premiums are bid to CMS in June of the prior year and are adjusted by the CMS risk‑adjustment model that uses diagnosis and encounter data to set higher or lower per‑member payments.  Although the structure of the pricing has remained consistent, the company emphasizes that “relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results,” and it specifically cites a $330 million earnings impact if 2021 commercial medical costs had been 1 % higher.  This illustrates that while the composition of premium revenue (commercial, Medicaid, Medicare Advantage) has not fundamentally changed, the risk assumption—i.e., the exposure to medical‑cost fluctuations and risk‑adjusted payments—remains a central driver of earnings volatility.  Additionally, the 2024 discussion of value‑based arrangements shows that Optum Health now captures premium revenue through per‑patient‑per‑month payments under contracts that shift utilization and cost risk to the company, further integrating value‑based models into its premium‑revenue mix.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Procter & Gamble stated that its long-term target for Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity was to maintain it at or above 90 percent, indicating a strategic focus on strong cash conversion relative to net earnings. By 2024, the company exceeded this target, reporting an Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity of 105%. This evolution suggests an improvement in the company's ability to generate cash relative to its net earnings, surpassing its own long-term benchmark. The increase from the targeted 90% to an actual 105% reflects enhanced efficiency in converting earnings into cash, despite the inclusion of significant non-cash charges such as the Gillette intangible asset impairment and foreign currency translation losses.",
      "llm_answer": "Procter & Gamble’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity rose from 93 % in fiscal 2022 to 105 % in fiscal 2024, indicating that the company’s cash generation now exceeds its net earnings (adjusted for non‑core items).

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, reported under 'Other measurement basis' in the investment table. By 2024, the company no longer provided a specific dollar value for nonmarketable investments but instead elaborated on the valuation methodology, stating that these investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. This shift indicates a move from quantitative disclosure to qualitative explanation without updating the specific value, suggesting a more opaque but methodologically clarified approach to reporting these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 10‑K shows a shift in how Texas Instruments reports its non‑marketable investments: they are now disclosed only in the “Other investments” footnote and are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, rather than being grouped with fair‑value investments. This tighter, cost‑based presentation signals a more conservative approach—emphasizing that these assets are not intended for active trading and should be reported at their carrying amount only when there is a clear, observable change in value.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, Xbox content and services revenue increased by 50%, with 44 percentage points of growth attributed to the net impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition. In fiscal year 2024, Xbox content and services revenue again increased by 50%, and the acquisition continued to be a key driver, specifically noted as contributing 44 percentage points of net impact due to the shift of Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party. This indicates that the acquisition remained central to sustaining the same high growth rate in this segment year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth in Xbox content and services revenue accelerated in fiscal 2024, increasing 50% year-over-year, driven by 44 points of net impact from the Activision Blizzard acquisition. In fiscal 2023, the same revenue grew 39%, with Activision Blizzard contributing 10 points of net impact. Thus, the acquisition's contribution to growth was higher in 2024 (44 points) than in 2023 (10 points), significantly boosting the revenue growth rate in the subsequent fiscal year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Chevron reported an ARO reduction of $1.3 billion, whereas in 2024, this figure decreased significantly to an ARO reduction of only $0.3 billion. This indicates a notable slowdown in the rate at which the company was reducing its asset retirement obligations, suggesting either an increase in new obligations or a strategic decision to defer certain retirement activities.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's ARO reduction/(build) shifted from a $1.3 million reduction in 2023 to a $0.3 million reduction in 2024, indicating a modest decline in the company's asset retirement obligations. This shift suggests that Chevron is managing its retirement liabilities with slightly less downward adjustment, reflecting a stable but cautious approach to future decommissioning costs.",

      "original_answer": "AMT's estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset retirement obligations increased from $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2023, to $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024. This change was influenced by several liability adjustments, including a $470.0 million increase in 2024 related to the extension of estimated settlement dates. Additionally, in 2024, revisions in estimates included a $125.0 million decrease and a $22.8 million increase in liability related to foreign currency translation for the years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2023, revisions included a $22.3 million increase and a $24.6 million decrease in liability for foreign currency translation for the years ended 2023 and 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset‑retirement obligations increased from $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion. This rise is driven primarily by a $470 million increase in the asset‑retirement liability due to the extension of settlement dates, and by a $125 million decrease (offset by a $22.8 million increase) related to foreign‑currency translation adjustments. Consequently, the liability grew by roughly $0.5 billion, reflecting both the longer settlement horizon and currency‑translation effects.",

      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, organic sales growth in Procter & Gamble's Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment remained flat at 5% year-over-year in fiscal 2024 (as reported in the \"Organic Sales Growth\" table on page 35), with no change in net sales for the segment specifically noted in the \"Summary of 2024 Results\" on page 20 (\"Net Sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine & Family Care\"). This flat performance indicates a stable but non-growing trajectory, consistent with the segment's historical positioning as a mature, low-growth category within P&G's portfolio, despite overall company organic sales growth of 4% (page 20). The segment's performance reflects P&G's strategic focus on maintaining leadership in core categories rather than pursuing aggressive growth, aligning with its long-term objective of delivering organic sales growth above market rates in key categories (page 19).",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant shift from a positive trend in 2022 to a negative impact in 2023, indicating a reversal in the trajectory of gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The gross profit rate rose 20 basis points in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023, while it fell 50 basis points in fiscal 2023 versus fiscal 2022. The 2024 improvement was driven mainly by supply‑chain efficiencies that offset ongoing format and channel shifts, whereas the 2023 decline stemmed from continued growth in lower‑margin formats and channels in China and a shift toward lower‑margin categories.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM Financial indicated that used vehicle prices were expected to decrease relative to 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. It also stated that no impairment indicators were present in the leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. By 2023, the company quantified the financial impact of a 1% relative change in estimated residual values at year-end, showing that such a shift could directly affect depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio. This evolution indicates a shift from a qualitative assessment of residual value risk in 2022 to a more quantitative and scenario-based analysis in 2023, suggesting a more refined risk management approach.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 10‑K disclosures, GM Financial’s residual‑value estimates for its leased‑vehicle portfolio were $22.7 billion at December 31 2023, and a 1% relative change in those estimates would alter depreciation expense by roughly $227 million over the remaining lease terms. The company notes that used‑vehicle prices have been high, but it expects prices to weaken relative to 2021 levels in 2022, which could pressure residual values and increase depreciation or require impairment charges. This focus on regularly updating residual‑value assumptions and monitoring market conditions reflects GM Financial’s risk‑management approach of proactively adjusting estimates to mitigate exposure to adverse shifts in used‑vehicle pricing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Investment and Brokerage Services revenue decreased by $338 million, primarily due to lower transactional revenue and asset management fees driven by declines in assets under management (AUM) and pricing, as well as lower average market valuations. In 2024, however, the total revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased to $17,766 million from $15,563 million in 2023. This growth was driven by increases in both asset management fees (from $12,002 million to $13,875 million) and brokerage fees (from $3,561 million to $3,891 million). Thus, the segment shifted from a decline in 2023 to a significant recovery and growth in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services (reported as part of Global Markets and All Other) declined modestly, falling from $21,812 million in 2023 to $21,812 million in 2024? Actually the table shows 2024 total revenue for Global Markets at $21,812 million versus $19,527 million in 2023, representing an increase; however, the key components driving the change include higher market‑making and similar activities (+$1.2 billion) and higher investment‑banking fees (+$1.4 billion), which offset lower fees and commissions from asset management and brokerage services. The net effect was a rise in total noninterest income for the segment, but overall revenue growth was limited by these offsetting factors.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DHR reported a core sales decline of (10.0)%, indicating a significant contraction in sales from existing businesses, excluding acquisitions and currency effects. By 2024, the core sales decline had improved to (1.5)%, showing a substantial reduction in the rate of decline. This evolution suggests that the company's underlying business performance strengthened significantly year-over-year, with core operations stabilizing and nearing growth. The improvement from (10.0)% to (1.5)% indicates a positive shift in demand, pricing, or unit sales, despite the broader market or economic challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Danaher's core sales declined 1.5% year-over-year, driven primarily by decreases in the Biotechnology segment (especially in China and Western Europe) and Life Sciences, partially offset by growth in Diagnostics. This core sales decline, combined with flat total sales due to acquisitions offsetting the core weakness, indicates underlying weakness in the company's core business trends, particularly reduced demand in key geographies and segments despite price increases.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Refined Product Sales increased by 59,000 barrels per day, or 4 percent, primarily driven by higher demand for jet fuel and gasoline. However, in 2024, Refined Product Sales slightly declined from 1,287 thousand barrels per day (MBD) to 1,286 MBD. This indicates a shift from growth to near stability in downstream sales performance between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s Refined Product Sales volumes remained essentially flat year‑over‑year (1,287 MBD in 2023 versus 1,286 MBD in 2024), indicating that downstream operational performance was stable in terms of volume, but earnings from the U.S. downstream segment fell sharply—by about $3.4 billion—mainly because of lower refined‑product margins and higher operating expenses. This margin compression suggests that while sales volumes were steady, the profitability of Chevron’s refining operations declined between 2023 and 2024.",

However, in 2023, the company incurred $92 million in restructuring and related costs, signaling a renewed focus on organizational changes or cost optimization efforts. This shift suggests that the company initiated new restructuring activities in 2023 after a period of inactivity.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, restructuring and related costs rose sharply—from $89 million to $68 million in total segment costs, with notable increases in specific segments such as $27 million in Discrete Automation and $7 million in Safety & Productivity in 2024 versus $35 million and $7 million respectively in 2023—indicating that the company is actively managing cost reductions and operational efficiencies as part of its strategic focus on margin improvement and integration of recent acquisitions. This uptick, alongside higher amortization of acquisition‑related inventory step‑up ($231 million in 2024) and increased acquisition/divestiture costs, reflects a strategic emphasis on streamlining operations and offsetting inflationary pressures while pursuing growth through acquisitions like Heritage AspenTech.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Canadian Segment Gross Margin Percentage increase was driven by improvements in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, contributing a combined positive impact of 35 basis points, partially offset by increased 2% rewards. In 2024, the same factors—core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—continued to positively influence the gross margin percentage, again contributing a combined 35 basis points, despite the same offsetting pressure from increased 2% rewards. This indicates a consistent upward trend in gross margin performance from these areas, with no material change in the magnitude of their contributions.",
      "llm_answer": "The Canadian segment gross margin percentage rose from 10.57 % in 2023 to 10.92 % in 2024, an increase of 35 basis points. This improvement was driven primarily by warehouse ancillary and other businesses—especially e‑commerce and gasoline—adding roughly 19 bps, plus the absence of 2023 charter‑shipping charges contributing about 16 bps, while core merchandise categories added only 4 bps and higher 2 % rewards subtracted 3 bps.

In 2024, the CAS pension cost decreased to $1,684 million, while the FAS pension service cost was $60 million, leading to a total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment of $1,624 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP reported $3,393 million in unproved property for the Lower 48 region, contributing to a total of $5,206 million across all consolidated operations. By 2024, the Lower 48 unproved property value increased significantly to $13,883 million, raising the total unproved property to $15,490 million across consolidated operations. This indicates a major strategic or asset shift in the Lower 48 region, which became a dominant component of COP's unproved property portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided data, the value of COP's unproved property in the Lower 48 region decreased from $255 million in 2022 to $157 million in 2023, and further to $10,985 million in 2024. Consequently, total unproved property across all consolidated operations declined from $255 million in 2022 to $313 million in 2023, then rose sharply to $10,985 million in 2024.",

By 2024, the company clarified that fixed lease income included both fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM reimbursements recorded on a straight-line basis. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward stabilizing revenue streams by emphasizing predictable income components such as fixed minimums and CAM reimbursements, while reducing reliance on variable tenant-sales-based income.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on SPG's 2023 and 2024 disclosures, fixed lease income increased from $34,112 million in 2023 to $35,518 million in 2024, reflecting a strategic focus on stabilizing and growing core retail property revenues through long-term, fixed-rate lease structures.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Installed Base Growth was explicitly stated as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue alongside average revenue per user expansion and the shift from on-premises Office to Office 365. In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever. This suggests that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue remained consistent as a key revenue driver, continuing to fuel growth through the expansion of the existing customer base (including frontline workers, small and medium businesses, and growth markets) and the ongoing shift from on-premises Office licenses to Office 365/Microsoft 365 subscriptions. This trend was explicitly highlighted in both the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings as a primary factor influencing Office Commercial revenue performance.",

By 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained stable at 7%, but paid net membership additions surged dramatically, increasing by 232% to reach 29,529 thousand. This indicates a significant improvement in user acquisition in 2023 despite a similar revenue growth rate, suggesting more efficient scaling or successful new market penetration.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's streaming revenue grew 7% year-over-year, driven by an 8% increase in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 1% decline in average monthly revenue per paying membership due to pricing changes and regional growth patterns. Paid net membership additions surged by 232% to 29,529, indicating accelerating subscriber growth. This combination of revenue growth and significant membership expansion suggests Netflix is transitioning from its earlier high-growth phase toward a more mature, scalable growth trajectory focused on expanding its global user base while managing pricing dynamics.",

By 2024, the unfunded capital contributions increased to $7.5 billion, continuing the pattern of manageable expected commitments.

While its equity investments in affordable‑housing and renewable‑energy projects grew modestly (from $15.8 billion in 2023 to $16.7 billion in 2024), the Corporation continues to state that any additional capital contributions would not be significant and are contingent on project qualification for tax credits.

      "question": "How has Chevron's approach to reducing oil production GHG intensity evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of capital allocation and strategic alignment with its long-term net zero goals?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Chevron disclosed an oil production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO₂e/boe and had spent $6.5 billion of its planned $10 billion lower-carbon capital spend through 2028, with $2 billion allocated to reducing carbon intensity in oil and gas operations. By 2024, Chevron maintained the same GHG intensity target of 24 kg CO₂e/boe but had increased its total lower-carbon investments to $7.7 billion since 2021, indicating a continued commitment to its 2028 targets and broader 2050 net zero upstream production aspiration. Additionally, in 2024, Chevron placed more emphasis on external dependencies like technology development and policy incentives to achieve its long-term goals, signaling a strategic shift toward integrating external enablers into its GHG reduction pathway.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's approach to reducing oil‑production GHG intensity has shifted from a focus on operational efficiency to a more integrated, portfolio‑wide strategy aligned with its net‑zero aspirations. In 2023 the company reported upstream GHG intensity of 24 kg CO₂e/boe and set a 2028 portfolio carbon‑intensity target of 71 g CO₂e/MJ, while also outlining a $10 billion lower‑carbon capital spend through 2028 (≈$2 billion to cut oil‑and‑gas carbon intensity and $8 billion for renewables, hydrogen and carbon capture). By 2024 it announced a $2‑3 billion structural cost‑reduction program to fund these lower‑carbon investments, recognizing that achieving a 2050 upstream net‑zero aspiration will require advances in technology, permitting and carbon‑credit availability, as well as continued capital allocation toward decarbonisation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group estimated risk adjustment premium revenues based on submitted diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician treatment settings, with these data being subject to government review and audit by regulators. By 2024, the company maintained a similar estimation methodology but placed increased emphasis on the completeness and accuracy of data submitted to CMS, reflecting a more mature and refined process for capturing risk adjustment data. The 2024 disclosure also specifically highlights the role of both the company and healthcare providers in collecting, capturing, and submitting the necessary data within prescribed deadlines, suggesting a more collaborative and systematic approach to data submission compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's approach to estimating risk adjustment premium revenues has evolved from relying on estimated premiums net of projected rebates (2022) to explicitly describing the use of CMS risk adjustment data submitted by the Company and health care providers, with emphasis on audit oversight (2024). The core methodology remains consistent—using diagnosis and encounter data to calculate risk-adjusted payments—but the 2024 disclosure adds greater detail about the data submission process and regulatory review, including CMS audits of submitted risk adjustment data.

This $10 increase in tax benefit led to a smaller net stock-based compensation expense, which remained at $645 in 2024 despite a rise in gross stock-based compensation expense from $774 to $818.

This significant growth indicates a substantial rise in order intake and suggests strong operational momentum, as the company is managing a growing volume of orders yet to be fulfilled.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM reported $356 million in unrecognized tax benefits that could favorably affect its future effective tax rate. In 2023, this amount increased to $386 million. This represents a $30 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, suggesting a slight upward trend in the company's potential tax savings in the future, though the company noted that it is still not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change in these benefits over the next twelve months.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GM’s unrecognized tax benefits declined from $520 million to $585 million? Actually the tables show $520 million at the start of 2023 and $585 million at year‑end 2023, indicating a modest increase. However, the more relevant figure is the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate—this decreased from $411 million in 2022 to $386 million in 2023. This reduction suggests that the company expects a slightly lower impact on its future effective tax rate, potentially allowing a modestly higher effective tax rate going forward.",

By 2023, Chevron had already spent $6.5 billion on lower-carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022. This indicates significant progress toward its 2028 target and suggests an acceleration in implementation, particularly in scaling lower-carbon business lines such as renewable fuels.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s lower‑carbon capital spending remained focused on two pillars: roughly $2 billion to cut the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations and about $8 billion for renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon‑capture projects.  The company kept its 2028 portfolio‑carbon‑intensity target of 71 g CO₂e/MJ and continued to invest the planned $10 billion through 2028, but the pace of spending shifted toward projects that can deliver near‑term emissions cuts (e.g., carbon‑capture and renewable‑fuel production) while still supporting its upstream business.  Progress toward the 2028 targets was modest, with the company reporting $6.5 billion spent on lower‑carbon investments to date, but the overall strategy and capital allocation framework remained unchanged.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's treatment and estimation of medical costs payable evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the role it played in the company's cash requirements and the accounting policies applied?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group listed 'medical costs payable' as a key component of its short-term cash requirements, indicating it was a primary liability to be settled within twelve months through cash flows from operations and available cash. The company emphasized that it expected to meet these obligations using operational cash flows and did not foresee liquidity issues due to its strong capital position. By 2024, the treatment of medical costs payable shifted to being a central focus in the company's accounting estimates and judgments, specifically under 'Use of Estimates' in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Here, medical costs payable was described as one of the most significant estimates requiring complex assumptions due to its inherent uncertainty and likelihood of change over time. The 2024 disclosure also highlighted that changes in estimates for medical costs payable were recognized in earnings during the period of adjustment, indicating a more dynamic and potentially volatile nature compared to the more static view in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group’s medical costs payable declined from $4,053 million in 2022 to $2,503 million in 2024, reflecting more mature claim data and lower completion‑factor adjustments that reduced the liability each year. This decrease freed cash that helped meet the company’s short‑term obligations and supported its overall cash‑flow needs, while the estimation methods—applying observed medical‑cost trend factors to recent per‑member costs and refining them with near‑term completion factors—remained consistent across the periods.",

By 2024, the company exceeded this target, achieving an adjusted free cash flow productivity of 105%.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Emerson maintained a $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility entered into in May 2018, replacing the April 2014 facility. The facility had no financial covenants, was unsecured, and fees to maintain it were described as immaterial. In 2023, the Company entered into a new $3.5 billion five-year revolving backup credit facility in February 2023, which replaced the May 2018 facility. The terms remained largely consistent, with no financial covenants, unsecured status, and multiple interest rate alternatives. Again, fees to maintain the facility were disclosed as immaterial.

By 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of 1% on sales, indicating a reversal in this dynamic. This shift suggests that LIN experienced a change in its cost structure or pricing strategy, where rising costs were no longer fully recoverable through pricing adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, cost pass-through contributed 6% to EMEA sales growth in 2021 (page 30) and 6% to EMEA sales in 2024 (page 26), but its impact on sales dynamics shifted: in 2021 it drove 6% sales growth with minimal profit impact, while in 2024 it decreased sales by 4% (page 26) yet operating profit still rose 12% due to pricing and productivity. This indicates LIN's pricing dynamics are increasingly resilient to cost inflation, as higher price attainment (3% in 2024 EMEA) and volume stability offset cost pass-through headwinds, demonstrating pricing power that sustains margin expansion despite evolving cost pressures.",

Despite the decline in per-user revenue, the significant increase in average paying memberships contributed to a $193,506 thousand rise in total revenue from $3,266,601 thousand in 2022 to $3,763,727 thousand in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, average paying memberships grew 8% (from 222,924 to 240,889) and average monthly revenue per paying membership slipped 1% (from $11.76 to $11.64). The modest revenue‑per‑member decline was offset by the larger membership base, driving a 7% increase in total streaming revenue and a 23% rise in operating income, which helped lift the overall operating margin from 18% to 21%.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased by 80 basis points, primarily due to pricing increases and lower supply chain costs. However, in fiscal 2024, these costs surged by 157.4% in dollar terms, rising from $20.2 million to $52.0 million. This indicates that while the company was able to manage these costs effectively in 2023, it faced significant cost pressures in 2024, undermining earlier efficiency gains.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, Starbucks' product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased by 80 basis points, primarily due to the impact of increased sales from pricing (approximately 70 basis points) and a reduction in supply chain costs (approximately 60 basis points). This indicates effective cost management in the supply chain and pricing strategies, contributing to improved efficiency in this cost category.",

In 2023, EMEA product revenue slightly increased to $10,645 million but its percentage contribution to total product revenue decreased to 27.1%. This indicates that while the region maintained a relatively stable revenue level, its proportional importance to Cisco's global product revenue slightly declined due to stronger performance in other regions.",

However, despite the sales growth, operating profit for the Engineering segment decreased by $81 million, or 16%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher margins in the prior year from the wind-down of sanctioned Russian projects. This suggests that while sales grew, profitability was negatively impacted by the absence of those prior-year benefits.",

The consistent 5% figure suggests that unionization efforts have not expanded meaningfully during this period, reflecting a relatively stable labor relations environment despite broader industry unionization trends.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through was described as a positively impacting factor due to Linde's long-term contracts that allowed for the transfer of energy and feedstock cost fluctuations to customers, contributing to stable cash flow. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact, contributing to a (1)% change in sales. This shift indicates a change in the effectiveness or direction of cost pass-through mechanisms, possibly due to market conditions or contract renegotiations, affecting Linde's pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through mechanisms on Linde’s sales shifted from a **positive contribution of 5% in 2022** (as noted in the 2021 review) to a **negative drag of approximately 1% in both 2023 and 2024**, primarily due to lower energy cost variances being billed to onsite customers. This shift indicates that while pricing dynamics (driven by higher price/mix growth of 2% in 2024) and volume stability supported sales, the ability to pass through rising energy costs—historically a key lever for margin protection—**weakened**, signaling increased competitive pressure or contractual limitations in energy cost recovery. Consequently, the company’s pricing dynamics increasingly relied on **explicit price increases rather than passive cost pass-through**, reflecting a strategic shift toward more direct pricing control amid inflationary pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Verizon recognized overage usage revenue for postpaid wireless plans on a month-to-month basis as the customer exercised their option for incremental services beyond their monthly allowance. In 2024, this recognition method remained consistent; however, the company placed increased emphasis on the month-to-month nature of these overage fees, reinforcing that they are recognized only when the customer actually uses the service beyond the plan's allowance. While the core revenue recognition principle remained unchanged, the 2024 disclosure provided more explicit language around the timing and conditions of overage fee recognition, indicating a subtle refinement in how the company communicates its policy, rather than a substantive accounting change.",
      "llm_answer": "Verizon continues to recognize revenue from overage usage on postpaid wireless plans in the same manner as prior periods – the usage‑based fee is recorded when the customer exercises the option (typically on a month‑to‑month basis). The 2024 filing shows no change to this policy; the only evolution is that the overage fees are now included in the overall contract price and allocated between service and equipment revenue based on standalone selling prices, but the timing of revenue recognition remains unchanged.",

In 2024, the company instead stated that unamortized ITCs 'impact' regulatory liabilities, suggesting a broader, potentially more indirect influence rather than a primary attribution.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reported no restructuring and related costs, indicating a period of relative operational stability with no significant restructuring activities. However, in 2023, the company disclosed restructuring and related costs totaling $10 million, signaling a shift toward active restructuring efforts. This change suggests that the company initiated cost optimization or strategic realignment initiatives in 2023 that were not present in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, restructuring and related costs declined sharply from $89 million to $11 million, indicating that Emerson was scaling back its cost‑reduction initiatives as sales grew and the integration of recent acquisitions progressed. This reduction, together with higher operating cash flow and improved margins, suggests the company was shifting its operational strategy toward leveraging organic growth and newly acquired assets rather than pursuing further large‑scale restructuring.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed 2% to the year-over-year sales growth, indicating that rising costs were at least partially transferred to customers. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on the year-over-year sales comparison, suggesting that either cost pressures eased or LIN was less able to pass through cost increases to customers. This shift reflects a reversal in the company's cost pass-through dynamics, moving from a supportive factor to a slight drag on sales growth.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost pass‑through on sales fell from a 3 % contribution to sales growth in 2021 to a 1 % drag in 2024, indicating that Linde’s ability to shift higher energy and commodity costs onto customers has weakened over time. This decline signals improving cost‑management dynamics—price and productivity gains are now the primary drivers of profit growth, while cost‑pass‑through is playing a smaller, even negative, role in revenue expansion.",

However, the growth rates for specific segments changed over time. In 2022, the Consumer Credit segment grew by 17% globally, while in 2024, this growth rate slowed to 6%. Similarly, the Commercial segment saw an increase in growth rate, from 29% in 2022 to 12% in 2024 globally. This indicates a moderation in the expansion of Consumer Credit and a sustained but slower growth in Commercial payments volume.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, Visa's Total Nominal Payments Volume grew from $6.044 billion in fiscal 2022 to $6.654 billion in fiscal 2023, reflecting a 9% increase, and then to $6.991 billion in fiscal 2024, a further 5% rise. Consumer Credit volume rose from $2,047 billion (2022) to $2,230 billion (2023) (+9%) and then to $2,355 billion (2024) (+6%). Consumer Debit increased from $2,826 billion (2022) to $2,826 billion (2023) (flat) and then to $2,990 billion (2024) (+6%). Commercial volume grew from $988 billion (2022) to $1,042 billion (2023) (+5%) and then to $1,042 billion (2024) (same as 2023, but the growth rate reported for 2024 vs. 2023 is 5%). Overall, the Consumer Credit segment showed approximately 9% growth from 2022 to 2023 and an additional 6% growth from 2023 to 2024, while the Commercial segment posted about 12% growth from 2022 to 2023 and a modest 5% growth from 2023 to 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, CVX reported current-year dry hole expenditures of $83 million, while in 2023, this figure increased significantly to $326 million. This represents a more than threefold increase in dry hole costs year-over-year. The substantial rise in dry hole expenditures suggests that CVX experienced a notable increase in unsuccessful exploration activities in 2023 compared to the prior year, indicating a higher exploration risk profile during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's current-year dry hole expenditures increased slightly from $309 million in 2022 to $326 million in 2023, reflecting a modest rise in exploration risk as the company continued to incur small but non‑trivial dry‑hole costs despite an overall reduction in capital spending. This uptick suggests that while Chevron is scaling back broader exploration outlays, it remains exposed to the inherent uncertainties of drilling unsuccessful wells.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer's Upjohn Business was still referenced in the context of historical spin-off activities, with its financial results reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, Pfizer noted that approximately 75% of the expected $700 million in separation costs had been incurred by the end of 2021. By 2023, the Upjohn Business was formally defined in the glossary as 'Pfizer's former global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business,' which had been spun-off on November 16, 2020, and combined with Mylan to create Viatris. This shift indicates a move from active financial tracking and cost reporting to a more historical and definitional reference, suggesting the integration and separation process had largely concluded by 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Pfizer restructured its commercial operations to focus on a single reportable segment (Biopharma) and reorganized its reporting structure to reflect this change. The company completed the spin-off of its former Upjohn Business in 2020 and began reporting through a new two-segment structure (Biopharma and PC1) starting in fiscal 2021, with Biopharma as the sole reportable segment. This strategic shift was part of Pfizer's transformation into a more focused, science-based biopharmaceutical company, eliminating the separate reporting of the Upjohn Business that had previously been part of its financial disclosures.",

By 2023, this revenue decreased to $5,466 million, and its percentage contribution dropped to 13.9%. This indicates a decline in both the absolute revenue and relative importance of the APJC region to Cisco's overall product revenue during this period.",

This contraction signals a diminishing share of Cisco's overall product portfolio in the APJC region, suggesting that the company's strategic focus may be shifting away from or facing challenges in maintaining growth momentum in that market.",

By 2023, Automotive Interest Expense decreased to $911 million, but Automotive Financing - GM Financial Interest Expense rose sharply to $4,685 million, resulting in a total interest expense of $5,596 million. This shift shows that the proportion of interest costs attributed to GM Financial increased significantly, suggesting a greater reliance on financing activities in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The Automotive Interest Expense rose modestly from $911 million in 2022 to $987 million in 2023, while GM Financial’s interest expense jumped sharply from $2.881 billion to $4.685 billion over the same period. This increase reflects a more leveraged balance‑sheet structure, with GM Financial’s debt growing from $96.9 billion to $105.3 billion and its weighted‑average borrowing costs rising, indicating that the company’s overall financial structure has become more debt‑intensive, especially within its financing arm.",

In contrast, by 2024, the cost of wireless equipment surged to $26,100 million, with $21,259 million attributed to the Consumer segment and $4,841 million to the Business segment. This significant increase of over $21 billion indicates a major shift in strategy, likely tied to increased investment in or sales of wireless equipment.",
      "llm_answer": "The cost of wireless equipment declined from $25,134 million in 2022 to $21,827 million in 2023, reflecting a lower volume of devices sold (particularly fewer phone upgrades) that was partially offset by a shift toward higher‑priced equipment. This reduction signals that Verizon is focusing on selling fewer, but more premium, devices—suggesting a strategic shift toward higher‑margin equipment sales rather than volume growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's Other Income and Expense, Net increased primarily due to lower non-service pension costs and gains on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund. By 2023, the net figure for Other Income and Expense was $392 million, which included contributions from various components such as interest income ($27 million), AFUDC equity ($197 million), post-in-service equity returns ($34 million), and nonoperating income, other ($134 million). This indicates a shift in the composition of the net income, with AFUDC equity and nonoperating income, other playing significant roles in 2023 compared to the 2022 drivers.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided pages, Duke Energy's \"Other Income and Expense, Net\" increased from $18 million in 2021 to $598 million in 2023. The growth was driven primarily by non‑service pension cost reductions and gains in the nuclear decommissioning trust fund (2021‑2022), and by a broader rise in non‑operating income—including interest income, AFUDC equity, post‑in‑service equity returns, and various other non‑operating items—across the Duke Energy registrants in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer defined Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. By 2023, the definition changed to exclude amortization of intangible assets instead of purchase accounting for acquisitions, along with acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. This indicates a shift in the nature of adjustments being emphasized in the metric's calculation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Pfizer's Adjusted Cost of Sales definition remained consistent in excluding certain acquisition-related items, amortization of intangible assets, and other significant items, but the company began explicitly including \"certain significant items\" such as restructuring charges and integration costs in its Adjusted income measure, reflecting a shift in how it evaluates and presents these expenses for performance assessment. This evolution aligns with its broader non-GAAP reporting framework, where Adjusted income excludes these costs to provide a clearer view of core operational performance.",

This indicates a weakening in the company's competitive position in the oral tobacco segment over this period.

While on! saw an increase from 6.8% to 8.3%, it was not enough to offset the overall decline.",
      "llm_answer": "The retail share of MO’s oral tobacco products declined from 42.8% in 2023 to 37.5% in 2024, reflecting share losses in the MST category that were partially offset by growth in the oral nicotine pouch segment.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx's pension plan assumptions included future salary increases as a key component in calculating the projected benefit obligation, which stood at $28.7 billion. By 2024, while the company continued to disclose pension plan assumptions, it emphasized a strategic shift by closing its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees starting 2020 and introducing an enhanced 401(k) plan with an 8% company match. This indicates a reduced emphasis on defined benefit plans and a shift toward defined contribution plans, suggesting a moderation in long-term salary-linked pension liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided pages, FedEx's assumptions regarding future salary increases for pension plan obligations evolved as follows: In 2022, the rate of increase in future compensation levels used to determine benefit obligations was 5.11% (down from 5.13% in 2021 and 5.29% in 2020), and the rate used for net periodic benefit cost was 5.06% (down from 5.11% in 2021 and 5.13% in 2020). By 2024, these rates had increased to 3.06% for benefit obligations and 3.04% for net periodic cost, reflecting a continued decline in assumed future salary growth. This downward trend in salary increase assumptions indicates that FedEx has become more conservative in its long-term compensation expectations, likely reflecting a strategic shift toward controlling pension expense growth amid evolving workforce dynamics and benefit plan changes (such as the transition to 401(k) plans for new hires).",

However, by 2024, the company clarified that recipients of stock-settled PSUs authorized beginning in 2013 receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense, rather than retained earnings, and these are paid at the time of settlement. This reflects a shift in both the timing and accounting treatment of dividend equivalents for newer PSU grants.",

In 2023‑24 the PSUs are settled in stock after the three‑year performance period, and recipients receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent at settlement that is recorded as compensation expense, rather than a pre‑settlement cash dividend to retained earnings.",

In 2024, the company explicitly disclosed that PUDs continued to represent 35% of total proved reserves, consistent with the prior year. However, it also revealed that $9.4 billion in costs were incurred during the year for the development of PUDs. Additionally, 2024 included detailed geographic breakdowns of PUD development timelines, noting that 88% of PUDs were scheduled for development within five years, with specific mention of the Lower 48, Canada, Alaska's Willow project, and an equity affiliate in Australia.

The absolute level of PUDs grew, driven by revisions of 535 MMBOE, purchases of 57 MMBOE, and extensions/discoveries of 281 MMBOE, while transfers to proved developed reserves of 509 MMBOE offset part of the increase.  Costs incurred to develop these PUDs were $9.4 billion in 2024, reflecting ongoing development of the Lower 48 unconventional plays, Canada oil‑sands, and the Willow project in Alaska, with about 88 percent of PUDs slated for development within five years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD's provisions during the period were $106 million, while in 2024, they increased significantly to $213 million. This indicates a doubling of provisions over the two-year period, suggesting that AMD faced greater financial commitments or anticipated higher liabilities in 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 AMD’s tax‑related provisions and related liabilities showed a clear upward trend.  The company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits rose from $1.361 billion at the end of 2022 to $1.498 billion by the end of 2024, and the amount of accrued penalties and interest grew from $81 million to $298 million over the same period.  This increase reflects expanding uncertain‑tax‑position reserves, larger valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, and the cumulative effect of expiring NOLs and tax credits, indicating that AMD is progressively committing more resources to meet its tax obligations and potential future liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the income tax expense (benefit) on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using applicable tax rates in relevant jurisdictions and included both current and deferred tax amounts. The rationale for excluding purchase accounting impacts focused on the merger of equals structure, geographic management approach, and the need for comparability across segments and with peers. By 2024, the company retained the same technical explanation for the tax impact but added specificity to its rationale by referencing the 2018 business combination explicitly, reinforcing the long-standing nature of the merger and its ongoing influence on financial reporting. This evolution indicates a more detailed contextualization of the merger's lasting effects on financial disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the company’s rationale for excluding the current and deferred income tax impact of non‑GAAP pre‑tax adjustments has remained consistent: it believes that presenting the tax effect using the applicable jurisdictional rates (including both current and deferred amounts) provides a clearer view of the underlying operating performance, and that investors and analysts need to understand these purchase‑accounting tax impacts to assess comparable earnings. Consequently, the tax expense (benefit) on the adjustments is calculated using the same methodology each year, and the adjusted income‑tax figures are disclosed separately to reflect the net tax effect of all non‑GAAP adjustments.",

This indicates that while the rental car segment continued to grow during the recovery period, the pace of growth slowed down significantly in the second year, suggesting a potential stabilization or moderation in demand recovery.",

In 2024, the company reported $4,839,816 thousand in streaming revenues, with a significant increase in paid net membership additions to 7,330 thousand, up from 4,298 thousand in 2023.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s streaming revenue grew 7% year‑over‑year (from $29.5 bn to $31.5 bn), driven by an 8% rise in average paying memberships that more than offset a 1% dip in average monthly revenue per member. In 2024, paid net membership additions surged to roughly 9.5 million (up from 5.8 million in 2023), indicating that the company is adding members faster and that this accelerating membership growth is likely to continue fueling streaming‑revenue expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, American Tower recorded a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge for the India reporting unit due to a strategic review that indicated the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. Additionally, the carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $344.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with tower portfolio and network location intangible assets valued at $916.2 million and $243.6 million, respectively. By 2024, the Company finalized a review of estimated useful lives of its tower assets, extending the depreciation period from 20 to 30 years, which led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year. This change in accounting estimate reflects a shift in the long-term valuation and treatment of the India reporting unit's assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the Company revised its estimated settlement dates for asset retirement obligations, extending them based on historical operating experience and management intent. This change increased the asset retirement obligation liability by $470 million and the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay by $875 million, while reducing accretion expense by about $75 million for 2024. Additionally, the Company extended the useful lives of its tower assets from an average of 20 years to 30 years, resulting in a $730 million (after‑tax) decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for 2024. These adjustments reflect evolving estimates of asset lives and settlement timing that affect both impairment assessments and expense recognition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD benefited from the FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) tax benefit, which contributed $147 million to its income tax provision. By 2024, the impact of FDII had evolved due to a change in U.S. tax regulations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures instead of deducting them as incurred. This change increased taxable income in 2024 and 2023, which in turn increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit, indicating a growing influence of FDII on AMD's tax position despite no direct benefit amount being disclosed for 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the FDII tax benefit’s impact on AMD’s taxable income grew as the company’s U.S. taxable income increased due to capitalizing R&D expenses under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which raised taxable income eligible for the FDII deduction. This evolution was driven by the U.S. tax regulation change requiring capitalization of R&D expenditures, which increased taxable income and enhanced the FDII benefit’s effect.",

By 2023, Total PMI Net Revenues increased to $35.174 billion, with combustible products contributing $22.334 billion and smoke-free products contributing $12.840 billion.

      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, PMI’s total net revenues grew from $31,762 million to $35,174 million.  The increase was driven primarily by higher sales of smoke‑free products, which rose from $10,190 million in 2022 to $12,840 million in 2023, while combustible‑product revenues modestly increased from $21,572 million to $22,334 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense. This applied particularly to PSUs with performance periods beginning before 2018, where recipients received dividend equivalents only after the performance period ended and until settlement. For PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received accrued reinvested dividend equivalents, which were paid at the time of settlement. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted to stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs), where most recipients received either a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to retained earnings. Additionally, the grant date fair market value of RSUs that did not receive a dividend equivalent was adjusted to reflect the net present value of estimated dividends not received. This represents a shift from cash-settled to stock-settled instruments with distinct implications for dividend equivalent treatment and financial accounting.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of dividend equivalents shifted from being charged to retained earnings for stock‑settled PSUs issued before 2013 to being accrued and charged to compensation expense (as an “accrued reinvested dividend equivalent”) for both stock‑settled and cash‑settled PSUs granted from 2013 onward. Consequently, while the cash‑settled PSU program continued to settle in cash and required expense recognition over the performance period, the newer cash‑settled awards (introduced in 2018‑2019) also began receiving an accrued reinvested dividend that is now recorded as compensation expense, eliminating the prior practice of charging such equivalents directly to retained earnings. This evolution means that from 2023 to 2024 the company moved from recognizing dividend equivalents only as retained‑earnings adjustments to fully incorporating them into the compensation‑expense measurement for all PSU and RSU awards.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $4,984 million in 2022 to $8,635 million in 2024. This growth was driven by higher segment operating profits, which rose from $7,176 million in 2022 to $9,720 million in 2024.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 Linde’s Total Operating Profit rose from $4,984 million to $8,635 million, a 73% increase. The growth was driven by higher segment operating profit across all regions, especially a 12% rise in EMEA and a 7% rise in the Americas, while Engineering’s profit fell 16% and “Other” turned from a $56 million loss in 2022 to a $62 million gain in 2024. Consequently, the share of profit contributed by each segment shifted: the Americas’ contribution grew modestly, EMEA’s share expanded due to strong pricing and volume gains, APAC’s profit grew 6% but its relative weight stayed small, and Engineering’s share shrank because of lower margins. Reconciling items also changed – purchase‑accounting impacts from the Linde AG merger fell from $1.9 billion in 2022 to $0.94 billion in 2024, and cost‑reduction charges dropped from $273 million to $145 million, leaving the reported operating profit at $8.635 billion in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NFLX reported streaming revenues of $33.64 billion, reflecting a 7% increase from the previous year. In 2024, the company disclosed that it had implemented foreign exchange hedging strategies that directly impacted its streaming revenues. Specifically, hedging gains of $124 million were included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year ended December 31, 2024. This indicates that while the core streaming revenue growth trajectory remained positive, the company actively managed foreign exchange risk in 2024, which contributed an incremental $124 million to its reported streaming revenues.",
      "llm_answer": "NFLX's streaming revenues increased by 7% year‑over‑year in 2023, and the 2024 annual report shows streaming revenues of $17.36 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 (up from $14.87 billion in 2023). The company hedges foreign‑exchange risk on forecasted streaming revenue using cash‑flow forward contracts; gains and losses on these hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and re‑classified into \"Streaming revenues\" when the hedged transaction impacts earnings. Consequently, foreign‑exchange hedging contributed positively to the 2024 streaming‑revenue figure.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, the company recognized a pre-tax income of $63 million related to the Canadian retail business transaction, primarily from a realized gain on contingent consideration and adjustments to the selling price. By fiscal 2024, this impact increased significantly to a pre-tax income of $177 million, driven by additional realized gains on contingent consideration. This indicates that the company continued to benefit financially from post-sale arrangements tied to the performance or milestones related to the Canadian retail business after the initial sale in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact from the Canadian retail business transaction shifted from a $63 million pre‑tax gain in fiscal 2023 to a $177 million pre‑tax gain in fiscal 2024, reflecting a larger realized gain on the contingent consideration that was recognized in the later year.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron described crude oil liftings as a factor that 'impacted' its forward-looking statements, indicating an external influence among many others. By 2024, the company shifted its language to state that its forward-looking statements 'depend on' crude oil liftings, placing it among a narrower group of critical factors affecting outcomes. This change in phrasing indicates a more direct and central framing of crude oil liftings in relation to the company's projections, though the document does not quantify or elaborate on the extent of this dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Chevron’s language around forward‑looking statements has remained consistent in its cautionary framing, but the focus of those statements shifted. In the 2022 filing, the forward‑looking language emphasized risks tied to crude‑oil price volatility, production quotas, refining margins, and the broader energy‑transition context, while still using the standard “may,” “could,” “will,” etc., qualifiers. By the 2024 filing, Chevron’s forward‑looking statements increasingly highlighted its strategic pivot toward lower‑carbon energy, detailing ambitions to “lead in lower carbon intensity oil, products and natural gas” and to grow renewable‑fuel, hydrogen, carbon‑capture and offset businesses, while still retaining the same generic risk‑disclosure language. Thus, the evolution is one of expanding the scope of forward‑looking content to include explicit references to its energy‑transition goals and related business strategies, even though the formal cautionary wording remains largely unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, gasoline costs were described as a negative impact on Costco's business, with rising energy prices contributing to adverse effects on demand, cost of inventory, and operational expenses. The company expressed concerns about its ability to pass on these cost increases without negatively affecting consumer demand. By 2024, however, the framing shifted: gasoline cost fluctuations were described as a factor influencing comparable sales growth, indicating that Costco had begun to treat gasoline price volatility not just as a cost burden, but as a lever affecting sales performance and potentially pricing strategy. This evolution shows that gasoline costs became a more integral, strategic variable in Costco's financial dynamics, rather than solely a risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, gasoline sales remained a low-margin, high-traffic component of Costco’s warehouse ancillary business, contributing to net sales growth but pressuring gross margin percentages. While rising gasoline prices boosted overall sales volume and improved SG&A expense leverage, they also contributed to a 35-basis-point increase in gross margin percentage—primarily driven by warehouse ancillary and other businesses, including gasoline—indicating that Costco’s profitability is moderately sensitive to fluctuations in gasoline prices, though not strategically dependent on them.",

By 2024, these figures increased to $88,461 million for the Lower 48 and $11,274 million for the Asia Pacific/Middle East, indicating a significant increase in investment concentration in the Lower 48 and a modest increase in the Asia Pacific/Middle East.

      "question": "How did Lowe's relationship with its Canadian retail business evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of financial involvement and strategic positioning?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Lowe's completed the sale of its Canadian retail business, which included 232 company-operated stores and 210 dealer-owned stores, and began accounting for contingent consideration related to the transaction. By 2024, Lowe's no longer had an ownership stake in the Canadian retail business and instead recognized $177 million in pre-tax income from realized gains on the contingent consideration related to that sale, indicating a full transition from operational involvement to post-sale financial settlement.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Lowe's completed the sale of its Canadian retail business, which had a material impact on its financial results. The company recognized a pre-tax gain of $177 million in fiscal 2024 related to this divestiture, and the sale contributed to a significant reduction in net earnings ($7,726 million in 2023 vs. $6,957 million in 2024) and a decline in return on invested capital (from 36.4% to 32.0%). The Canadian business had been sold in February 2023, and its financial effects were reflected in the 2023 results, with the 2024 results showing the post-sale financial position. Lowe's maintained a strong liquidity position with $1.8 billion in cash and $4.0 billion in undrawn credit capacity as of January 31, 2025, and continued to focus on strategic investments and shareholder returns despite the Canadian business exit.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BMY reported IPRD-related impairment charges of $136 million, primarily due to discontinuation of development for certain investigational compounds. By 2024, these impairment charges surged to $2.9 billion, indicating a significant increase in the write-down of intangible assets, particularly IPRD. This evolution reflects a more aggressive reassessment of asset valuations, likely due to changing market conditions, regulatory challenges, or internal strategic shifts. The increase from $136 million to $2.9 billion shows a substantial change in how BMY evaluated the recoverability of its IPRD assets within a single year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, BMY’s approach to IPRD-related impairment charges shifted markedly toward greater conservatism and more frequent reassessments. In 2023, impairment charges on intangible assets totaled $136 million, reflecting a partial write‑down of certain projects that were discontinued during pipeline prioritization. By 2024, the company recorded $2.9 billion in impairment charges on long‑lived assets—including intangible assets—driven by a combination of revised cash‑flow projections, earlier‑than‑expected loss of market exclusivity, and the write‑down of newly acquired IPRD (e.g., repotrectinib/Augtyro) that later achieved FDA approval and was re‑classified to acquired marketed product rights. This escalation indicates that BMY is now more aggressively testing the recoverability of its intangible assets, adjusting valuations promptly when market, regulatory, or clinical developments suggest diminished future cash flows, and is willing to take larger write‑downs to reflect a more realistic assessment of asset recoverability.",

This significant reduction indicates a shift in COP's exploration strategy, with fewer dry hole costs recorded in 2024 compared to the prior year, potentially reflecting more targeted or successful exploration efforts.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 10‑K (Note 7 – Impairments and Note 6 – Suspended Wells), ConocoPhillips recorded $37 million of dry‑hole expense in 2023 for the suspended Warka discovery well in Norway and $31 million of dry‑hole costs for the Bear‑1 well in Alaska, compared with $129 million of impairment expense in 2022 for suspended wells in Canada and $102 million of dry‑hole costs in 2022 for four operated wells in Norway. This decline in dry‑hole and impairment charges signals that the company is shifting its exploration focus away from high‑risk, suspended projects and is concentrating on more economically viable assets, as reflected in the reduced exploration expense and a lower balance of suspended well costs ($184 million at year‑end 2023 versus $527 million at year‑end 2022).",

      "original_answer": "Salesforce's gross profit margin for Subscription and Support Revenue increased from 81% in 2023 to 82% in 2024. This margin expansion was driven by a reduction in the cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues, which decreased from 19% in 2023 to 18% in 2024. The cost of Subscription and Support Revenue fell from $5,821 million in 2023 to $6,177 million in 2024, but grew at a slower rate than revenues, contributing to the improvement in gross margin.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Salesforce's gross profit margin for Subscription and Support Revenue remained flat at 82% year-over-year (82% in both 2023 and 2024), as gross profit as a percentage of revenue held steady at 75% for total revenues (with Subscription and Support representing 93% of total revenue). However, the trend in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue drove this stability: cost of revenues for Subscription and Support decreased from 19% of revenue in 2023 to 18% in 2024, while total cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue declined from 27% to 25%. This reduction in cost structure (particularly the 1-percentage-point drop in Subscription and Support cost ratio) offset revenue growth to maintain the same gross margin, even as absolute gross profit increased from $22,992M to $26,316M.",

By the end of 2023, this metric decreased to 6.4 years. This represents a reduction of 0.9 years, indicating a moderate change in the contractual term of outstanding options.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the stock option activity tables provided in the 2022 and 2023 10-K filings, the weighted-average remaining contractual term for employee stock options decreased from 8.3 years at December 31, 2022 to 6.4 years at December 31, 2023, representing a reduction of 1.9 years. This decline reflects the expiration and exercise of older options, leaving only a smaller number of outstanding options with shorter remaining terms.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Converse's direct to consumer revenues increased by 22%, driven by strong digital demand, while wholesale revenues decreased by 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China and global supply chain constraints. By fiscal 2024, both channels experienced declines: direct to consumer revenues decreased by 14% on a currency-neutral basis, mainly due to reduced traffic in North America and Western Europe, and wholesale revenues fell by 16%, driven by declines across all geographies. The shift from growth to decline in direct to consumer and the deepening of the wholesale decline reflect changing market dynamics and increased promotional activity that reduced ASP by 3% in fiscal 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Converse’s revenue fell 15% on a currency‑neutral basis, driven by declines in North America and Western Europe and a 12% drop in combined wholesale and direct‑to‑consumer unit sales, partially offset by growth in Asia. Wholesale revenues fell 16% and direct‑to‑consumer revenues fell 14% on a currency‑neutral basis, with lower traffic in North America and Europe offsetting gains in Asia. The key drivers of these changes were reduced unit volume, lower average selling prices (especially in direct‑to‑consumer channels), and a shift toward more promotional activity, while cost‑related factors such as lower ocean freight rates and modest wage‑related expense reductions provided only limited offset.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group highlighted its cash and investment balances, including $21.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and emphasized that fluctuations in asset values would not materially impact liquidity due to strong operating cash flows and access to credit facilities. Medical costs payable were part of the short-term obligations expected to be covered through operational cash flows and available liquidity. In 2023, the company placed greater emphasis on the estimation methodology for medical costs payable, noting that these estimates require complex assumptions and are inherently uncertain, often changing in subsequent periods. The 2023 disclosure also explicitly tied changes in estimates directly to earnings in the period they are adjusted, signaling a more dynamic and risk-sensitive approach to financial reporting around medical liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, UnitedHealth Group refined its medical costs payable estimates by shifting from relying primarily on historical completion factors for prior periods to applying observed medical cost trend factors to the most recent two months of claim data, supplemented by near-term completion factors. This change improved the precision of its liability estimation, particularly for recently incurred claims. Additionally, the company reported a reduction in the allowance for expected credit losses on its available-for-sale debt securities portfolio, reflecting improved credit quality assessments, which contributed to a more favorable overall risk management outlook for medical cost obligations.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' strategic involvement with Surmont evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what financial implications did this shift have in terms of asset ownership and capital structure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), transitioning from a partial owner to full ownership. This marked a significant shift in strategic involvement, as disclosed in the 2024 filing. The acquisition was funded through new debt issuance of $2.7 billion, increasing total debt from $16.6 billion in 2022 to $18.9 billion by the end of 2023. This reflects a transformation from a shared-operational model to full control, which likely influenced capital allocation decisions, including the planned $9 billion return of capital in 2024, signaling confidence in the company’s post-acquisition financial positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips shifted from a strategic partnership to full ownership of the Surmont asset. In October 2023 the company acquired the remaining 50 % working interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for roughly $2.7 billion of cash (plus a contingent consideration of up to $0.4 billion), thereby gaining 100 % ownership of the Canadian oil‑sands operation. This acquisition was financed primarily through $2.7 billion of new long‑term debt and a $1.1 billion debt‑refinancing that also funded the repurchase of existing notes. By the end of 2024 the company had fully integrated Surmont into its asset base, reflected in its 2024 capital‑expenditure plan and the 2024 pro‑forma financials that include the Surmont assets. The move strengthened ConocoPhillips’ production base and reserve profile, while the debt issuance increased total debt to $18.9 billion, extending the weighted‑average maturity and modestly raising leverage, but the company offset this through strong cash‑flow generation and a $9 billion shareholder‑return framework.",

Because cost of revenues for this segment also fell modestly (from $2,539 million to $2,364 million), the gross profit margin stayed flat, indicating that the company’s cost efficiency in this segment was maintained despite the slight revenue dip.",

This indicates a consistent or growing level of investment in capital projects over the two-year period, as interest capitalization typically reflects ongoing major capital investments. The increase from $62 million to $68 million suggests a moderate upward trend in the company's capital spending.",
      "llm_answer": "The interest capitalized declined from $57 million in 2022 to $68 million in 2023 and then to $68 million in 2024 (the figures show $57 M in 2022, $68 M in 2023 and $68 M in 2024). This downward trend indicates that Linde is investing less in capital projects that require interest capitalization, reflecting a reduced emphasis on financing large‑scale capital expenditures through debt‑related interest accumulation.",

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with current content liabilities remaining unchanged at $4.5 billion, but non-current content liabilities decreased to $2.6 billion.

However, by fiscal 2024, Converse revenues had decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This decline was primarily attributed to drops in North America and Western Europe, with combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales down 12%, driven largely by a decrease in wholesale. Additionally, average selling price (ASP) fell by 3%, mainly due to increased promotional activity in the direct-to-consumer channel.",

In fiscal 2022, Converse generated $2,346 million in revenue (up 6% from $2,205 million in fiscal 2021), but by fiscal 2024 that figure fell to $2,082 million—a 15% drop on a currency‑neutral basis, driven by weak performance in North America and Western Europe and lower unit sales and ASPs in both wholesale and direct‑to‑consumer channels. The contraction was attributed to lower wholesale and direct sales, reduced footwear unit volumes, and pricing pressures, while margin compression from unfavorable foreign‑exchange shifts and higher product costs further weighed on profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron announced a planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 for lower carbon investments, with $2 billion allocated to reducing carbon intensity in traditional oil and gas operations and $8 billion directed toward renewable fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and offsets. By 2024, the company had already spent $7.7 billion on lower carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022, reaffirming its commitment to the same $10 billion total target through 2028. This indicates that Chevron has maintained its long-term capital commitment to lower carbon initiatives, while accelerating spending in the early years, particularly through strategic acquisitions that support its broader decarbonization goals.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s planned capital allocation for lower‑carbon investments has risen from roughly $10 billion through 2028 (announced in 2021) to about $7.7 billion already spent by 2024, with an additional $2 billion earmarked for decarbonising its core oil and gas operations and $8 billion for renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon‑capture projects. This scaling of lower‑carbon spending, together with its 2050 net‑zero upstream aspiration and 2028 carbon‑intensity targets, signals a clear strategic shift toward reducing the carbon intensity of its business while still maintaining a sizable oil‑and‑gas portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power had $26 million in derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes, split between $11 million current and $15 million non-current. By 2024, this amount increased significantly to $110 million total liabilities, with $69 million current and $41 million non-current. This indicates a substantial increase in Alabama Power's risk exposure tied to regulatory hedging instruments over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "Alabama Power’s derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes declined sharply from $113 million at the end of 2023 to $27 million at the end of 2024—a reduction of roughly 76 %. This decrease reflects a substantial fall in the net liability for its hedging derivatives (from $113 M to $27 M), indicating that the company’s regulatory‑hedged derivative exposure has been reduced, suggesting lower risk of adverse price movements in the commodities it hedges.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific expanded its Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment through the acquisition of CorEvitas, LLC, a provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence solutions aimed at improving drug development efficiency. This signaled a strategic move to enhance decision-making tools in biopharma services. By 2024, the segment's revenues increased slightly from $23.041 billion to $23.157 billion, indicating a continuation and consolidation of prior strategic initiatives, though no new major acquisitions were disclosed for that year. This reflects a shift from active expansion through acquisitions in 2023 to a more stable growth phase in 2024.",

The segment experienced **no acquisition‑related revenue impact** and **no currency translation effect**, resulting in **0 % organic growth**. Recent acquisitions—including CorEvitas (August 2023) and Olink (July 2024)—were noted but did not materially shift segment revenue in 2024.",

In 2023, the company's strategy shifted significantly, with wind expenditures decreasing to $2,820 million and solar expenditures increasing substantially to $3,270 million. This indicates a strategic pivot from wind toward solar energy investments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, NEER’s capital allocation strategy shifted toward greater investment in solar and wind projects, as reflected in the higher estimated capital expenditures disclosed in the 2023 Commitments table. Specifically, NEER’s solar capital spending is projected to rise from $3,270 million in 2024 to $1,370 million in 2025, while wind spending declines sharply from $2,820 million in 2024 to $545 million in 2025, indicating a strategic emphasis on expanding solar capacity and repowering existing wind assets. Overall, NEER’s total capital expenditures for 2024‑2028 are estimated at $18.3 billion, with a clear reallocation of resources toward solar and related clean‑energy projects.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Tire Installation was listed among other warehouse ancillary services, but it was embedded within a broader list that included gasoline, pharmacy, optical, and food court services. By 2024, Tire Installation was explicitly called out as a distinct category under warehouse ancillary services, indicating a more deliberate emphasis on its importance. This evolution suggests that Costco may have elevated the strategic positioning of Tire Installation, potentially aligning it more closely with core member services to drive traffic or enhance the value proposition for members.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco’s Tire Installation service has evolved from being a peripheral, ancillary offering in 2022—mentioned only in the context of its broader “Warehouse Ancillary” category and described as part of a diversified service portfolio that includes gasoline, pharmacy, and optical—into a more strategically emphasized component of its membership value proposition by 2024. In the 2024 filing, the company explicitly highlights Executive membership benefits, including the 2% reward program and expanded service access, and notes that Executive members accounted for a significant share of sales, indicating that services like tire installation are now leveraged to deepen member engagement and drive higher spending within the core warehouse model. This shift reflects a broader evolution in how Costco positions its service offerings—not merely as add‑ons but as integral, high‑margin drivers that reinforce the membership ecosystem and support its low‑price, high‑volume business model.",

By 2024, the reported income from equity investments had stabilized at $170 million, with values of $167 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022. This represents a decrease from the adjusted 2021 level but shows relative stability in recent years. The earlier increase in 2021 was partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge in the third quarter of that year related to an APAC joint venture, while the more recent figures suggest a normalization following the structural change in 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde plc's income from equity investments grew from $119 million in 2021 to $170 million in 2024, reflecting the deconsolidation of an APAC joint venture that shifted related income to equity earnings and the absence of the $35 million impairment recorded in 2021.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Sales and Other Expenses included certain indirect taxes, such as digital services taxes, which were reported under 'General and administrative' expenses in prior periods. By 2023, Booking Holdings reclassified these indirect taxes into 'Sales and other expenses' to align with a presentation that reflects costs more closely tied to revenue changes. This reclassification affected the composition of the metric, although it did not impact previously reported Revenue, Operating income, Income before income taxes, or Net income for 2022 or 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the presentation of Sales and Other Expenses was updated to reclassify certain indirect taxes (e.g., digital services taxes) from General and Administrative expenses into Sales and Other Expenses, reflecting their variable nature tied to revenue changes. This reclassification increased Sales and Other Expenses by $168 million in 2022 and $98 million in 2021, while reducing General and Administrative expenses by the same amounts, without affecting total operating results. The composition of Sales and Other Expenses now more clearly separates revenue-linked costs like merchant transaction fees and indirect taxes from fixed administrative costs.",

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with $4.5 billion in current content liabilities, $2.6 billion in non-current content liabilities, and $14.6 billion in off-balance-sheet obligations. This reflects a minor shift in the composition of obligations, with a small decrease in non-current liabilities offset by a slight increase in off-balance-sheet commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix's total content obligations decreased slightly from $21.83 billion to $21.71 billion. The on‑balance‑sheet portion (current and non‑current content liabilities) remained roughly $7.6 billion each year, while the off‑balance‑sheet portion—representing unrecorded commitments for future titles that are not yet determinable—remained large (about $14.6 billion in both years). Thus, the overall breakdown between on‑balance‑sheet and off‑balance‑sheet obligations stayed essentially unchanged, with only modest shifts in the timing of specific commitments.",

By 2024, this table was updated to cover the periods ending December 31, 2024 and 2023.

However, the time‑period coverage of the summarized tables shifted: the 2023 tables (pages 180‑184) cover balances as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, while the 2024 tables (pages 190‑194) present balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, effectively extending the reporting horizon one year forward.",

By 2023, the company no longer disclosed production from Australia and instead focused entirely on domestic U.S. assets, including the Delaware Basin (537 MBOED), Eagle Ford (226 MBOED), Midland Basin (182 MBOED), Bakken (106 MBOED), and Other (16 MBOED), totaling 1,067 MBOED.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, ConocoPhillips' geographic focus for Total MBOED production shifted significantly toward the **Lower 48** region, which contributed **64% of consolidated liquids production and 76% of consolidated natural gas production** in 2023 (up from a smaller share in 2022, as implied by the 2021 data showing the segment's dominance). This shift was accompanied by a **substantial increase in overall output volume**, with the Lower 48's Total MBOED rising from **1,067 MBOED in 2021 to 1,067 MBOED in 2023** (though the 2021 figure is explicitly cited as the baseline for the segment's contribution, confirming its growing share of total production). The company also expanded its focus in Canada (with Surmont now 100% owned and contributing 81 MBOED of bitumen) and maintained steady output in Norway (Total MBOED of 115 MBOED in 2023), but the **primary change was the heightened emphasis on the Lower 48, which drove the overall volume increase**.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Honeywell detailed a specific methodology for estimating asbestos-related liabilities, including the use of average resolution values over a defined look-back period for both pending and future claims projected through 2059. The company also recorded probable insurance recoveries, factoring in the solvency status of insurers, and acknowledged the uncertainty in projections due to variables like future claims filing rates and disease classifications. By 2024, the disclosure became more generalized, focusing on the unpredictability of litigation outcomes and contingent liabilities without specifying the same detailed methodology. The 2024 filing emphasized broader uncertainties, including the potential impact of new developments, settlement strategies, and evidentiary requirements, but omitted the detailed actuarial assumptions present in the 2023 report.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Honeywell’s asbestos‑related liability disclosures continued to rely on the same methodology of estimating future claims using historical resolution values, epidemiological projections through 2059, and assumptions about claim filing and dismissal rates, while also evaluating probable insurance recoveries based on coverage interpretations and insurer solvency. The 2024 filing emphasizes that these projections remain highly uncertain, noting that changes in liability estimates, recovery experience, or insurer financial conditions could materially alter the anticipated insurance reimbursements, and it reiterates the need for ongoing reassessment of both the liability and recovery assumptions.",

By 2024, there was no indication of any divestiture or change in ownership of Surmont; however, the company disclosed plans to sell noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for approximately $400 million.

In 2024 the company continued to hold the full interest and reported payments of $158 million under the contingent‑consideration arrangement tied to WCS pricing, while also finalizing the purchase‑price allocation and recognizing the full fair‑value of the acquired proved and unproved properties.",

      "question": "How has Linde's treatment and disclosure of purchase accounting impacts evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its influence on segment operating profit and management's performance evaluation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde excluded purchase accounting impacts from its non-GAAP measures, emphasizing that these adjustments were critical for investor understanding due to their uneven geographic impact and the fact that management and variable compensation were assessed based on results excluding these impacts. By 2024, purchase accounting impacts were explicitly included in the company's definition of segment operating profit, indicating a shift in how these impacts are communicated and evaluated internally and externally. This evolution reflects a more integrated approach to reporting these adjustments within segment performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's purchase accounting disclosures have evolved to explicitly separate and quantify the impacts of merger-related adjustments (e.g., fair‑value step‑ups in assets, amortization of acquired intangibles, debt fair‑value amortization) on segment operating profit. In 2024 the company reports segment operating profit **excluding** these purchase accounting impacts, whereas prior‑year disclosures presented total operating profit that included such adjustments. This change makes segment profit more reflective of underlying operational performance and allows management to evaluate segment results on a basis comparable to internal performance metrics and external peers. Consequently, segment operating profit now serves as a more reliable basis for performance evaluation and incentive compensation, as it isolates genuine operating trends from the non‑cash effects of the Linde AG merger.",

Financially, the segment reported $6,030 million in remaining performance obligations as of December 31, 2024, reflecting ongoing contract commitments, while the company's overall repositioning charges decreased significantly to $244 million in 2024 (down from $860 million in 2023), driven by reduced workforce reductions and asset impairments in Industrial Automation.",

This represents a decline in the average revenue generated per membership, suggesting a potential shift in the company's pricing strategy or a change in the mix of membership plans offered.

In 2024, Alabama Power had specific disclosures showing $26 million in total derivatives designated for regulatory purposes, with $42 million in non-current liabilities and $23 million net recognized liabilities on the balance sheet. The 2024 disclosures also included a breakdown of current and non-current portions of these derivatives, indicating a more detailed regulatory reporting structure compared to the general segment reporting in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Alabama Power’s energy-related derivatives designated for regulatory purposes saw a shift in balance sheet presentation and reporting structure. In 2023, regulatory hedges were reported as current ($11M) and non-current ($15M) assets/liabilities under \"Energy-related derivatives designated as hedging instruments for regulatory purposes,\" with net amounts of $7M (assets) and $23M (liabilities) after offsets. By 2024, these derivatives were reclassified under \"Regulatory assets\" with current ($11M) and non-current ($15M) components, and net amounts of $7M (assets) and $23M (liabilities), reflecting a consistent presentation focused on regulatory recovery mechanisms rather than direct balance sheet liabilities. The 2024 disclosures also emphasized the role of these derivatives in fuel-hedging programs, where gains/losses are initially recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets and later recovered through approved cost recovery, maintaining their regulatory accounting treatment without material changes in classification or reporting structure.",

However, this was partly offset by higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable volume/mix due to lower cigarette mix. In 2024, Operating Income Excl. increased by 25.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing and volume/mix driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. However, lower manufacturing costs were largely offset by higher marketing, administration, and research costs, and a favorable comparison to the prior year was noted due to the South Korea indirect tax charge of $204 million in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was described as being driven by demand for volume licensing, Software Assurance, and advanced security offerings such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on the number of information workers in enterprises rather than PC sales. By 2023, the revenue categorization expanded to include 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services,' explicitly listing Windows cloud services as a component alongside volume licensing. The inclusion of 'cloud services' in the 2023 breakdown indicates a strategic shift toward integrating cloud-based offerings into the Windows Commercial portfolio. This evolution suggests that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, as part of the broader cloud services, became more embedded within a diversified set of commercial offerings, aligning with the company's emphasis on cloud transformation and subscription-based models. The 2023 filing also introduced a formalized growth metric for this revenue segment, signaling a more structured approach to tracking and expanding this part of the business.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Windows Commercial revenue grew as part of Microsoft's broader shift toward cloud and security services, with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint playing a key role in its commercial offering. This growth occurred within the Intelligent Cloud segment, where server and cloud services revenue—including Azure and Windows cloud services—rose 22%, driven by increased adoption of cloud-based security and productivity solutions. The expansion of Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions (up 7% in seats) and Dynamics 365 growth (24%) further reflects a strategic pivot toward integrated, cloud-native offerings that combine security, productivity, and enterprise software.",

By 2024, the segment experienced a 33% decline in net revenue, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion in 2024, primarily due to customer inventory normalization. Additionally, in 2024, AMD expanded its adaptive computing portfolio with the launch of the new Versal™ Series Gen 2 devices, including the Versal AI Edge Series Gen 2 and Versal Prime Series Gen 2 adaptive SoCs, which focused on end-to-end acceleration of AI-driven embedded systems.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, AMD's Embedded Segment experienced a 33% decline in revenue, primarily due to customers normalizing their inventory levels. The segment's product focus remained centered on embedded CPUs (including Ryzen Embedded V-Series, R-Series, and EPYC Embedded processors), FPGAs (UltraScale+ and older series), and Adaptive SoCs (Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC, Versal AI Edge, and Versal Prime), which serve diverse markets like industrial, automotive, and aerospace. Despite the revenue drop, the segment continued to leverage its core embedded technologies for high-performance, low-power applications requiring 24/7 operation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $14.56, showing a 9% increase compared to the previous year. By 2023, this metric had significantly declined to $8.66, reflecting a 2% increase year-over-year. This sharp drop indicates a major shift in Netflix's pricing strategy or market dynamics, such as a move toward more affordable plans, increased competition, or changes in regional pricing structures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s average monthly revenue per paying membership declined from $8.50 to $7.64—a 10% drop—despite an 17% increase in average paying memberships. This indicates that the company’s pricing strategy yielded lower revenue per user, likely due to competitive pressures, market saturation, and a shift toward lower-priced plans or regions, rather than pure volume growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, American Tower recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $402.0 million related to the India and Spain reporting units, with a significant portion attributed to the India reporting unit. In 2024, the company recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million specifically for the India reporting unit as of September 30, 2023. This indicates a continued deterioration in the financial health of the India reporting unit, as its carrying amount still exceeded its estimated fair value even after the prior year's impairment, signaling ongoing challenges in this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The goodwill impairment charge related to the India reporting unit was $322 million in 2023, and the company recorded an additional $402 million of goodwill impairment for India and Spain in 2023 (with the $322 million specifically tied to the India unit). There is no indication of a further goodwill impairment charge for India in 2024, suggesting that the unit’s goodwill had already been fully impaired and was not carried forward as a liability. Consequently, the absence of a new impairment charge in 2024 signals that the India reporting unit’s goodwill no longer contributed to the company’s balance sheet, reflecting a deteriorated financial position that prompted the earlier write‑down.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 10.4%, driven by a favorable pricing variance mainly from combustible tobacco, a favorable comparison related to Saudi Arabia customs assessments of $246 million, and a favorable volume/mix primarily from higher cigarette and HTU volumes. In 2024, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix mainly from higher HTU volume, but partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a shift in growth drivers from broad pricing and volume gains across both product lines in 2023 to a more HTU-focused volume/mix benefit in 2024, with some moderation in pricing impact.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions grew 19.3%, driven by favorable pricing variance and volume/mix dynamics. Volume/mix gains—primarily from growth in ZYN nicotine pouches in the U.S. and higher HTU shipments—partly offset cigarette volume declines outside the U.S., while pricing improvements also contributed to revenue growth. Operating income, however, fell sharply (down 41.1% excluding currency and acquisitions) due to higher marketing, administrative, and restructuring costs, despite these favorable volume and pricing factors.",

In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, increased by $122 million, but after write-offs of $199 million and adjustments for foreign currency, ended at $577 million. This indicates a shift in inventory risk exposure, with a notable reduction in the allowance balance by the end of 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting either improved inventory management or a strategic reduction in inventory holdings.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM’s Allowance for Inventory Losses increased from $631 million at the end of 2023 to $658 million at the end of 2024, reflecting a $201 million addition offset by $183 million in write‑offs and a $9 million foreign‑currency adjustment.

      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's additional investments and advances increased from $3.1 billion in 2022 to $3.0 billion in 2023, reflecting a modest decline in spending on new projects and acquisitions, while the company's capital‑expenditure plan remains robust, targeting $23‑$25 billion of investments in 2024. This trend indicates that, despite a slight pull‑back in short‑term investment outlays, ExxonMobil continues to prioritize disciplined, long‑term capital deployment to sustain production growth and strategic initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMD's Embedded Operating Income was $2.6 billion. In 2024, it decreased to $1.4 billion, representing a decline of $1.2 billion. This significant drop was primarily driven by lower revenue due to reduced demand as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, AMD's Embedded segment operating income declined significantly from $2,628 million in 2023 to $1,421 million in 2024, representing a decrease of $1,207 million (approximately 46%). This reduction was primarily attributed to lower demand as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels, as noted in the 2024 segment reporting (page 50) and the discussion of Embedded segment performance in the same document. The decline reflects a 33% drop in Embedded net revenue ($5.321 billion to $3.557 billion) that directly impacted operating income.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 42,802 thousand, while the average monthly revenue per membership rose slightly to $8.66.

This indicates that subscriber growth outpaced pricing gains, driving overall revenue growth (5% to $3.76 B) but putting pressure on revenue per user, likely reflecting a mix of lower‑priced plans, regional expansion, and modest price increases.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe was 30.3%, down from 31.1% in 2022, reflecting a decline of 0.8 percentage points. In 2024, the cigarette market share remained unchanged at 30.3% compared to the prior year, indicating that the rate of decline slowed to zero. This suggests a potential stabilization in PM's cigarette business in Europe, which may reflect strategic adjustments or competitive responses to market pressures, including competition from heated tobacco products which saw continued growth in market share.",
      "llm_answer": "Philip Morris' cigarette market share in Europe increased by 0.8 percentage points to 30.3% in 2023, while its heated tobacco unit (HTU) share rose by 1.3 points to 9.1%, reflecting a favorable shift in market positioning. This growth occurred despite a 1.3% decline in the overall European market for cigarettes and HTUs, driven by volume declines in key markets like the UK, France, and Germany, partially offset by growth in Turkey and Poland. The acceleration in share gains—particularly in HTUs—suggests improving competitive positioning, as PMI's volume and mix improvements outpaced market contraction, though the overall market share growth (0.4 points for total Europe) remains modest due to the region's overall decline.",

In 2024, the company shifted its framing, describing the relationship as being 'impacted by' client spending budgets and economic conditions. This indicates a more passive but still significant sensitivity to external spending trends, suggesting a strategic reframing of how client budgets influence IBM's business outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's view of the link between client spending and its own performance has shifted from a focus on overall budget levels to a more nuanced, risk‑aware stance. In the 2023 filing it warned that a downturn in economic conditions and reduced client‑spending budgets could directly hurt revenue and profit, emphasizing that any slowdown in client demand would immediately affect results. By 2024 the language stresses that client‑spending volatility—especially in high‑value, competitive segments—creates uncertainty for revenue growth and can raise costs if IBM must adapt quickly to shifting preferences, making the relationship more conditional and dependent on client adoption of hybrid‑cloud and AI solutions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Mastercard classified its net revenues into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions, with the payment network primarily generating revenue from fees based on GDV (including both domestic and cross-border volume) and for providing switching and other network-related services. By 2024, the company consolidated its reporting into a single reportable operating segment called 'Payment Solutions,' which derives revenue from a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers, including access to the continuous payment network and value-added services either integrated or sold standalone. This evolution indicates a shift from a dual classification of revenue sources to a more unified segment reporting approach, where all activities are considered interrelated and supportive of each other.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard continues to report its payment network results within a single \"Payment Solutions\" operating segment, but the way it classifies and presents revenue within that segment has evolved. In the 2024 filing, revenue is broken out more granularly (e.g., payment‑network fees, value‑added services, and specific cost components such as personnel, professional fees, data‑processing, advertising, etc.) and disclosed in the CODM performance tables, whereas the 2023 filing presented a more aggregated net‑revenue figure with fewer detailed line‑item disclosures. Additionally, the 2024 filing includes expanded commentary on segment‑level performance metrics, hedging activities, and ESG‑related compensation modifiers that affect how the segment’s results are measured and reported.",

By 2024, the segment's revenue sources were described as primarily coming from 'healthcare-related services' and internet services, suggesting a shift from general health technology toward more direct healthcare services. While internet services remained a consistent revenue contributor in both years, the evolution from 'health technology' to 'healthcare-related services' implies a more specialized or clinical orientation in the later year.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Alphabet’s Other Bets segment has seen healthcare-related revenue grow as part of its diversified “emerging businesses” portfolio, with the 2024 filing explicitly noting that “revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.” While the 2022 filing describes Other Bets as including “early-stage businesses” at various development stages and mentions healthcare as one of the industries targeted, it does not provide detailed segment-level revenue breakdowns. By 2024, the focus on healthcare has become more pronounced, aligning with Alphabet’s broader strategy of investing in high-risk, high-reward frontier technologies like AI and quantum computing, though specific revenue figures or growth rates for healthcare offerings within Other Bets are not disclosed. The evolution reflects a continued, deliberate investment in commercializing health tech ventures—such as Verily and Waymo’s health initiatives—though these remain a small, strategic component of the overall Other Bets segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company underwrote consumer loans using proprietary models that included deal structure data, and Table 21 provided credit score distribution details for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2023, the company continued to incorporate deal structure data into its underwriting process, but Table 21 was updated to reflect credit score distribution metrics as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. This indicates that while the use of deal structure data remained consistent, the underlying credit score metrics used in underwriting evolved to reflect more recent borrower risk profiles.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed credit score metrics for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, the use of deal structure data in underwriting consumer loans has remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, with no indication of structural changes in underwriting methodology. The credit score distributions for both portfolios show near-identical proportions of borrowers with FICO scores above and below key thresholds (e.g., 660 for credit cards and 620 for auto loans) in both years, suggesting that credit scoring models and associated underwriting practices, which incorporate credit bureau data as part of deal structure, have been applied consistently without significant evolution.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT evaluated strategic alternatives for its India operations, receiving third-party indications of value that were lower than the carrying value of the India reporting unit. This information was used as a significant input in determining the fair value of the unit during the goodwill impairment test, although no impairment was explicitly recorded in that year. By contrast, in 2024, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, leading to a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This marks a shift from a potential strategic exit with uncertain impairment implications to a concrete recognition of value loss.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the India reporting unit on AMT evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of fair value assessment and goodwill impairment charges. In 2023, the Company identified a triggering event for goodwill impairment in its India reporting unit due to third-party indications of value during strategic reviews, leading to an interim quantitative impairment test as of September 30, 2023. This assessment resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million, as disclosed in the 2023 financial statements. By 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC TIPL (India Tower Private Limited) on September 12, 2024, as part of the ATC TIPL Transaction, which concluded the strategic review and led to the disposal of the entire India operations. The disposal resulted in a loss from discontinued operations of $978.3 million for 2024, reflecting the cumulative impact of prior impairments and the final exit from the market, as detailed in the 2024 financial statements. The fair value assessment during 2023 was informed by third-party valuations and a probability-weighted approach, but the subsequent sale in 2024 marked the definitive resolution of the unit's financial impact.",

By 2023, Amgen's disclosures revealed a shift in the composition and sourcing of these rights, noting that developed-product-technology rights now included assets acquired through the Horizon and ChemoCentryx acquisitions. This marks a change from 2022, where no such specific acquisitions were cited in the description of these rights. The inclusion of these new acquisitions in 2023 suggests a strategic expansion in Amgen’s portfolio of developed-product-technology rights, likely influencing the valuation and structure of these assets.",

This shift was driven primarily by goodwill from the Horizon purchase and the inclusion of new finite‑lived intangible assets, indicating a strategic expansion of acquired product‑technology rights and related amortization.",

In 2024, this growth slowed to 8.6%, still driven by favorable pricing variance and volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, with lower cigarette volume as a partial offset. The decline in growth rate from 11.2% to 8.6% indicates a moderation in the rate of expansion despite continued strength in HTU volume.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, slowed from 19.3% in 2023 to 8.6% in 2024, primarily driven by favorable pricing and volume/mix gains from higher HTU shipments (especially ZYN in the U.S. and growth in markets like Turkey), partially offset by lower cigarette volume and unfavorable mix in certain regions. This deceleration was most pronounced in the Americas, where net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions fell 2.9% due to declining cigarette volumes outside the U.S., while Europe and SSEA/CIS/MEA saw stronger growth (8.6% and 11.7% respectively) fueled by HTU volume expansion and pricing benefits.",

This decrease signals that the company is shifting its strategic investment focus from large‑scale restructuring toward operational efficiency and targeted growth areas such as healthcare logistics and digital services, while still maintaining modest spending to complete remaining technology and portfolio‑review projects through 2025.",

      "original_answer": "Corporate and Financing Expenses decreased from $1,791 million in 2023 to $1,372 million in 2024, representing a significant decline of $419 million. In 2023, expenses increased compared to 2022 due to the absence of favorable tax-related items from the prior year, although this was partially offset by lower financing costs. By 2024, the expenses dropped notably, primarily driven by further reductions in financing costs.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Corporate and Financing expenses declined from $1,791 million to $1,372 million—a reduction of roughly $419 million. The primary driver of this decrease was lower financing costs, while the prior‑year increase in 2023 had been attributed mainly to the absence of favorable tax‑related items. Consequently, the expense reduction reflects improved financing conditions and the removal of those tax benefits.",

By 2024, Alphabet's involvement in Other Bets evolved into a more active investment and development approach, with a focus on 'using technology to solve big problems' across industries like transportation and health technology. The 2024 report also highlights that some Other Bets are 'already generating revenue and making important strides,' showing a shift from early-stage exploration to more mature, revenue-generating ventures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Alphabet’s strategic involvement in Other Bets has shifted from a broad, moonshot‑oriented investment approach toward a more focused, operational emphasis on scaling mature initiatives and integrating AI across its portfolio. In 2022 the company highlighted its long‑term moonshot philosophy and early AI investments, while by 2024 it emphasized concrete AI‑driven products (e.g., Gemini, Circle‑to‑Search) and the commercial rollout of autonomous ride‑hailing via Waymo, signaling a move from experimental bets to revenue‑generating, AI‑enabled businesses. This evolution reflects tighter operational focus, tighter integration with core Google services, and a disciplined investment strategy aimed at turning Other Bets into sustainable growth engines.",

By 2023, the facility was listed as 'Leased' in Tesla's primary manufacturing facilities table, indicating that while Tesla is still utilizing the site, it does not own the property outright, which may reflect a shift in capital allocation strategy or facility management approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Tesla's relationship with its Megafactory in Lathrop, California shifted from a leased facility (as noted in the 2022 10-K's property table listing it as \"Leased\") to a strategic asset under active development, reflecting its growing role in energy storage production. The 2023 10-K explicitly references ongoing construction and ramp-up efforts for the Megafactory as part of Tesla's broader strategy to expand energy generation and storage capacity, emphasizing its importance for meeting demand and supporting future growth despite component constraints. This evolution underscores a strategic pivot from mere facility use to a core component of Tesla's long-term manufacturing and sustainability objectives.",

In 2023, the company provided a more granular sensitivity table showing specific dollar impacts of completion factor changes on medical costs payable, with a 0.75% change leading to an $867 million impact. This evolution indicates a shift from a general sensitivity estimate to a more detailed, scenario-based analysis of medical cost liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PM's net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 1.9%, driven by higher cigarette, HTU, and device volumes, but partly offset by unfavorable device and cigarette mix. In contrast, in 2024, the increase in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, was significantly higher at 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a substantial improvement in revenue performance from 2023 to 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, PM's net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions rose 11.7% in SSEA, CIS & MEA and 19.3% in the Americas, driven by favorable pricing (especially higher combustible tobacco prices), volume/mix growth from higher cigarette and HTU shipments, and one-time favorable comparisons (e.g., $80M distribution termination charge in 2023). Operating income grew 26.8% in SSEA, CIS & MEA and 19.3% in the Americas, reflecting similar drivers plus lower prior-year costs (e.g., $80M charge in 2023), though the Americas saw a 41.1% decline in operating income (excluding currency/aquisitions) due to heavy investments in ZYN and restructuring costs.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, LOW's Obsolete Inventory Reserve stood at $168 million as of January 28, 2022, reflecting a decrease of approximately $14 million from the prior year. By fiscal 2023, this reserve increased significantly by approximately $106 million, reaching $245 million as of February 2, 2024. This substantial increase indicates that LOW anticipated higher losses associated with inventory becoming obsolete, suggesting a shift in inventory risk exposure, possibly due to changes in consumer purchasing patterns or product quality concerns.",
      "llm_answer": "The Obsolete Inventory Reserve increased by approximately $106 million from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, rising to $245 million as of February 2, 2024. This rise reflects higher anticipated losses from inventory sold below cost, indicating that Lowe’s is confronting greater inventory‑risk exposure and may need to adjust its purchasing and pricing strategies to mitigate potential margin compression.",

In 2023, the company reported $1,225.6 million in property revenue from Africa, representing a more modest 3% increase compared to 2022.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Africa property revenue rose from $1,192.5 million to $1,225.6 million—a 3 % increase—driven by higher tenant billings, colocations, amendments, and pass‑through revenue, while foreign‑currency effects had a modest negative impact. This growth signals that the company is expanding its African portfolio and extracting more revenue from existing sites, supporting a continued upward trajectory in that region.",

By 2023, the change in non-qualifying hedge activity contributed a $2,986 million increase to net income compared to the prior year. This indicates a significant shift from a source of earnings volatility to a substantial earnings contributor, reflecting a reversal in the direction and magnitude of the impact from these activities.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle described its Services Business as one of three operating segments, but the strategic positioning focused primarily on general enterprise IT environments with a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies. The Services Business was not explicitly tied to cloud adoption but rather positioned as a flexible offering across deployment models. By fiscal 2023, Oracle significantly evolved its strategic positioning of the Services Business, explicitly linking it to cloud adoption and customer support. The 2023 filing emphasized that customers could 'continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments.' This included integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and AI-enhanced offerings like Oracle Autonomous Database, which used machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions. The Services Business in 2023 was framed as a key enabler of cloud migration and customer retention, with a focus on supporting Oracle Cloud Services contracts and product enhancements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2023, Oracle shifted its Services Business strategy to emphasize cloud adoption and integrated support, moving from a focus on traditional on-premise license support to a model centered on cloud services and subscription-based support. This transition is evident in the growing proportion of cloud services revenues (increasing from 25% in fiscal 2022 to 32% in fiscal 2023) and the company's explicit emphasis on cloud migration programs that allow customers to pivot licenses and support contracts to Oracle Cloud, alongside expanded SaaS offerings designed for intuitive, secure, and flexible cloud deployment.",

By 2024, the company continued to emphasize structural cost savings as a key earnings driver, incorporating it into its newly introduced earnings driver framework. While the 2024 disclosure does not provide a new cumulative savings figure, the explicit inclusion of structural cost savings as a defined earnings driver indicates a strategic shift to institutionalize cost efficiency as a recurring component of earnings performance. This evolution shows that XOM transitioned from achieving cost savings as a阶段性 initiative to embedding it as a core financial metric in its reporting and operational strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's structural cost savings accelerated from $2.3 billion in 2023 to an estimated $12.1 billion of cumulative savings versus 2019, reflecting ongoing efficiency gains and workforce reductions that the company expects to sustain.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, the Core Routing portfolio contributed to flat revenue in the routed optical networking segment, with growth specifically attributed to the Cisco 8000 series offerings and the webscale provider market. By fiscal 2023, the Core routing portfolio continued to grow, contributing to an overall 18% increase in the Networking product category. This growth was driven by Catalyst 8000 routers, SD-WAN, and IoT routing offerings. Therefore, the Core Routing portfolio evolved from maintaining stability in revenue during fiscal 2022 to actively driving growth in fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Cisco’s core routing portfolio—encompassed within the Networking product category—declined 15% year‑over‑year (a $5.3 billion drop) in fiscal 2024, driven by weaker demand for campus and data‑center switching (especially Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000), enterprise routing softness, and a slowdown in Wi‑Fi‑6 and Meraki wireless sales. The decline was partially offset by growth in SD‑WAN offerings and the inclusion of Splunk‑related revenue. Earlier (fiscal 2022‑2023) the same portfolio had risen 18% as customers upgraded to Catalyst 9000, Nexus 9000 and Meraki switches, adopted Catalyst 8000 routers and expanded Wi‑Fi‑6 and Meraki deployments. Thus, the core routing business trended downward in the most recent period after a prior period of growth.",

      "question": "How has Capital One's approach to disclosing net charge-off rate calculations evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of transparency around credit quality and policy details?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One provided a comprehensive explanation of its net charge-off policies, including a detailed breakdown of charge-off methodologies by loan type and a historical table (Table 26) showing net charge-off amounts and rates for 2019 through 2021. By 2023, this level of detail was no longer included; instead, the company only provided a brief definition of net charge-off rates without historical data or specific loan category breakdowns. This represents a significant reduction in transparency regarding credit quality and charge-off practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s 2023 10‑K shows a marked increase in transparency around credit‑quality metrics and charge‑off calculations.  The filing now provides detailed tables (e.g., Table 26) that break out net charge‑off amounts and rates by portfolio segment, includes the methodology for calculating those rates, and adds supplemental disclosures on non‑performing loans, delinquency aging, and the impact of recent accounting standard adoptions.  Compared with the 2022 filing, the 2023 report expands the granularity of charge‑off data (including separate international card‑business rates) and adds clearer explanations of how charge‑off policies vary by loan type and how recoveries are recorded, thereby offering investors a more comprehensive view of the company’s credit‑risk monitoring and reporting practices.",

The segment was positioned within a long-term corporate planning framework supported by the Global Outlook and annual Corporate Plan. By 2024, the company elevated the strategic importance of Specialty Products by categorizing it under 'Advantaged Projects' and explicitly linking it to value creation through integration, higher-value product yields, and above-average returns. Additionally, in 2024, Specialty Products were tied to performance chemicals and lubricants, highlighting differentiation and customer value enhancement, a shift from the broader integrated business model focus of 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's Specialty Products segment has evolved from a standalone reporting focus in 2023 to being integrated within the broader Product Solutions business structure in 2024, with explicit strategic emphasis on value creation through \"Advantaged Volume Growth\" and \"High-Value Products\" (including performance chemicals and lower-emission fuels). The segment's earnings (excluding identified items) grew from $2,807 million in 2023 to $3,065 million in 2024, reflecting enhanced integration with Upstream and Chemical segments to leverage advantaged assets like Guyana and the Permian Basin, while maintaining focus on sustainable value creation through innovation and lower-emission product development.",

In the 2024 filing, the revenue further increased from $62,871 million in 2023 to $87,109 million in 2024, but the growth rate slowed to 39%.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the document outlined the asset allocation for U.S. Retiree Health Care, indicating that 65% - 80% of assets were invested in fixed income securities and cash equivalents, with the remainder in equity securities. By 2023, the company reported specific projected funding obligations for U.S. Retiree Health Care, totaling $27 million for 2024, declining to $22 million by 2028, and $97 million cumulatively from 2029 to 2033. This reflects a decreasing financial obligation over time, as compared to the earlier year's asset-focused disclosure.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial commitment to U.S. retiree health care obligations decreased from 2022 to 2023, with the projected funding level for 2023 showing a reduction in the present value of benefit obligations. Specifically, the December 31, 2022 balance sheet reflects $7 million in fixed income securities and cash equivalents and $98 million in equity securities for the U.S. retiree health care plan, totaling $105 million in plan assets, while the 2023 data shows $4 million in fixed income securities and cash equivalents and $54 million in equity securities, totaling $214 million in plan assets. However, the projected benefit payments for 2023 under the U.S. Retiree Health Care plan are $27 million for 2024, $25 million for 2025, $24 million for 2026, $23 million for 2027, $22 million for 2028, and $97 million for 2029–2033, indicating a continued but slightly reduced funding trajectory compared to prior years. The key change is the updated discount rate assumption for 2023 (5.68% for benefit obligations, down from 5.68% in 2022), which reflects a lower rate used to calculate the present value of future obligations, resulting in a lower projected funding requirement.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Company monitored tenant-related intangible assets for impairment based on indicators such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts, or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. By 2023, the Company expanded its criteria to include an additional indicator: 'the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations.' This evolution reflects a more comprehensive approach to assessing potential impairments by incorporating financial performance indicators of tenants alongside existing operational and contractual indicators.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 the Company’s monitoring and impairment assessment for tenant‑related intangible assets remained largely unchanged – it continued to evaluate these assets on a tenant‑by‑tenant basis for indicators such as high turnover, non‑renewal of contracts, or cancellations, and to test recoverability using projected undiscounted cash flows. In 2023 the Company introduced a new indicator of impairment by monitoring “high levels of turnover or attrition, non‑renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship” on a tenant‑by‑tenant basis, and it began assessing recoverability through projected undiscounted future cash flows specific to each tenant‑related intangible asset. This added a more granular, tenant‑level focus to the existing impairment methodology.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the accrued balance for U.S. rebate accruals related to Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D was $2.3 billion, and the company used prior payment history as a key input in estimating the expected provision for rebates. In 2024, this accrued balance decreased slightly to $2.2 billion, and prior payment history continued to be used as a foundational element in the estimation process. The slight decrease in the accrued balance suggests a minor adjustment in expected rebate obligations, which may reflect either a refinement in the use of prior payment data or a shift in rebate claim trends. This indicates that while the methodology remained consistent, the underlying assumptions or data inputs based on prior payment history may have evolved slightly to reflect updated trends in rebate claims.",
      "llm_answer": "The use of prior payment history in estimating U.S. rebate accruals was retained as part of the Company’s estimation approach for Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D rebates in both 2023 and 2024.  Management continued to rely on historical payment data—combined with pricing, utilization mix, inventory levels and contract terms—to project the expected rebate provision, which resulted in an accrued balance of $2.2 billion for these rebates as of December 31 2024.  No substantive change in the methodology was disclosed between the two years.",

By 2024, JPM adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2024, for Investments in Tax Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method, applied under the modified retrospective method, signaling a specific procedural update in how tax consequences are accounted for. This indicates a shift from general acknowledgment of complexity and estimation risk to the implementation of a new structured accounting methodology for tax-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "JPMorgan Chase’s approach to accounting for tax‑related assets and liabilities—particularly the assessment of realizability and valuation allowances—remained consistent with its standard asset‑and‑liability method for deferred taxes. However, the 2024 disclosures show a modest increase in the valuation allowance (from $183 million in 2023 to $249 million in 2024) and a corresponding rise in the net deferred tax asset balance (from $17,910 million to $17,600 million), reflecting the Firm’s ongoing evaluation of the likelihood of realizing non‑U.S. deferred tax assets, especially NOL carryforwards.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GD's Marine Systems segment contributed to revenue growth driven by U.S. Navy ship construction. By 2023, the segment's performance was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program. These challenges were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis-class (TAO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program in 2023. Additionally, GD highlighted increased risk in 2023 around variable consideration for long-term U.S. Navy contracts, particularly the Virginia-class submarine program, indicating a shift toward greater financial uncertainty compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GD's Marine Systems segment revenue grew from $11,040 million to $12,461 million, driven primarily by increased U.S. Navy ship construction—particularly on the Columbia‑class submarine and John Lewis‑class replenishment oiler programs—while operating earnings declined modestly, with the segment’s operating margin falling to 8.6% in 2023 due to the early‑stage, lower‑margin nature of these new submarine and destroyer contracts.",

By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and expected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a strategic shift toward significantly reducing or eliminating postretirement medical costs over the medium term.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Merck recorded $190 million in pretax costs related to the upcoming 2024 Restructuring Program, which included facility shut-down expenses as a key component. By 2024, the company disclosed that the cumulative pretax costs for this restructuring program were estimated at $4.0 billion, with facility shut-down costs continuing to represent a significant portion of the cash outlays. This indicates a substantial increase in restructuring activity and signals an escalation in the execution phase of the program, aligning with the company’s plan to optimize its global manufacturing networks for both Human and Animal Health. The shift from initial costs in 2023 to broader implementation in 2024 reveals a deliberate scaling of restructuring efforts.",

The 2024 restructuring expenses—$888 million in total, of which $190 million relates to the 2024 program—reflect ongoing optimization of its global manufacturing network and animal‑health supply chain, with about 60 % of the total costs being non‑cash accelerated depreciation and the remainder representing cash outlays for facility closures. This progression shows that Merck is steadily scaling back excess capacity and shifting resources toward new modalities, underscoring the expanding scope and long‑term commitment of its restructuring efforts across both years.",

      "question": "How has Boeing's financial exposure and liquidity position related to its Commercial Airplanes segment evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of operating cash flow challenges and backlog value?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment faced significant operating cash flow challenges due to lower deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers, with net cash used by operating activities reaching $3.4 billion in 2021. The company had $16.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $58.1 billion in debt as of December 31, 2021, and anticipated continued negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramped up. By 2024, the Commercial Airplanes segment reported a contractual backlog of $498,802 million, up slightly from $497,094 million in 2023, indicating a gradual recovery in order book stability. While liquidity improved as the company moved past the worst of the 737 MAX and pandemic-related disruptions, the segment was still not fully back to pre-crisis financial health, though the trend suggests improvement.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment experienced a dramatic shift from profitability to significant losses, driven by operational and financial pressures. In 2022, BCA generated $26,026 million in revenue with a $2,341 million loss from operations, reflecting ongoing challenges from the 737 MAX grounding and pandemic impacts. By 2023, revenue increased to $33,901 million (up 30% from 2022) due to higher 787 deliveries, but losses narrowed to $1,635 million as abnormal production costs declined and deliveries rose. However, in 2024, BCA revenue dropped sharply to $22,861 million (down 33% from 2023) due to lower deliveries across all programs, including the 737-9 grounding in January 2024, and a $7,969 million loss from operations—nearly five times the 2023 loss. This deterioration was exacerbated by $4,079 million in reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, lower margins from production disruptions (including the IAM 751 work stoppage), and higher R&D expenses. Despite a substantial backlog of $521 billion (including $498 billion in contractual backlog), the segment's operating cash flow remained severely constrained by these losses, with negative operating cash flows persisting until commercial deliveries can ramp up. The company's liquidity was further strained by $1,770 million in supplier cost increases recorded in 2024, directly impacting cash flow and profitability.",

      "question": "How did Netflix's disclosure regarding obligations for unknown future content titles evolve between 2022 and 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that it did not include any estimated obligation for future titles beyond the known minimum amount but noted that these unknown obligations were expected to be significant. In 2023, the company reiterated this approach but added more emphasis on the significance of these unknown obligations, explicitly stating that 'the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.' This represents a qualitative evolution in the company's disclosure, signaling increased awareness or risk communication around future content liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix’s disclosure regarding obligations for unknown future content titles shifted from describing them as “significant” but not estimable in its 2022 filing to providing concrete, quantified figures in its 2023 filing. Specifically, the 2023 10-K (page 59) states that total content obligations amounted to $21.7 billion, with $14.6 billion representing unrecorded obligations for future titles—up from $14.2 billion in 2022 (page 58). While the language still notes that these unrecorded obligations are not reflected on the balance sheet because they do not meet recognition criteria, the 2023 disclosure explicitly quantifies the scale of these commitments, indicating they are expected to be significant but now includes detailed timing breakdowns (e.g., less than one year: $10.3 billion; over five years: $0.6 billion). This evolution reflects a move from qualitative uncertainty to measurable, structured disclosure of future content financial commitments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort) in its financial statements due to its management agreements, which granted its subsidiaries the power to direct the parks' day-to-day operations and strategic development, despite owning less than 50% equity. By 2023, the 10-K filing included specific financial disclosures showing that Disney reported $128 million in borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks for fiscal year 2025 and $1,164 million in borrowings thereafter. This indicates a shift from primarily qualitative consolidation justification in 2022 to more detailed quantitative disclosure of the financial obligations tied to the Asia Theme Parks in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Disney's financial relationship with the Asia Theme Parks evolved through the consolidation of these parks into its financial statements due to management agreements that grant Disney control over day-to-day operations and significant management fees. The parks' borrowings, including $1.292 billion in 2024 and $1.308 billion in 2023, were disclosed as part of Disney's total borrowings, with interest rates of 7.93% for Asia Theme Parks borrowings. Disney's 2023 10-K (page 100) confirms the consolidation of Asia Theme Parks as VIEs under management agreements, and the 2024 10-K (page 103) shows the related tax and financial disclosures, though specific changes in management agreements or borrowing terms between 2022 and 2023 are not detailed beyond the consolidation and borrowing amounts.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.' The removal of 'home builders' could imply a strategic shift away from partnerships with home construction firms, potentially signaling a reduced emphasis on new home purchase financing or a refocusing of referral partnerships within the retail mortgage channel.",

In 2023, the company disclosed how medical costs payable were sensitive to changes in completion factors, with a 0.75% change in these factors leading to an $880 million increase in medical costs payable. This indicates a shift from a static reporting of medical costs payable in 2022 to a more dynamic and sensitivity-based disclosure in 2023.",

Sensitivity analysis shows that a 0.25‑percentage‑point change in completion factors would alter the medical‑costs‑payable estimate by roughly ±$292 million, while a 1‑percentage‑point shift in medical‑cost trend factors would change the estimate by about ±$376 million.",

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning and growth focus of Adobe's Digital Experience segment evolved from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, particularly in terms of market differentiation and go-to-market strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Adobe emphasized its market leadership in the Digital Experience segment by highlighting the Adobe Experience Cloud's ability to manage customer journeys, enable personalized experiences at scale, and deliver intelligence across industries. The differentiation was tied to the Adobe Experience Platform's integration capabilities and the segment's four strategic growth pillars: data insights, content and commerce, customer journeys, and marketing planning and workflow. The go-to-market strategy focused on a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies and systems integrators.\n\nBy fiscal 2024, Adobe expanded its differentiation by emphasizing natively embedded AI services and end-to-end content supply chain solutions within the Adobe Experience Cloud. These AI services included attribution, automated insights, customer journey management, and one-click personalization, all working with Adobe Experience Platform. The go-to-market strategy also evolved, with a stronger emphasis on C-suite partnerships, transformational accounts, and a scaled approach to customer acquisition and value realization. Additionally, Adobe highlighted strategic investments in expanding its ecosystem of partners and routes to market, aiming to drive continued revenue growth in the Digital Experience segment for fiscal 2025 and beyond.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 Adobe has sharpened the positioning of its Digital Experience segment around AI‑driven personalization and end‑to‑end content workflows.  The 2024 filing emphasizes that Adobe Experience Cloud now differentiates itself through native AI services (Adobe Sensei) and an open, real‑time customer‑profile platform that enables one‑to‑one personalization at scale, while expanding go‑to‑market reach via C‑suite partnerships, a larger direct sales force and a broader ecosystem of agencies and ISVs.  This strategy is intended to deepen penetration in both enterprise and mid‑market accounts and drive recurring revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond.",

      "question": "How has the financial performance of Boeing's Defense, Space & Security segment evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the segment's operational trajectory?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment reported an operating loss of $3.544 billion. By 2024, the operating loss for the same segment had increased to $5.413 billion. This indicates a significant worsening in the financial performance of the BDS segment over this two-year period. While other segments like Global Services showed improvement, the BDS segment experienced growing losses, suggesting ongoing challenges or increased costs in defense and space programs.",
      "llm_answer": "The Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment’s operational trajectory shows a clear improvement from 2022 to 2024, with its segment operating loss declining from $3,544 million in 2022 to $1,764 million in 2023 and further to $5,413 million in 2024 (though the 2024 figure reflects a larger GAAP loss due to broader segment losses). This reduction in loss—particularly the notable decrease in unfavorable cumulative contract catch‑up adjustments—indicates that BDS is moving toward greater stability and profitability, even as overall segment revenues remain relatively flat. Consequently, the segment is emerging from prior earnings headwinds and positioning itself for a more positive earnings trajectory in the coming years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil defined Structural Cost Savings as sustainable decreases in cash operating expenses (excluding energy and production taxes) compared to 2019 levels, with cumulative savings totaling $9.7 billion. The company emphasized internal stewardship to support management oversight over time. By 2024, Structural Cost Savings were reframed as an earnings driver, with a focus on after-tax earnings effects and inclusion of cash operating expenses related to divestments previously captured in volume/mix drivers. This shift indicates a broader integration of cost savings into financial reporting and performance analysis.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's definition of Structural Cost Savings remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, describing it as after-tax earnings effects from sustainable reductions in cash operating expenses (excluding energy and production taxes) driven by operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and divestment-related measures, with cumulative savings estimated at $9.7 billion relative to 2019 levels in 2023 and $12.1 billion in 2024. Internally, the company stewards these savings to optimize spending through disciplined expense management, tracking them as a key performance metric to measure progress toward long-term cost reduction goals.",

      "question": "How has the performance and strategic positioning of Mastercard's Payment Network evolved between 2023 and 2024, based on the changes in its contribution to net revenue growth and its integration within the broader Payment Solutions segment?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Payment Network contributed 11% to Mastercard's net revenue growth, reflecting its strong operational performance and a key role in driving revenue. By 2024, the Payment Network was fully integrated into the newly defined 'Payment Solutions' segment, which Mastercard now treats as its sole reportable operating segment. This shift indicates a strategic move toward unifying its payment network with value-added services under a single framework, emphasizing holistic payment solutions rather than distinguishing between core network operations and supplementary services. The consolidation of reporting and the repositioning of the Payment Network within a broader segment reflect a significant transformation in how Mastercard organizes and evaluates its core business performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard’s Payment Solutions segment has evolved from a strong 2023 foundation—where net revenue grew 13% and contributed 13% of total operating expenses—to an even more pronounced strategic focus in 2024, as evidenced by its dominant share of the company’s overall revenue (accounting for roughly 55% of total net revenue in 2024) and its integration within the broader segment. While the provided data does not detail specific 2024 revenue growth figures beyond the 2023 baseline, the consistent emphasis on expanding payment network volumes, value‑added services, and cross‑border transaction assessments, coupled with the segment’s continued role as the primary driver of Mastercard’s net income (e.g., $12.874 billion consolidated net income in 2024), underscores its heightened strategic positioning within the company’s overall growth strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the net interest expense was $200 million, calculated from $480 million in interest incurred on debt and other, partially offset by $197 million in interest income. By 2024, the net interest expense increased to $256 million, driven by a rise in interest incurred on debt and other to $555 million, despite a further increase in interest income to $228 million. This indicates that the company's financing costs grew, and its capital structure management experienced increased pressure due to higher debt-related expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "The net interest expense increased from $256 million in 2023 to $256 million in 2024 (the provided data shows $256 million for both years), indicating that financing costs remained stable year‑over‑year.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan disclosed that the Core Deposit Intangible from the First Republic acquisition was valued at $1.3 billion and was being amortized over a projected period of approximately 7 years. The valuation methodology was described, including the use of after-tax cost savings and assumptions about market participant behavior. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in terms of the $1.3 billion valuation and the 7-year amortization period, but the language was slightly refined, emphasizing that the intangibles 'are amortized' rather than 'will be amortized,' indicating that the amortization process had commenced. Additionally, the 2024 filing made a new reference to 'disputed amounts with the FDIC as of April 30, 2024,' which was not present in the 2023 filing, suggesting an ongoing financial or legal development affecting the acquisition-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, JPMorgan Chase's disclosure of Core Deposit Intangibles related to the First Republic acquisition evolved in two key ways between the 2023 and 2024 filings: First, the **core deposit intangible was explicitly valued at $1.455 billion** in the 2023 10-K (Page 322), with detailed methodology describing the discounting of after-tax cost savings over a 7-year amortization period using market participant assumptions. Second, the **2024 10-K (Page 323) confirms the final bargain purchase gain was adjusted to $2.9 billion** through the one-year measurement period, reflecting ongoing fair value refinements to the net assets acquired, including intangibles, while maintaining the same valuation approach for the core deposit intangible. The core deposit intangible amount ($1.455 billion) remained consistent, but the 2024 filing emphasizes the finalization of the measurement period adjustments to the overall acquisition accounting.",

      "question": "How has the impact of a 2% increase in market interest rates on UnitedHealth Group's investment income and fair value of financial liabilities evolved from 2022 to 2023?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, a 2% increase in market interest rates resulted in $401 million in additional investment income and a $8,700 million decrease in the fair value of financial liabilities. In 2023, the same 2% increase led to a higher investment income of $629 million, while the fair value of financial liabilities decreased by $7,365 million. This indicates that UnitedHealth Group's exposure to interest rate changes increased in magnitude over the year, particularly on the investment income side, while the sensitivity of liabilities slightly decreased.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 filing, the company quantifies the sensitivity of its investment income and the fair‑value of fixed‑rate assets and liabilities to interest‑rate shifts. A 1 % (100 bps) rise in market rates would increase annual investment income by roughly **$344 million** and raise interest expense by about **$196 million**, while also reducing the fair value of fixed‑rate investments by approximately **$1.87 billion** and lowering the fair value of fixed‑rate debt by about **$1.75 billion**. Conversely, a 2 % (200 bps) increase would boost investment income by about **$688 million**, add roughly **$393 million** to interest expense, and cut the fair value of investments and debt by roughly **$3.64 billion** and **$8.14 billion**, respectively. These figures illustrate how a 2 % rate hike would materially affect both earnings and the valuation of the company’s interest‑rate‑sensitive positions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, currency exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact decreased to 0.5%. This indicates a reduced positive contribution from exchange rate movements, suggesting a decline in the company's exposure or a shift in the direction of foreign exchange fluctuations affecting sales during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a positive 5% contribution in 2023 to a smaller 1% contribution in 2024, indicating reduced exposure to favorable foreign exchange movements. This decline suggests the company's sales growth is increasingly driven by organic performance and acquisitions rather than currency tailwinds, though currency still modestly affects reported results.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Target Corporation's short-term investments were $2.9 billion, and its cash and cash equivalents totaled $3.8 billion. In 2024, these figures increased to $3.9 billion in short-term investments and $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. This reflects a consistent approach to preserving principal and liquidity, with an expansion in the scale of short-term investments and overall liquidity reserves, indicating a maintained but more capitalized strategy in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Target’s short‑term investment policy has remained focused on preserving principal and maintaining liquidity, but the scale of its short‑term holdings expanded markedly between 2023 and 2024.  In 2023 the company reported cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion (including $2.9 billion of short‑term investments) as of February 3, 2024, whereas by 2024 that balance had risen to $4.8 billion, with short‑term investments of $3.9 billion as of February 1, 2025.

By 2024, the segment's backlog revenue stood at $64,023 million for the year, compared to $59,012 million in 2023. While the facilities footprint remained relatively stable, the significant increase in backlog revenue—approximately 8.5% from 2023 to 2024—suggests a growing demand for the segment's offerings, indicating a positive growth trajectory despite no major changes in physical capacity.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing’s Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment’s backlog grew modestly from $497 billion in 2022 to $498.8 billion in 2023 and $521.3 billion in 2024, driven primarily by increases in BDS and Global Services backlog that offset a decline in Commercial Airplanes backlog.  At the same time, the segment’s facilities footprint remained anchored in a network of owned and leased sites—about 22,584 thousand square feet owned and 5,970 thousand square feet leased as of 2021—supporting its defense, space and security operations.

Additionally, the scope of asset sales expanded geographically in 2024 to include upstream assets in Argentina and Nigeria, compared to only the U.S. in 2023.

The profit decline was driven mainly by higher manufacturing costs, even though revenue grew due to a more favorable product mix.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Adobe recorded unrealized credit-related losses directly to other income (expense), net, with a corresponding allowance for credit-related losses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. This treatment remained consistent in fiscal 2024, where the company continued to recognize unrealized credit-related losses in the same manner. However, in 2024, Adobe provided additional context around financial activities, such as the $1 billion non-tax-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition, which may have influenced overall financial statement presentation and emphasis, even though the accounting treatment for credit-related losses remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe did not recognize any unrealized credit-related losses on its marketable debt securities during fiscal 2024 or 2023; instead, unrealized non-credit-related losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, while unrealized credit-related losses (if any) would be recorded directly in income with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet. The company’s disclosures in Note 5 confirm that no credit loss allowance was established for any of its short-term investments in either fiscal year.",

This indicates a minor decline in the segment's order volume over this period, suggesting a potential softening in new orders or delivery delays.",
      "llm_answer": "The Boeing Commercial Airplanes backlog increased from $497,094 million at the end of 2022 to $498,802 million at the end of 2024, reflecting a modest rise in contractual backlog despite a decline in unobligated backlog. This indicates that while overall order volume remains relatively stable, the segment continues to face pressures such as delivery delays, production disruptions, and uncertainty around new programs like the 777X, which could lead to further backlog reductions or cancellations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (6)% on sales, while in 2024, this impact significantly lessened to (1)%. This indicates that the company experienced a reduction in the degree to which rising costs affected its sales performance year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost pass‑through on sales shifted from a 1 % drag in 2023 to a 1 % drag in 2024, but the 2024 filing notes that this cost‑pass‑through decrease had “minimal impact on operating profit,” indicating that the company’s pricing and productivity gains more than offset the cost‑inflation pressures. Consequently, the modest rise in operating margin (from 24.4 % to 26.2 % reported and from 27.6 % to 29.5 % adjusted) signals improved cost‑management dynamics, with the firm successfully passing modest cost changes to customers while maintaining profitability.",

By 2023, the company specifically disclosed a liability of $39 million principally related to travel transaction taxes. This indicates that while the company continued to face exposure, the liability was quantified and likely reflected settlements, accrual adjustments, or resolution progress from prior uncertainties.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the company's exposure to travel transaction taxes remained significant but did not show a material change in magnitude. While the company continues to defend against lawsuits and regulatory inquiries in multiple jurisdictions concerning historical and prospective travel transaction taxes (such as hotel occupancy taxes), it maintains its position that it does not owe the claimed taxes. The company acknowledges that an adverse outcome in any such litigation could result in liabilities for past and future bookings, potentially affecting profit margins and results of operations. Additionally, the company continues to assess its tax positions, including potential liabilities related to digital services taxes and other non-income-based taxes, which could materially impact its financial condition if assessed against the company.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that it had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, with significant additional streaming content commitments that did not meet the criteria for liability recognition. These obligations were described as long-term and fixed-cost in nature, limiting Netflix’s flexibility in reacting to changes in business conditions and potentially requiring access to capital markets at unfavorable times. By 2023, Netflix expanded its description of content obligations to include non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements, as well as production-related obligations. While specific dollar figures for total content liabilities were not explicitly stated in 2023, the company emphasized that obligations for unknown future titles under certain licensing agreements were expected to be significant, indicating a growing complexity and financial exposure in its content commitments. This evolution reflects both an increase in the scale and inflexibility of content obligations, heightening liquidity risk.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s content obligations remained roughly flat at about $21.7 billion, with a slight decrease in the non‑current portion and a modest increase in the current portion of the liability. The company continues to carry a large amount of off‑balance‑sheet commitments—approximately $14.6 billion in 2023—that are not reflected on the balance sheet because they do not yet meet recognition criteria. These fixed, multi‑year streaming content obligations constrain cash flow, as payments are required up front and cannot be easily reduced if membership growth slows, creating significant liquidity pressure and limiting the company’s flexibility to respond to market changes.",

By fiscal 2024, this figure increased significantly to $33,427 million under the Nike Brand, with additional footwear revenue of $1,800 million attributed to CONVERSE. The 2024 report provides a regional breakdown not explicitly detailed in 2023, showing $14,537 million in North America, $8,473 million in Europe, Middle East & Africa, $5,552 million in Greater China, and $4,865 million in Asia Pacific & Latin America.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT allocated between $280 million and $300 million for Start-up capital projects. In 2023, this allocation dropped significantly to $128.1 million. This indicates a strategic shift where AMT reduced its investment in new start-up projects, possibly reallocating resources to other priorities such as ground lease purchases or redevelopment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMT’s allocation for start-up capital projects declined from $128.1 million to $65–$85 million (a roughly 50% reduction). This cut signals a shift away from funding new, high‑growth initiatives and toward prioritizing more established or higher‑return investments such as discretionary capital projects, ground‑lease purchases, and redevelopment. Consequently, the company appears to be tightening its investment strategy, focusing on core infrastructure upgrades and incremental returns rather than expanding into new ventures.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2023 filing, the Veralto Distribution contributed $974 million to Accumulated Comprehensive Income, as noted in the line item under Other Comprehensive Income. By 2024, this amount was no longer present as a separate line item, and Accumulated Comprehensive Income had declined from $(1,748) million in 2023 to $(3,218) million in 2024. This indicates that while the Veralto Distribution had a significant positive impact in 2023, its absence in 2024 contributed to the overall decline in Accumulated Comprehensive Income, alongside other comprehensive losses during the year.",
      "llm_answer": "The Veralto Distribution was reflected as a $983 million credit to foreign‑currency translation adjustments and a $(9) million debit to pension/postretirement adjustments, which together added $974 million to accumulated other comprehensive income. In the 2023 filing the balance of this component was $(1,446) million for foreign‑currency translation and $(401) million for pension adjustments, resulting in a total accumulated comprehensive income of $(1,748) million; by the 2024 filing the balances had shifted to $(2,904) million and $(300) million, respectively, driving the total accumulated comprehensive income down to $(3,218) million. Thus, the impact of the Veralto Distribution on accumulated comprehensive income declined sharply, moving from a net positive $974 million contribution in 2023 to a net negative $(1,470) million effect in 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and occurred when revenue was recognized prior to invoicing, with specific mention of deferred revenues being recorded when revenues were to be recognized after cash collection. In fiscal year 2024, Oracle maintained the same classification of unbilled receivables within accounts receivable but updated the presentation slightly, referring to 'non-operating expenses, net' instead of 'non-operating expenses or income, net' when discussing interest revenue from financing arrangements. This indicates a subtle evolution in financial statement presentation without a substantive change in the treatment of unbilled receivables.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle’s treatment of unbilled receivables has remained consistent between fiscal 2022 and 2024: unbilled amounts are recorded as part of accounts receivable when revenue is recognized before invoicing, and they are subsequently collected in later periods. The company continues to invoice cloud and on‑premise licenses and hardware when the product is delivered or made available for use, while license‑support and hardware‑support contracts are typically invoiced annually in advance. This invoicing and recognition pattern has not changed materially across the two periods.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 11% growth in average paying memberships compared to the prior year, contributing to a 19% increase in consolidated revenues. By 2024, the growth rate of average paying memberships had slowed to 15% year-over-year (from 240,889 in 2023 to 277,730 in 2024), yet streaming revenues still grew by 16% year-over-year. This indicates that despite a lower growth rate in memberships compared to earlier years, Netflix was able to maintain strong revenue growth, likely due to more stable monetization per membership and a larger base of paying members.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s average paying memberships grew at an accelerating pace—rising from roughly 28.5 million in 2022 to 48.95 million in 2024 (a 71% increase from 2023 and a 23% increase from 2022 to 2023). This rapid membership growth, combined with modest price increases, drove streaming revenue up 16% year‑over‑year in 2024 (to $39.0 billion) and contributed to a 50% jump in operating income, pushing the operating margin to 27%. Consequently, the surge in paying members was a primary catalyst for the company’s streaming revenue growth over the 2022‑2024 period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that foreign currency exchange gains and losses on assets and liabilities were recorded in other income (expense), net, and partially offset by gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts used to hedge these exposures. Additionally, PayPal mentioned a matured net investment hedge from 2020, with its gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the foreign subsidiary was sold or liquidated. By 2023, PayPal expanded its disclosure to clarify that foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were included in other, net, along with forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and fair value changes on non-hedging derivative contracts. The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts. This evolution indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to disclosing foreign exchange exposures and their financial effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, PayPal’s foreign currency exchange gains and losses were accounted for consistently under its existing guidance: foreign currency translation adjustments for non‑U.S. functional‑currency subsidiaries flow through accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), while transaction‑related gains/losses and hedge results are recorded in “Other income (expense), net” on the income statement. The 2023 filing (page 75) notes that the company uses cash‑flow and net‑investment hedges to offset exposure, and that gains/losses on these contracts are recognized in the same period the related forecasted transaction impacts earnings. No material change in this accounting policy is reported for 2023 versus 2022; the only evolution is the ongoing evaluation of new FASB guidance (e.g., ASU 2023‑07 and ASU 2023‑08) that may affect future disclosures but does not alter the core treatment of foreign‑currency gains and losses. Consequently, the impact of foreign‑currency exchange contracts on net income remains recorded in “Other income (expense), net,” with any residual hedge gains/losses flowing through AOCI until realized.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed that approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services were known and settled within 90 days, with substantially all settled within twelve months. By 2023, the company provided a more quantified sensitivity analysis, stating that a hypothetical 1% difference between its December 31, 2023, estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable would have increased or decreased 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This indicates a more explicit quantification of risk exposure in 2023 compared to the more qualitative disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The sensitivity analysis shows that a 0.75 % decrease in completion factors would increase medical‑costs‑payable estimates by $880 million, while a 0.75 % increase would reduce them by $867 million; similarly, a 3 % increase in medical‑cost trend factors would raise the estimate by $1,128 million, and a 3 % decrease would lower it by $1,128 million. This range of potential adjustments indicates that the company’s exposure to unpaid claims is material and can swing by roughly $1 billion depending on how quickly claims are processed and how medical cost trends evolve, underscoring a significant risk that actual claim payments may differ substantially from the recorded estimates.",

The company acquired Terran Orbital Corporation in October 2024 to broaden satellite design, production, launch planning, and on‑orbit support capabilities within Space, complementing existing programs such as SBIRS, Next‑Gen OPIR, Trident II D5, Orion, GPS III, hypersonics, and Next‑Generation Interceptor. This acquisition, together with continued growth in missile defense, hypersonic strike weapons, and satellite‑based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, reflects a strategic shift toward integrated all‑domain mission solutions and increased emphasis on commercial and government satellite services. Consequently, Space’s contribution to overall net sales rose to 18 % in 2021 (with international sales remaining modest) and the segment is positioned to capture expanding demand driven by evolving global security threats and the U.S. government’s emphasis on space‑based capabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company reported restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents of $1.9 billion, which increased to $2.4 billion in 2024. This represents a $0.5 billion or approximately 26% increase in restricted funds. The increase suggests a more conservative liquidity strategy in 2024, with a greater portion of cash being set aside for specific purposes, potentially to mitigate credit and settlement exposures or to meet regulatory or contractual obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents tied to capital asset purchases declined from $1.9 billion to $2.4 billion (a modest increase in total restricted cash, but the amount explicitly linked to capital expenditures fell as the company shifted more of its capital spending to other sources). This reduction suggests the firm is relying less on earmarked cash for asset purchases and is instead funding those investments through operating cash flow, debt issuances and its revolving credit facility, indicating a more flexible liquidity strategy.",

This evolution indicates a shift in reporting focus toward greater transparency and emphasis on measurable business performance, aligning TPV with other quantified metrics to demonstrate the scale and growth of PayPal's operations.",
      "llm_answer": "In 2022 PayPal only identified total payment volume (TPV) as a key metric without providing an actual figure, merely describing it as “the value of payments… successfully completed on our payments platform.” By 2023 the company began reporting a specific TPV amount—$1.53 trillion—as part of its “Scale” overview and key‑metric table, explicitly stating that it processed that volume of payments.

By 2023, the company emphasized the sensitivity of its Medical Costs Payable estimates, disclosing that a hypothetical 1% difference between estimated and actual Medical Costs Payable would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle's Cloud Services and License Support Expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and infrastructure investments made to support the growth in the cloud and license business. By fiscal 2024, these expenses had risen to $8,783 million, reflecting a 21% increase in constant currency compared to fiscal 2023. This indicates a continued and accelerating investment in the cloud and license business to support growing revenues, particularly in cloud services, which saw a 24% constant currency increase in revenue from fiscal 2023 to 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 Oracle’s Cloud Services and License Support expenses rose sharply—from roughly $435 million in 2023 to $525 million in 2024 (and were $360 million in 2022) – reflecting a deliberate increase in investment in its cloud and license business. This growth in expenses, coupled with rising cloud‑services revenues, signals that Oracle is substantially expanding its cloud‑focused infrastructure and support capabilities.",

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin's pension plan funding approach evolved significantly from 2021 to 2024. In 2021, the company made no contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans, while in 2024, it contributed $990 million. The ERISA-funded status also improved, with the company achieving at least 80% funded status across all qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024, compared to a funded status of approximately 92% in 2021 after a $1.0 billion contribution in 2020. This indicates a shift from a period of minimal contributions and moderate funded status to a more active funding strategy aligned with ERISA requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2021 and 2024, Lockheed Martin’s pension funding strategy shifted from relying on cash contributions to managing liabilities through risk‑transfer transactions. In 2021 the company completed a $4.9 billion pension risk‑transfer using group annuity contracts, eliminating roughly $4.9 billion of defined‑benefit obligations and triggering a $1.7 billion noncash settlement charge. Subsequent years continued this approach, with additional risk‑transfer purchases reducing plan volatility and PBGC premiums. Funding under ERISA remained at or above the 80 % target, but cash contributions fell to $990 million in 2024 (versus $1.0 billion in 2020 and none in 2021), while recoveries of pension costs under CAS continued to offset contributions. The funded status under ERISA stayed at ≥80 % through 2024, whereas GAAP funded status and actuarial assumptions (discount rate and 6.5 % expected return) drove the volatility in reported pension expense and stockholder equity.",

In 2023, earnings (loss) excluding identified items were $(1,867) million, but in 2024, this metric improved to $(1,402) million—a $465 million reduction in the loss—driven by lower financing costs and the absence of prior-year unfavorable items.

By 2024, the company refined its approach by emphasizing a more precise methodology in which the selected discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value derived from the yield curve analysis. While the core method remained consistent, the 2024 filing reflects a more structured emphasis on the derivation of the equivalent rate as a direct output of the present value calculation, suggesting a refinement in transparency and analytical rigor.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, International Adult Nutritionals reported revenue of $2,784 million with a total change of 4.5%, where exchange rates negatively impacted growth by 6.0%. In 2024, revenue increased to $2,909 million, reflecting a 4.5% total change, with exchange rates again having a negative impact of 6.0%. This indicates consistent performance and exchange rate pressure across both years.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, International Adult Nutritional sales rose 4.5% nominally (6.0% excluding foreign exchange), driven by growth in Ensure and Glucerna. Exchange rates negatively impacted this growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points, as the stronger U.S. dollar reduced international sales by 4.2% overall and specifically contributed to the 4.5% reported increase versus a 10.5% increase when adjusted for currency effects.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be repurchased under Walmart's publicly announced plans decreased from $12.4 billion in November to $10.6 billion by the end of January. In contrast, in 2024, the company started with $13.1 billion in November and only decreased slightly to $12.0 billion by the end of January. This indicates a more stable and potentially more actively managed repurchase strategy in 2024 compared to the more rapid depletion seen in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be repurchased under Walmart’s publicly announced plans declined from about $12.4 billion (as of the end of fiscal 2022) to roughly $12.0 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. This reduction reflects the ongoing execution of the company’s share‑repurchase program, which was expanded to a $20 billion authorization in early 2021 and remains active without a set expiration. The decreasing remaining authorization indicates that Walmart is steadily using its allocated capital for buybacks, but still retains a substantial amount of authority to continue repurchasing shares as part of its disciplined capital‑allocation strategy.",

This represents a reduction of $56 million over the two-year period. The trend indicates that IBM may have improved its inventory management or adjusted its provisioning strategy, as evidenced by the consistent decline in the allowance balance despite ongoing additions and write-offs.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's Allowance for Inventory Losses was $17 million in 2022 and increased to $22 million in 2024, reflecting a higher provision for potential inventory write‑downs. This upward trend suggests the company is adopting a more conservative approach to inventory valuation, likely to account for slower turnover or heightened risk of obsolescence, indicating a shift toward tighter inventory management and stronger provisioning for possible losses.",

However, in 2023, WarnerMedia was classified as part of discontinued operations following its separation and distribution, signaling a complete operational and financial divestiture. This represents a significant transformation from an active business segment with substantial commitments to a fully exited business unit.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AT&T’s financial commitments to WarnerMedia shifted from direct operational support to structured financing arrangements. In 2022, AT&T disclosed $5.6 billion in direct supplier financing obligations and $5.6 billion in vendor financing commitments related to WarnerMedia, with significant payments made during the year. By 2023, these obligations had decreased substantially, with $5.4 billion in direct supplier financing and $2.5 billion in vendor financing outstanding at year-end, reflecting the ongoing separation of WarnerMedia (now part of Warner Bros. Discovery) and the associated debt restructuring. This evolution underscores AT&T’s transition from direct financial involvement to a more passive role as a creditor with defined contractual obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments stated that it rebalanced the plans' investments when they were outside the target allocation ranges. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the fact that assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets were based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. Additionally, in 2023, the company explicitly mentioned adjusting results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets and that assumptions for non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflected different economic environments. This indicates a more detailed and forward-looking approach to asset allocation in 2023 compared to the more general rebalancing policy described in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Texas Instruments adjusted its target allocation ranges for defined benefit plans, narrowing the fixed income range from 65%-80% to 65%-80% (U.S. and retiree health care) and 60%-100% (non-U.S.), while reducing the equity range from 20%-35% to 20%-35% (U.S. and retiree health care) and 0%-40% (non-U.S.). The company rebalances investments when allocations fall outside these ranges, maintaining a higher fixed income proportion (65-80% in U.S. plans) aligned with liability sensitivity. Discount rate assumptions also shifted significantly upward (e.g., U.S. discount rate increased from 2.74% in 2022 to 5.20% in 2023), reflecting changes in bond market conditions and liability valuation.",

In 2024, the growth rate slowed to 6%, with the volume reaching $2,990 billion from $2,826 billion the previous year.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement disclosed serving 4.4 million seniors through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. By 2023, the company reported 4,355,000 members in Medicare Supplement (Standardized) plans, indicating a slight decrease of 45,000 members from the prior year. This small decline suggests relative stability in the company's Medicare Supplement market share, despite broader growth in other senior-focused segments like Medicare Advantage. The change reflects a minor contraction in this specific product line, even as the company maintained its overall presence in senior insurance offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealthcare’s Medicare Supplement enrollment remained essentially flat from 2022 to 2023 (4,355 thousand in 2023 vs. 4,375 thousand in 2022), indicating a stable but non‑growing presence in that segment. However, the broader Medicare Advantage and Medicare & Retirement businesses drove overall UnitedHealthcare revenue growth of 13 % and an 11 % increase in earnings from operations, showing that the company is relying on its Medicare Advantage and related senior‑focused products to expand its scale and reinforce its positioning as a leading insurer for older Americans.",

By 2023, the composition shifted to 47%, 18%, 6%, and 6% respectively for the same categories, with oil and gas production assets increasing slightly to 16%.

This evolution reflects NEER's strategic focus on expanding its renewable energy portfolio, particularly wind and solar projects, as evidenced by the increased capital expenditures allocated to these areas (e.g., $2,630 million for wind and $3,445 million for solar in 2023) and the continued presence of oil and gas assets at 16% of depreciable property.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA’s long-term supply commitments evolved to address extended lead times and heightened financial risk exposure. The company increasingly entered into longer-term, non-cancellable inventory and capacity agreements—often placing orders 12 months in advance of historical lead times—to secure supply amid global shortages, particularly for AI-focused products like Hopper and H100. This shift heightened exposure to inventory overcommitment and potential write-downs if demand softened, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K’s discussion of excess inventory risks and supply chain complexity. While these commitments improved supply resilience, they also amplified financial risk, especially as geopolitical export controls (e.g., U.S. licensing requirements for China) further constrained market access and forced strategic pivots to alternative products and markets.",

In 2024, while no updated GDV figure was provided, the company introduced a more detailed explanation of GDV, clarifying that it includes both purchase volume and cash volume, and specifying that cross-border volume growth is measured separately. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced approach to currency conversion, using quarterly average exchange rates to calculate U.S. dollar equivalents. This represents a shift from simply reporting GDV figures to enhancing transparency around its components and measurement methodology.",

The key change in measurement introduced in 2024 was the use of currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude the impact of foreign currency translation and transaction effects to provide a clearer view of underlying volume growth. This adjustment allowed for more accurate comparison of GDV trends by removing currency volatility, as highlighted in the \"Currency Impact\" and \"Non-GAAP Reconciliations\" sections of the 2024 10-K filing.",

By 2024, the Allowance For Credit Losses - Noncurrent had decreased to $19 million, down from $27 million at the start of the year, primarily due to a $7 million deduction with no write-offs and a $1 million reduction from foreign currency and other adjustments.

      "question": "How has Johnson & Johnson's strategic focus within its MedTech segment evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of restructuring versus acquisition activities?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson's MedTech segment was undergoing a restructuring program that involved exiting certain markets and product lines, particularly in Orthopaedics, with a pre-tax expense of $319 million and an estimated total cost of $700 million to $800 million. This reflected a strategy of streamlining operations and reducing exposure to underperforming areas. In contrast, by 2024, the company shifted toward expansion in the MedTech space through acquisitions, including Shockwave Medical Inc., a leader in intravascular lithotripsy technology, indicating a strategic pivot from cost-cutting to growth through innovation. The shift demonstrates a transformation in the company's approach to the MedTech segment, moving from contraction to investment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Johnson & Johnson’s MedTech segment shifted from a major acquisition-driven growth strategy to a more balanced approach emphasizing restructuring and integration costs rather than large-scale deals. While the company completed the $13.1 billion acquisition of Shockwave Medical in May 2024 (and earlier acquired Abiomed in 2022), it recorded only modest acquisition‑related expenses in 2024 ($0.9 billion, largely tied to inventory step‑up and equity awards) and indicated that future restructuring initiatives—particularly within MedTech—would account for $700‑$800 million in pre‑tax costs, signaling a strategic pivot toward operational streamlining rather than further major purchases. This evolution reflects a focus on integrating recent acquisitions and optimizing the segment’s portfolio, rather than pursuing additional large‑scale business combinations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEER's depreciable electric plant and other property were composed of 51% wind, 14% solar, and 7% rate-regulated transmission facilities. By 2023, the composition shifted to 47% wind, 18% solar, and 6% rate-regulated transmission. This indicates a decrease in the proportion of wind and rate-regulated transmission facilities, while solar facilities increased. These changes reflect a strategic shift toward solar energy and away from wind and transmission assets within NEER's portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, NEER’s depreciable electric plant and other property mix shifted markedly toward renewables: wind’s share fell from 51 % to 47 %, solar rose from 14 % to 18 %, nuclear held steady at about 6‑7 %, and rate‑regulated transmission held flat at roughly 6 %.  In absolute terms, NEER’s gross investment in depreciable plant grew from $124.96 bn to $139.05 bn, driven largely by new wind and solar additions (wind + ~ 1.5 bn, solar + ~ 1.5 bn) and modest growth in transmission assets, while nuclear and fossil‑fuel‑related property declined slightly.  This compositional change reflects NEER’s continued expansion of wind and solar capacity and the retirement or de‑commissioning of older fossil‑fuel assets.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced a $143 million increase in goodwill due to acquisitions, reflecting strategic investments to expand its capabilities. By fiscal year 2023, the financial exposure shifted toward post-sale obligations, as warranty liabilities primarily related to this segment were highlighted, indicating increased responsibility for long-term product support and customer commitments. This evolution shows a transition from upfront investment risk to ongoing operational liability.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA’s exposure to the Compute & Networking segment shifted primarily through the acquisition of Mellanox, which was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price allocation placed $3.43 billion of goodwill and $2.97 billion of identified finite‑lived intangibles (including $630 million of IPR&D) into that segment; the goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment, and any adjustments to the allocation are recorded against goodwill during the measurement period. Post‑sale, NVIDIA retained no ongoing purchase‑price obligations beyond normal purchase commitments, although it continues to have future purchase commitments of $16.1 billion for inventory and supply‑chain arrangements that are unrelated to the acquisition. Thus, the segment’s financial exposure evolved from a one‑time acquisition‑related goodwill balance to ongoing operating commitments, but no additional post‑sale obligations tied to the acquisition itself remain.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix emphasized the complexity and subjectivity involved in estimating content amortization, which is based on historical and forecasted viewing patterns, and noted that changes in these patterns could affect amortization timing. By 2024, the company provided a more concrete and quantifiable disclosure, showing that tax incentives on qualified production spend directly reduced the cost basis of content assets, resulting in lower amortization. Specifically, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023, and $899 million in 2024, indicating a growing impact of these incentives over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 Netflix’s content amortization grew modestly—from $14.03 billion in 2022 to $15.30 billion in 2024—while the company increasingly leveraged tax incentives to offset production costs, reducing amortization expense on produced content by roughly $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023 and $899 million in 2024. This reliance on tax credits lessens the net cost basis of content assets and therefore lowers the amount of amortization recognized each period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that for GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates resulted in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees, and for GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates led to a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, MetLife's assumptions regarding withdrawal rates and their impact on the estimated fair value of guarantees for GMWBs and GMABs/GMIBs evolved as follows between 2022 and 2024:\n\n1.  **Withdrawal Rate Assumption Trends:** The withdrawal rate assumption (a key input for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs) was adjusted dynamically based on factors like the guaranteed amount relative to account value, withdrawal history, and policyholder age. While specific year-over-year percentage changes aren't detailed in the tables, the document consistently states that for **GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees**, and for **GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates results in a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value**.\n\n2.  **Impact on Estimated Fair Value:** The document explicitly links withdrawal rate changes to the direction of fair value impact for these guarantees. The 2024 data (Page 269, Table for Embedded Derivatives) shows a significant increase in the \"Changes in unrealized gains (losses) included in net income (loss) for the instruments still held at December 31, 2024\" for embedded derivatives related to guaranteed minimum benefits, particularly a **$86 million positive impact** attributed to changes in assumptions (including withdrawal rates) for the GMIB/GMAB portfolio. This indicates that the assumptions used for withdrawal rates (and related factors like utilization and mortality) contributed positively to the estimated fair value of these guarantees during 2024, aligning with the documented directional relationship. The evolution reflects a continued application of the same dynamic linkage between withdrawal rate assumptions and fair value impact as described in the 2022-2024 notes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the CISO provided at least two updates per year to the RCSC on cybersecurity matters. In 2024, this frequency increased to quarterly updates, indicating a more proactive and frequent communication approach regarding cybersecurity risks. This change reflects an increased emphasis on governance and oversight of cybersecurity threats within the company.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, QFNA was described as a reportable segment with accountability for share-based compensation expense, indicating its active role in the company's organizational structure and performance metrics. However, in 2024, the financial data shows that QFNA's allocation was only $11 million, a significant drop compared to other segments like FLNA ($150 million) and PBNA ($238 million). This suggests that QFNA's strategic importance may have diminished relative to other divisions, as reflected in the reduced financial resources allocated to it.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 the financial allocation for Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) shifted markedly: its operating profit fell from $492 million in 2023 to $445 million in 2024, and the restructuring and impairment charge attributed to QFNA dropped from $11 million to just $30 million, while corporate‑level charges rose from $88 million to $101 million. This reduction in QFNA‑specific charges and the relatively modest share of the total productivity‑plan expense (about 1 % of the overall $2.6 billion plan) indicate that the segment is being treated as a lower‑priority, cost‑containment unit rather than a strategic growth driver within PepsiCo.",

In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by effective price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, although this was partially offset by shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. The change reflects a reversal in trend from margin compression in 2022 to margin expansion by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased 40 basis points in fiscal 2025 and 27 basis points in fiscal 2024, driven primarily by Walmart U.S. price management, favorable merchandise mix and growth in higher‑margin businesses, while the 2022 decline was due to higher‑margin fuel sales and cost inflation.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS revenue was reported in a table format showing $10,653 million in 2021 and $10,653 million in 2022, indicating a flat performance. However, in 2023, the company provided a more detailed description of AWS revenue recognition, emphasizing that revenue is primarily recognized when customers use services based on the quantity rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Additionally, in 2023, Amazon disclosed that certain AWS services, including compute and database, are offered as fixed quantities over specified terms, with revenue recognized ratably. This shift reflects a more nuanced understanding of contractual arrangements and service delivery models, including the capitalization and amortization of sales commissions for contracts exceeding one year, which was not mentioned in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AWS revenue recognition remained anchored in its standard model of allocating transaction price to distinct performance obligations (e.g., compute, storage, database services) based on stand-alone selling prices, with revenue recognized when control transfers—typically as services are consumed (e.g., per-hour compute usage) or ratably over fixed-term contracts. Contractual arrangements continued to reflect AWS’s multi-faceted delivery model, including on-demand, reserved instance, and fixed-term commitments, alongside third-party seller services where Amazon acts as an agent rather than principal. While AWS revenue growth decelerated from 37% in 2022 to 27% in 2023 (reflecting broader economic headwinds), the core service delivery and revenue recognition methodology—centered on usage-based billing and allocation across service categories—remained consistent, with no fundamental shift in how revenue is measured or recognized.",

By 2023, this value decreased to $4,031.2 million, indicating a decline of $728.2 million.

      "original_answer": "The fair value of plan assets for international pension benefits increased from $201 million in 2023 to $216 million in 2024. This indicates a modest improvement in the funding level of these plans over the year, suggesting a slight strategic increase in asset contributions or positive returns on existing plan investments.",
      "llm_answer": "The fair value of international pension plan assets increased from $579 million at May 31 2023 to $602 million at May 31 2024, while the corresponding projected benefit obligation rose from $722 million to $728 million, narrowing the funded deficit from $499 million to $489 million. This modest improvement reflects stronger asset returns and contributions, indicating that FedEx is maintaining a largely stable funding approach for its international plans, with only incremental increases in contributions and a focus on preserving solvency rather than aggressive additional funding.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's Adjusted Net Debt increased from $14,702 million in 2023 to $16,769 million in 2024. This indicates a rise in the company's net financial obligations after adjusting for purchase accounting impacts, suggesting a potential increase in leverage or a strategic decision to take on more debt, which could signal either expansionary activities or a shift in capital structure management.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix highlighted the forward-looking nature of content amortization as part of a broader set of financial and strategic uncertainties, noting its dependence on estimated viewing patterns which could impact financial performance. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed and concrete description of the amortization process, emphasizing its complexity and subjectivity due to reliance on both historical and forecasted viewing data. The 2024 filing also outlined specific audit procedures conducted by Ernst & Young LLP to evaluate the amortization method, including sensitivity analyses and comparisons of prior estimates to actual results—indicating a more structured and scrutinized approach over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s approach to content amortization has become more complex and subjective between 2022 and 2024, as highlighted in the 2024 filing (page 38). The company now emphasizes that amortization is based on “historical and estimated viewing patterns,” with significant judgment and assumptions about future viewing behavior. Auditors noted that this requires extensive testing of management’s forecasts, data completeness, and sensitivity analyses, underscoring the increased reliance on subjective estimates compared with the more straightforward methodology described in the 2022 filing (page 6).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Enhanced Defined Contribution Plan was described as an option for employees who elected not to continue accruing benefits in the defined benefit pension plans, as well as for employees hired between November 1997 and December 31, 2003. It included a fixed employer contribution of 2% of annual eligible earnings plus a matching contribution of up to 4%. In 2023, the plan maintained this structure for those hired through December 31, 2003, but for employees hired after that date, the fixed 2% contribution was removed, leaving only the matching contribution of up to 4%. This represents a narrowing of benefits for newer hires.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife described the performance factor as being applied to Performance Units, which were liability awards, and the factor was determined using the same methodology as for Performance Shares, though specific performance metrics or outcomes were not detailed. By 2024, MetLife provided a more detailed and structured approach for Performance Shares, which were classified as equity awards. The performance factor for the 2021–2023 period was explicitly set at 147.5%, based on return on equity relative to business plan goals, total shareholder return compared to a peer group, and a cap if shareholder return was zero or negative. Additionally, the 2024 filing clarified that the Compensation Committee could adjust for 'Significant Events' affecting performance. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of performance factor usage to a more transparent and quantitatively defined mechanism with explicit outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 MetLife’s Performance‑Share program continued to use a three‑year performance period with a final payout multiplier of 0%–175%, but the company began applying a more detailed, committee‑driven calculation for the performance factor (combining adjusted ROE, total shareholder return versus a peer group, and a cap at 100% if shareholder return is ≤0, while excluding “Significant Events”). The 2022‑2024 performance factor was set at 147.5%, and at year‑end 2024 the performance period for the 2022‑2024 grants was completed, but the final factor had not yet been determined; the outstanding awards (873,665 Performance Shares) will be multiplied by whatever factor the Compensation Committee ultimately approves, directly affecting the ultimate share payout.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $1.7 billion in 2021, $880 million in 2020, and $580 million in 2019, indicating consistent downward revisions in prior estimates. In 2023, the company stated that a hypothetical 1% difference in its estimate of Medical Costs Payable at year-end would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This shift indicates that while the company still experiences estimation variance, the nature of the impact evolved from realized favorable developments in prior years to a forward-looking sensitivity analysis in 2023, reflecting a more predictive and quantified risk to earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 the sensitivity of UnitedHealth Group’s Medical Costs Payable estimates declined: the 2022 sensitivity analysis showed that a 0.75% decrease in completion‑factor assumptions would increase medical‑costs payable by about $686 million, whereas the 2023 analysis shows a similar 0.75% decrease would raise payable amounts by only about $880 million – a smaller impact relative to the overall reserve level.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported an international tax liability of $3,090 million, which decreased to $2,604 million in 2024. This reduction of $486 million suggests that the substantial tax liability risk disclosed in 2023 related to the Kenvue separation was partially realized and subsequently addressed. The decrease implies that JNJ may have resolved or mitigated a portion of the previously disclosed international tax exposure associated with the separation.",
      "llm_answer": "JNJ's international tax liability increased in 2024, with the effective tax rate rising to 15.7% from 11.5% in 2023, driven by higher income in higher-tax jurisdictions and the impact of Pillar Two tax reforms. This increase reflects a worsening tax risk profile, particularly as the company faces potential substantial tax liabilities from the Kenvue separation, including unresolved IRS determinations about the tax-free nature of the transaction and possible tax liabilities in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The separation's tax risk is heightened by the possibility that the IRS or foreign tax authorities may challenge the tax-free treatment, potentially triggering significant liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, non-qualifying hedge activity had a favorable after-tax impact of approximately $370 million on Corporate and Other's results. In contrast, in 2023, the impact turned unfavorable, resulting in an after-tax negative impact of approximately $793 million. This represents a significant shift from a positive contribution to a substantial drag on performance due to changes in the fair value of interest rate derivative instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of non‑qualifying hedge activity on Corporate and Other improved dramatically, shifting from a $1,297 million drag in 2022 to a $2,986 million boost in 2023. After‑tax, this translated to a $1,297 million negative effect in 2022 and a $2,986 million positive effect in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo described its allocation methodologies for operating expenses across segments, including share-based compensation, pension, and retiree medical expenses, but did not disclose any specific dollar amounts allocated to the AMESA segment. In contrast, the 2024 filing explicitly reported a $5 million allocation to the AMESA segment for these expenses. This change indicates a shift in the company's financial reporting approach, with increased transparency in 2024 regarding resource allocation to the AMESA region, suggesting a more detailed and accountable presentation of financial commitments across geographic segments.",
      "llm_answer": "PepsiCo’s disclosure of operating expense allocations to its AMESA segment remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with the segment’s allocated share of share‑based compensation held steady at 5 % of the total allocation (page 70). This unchanged allocation reflects the company’s ongoing practice of distributing share‑based expense across its reportable segments using the same methodology each year, indicating a stable and transparent approach to segment reporting.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points, primarily due to price management in the Walmart U.S. segment driven by cost pressures. In fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. The increase in fiscal 2024 also benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year. This indicates a transformation in the gross profit rate dynamics, with a significant increase in contribution by 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 51 basis points in fiscal 2022 (from 24.3% to 24.8%) and remained flat in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior years. The increase in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by price management, cost inflation mitigation, and a favorable merchandise mix (including the lapping of temporary Auto Care and Vision Center closures), partially offset by increased supply chain costs. In contrast, fiscal 2021's flat gross profit rate was supported by strategic sourcing initiatives and strong sales in higher-margin categories, but was offset by the carryover effect of prior price investments and pandemic-related operational disruptions.",

This reduction reflects lower current and deferred tax provisions, driven by smaller asset‑valuation allowances and a modest decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, indicating that the company's overall tax position is easing but still substantial.",

By 2024, this figure had increased to $20,166 million, representing a growth of $5,563 million over two years. This indicates a significant improvement in the company's future revenue visibility, as Long-term RPO reflects contracted revenue that will be recognized beyond the next 12 months.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 Cisco’s long‑term remaining performance obligations (RPO) grew from **$14.6 billion** to **$20.166 billion**, an increase of roughly **38 %**. This expansion in long‑term RPO signals that the company has secured a larger backlog of future revenue, enhancing visibility into earnings that will be recognized beyond the next 12 months. Consequently, the growing long‑term RPO indicates stronger, more predictable revenue streams and supports expectations of continued financial performance in upcoming periods.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and risk exposure of MET's Liabilities for Future Policy Benefits evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to interest rate sensitivity and investment performance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed that liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using present value of expected benefits and premiums, with key assumptions including mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns. The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities. This indicates a shift from a primarily actuarial estimation approach in 2022 to a more risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife’s liabilities for future policy benefits have remained largely insulated from interest‑rate movements because the underlying assumptions used to calculate those liabilities are locked in for traditional long‑duration and limited‑payment contracts; only a premium‑deficiency trigger could alter them.  However, the company’s exposure to interest‑rate changes is evident in its risk‑management commentary: in a declining‑rate scenario only a small portion of invested assets (≈5% per year) face reinvestment risk, while in a rising‑rate scenario higher reinvestment yields more than offset the negative impact of lower derivative income on long‑duration products, and the company mitigates margin compression through dividend‑scale adjustments, interest‑rate derivatives, and asset‑liability duration matching.  Consequently, while the liability calculations themselves are not directly affected by rate changes, the profitability and capital adequacy of those liabilities are closely tied to MetLife’s ability to manage interest‑rate sensitivity and investment performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ disclosed that profit-share payments in collaborative arrangements were capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product after regulatory approval, indicating a long-term asset treatment. By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted to emphasize that profit-share payments were now included directly in sales to customers, with the note that these payments represented less than 2.0% of total revenues in fiscal year 2024. This reflects a change in emphasis from long-term amortization to current revenue recognition, improving transparency around the contribution of collaborative arrangements to top-line performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 filing shows profit‑share payments now represent less than 2 % of total revenue (down from less than 3 % in 2022), and the company explicitly notes that these profit‑share amounts are included in sales to customers. Earlier disclosures (2023) described profit‑share payments as “less than 2 % of total revenues” but did not emphasize the change; the 2024 language makes clear that the share has been reduced and is reported within sales. Thus, the treatment of profit‑share payments shifted from a modest, non‑material component to an even smaller, explicitly disclosed portion of revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Target disclosed that substantially all vendor income—arising from volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising activities—was recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales. Additionally, reimbursements from vendors for advertising were recognized as offsets within SG&A expenses, with net advertising costs reported at $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. By 2024, Target's classification had evolved: vendor income that constitutes reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs was now explicitly offset against advertising expenses within Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, while vendor income not tied to such reimbursements continued to reduce Cost of Sales. This reflects a more nuanced and bifurcated treatment of vendor income depending on its nature and use.",
      "llm_answer": "Target's treatment and classification of vendor income has evolved such that it is now consistently recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales rather than being offset against advertising expenses within SG&A. This shift, highlighted in the 2024 Form 10-K (page 49), clarifies that vendor income—including payments for advertising activities, volume rebates, and compliance programs—is now fully integrated into Cost of Sales, with no material reclassification impacting Net Sales or Operating Income. The 2023 and 2022 reclassifications (noted on page 51) further solidified this presentation, ensuring vendor income is consistently treated as a cost of sales reduction across all relevant expense categories.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, LinkedIn generated $13.816 billion in revenue. By fiscal year 2024, LinkedIn's revenue had increased by 9%, indicating continued growth. This growth trajectory suggests that LinkedIn has maintained a steady upward trend in revenue contribution within Microsoft's broader product portfolio, reflecting its strategic importance and successful integration post-acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "LinkedIn's revenue grew from $10.3 billion in fiscal 2022 to $13.8 billion in fiscal 2024, reflecting a significant upward trajectory within Microsoft's portfolio. This growth, driven by LinkedIn's inclusion in the Productivity and Business Processes segment and its integration into Microsoft Cloud offerings, underscores its expanding contribution to Microsoft's overall revenue diversification and strategic focus on cloud-based productivity solutions. The consistent double-digit growth (9% in FY2024 following 35% growth in FY2023) highlights LinkedIn's strengthening role as a key component of Microsoft's cloud and business processes strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased slightly to $1.6 billion. This indicates that while the company continued to experience favorable profit adjustments from its long-term contracts in 2023, the magnitude of these adjustments was lower compared to the previous year, suggesting a moderate decline in the rate of improvement or risk retirement on those contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "The consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments declined by $100 million in 2023 versus 2022, reflecting a $100 million unfavorable adjustment on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program and lower Black Hawk production, partially offset by a $65 million favorable adjustment on an international surveillance program. This reduction indicates that the company’s performance on long‑term contracts was pressured by cost overruns and lower volumes, especially in Sikorsky helicopter programs, even though other segments (e.g., Space) saw favorable adjustments that partially offset the overall decline.",

Additionally, the total value of 'Facilities and other' under property and equipment at cost grew from $15,694 million in 2023 to $16,215 million in 2024, reflecting continued investment and expansion in this category.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, FedEx's capital expenditures declined by 16% to $5.176 billion, reflecting reduced spending on package‑handling and ground‑support equipment at FedEx Ground, information technology, facilities and other assets, as well as lower aircraft and vehicle outlays at FedEx Express and Freight.  This decrease was partially offset by continued investments in Network 2.0, hub modernizations, and $1.3 billion earmarked for aircraft acquisition and related equipment, indicating a strategic shift toward lower capital intensity while maintaining targeted investments in key infrastructure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Corporation stated that the fair value of conditional legal obligations related to soil remediation could not be measured due to the impossibility of estimating future settlement dates. In 2024, the Corporation repeated the same language, indicating no change in its ability to estimate these settlement dates. Therefore, the Corporation continued to face challenges in quantifying soil remediation costs due to indeterminate site lives and lack of settlement date visibility.",
      "llm_answer": "The disclosure regarding soil remediation costs within asset retirement obligations did not undergo a material change in estimation methodology between 2023 and 2024. Both years state that conditional legal obligations with indeterminate settlement dates—such as those tied to permanently shutting down facilities in the Product Solutions business—cannot be measured due to the impossibility of estimating future settlement dates. However, the 2024 filing (page 96) explicitly notes that \"Asset retirement obligations incurred in the current period were Level 3 fair value measurements,\" and the revised liability table (page 95) reflects a $1,047 million estimated cash payment for 2024 (vs. $1,146 million for 2025 in 2023), indicating updated discounting and accretion adjustments. Crucially, the 2024 disclosure reaffirms that **soil remediation costs remain unquantifiable** because the Corporation cannot estimate settlement dates for sites with indeterminate lives, maintaining the same core limitation as in 2023. No new methodology or estimation technique was introduced to address this uncertainty.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD received $6.9 billion in net proceeds from long-term debt, while in fiscal 2023, this amount decreased to $2.0 billion. This significant reduction indicates a shift in HD's financing strategy, moving away from issuing long-term debt as a primary source of liquidity, possibly reflecting a more conservative financial stance or a reduced need for external financing during fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, HD’s net proceeds from long‑term debt fell sharply—from about $6.9 billion in 2022 to roughly $2.0 billion in 2023—a decline of roughly $4.9 billion. This reduction reflects a more disciplined financing approach, with the company relying less on new long‑term borrowing and instead funding operations and shareholder returns through cash on hand, debt repayments, and proceeds from shorter‑term commercial paper.",

In contrast, by 2024, foreign exchange losses were $18 million (net of derivatives and hedging), with a $122 million non-cash gain from Senior Notes offsetting losses on cash and content liabilities. This marks a significant shift from a net gain in 2022 to a smaller net loss in 2024, with the Senior Notes' impact decreasing in magnitude and hedging playing a more prominent role in 2024.",

By 2024, Tesla disclosed a formal agreement with the Shanghai local government that introduced new operational conditions tied to cumulative capital expenditure targets and annual tax revenue requirements starting in late 2023. Additionally, while incentives received in 2023 were deemed immaterial, Tesla continued to receive immaterial amounts in 2024, indicating that while the financial impact remained minor, the nature of the relationship evolved from operational to more formally structured with defined performance obligations.",

By 2024, Tesla continued to meet these obligations as part of its ongoing operations at Gigafactory Shanghai, though the specific financial incentives (such as tax abatements or grants) were noted to be immaterial in amount for both 2023 and 2024, with the primary focus remaining on sustaining production capacity and meeting local economic development metrics to maintain the partnership.",

      "original_answer": "MA's gross settlement exposure increased from $59,571 million in 2021 (reported in the 2022 filing) to $78,385 million in 2024, representing a significant rise over this period. In 2022, the net settlement exposure was $51,861 million, which is 86.9% of the gross exposure. By 2024, the net exposure was $64,919 million, or 82.8% of the gross exposure. This indicates that while gross exposure increased, the proportion of net exposure relative to gross exposure slightly decreased, showing an evolution in the effectiveness or scale of risk mitigation arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 the Company’s gross settlement exposure rose from about $59.6 billion to $78.4 billion, and net settlement exposure increased from roughly $51.9 billion to $64.9 billion.  During the same period the net settlement exposure as a share of gross exposure fell from about 87 % (51.9 / 59.6) to about 83 % (64.9 / 78.4), a reduction of roughly 4 percentage points.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022–2023 period, Total Otezla revenue declined by 4% from $2,288 million to $2,188 million. In the subsequent 2023–2024 period, the decline continued but at a slower pace, with a 3% decrease from $2,188 million to $2,126 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NextEra Energy reported minimal gains on disposal of businesses or assets, amounting to only $4 million. In contrast, by 2023, the company recorded a significant net loss of $407 million from the disposal of businesses or assets. This sharp change indicates a notable shift in NextEra Energy's divestiture strategy, moving from limited asset sales with small gains to a more active divestiture approach involving larger transactions that resulted in a substantial net loss, possibly reflecting strategic portfolio realignment.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, gains on disposal of businesses/assets rose sharply from $4 million to $407 million, reflecting a series of divestitures of wind, solar and other generation assets that generated significant cash proceeds and contract‑liability offsets. This surge shows that NextEra Energy accelerated its portfolio simplification strategy, monetizing non‑core generation assets and using the proceeds to fund growth projects while shedding lower‑margin or non‑strategic interests.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, favorable items such as cost recoveries on severance and restructuring contributed to an increase in segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, the impact of such favorable items, including cost recoveries, increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.6 billion. This indicates a slight decrease in the contribution from cost recoveries and similar items year-over-year, suggesting a minor reduction in the positive adjustments supporting operating profit.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost recoveries on segment operating profit shifted from a $1.6 billion increase in 2022 to a $1.6 billion increase in 2023, indicating that while cost recoveries continued to boost profitability, the incremental benefit remained flat year‑over‑year. This stability suggests that Lockheed Martin’s financial performance in 2023 was characterized by consistent contribution from cost recoveries, but without the stronger uplift seen the prior year, reflecting a more mature and steady operating environment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, fuel surcharge revenues were $3.0 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion from $3.7 billion in 2022, primarily due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and lower shipment volumes, although fluctuating fuel prices had a delayed impact on recoveries. By 2024, fuel surcharge revenues further declined to $2.6 billion from $3.0 billion in 2023, again driven by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lagged effect of price changes, partially offset by higher shipment volumes. This indicates a continued downward trend in fuel surcharge revenues over the two-year period, influenced by both pricing and volume dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "Freight revenues increased 1% year-over-year to $22.8 billion in 2024, driven by a 3% rise in volume and core pricing gains, while fuel‑surcharge revenues fell $0.4 billion due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and the two‑month lag in passing price changes to surcharges. The key factors behind the change were higher international intermodal and grain volumes offsetting lower coal and rock shipments, and the shift toward lower‑margin international intermodal traffic that reduced average revenue per car.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil stated that its Corporate Plan assumptions included greenhouse gas emissions pricing as part of its economic evaluation for investments, developed annually based on its Global Outlook. By 2024, the company maintained this approach but emphasized that current policy trends and lower-emission solutions were not yet aligned with a net-zero pathway by 2050, indicating a more cautious stance on the pace of emissions reduction. This evolution suggests that while emissions pricing remains a consistent factor in planning, ExxonMobil is signaling that external policy support and technological advancements need to accelerate for the company to meet more aggressive emissions targets.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's 2024 Corporate Plan assumptions show a continued reliance on the Global Outlook scenario framework for long‑term planning, but the 2024 outlook explicitly acknowledges that current policy stringency and technology improvement trends are “not yet on a pathway to achieve net‑zero by 2050,” whereas the 2023 version described the Outlook as reflecting “an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050.” This shift signals a more cautious stance: the company now treats the 2050 net‑zero pathway as a remote scenario rather than a baseline, and it emphasizes that actual investment in lower‑emission projects will depend on the emergence of supportive policies, permitting, and cost‑effective abatement technologies. Consequently, while still incorporating greenhouse‑gas emissions pricing into its medium‑term business plans, ExxonMobil is placing greater weight on market‑driven returns and the availability of concrete opportunities, indicating a strategic pivot toward disciplined, return‑focused lower‑emission investments rather than a firm commitment to a net‑zero trajectory.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets was $313 million. By fiscal 2024, this figure had increased significantly, as the company reported a year-over-year rise in amortization expenses, attributing this growth directly to the acquisition of Splunk Inc. in March 2024. The Splunk acquisition, which contributed approximately $1.4 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024, also brought with it additional intangible assets that required amortization, marking a clear shift in Cisco's financial obligations tied to its acquisition-driven growth strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets increased from $73 million in fiscal 2022 to $313 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a substantial rise in the expense as the company integrated acquisitions—most notably the $1.4 billion purchase of Splunk—into its operations. This jump indicates that Cisco's acquisition strategy has become more aggressive, with larger, intangible‑heavy deals driving both revenue growth and higher non‑cash amortization costs.",

This indicates a significant improvement in the company's profitability performance over the period, as it was able to generate more profit per dollar of sales in 2024 compared to the prior year.",

This increase, driven by higher pricing in global helium and coatings businesses and lower corporate costs, indicates improved profitability performance in this segment.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Home Depot reported Sales per Retail Square Foot at $627.17, while in fiscal 2023, this metric decreased to $604.55, representing a 3.6% decline. This reduction indicates a reversal of the growth trend observed in previous years and suggests a potential challenge in maintaining or improving retail space efficiency during the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Home Depot's **Sales per Retail Square Foot increased by 11.2% from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023**, rising from **$627.17** (fiscal 2022) to **$604.55** (fiscal 2023) — though this reflects a 3.6% decline in the most recent year compared to fiscal 2022. This change indicates **improved retail efficiency**, as the company generated more sales per square foot of store space in fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022, despite a slight dip in the absolute figure. The metric is a key indicator of operational efficiency, and its growth (even if modest) suggests better utilization of retail space to drive revenue. \n\n*(Note: The document shows fiscal 2023 sales per square foot as $604.55 vs. fiscal 2022's $627.17, representing a 3.6% decrease. However, the question asks for evolution between fiscal 2022 and 2023, and the data confirms the metric increased from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 in the context of the comparative table's \"Fiscal 2023 vs. 2022\" column, where it is listed as $604.55 for fiscal 2023 and $627.17 for fiscal 2022. The 11.2% figure referenced in the document is for fiscal 2021 vs. 2020, not 2023 vs. 2022. The correct evolution is a 3.6% decline from fiscal 2022 to 2023, but the question's phrasing aligns with the document's stated metric for fiscal 2023 vs. 2022.)*",

In 2024, the number of owned refrigerated cars slightly decreased to 2,404, while the number of leased units dropped more significantly to 945, resulting in a total of 3,349 refrigerated cars.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde's long-term contracts enabled the company to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, positively impacting its business by ensuring stable cash flow. However, in 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on sales, indicating a shift in how these cost adjustments affected the company's revenue. This change suggests that rising costs could not be fully offset by customer pricing adjustments, potentially signaling tighter pricing conditions or increased cost pressures in the market.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost pass-through shifted from a 3% drag on sales in 2023 to a 1% drag in 2024, reflecting a modest improvement in pricing dynamics that allowed Linde to offset inflationary pressures through higher price attainment. This shift indicates that the company’s pricing power is strengthening, as cost pass-through now contributes less to sales decline, supporting overall flat sales growth driven primarily by price gains rather than volume.",

This represents a steady rise in the recognition of content-related costs over time. The increase suggests that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, with a growing portion of previously capitalized content assets being amortized as they were utilized over their expected viewing periods. This trend aligns with Netflix's strategy of expanding its content library to support global growth and member retention.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s amortization of content assets grew from $12,230 million to $15,302 million, reflecting a $3,072 million increase (≈ 25 %). This rise outpaces the growth in content payments ($17,469 million → $16,224 million), indicating that the company is front‑loading cash outlays for new productions and acquisitions. The trend suggests Netflix is aggressively expanding its original‑content pipeline and investing more heavily upfront, while still relying on amortization to spread costs over several years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reviewed its network location intangible asset for impairment using a cash flow modeling approach that incorporated tower location, demographics, timing of new tenants, lease rates, and ongoing cash requirements. Tenant-related intangible assets were assessed on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on turnover, contract non-renewals, or relationship terminations. By 2023, while the impairment review framework remained largely the same, the company added context around tenant risk by referencing a specific customer (VIL) in India that had made partial payments in 2022 and indicated it would not resume full contractual payments in 2023, signaling a shift in how tenant-specific risks were explicitly tied to impairment considerations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the impairment analysis for the Network Location Intangible asset evolved in two key ways: first, the cash flow modeling for impairment testing increasingly incorporated tenant-specific risks, particularly concerning VIL's payment behavior in India—where partial payments and subsequent payment shortfalls led to significant impairments of tenant-related intangibles and required ongoing monitoring of cash flow assumptions. Second, the analysis integrated more granular assumptions about future tenant renewals, lease rates, and demographic factors at the tower level, while also reflecting updated market conditions such as higher discount rates and increased tenant attrition risks, which collectively resulted in revised undiscounted cash flow projections that were compared against carrying values to determine impairment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, global Nplate sales increased by 13%, reaching $1,477 million, with U.S. government orders contributing $286 million. In 2024, global Nplate sales decreased by 1%, but when excluding U.S. government orders ($128 million in 2024), sales increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 8% and higher net selling prices of 6%. This indicates a shift where organic growth offset the decline caused by reduced government orders.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in global Nplate sales shows a steady increase from $1,307 million in 2022 to $1,477 million in 2023 (+13 %) and a modest rise to $1,456 million in 2024 (‑1 % overall, but a 12 % increase when excluding the $128 million U.S. government order). The primary driver of the 2023 growth was higher volume, including a $286 million U.S. government purchase, while the 2024 change reflects a slight decline in total sales but continued volume growth outside the United States. U.S. government orders contributed $128 million to 2024 sales and $286 million to 2023 sales, underscoring the impact of those orders on the year‑over‑year change.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ excluded war-related costs associated with the conflict in Ukraine, including asset impairments, inventory losses, and allowances for uncollectible receivables, from non-GAAP operating results to facilitate comparisons of ongoing performance. By 2024, MDLZ disclosed a specific incremental cost of $4 million directly attributed to the war in Ukraine, which was included in operating results. This marks a shift from exclusion in 2023 to explicit recognition and quantification in 2024, indicating a change in how these costs were treated and communicated.",
      "llm_answer": "MDLZ’s 2024 operating results show a modest 0.6% rise in segment operating income to $532 million, driven by higher net pricing and lower acquisition‑related costs, but this was largely offset by higher raw‑material costs, unfavorable currency impacts, volume/mix declines and higher advertising and ERP implementation expenses. In contrast, 2023’s segment operating income had risen sharply (up 36.3% to $529 million) as the company benefited from strong pricing, volume growth and the Ricolino acquisition, while currency headwinds and integration costs were less pronounced. Thus, the evolution reflects a shift from pronounced growth‑driven gains in 2023 to a more constrained improvement in 2024, with war‑related cost pressures and commodity price volatility increasingly weighing on operating results.",

In fiscal 2022 (referenced in MSFT_10k_2022.pdf, page 42), LinkedIn revenue growth was 34% year-over-year. By fiscal 2024 (referenced in MSFT_10k_2024.pdf, page 39), LinkedIn revenue growth increased to 9%—though this appears to reflect a sequential decline from prior growth rates, the key trajectory shows sustained expansion. The consistent inclusion of LinkedIn in Microsoft's commercial metrics and its integration into the Microsoft Cloud revenue stream (as noted on page 42 of the 2022 filing and page 39 of the 2024 filing) confirms its role as a growing, strategic component of Microsoft's cloud ecosystem, indicating a strong upward trajectory in performance despite macroeconomic headwinds.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs are capitalized in inventories if they relate directly to a specific contract or anticipated contract, with the determination that the contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources for performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable. Additionally, it specified that pre-contract costs were generally recognized as cost of sales upon receipt of the anticipated contract. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, emphasizing that these costs are incurred to enhance the ability to meet schedule and customer milestones, while maintaining the same core conditions for capitalization. The evolution reflects a more strategic framing of pre-contract cost incurrence without altering the financial treatment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin’s disclosure of pre‑contract costs remained consistent with prior practice: such costs are capitalized as work‑in‑process inventory only when they are incurred directly in anticipation of a contract award, the award is deemed probable, and the costs are expected to be recoverable. The company continues to monitor recoverability, especially for classified contracts in Aeronautics, but does not change the fundamental conditions under which these costs are capitalized.",

In 2024, this total decreased to 3,918 Flat Cars, with 1,966 owned and 1,952 leased units. This represents a reduction of 552 Flat Cars, or about 12.3%, over the year. The decline in both owned and leased Flat Cars suggests a reduced emphasis on this type of freight car in Union Pacific's fleet.",
      "llm_answer": "The total number of flat cars (both owned and leased) increased from 3,918 in 2023 to 3,918 in 2024? Actually the data shows 3,918 in 2024 and 4,470 in 2023. So it decreased from 4,470 to 3,918.

By 2024, the company explicitly stated that these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant,' indicating a more definitive acknowledgment of their material impact on future financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s language regarding future content obligations shifted from describing them as “significant” but not yet meeting recognition criteria to explicitly acknowledging that “the unknown obligations are expected to be significant,” indicating a more pronounced emphasis on the material nature of these unrecorded commitments. This evolution reflects a strategic tightening of disclosure to underscore the material financial exposure tied to future content licensing and production deals.",

      "question": "How has IBM's exposure to client spending budgets evolved between 2023 and 2024, based on the risk factors disclosed in its 10-K filings?",
      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM identified 'Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets' as a key risk factor, indicating continued sensitivity to client budgets. However, in 2024, the company added a nuance by emphasizing a 'shift in client buying patterns' as a contributing factor to this risk, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2023. This evolution suggests that while the core risk remains stable, IBM is observing and highlighting changing dynamics in how clients allocate their budgets, potentially due to digital transformation trends or shifts toward cloud and AI investments.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's risk factors indicate that its exposure to client spending budgets has evolved through heightened emphasis on macroeconomic volatility and discretionary IT spending trends. The 2024 filing specifically cites \"Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets Could Impact the Company's Business\" as a key risk, noting that reduced client demand due to economic conditions or shifts in technology purchasing patterns could directly affect revenue and profitability. This reflects a more pronounced focus on budget sensitivity in 2024 compared to 2023, where similar concerns were framed generally under \"economic and political changes\" without explicit budget terminology. The 2024 risk discussion also ties budget pressures to broader market uncertainties, including competition in high-growth segments like AI and hybrid cloud, where client adoption rates and economic models remain uncertain. Thus, IBM's exposure has shifted from general economic risk to a specific, amplified focus on how client budget constraints could materially impact its financial results.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, LOW paid $13,012 million for share repurchases, whereas in 2024, the amount decreased significantly to $4,053 million. This indicates a substantial reduction in the company's share buyback activity over the two-year period, suggesting a shift in capital allocation strategy, possibly toward conserving cash or investing in other strategic priorities.",
      "llm_answer": "LOW's total amount paid for share repurchases declined from $6.1 billion in fiscal 2023 to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2024. This reduction reflects a deliberate shift in capital allocation toward other priorities—such as debt repayment, dividend increases, and strategic investments—while still maintaining a sizable remaining authorization ($10.8 billion) for future buybacks. Consequently, the company is signaling a more balanced approach to returning cash to shareholders, emphasizing flexibility and financial resilience over aggressive equity retirement.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, American Express reported $1,433 million in current consumer Card Member Loans and $103 million in 30-89 days past due, with $36 million in 90+ days past due. In 2024, these figures increased to $1,615 million in current loans, $110 million in 30-89 days delinquent, and $45 million in 90+ days past due. This indicates a moderate increase in both delinquency categories, suggesting a slight rise in credit risk exposure over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the delinquency profile of Card Member Loans shifted slightly: the balance in the 30‑89 days past due category rose from $103 million to $110 million, while the 90+ days past due balance increased from $36 million to $45 million. The total loan portfolio also grew modestly, from $2,785 million to $2,863 million. This upward drift in past‑due balances, coupled with a relatively small increase in overall loan volume, suggests a modest deterioration in credit quality and indicates that American Express’s exposure to delinquent Card Member Loans is expanding slightly.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the decline in ENBREL sales was attributed to three factors: lower net selling price, lower inventory, and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. By 2024, the decline was attributed solely to a lower net selling price, indicating that inventory and sales deductions were no longer significant contributors to the decline. Additionally, the company's expectations shifted from anticipating ENBREL to follow the historical quarterly sales pattern in 2024 with further price declines, to expecting relatively flat volumes with continued price erosion in 2025, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price set for 2026.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 the decline in ENBREL sales deepened because the company expects continued downward pressure on net selling price—driven by heightened competition and the IRA‑mandated Medicare Part D price‑setting that begins in 2026—while volume is projected to stay flat. Consequently, the firm now anticipates only modest overall sales declines for ENBREL in 2025, with lower net prices outweighing any volume gains.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs were capitalized in inventory if they directly related to a specific anticipated contract, with the costs generally recognized as cost of sales upon contract award. The company also noted that start-up costs were expensed as incurred. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the strategic use of pre-contract costs in advanced procurement for a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment, with explicit mention of recoverability risks tied to the customer's decisions on future program phases. This reflects a shift from a general accounting policy to a more risk-focused disclosure involving specific programs and financial exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin’s treatment of pre-contract costs shifted from capitalizing them in inventory when recoverability was deemed probable to more aggressively assessing recoverability, especially on high‑risk programs. In 2023 the company recognized a $100 million loss on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program after determining that estimated costs would exceed revenues and that future recoveries were uncertain, and it disclosed that additional losses could arise if cost recovery or scope changes materialize. This reflects heightened risk exposure and a more conservative approach to capitalizing pre‑contract expenditures.",

The increase in net exposure is primarily attributable to the application of risk‑mitigation arrangements (cash collateral, letters of credit and guarantees) that reduced the gross exposure, but the net figure still expanded as the gross exposure grew faster than the risk‑mitigation offsets.",

However, in 2023, the Growth Markets revenue showed a decline of 2% in U.S. dollars, but still maintained a 7% increase in local currency. This indicates a slowdown in growth compared to the prior year, although positive momentum remained in local terms.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Growth Markets revenue rose sharply—up 21 % in U.S. dollars and 29 % in local currency—driving the overall revenue increase to $61.6 billion (22 % U.S. growth, 26 % local‑currency growth).  This growth contributed to a 14 % rise in total new bookings (13 % in U.S. dollars, 14 % in local currency), underscoring the segment’s expanding contribution to the company’s top‑line performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ did not exclude the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from its Organic Net Revenue calculations, and Organic Net Revenue stood at $35.6 billion, reflecting a 14.7% increase driven by net pricing and favorable volume/mix. However, in 2024, due to the significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso in late 2023 and the potential distortion on constant currency growth measures, MDLZ decided to exclude pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year (classified as 'extreme pricing') from Organic Net Revenue and related non-GAAP metrics. This change was implemented prospectively starting in Q1 2024, with the impact of extreme pricing now being separately disclosed as part of 'currency-related items.' In 2024, extreme pricing in Argentina contributed $1,167 million (3.2 percentage points) to Organic Net Revenue growth, offsetting some of the unfavorable currency translation impacts. This indicates a strategic shift in how MDLZ accounts for and reports financial performance in hyperinflationary environments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the treatment of extreme pricing in Argentina shifted from being included in Organic Net Revenue growth calculations to being explicitly excluded—beginning in Q1 2024, MDLZ removed pricing increases exceeding 26% year‑over‑year (the hyperinflation threshold) from its non‑GAAP growth metrics and instead offset this impact with currency‑translation adjustments. This change reflects MDLZ’s effort to isolate genuine volume‑driven growth from price distortions caused by Argentina’s hyperinflation, signaling a more disciplined approach to managing hyperinflationary markets by decoupling extreme price effects from reported organic performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that it would incur advanced procurement costs (precontract costs) to enhance its ability to meet the revised schedule and certain milestones on the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at the Aeronautics business segment. These costs were tied to the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program. By 2023, the company continued to incur these costs but shifted the terminology to 'pre-contract costs' and expanded the context to include ongoing monitoring of recoverability based on the customer's decisions about future phases. Additionally, while cumulative losses on the program increased from $225 million in 2022 to $270 million in 2023, the company maintained its focus on managing these advanced procurement costs in relation to program performance and future scope decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment and disclosure of advanced procurement (pre‑contract) costs related to the classified fixed‑price incentive fee contract evolved from 2022 to 2023 as follows: in 2022 the company continued to capitalize pre‑contract costs as inventory when they were deemed recoverable, but by 2023 it explicitly highlighted that such costs are being incurred to meet revised schedule and milestone targets on the classified contract and that their recoverability is now being actively monitored, with the risk of loss being tied to potential future phase awards and customer decisions. Consequently, the 2023 disclosures emphasize the uncertainty around recovery of these advanced costs and the possibility of additional losses if the program’s scope or schedule changes, whereas the 2022 discussion was less explicit about the contingent nature of recovery and the potential material impact of future losses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed having approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet, not including significant streaming content commitments that did not meet liability recognition criteria. By 2024, the recognized portion of content liabilities had increased to $6.2 billion (comprising $4.4 billion current and $1.8 billion noncurrent), with an additional $17.0 billion in unrecognized obligations, bringing the total to $23.2 billion. This indicates a significant increase in both recognized and unrecognized content liabilities, suggesting an aggressive expansion in content investment and long-term commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's total content liability increased from $21.7 billion at the end of 2023 to $23.2 billion at the end of 2024, reflecting a rise in both current and non‑current obligations and a larger amount of unrecorded commitments. This upward trend shows that the company is accelerating its spending on acquired and produced programming, expanding its global content pipeline and betting on higher future cash outflows to fuel growth. Consequently, investors can infer that Netflix’s strategy hinges on aggressive content investment, even though it creates substantial future payment obligations and liquidity pressure.",

Regarding markdown reserves, in 2022, the reserve was not explicitly stated, but in 2024, it was reported at $222 million, reflecting a decrease of approximately $23 million from fiscal 2023. This indicates that the company experienced relatively stable shrink risk but reduced its markdown exposure, suggesting improved inventory management or stronger sales performance that lowered the need for markdowns.",

By 2024, global Humira sales had decreased by 37%, with a 41% drop in the U.S. due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity on January 31, 2023, and a 13% decline internationally due to continued biosimilar impact.

This decrease was primarily driven by the loss of patent exclusivity in the U.S. on January 31, 2023, which triggered direct biosimilar competition, and continued biosimilar pressure internationally. The document confirms that Humira's patent protection had expired in the U.S. (December 2016) and EU (October 2018), making it vulnerable to generic/biosimilar competition, and that any significant adverse event affecting Humira revenues could materially impact AbbVie's overall financial performance.",

      "question": "How did GILD's disclosure regarding the risk to HIV product sales from shifts in treatment paradigms evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of their dependence on nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales and explicitly warned that any shift away from nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF could adversely impact HIV product sales. In 2024, while the company maintained the same risk narrative around potential paradigm shifts affecting nucleoside-based therapies, it omitted the specific percentage of total product sales attributable to HIV products. This suggests that while the core risk remained, the level of quantitative transparency decreased in the 2024 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "Gilead’s 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings show that the company’s HIV product portfolio—responsible for roughly 67 % of total product sales—continues to rely heavily on nucleoside‑based agents such as tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). In the 2023 filing, Gilead warned that any shift away from nucleoside‑based regimens would “adversely impact” HIV sales, and it highlighted the need to expand or maintain indications for existing HIV drugs to protect revenue. The 2024 filing repeats this risk, emphasizing that changes to HIV treatment paradigms or a loss of preference for nucleoside therapeutics would materially harm the company’s financial results. Thus, while the core risk remains unchanged, the 2024 disclosure underscores an ongoing dependence on TAF‑containing regimens and the vulnerability of those sales to evolving treatment standards.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities were excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they were not considered indicative of underlying operations. In 2024, this exclusion was maintained and further clarified as part of the non-recurring adjustments to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods. The change reflects a more explicit justification for the exclusion in 2024, emphasizing the non-recurring nature of these items and their lack of relevance to ongoing operational performance.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the company refined its non‑GAAP treatment of marketable‑security gains and losses. In 2023 it began excluding both realized and unrealized gains/losses from marketable securities in its non‑GAAP earnings measures, and in early 2024 it expanded that exclusion to include the impact of pricing in excess of 26% in Argentina as part of its constant‑currency growth calculations. This evolution reflects a deliberate effort to remove volatile market‑related items and extreme pricing effects from the metrics used to assess underlying operating performance.",

By fiscal 2023, the segment's revenue increased to $12.6 billion, and its percentage contribution to total company revenues rose from 20% to 21%.

The segment’s share of total revenue remained roughly stable (34% → 21% of the overall mix), but its absolute size expanded as overall company revenue grew modestly, driven by strong growth in managed services and health‑focused contracts within the industry group.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans showed a decreasing trend in future obligations, with amounts of $140 million for 2022 through 2024, declining to $130 million in 2025 and 2026, and totaling $570 million for 2027–2031. In 2023, Lockheed Martin continued to disclose these obligations but provided more detail on the accounting treatment, specifying that non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these plans were recorded as part of 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. This shift reflects a more detailed disclosure and classification refinement in 2023 compared to the primarily numerical disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the accounting treatment for Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans remained classified under postretirement benefit obligations within accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), with liabilities recognized on the balance sheet as net unfunded amounts. The financial disclosure evolved to reflect more detailed breakdowns of actuarial gains/losses, prior service costs, and reclassifications from AOCL, particularly highlighted in Note 11 and Note 12 of the 2023 filing. A significant development was the increased recognition of noncash pension settlement charges—$1.7 billion in 2021 and $1.5 billion in 2022—related to the purchase of group annuity contracts that transferred benefit obligations, accelerating the recognition of prior unrecognized actuarial losses. These transactions reduced future obligations and were reflected in both the income statement (as settlement charges) and AOCL (as deferred losses amortized over time). The 2023 disclosures also expanded the granularity of assumptions (e.g., discount rates, expected returns) and provided updated tables on funded status, future benefit payments, and asset allocations, including detailed fair value hierarchies for plan assets. Overall, while the classification as postretirement obligations persisted, the 2023 filing offered more nuanced transparency into the components of AOCL and the financial impact of plan changes, including the run-off of legacy liabilities through settlements and annuity purchases.",

      "original_answer": "The tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income continued to benefit Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, and in 2023, it increased slightly to 14.5%. Both years cite the foreign derived intangible income deductions as a key factor in reducing the effective tax rate, alongside other credits such as research and development and employee equity awards. The consistent mention of this deduction across both years indicates that it remained a stable component of the company's tax planning strategy, even amid broader tax law changes like the research and development capitalization rules that introduced new cash tax liabilities. However, the slight increase in the effective tax rate suggests a minor reduction in the relative benefit from these deductions.",
      "llm_answer": "The effective tax rate declined from 16.4% in 2021 to 14.5% in 2023, reflecting a strategic shift toward leveraging tax deductions for foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) and research and development credits, while also benefiting from lower tax rates in 2023 (14.5%) versus 2022 (14.2%). This evolution indicates Lockheed Martin is actively optimizing its global tax structure to reduce cash tax burdens, though the impact is partially offset by the amortization of R&D expenses under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which increases cash outflow but is managed through deferred tax asset planning. The company’s tax planning strategy emphasizes proactive engagement with tax authorities and legislative advocacy to mitigate adverse policy changes, such as potential R&D amortization rules, while capitalizing on available credits and deductions to sustain a lower effective tax rate.",

By 2024, this practice remained consistent, but the language evolved to emphasize that these assumptions were part of a broader set of economic inputs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing and foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting a more integrated and dynamic planning process that adapts to emerging policy and market conditions.",

In the 2023 Global Outlook, refinery margin assumptions were embedded within broader commodity price ranges and were described as “price differentials, refinery and chemical margins” that are updated annually as part of the Corporate Plan process. The 2024 filing shows the same structure—refinery margins continue to be a key input for the Outlook and the annual Corporate Plan—but explicitly notes that these margins are now “reflect[ed] … in the Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually” alongside updated policy stringency and technology improvement assumptions. Consequently, while the methodology for incorporating refinery margins did not change, the 2024 Corporate Plan placed greater emphasis on current margin trends and the evolving policy environment, refining the margin assumptions used for investment and earnings planning.",

By 2024, this mechanism had a negative 1% impact on sales growth, suggesting that while cost pass-through remained a feature of its contracts, it may have led to downward pressure on sales due to customer resistance or market conditions. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely strategic advantage to a more complex dynamic affecting revenue performance.",

This consistency indicates that Linde continues to strategically leverage contractual cost pass-through to offset inflationary pressures while maintaining pricing stability (e.g., \"pricing was flat\" in APAC), suggesting a disciplined approach to pricing strategy that prioritizes margin protection without aggressive price hikes, thereby supporting sustainable cost management amid ongoing inflation.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD's Federal income tax provision was $3,918 million, while in fiscal 2023, it decreased to $3,764 million, indicating a reduction in the company's tax liability. This downward shift suggests a change in the company's taxable income or tax planning strategies over the two fiscal years.",
      "llm_answer": "The Federal income tax provision declined from $5,304 million in fiscal 2022 to $4,781 million in fiscal 2023—a reduction of roughly $523 million—reflecting lower earnings before taxes and a modest decrease in the effective tax rate (from 24.4 % to 24.0 %). This drop indicates that HD’s overall tax burden fell in 2023, likely due to reduced profitability and the impact of tax law changes such as the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which did not materially affect the company’s effective tax rate.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Operations and Support Expenses decreased due to automation in network operations, digitization of customer support, and reductions in personnel and network access costs, including a $75 benefit from a dispute settlement. By 2024, this trend continued as Business Wireline Operations and Support Expenses dropped to $14,217 million, down from the 2023 level, showing sustained progress toward efficiency goals. This reflects the company's ongoing transformation strategy to right-size operations in alignment with its strategic direction, indicating that the 2024 results are a continuation of the cost-saving initiatives launched in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2024 financial data, the Business Wireline segment's Operations and Support Expenses of $13,352 million for 2024 reflect continued efficiency measures from 2023 automation and digitization initiatives. The segment's operating expenses decreased by 4.8% year-over-year (from $14,934 million in 2023), driven by lower equipment costs, reduced customer support expenses, and network access savings, partially offset by higher network-related costs as fiber build-out scales. This aligns with the 2023 expense reductions achieved through automation and digitization, demonstrating sustained operational efficiency improvements.",

Small business loans showed $45 million and $16 million in the same categories. By 2024, consumer delinquencies increased to $110 million (30-89 days) and $45 million (90+ days), while small business delinquencies rose to $56 million and $22 million respectively. This indicates a moderate increase in credit risk, suggesting potential deterioration in loan quality or economic pressures affecting repayment capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, delinquency trends in Card Member Loans show a modest increase in past‑due balances: the 30‑89 day delinquency rose from $231 million (2023) to $220 million (2024) and the 90+ day delinquency increased from $73 million to $89 million, while the overall modified‑loan portfolio grew only slightly (from $2,785 million to $2,863 million).

This marks a dramatic increase in impairment activity, signaling a major shift in the outlook for GILD's R&D initiatives, particularly in oncology.",

This downward revision—driven by disappointing Phase 3 EVOKE‑01 data and the subsequent decision to discontinue development of Trodelvy for metastatic NSCLC—signals a markedly more cautious outlook for GILD’s research and development pipeline in that indication, while the company continues to invest in other therapeutic areas.",

In 2023 the company excluded acquisition‑related costs and contingent‑consideration adjustments from Adjusted Operating Income, and it continued to exclude these items in 2024 when reconciling GAAP to non‑GAAP results. However, the 2024 reconciliation notes that the favorable impact of lower acquisition integration costs and lower contingent‑consideration adjustments was partially offset by higher raw‑material costs and other items, indicating that the treatment of these adjustments remained consistent—still excluded from the non‑GAAP metrics—but their net effect on earnings shifted slightly due to the offsetting cost pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed actions taken to reduce pension obligation volatility, including pension risk transfer transactions such as the August 2021 purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for $4.9 billion in pension obligations, and noted a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion. The company also reported a weighted average discount rate of 2.875% for its defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021. In 2023, the company shifted focus to how it records components of FAS pension income/expense across different financial statement accounts and provided a reconciliation table for the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans, indicating a more structured financial presentation of benefit obligations and plan assets. This represents a shift from strategic pension risk management in 2022 to detailed financial disclosure and classification in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Lockheed Martin’s disclosures of the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans shifted from a net liability of $5.47 billion (2022) to $6.16 billion (2023), reflecting a larger unfunded position. The company also reported a $1.5 billion noncash pension settlement charge in 2022 and a $1.7 billion charge in 2021, and it continues to manage volatility through pension risk‑transfer transactions and annuity purchases, which generate actuarial gains/losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and amortized over time. These changes are detailed in the 2023 and 2022 Form 10‑K tables (pages 81‑85) and the related footnote disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, foreclosure rates were listed as one of many external factors that could adversely affect customer confidence or financial condition, potentially leading to delayed purchasing decisions or reduced spending on home improvement products and services. By 2023, The Home Depot provided a more nuanced perspective, explicitly stating that adverse conditions in the housing market, including foreclosure rates, had already 'in some cases adversely impacted' customer behavior. This indicates a shift from a general acknowledgment of potential impact in 2022 to a more concrete recognition of realized effects in 2023, suggesting the company observed tangible changes in customer purchasing behavior linked to housing market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "The Home Depot’s discussion of foreclosure rates and their impact on customer purchasing behavior shows a shift in emphasis between the 2022 and 2023 10‑K filings. In the 2022 filing (pages 21‑25), the company frames foreclosure rates as one of several macro‑economic factors that can depress consumer confidence and disposable income, thereby indirectly affecting home‑improvement spending. By contrast, the 2023 filing (pages 21‑25) expands the narrative to link foreclosure trends more directly to shifts in consumer purchasing patterns, noting that rising foreclosure rates can lead customers to prioritize essential home‑maintenance and repair projects over discretionary improvements, which in turn influences the company’s sales mix and revenue outlook. This evolution reflects a more explicit connection between foreclosure‑driven economic stress and the firm’s sales performance.",

By 2024, the company shifted its emphasis, describing inventory write-offs as part of broader operational risks tied to single-entity dependencies in manufacturing and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), with a stronger focus on supply chain interruptions and their impact on clinical and commercial product availability. This evolution reveals a strategic shift from internal quality and strategy concerns to external manufacturing and supplier risks.",

The 2024 disclosures explicitly link write‑offs to impairments from failed trials (e.g., sacituzumab govitecan‑hziy’s Phase 3 EVOKE‑01 failure) and to discontinued programs (magrolimab, domvanalimab), revealing that the company now attributes its inventory‑related charges to broader manufacturing and product‑risk disclosures rather than isolated production issues.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD's foreign income tax liability was $436 million, which decreased to $365 million in fiscal 2023. This represents a reduction of $71 million, or approximately 16.3%, indicating a decline in the company's international tax burden over the two fiscal years.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, HD's foreign income tax liabilities decreased from $365 million in fiscal 2022 to $365 million in fiscal 2023 (the same amount), indicating relatively stable foreign tax exposure despite a modest decline in foreign earnings before taxes (from $1,487 million to $1,243 million). This stability suggests that the company's international operations continue to generate a consistent level of foreign tax obligations, though the reduced foreign earnings point to some contraction in overseas profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported a 19% increase in streaming revenues, with an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $11.67. By 2024, the streaming revenue growth rate had slowed to 17%, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership had decreased slightly to $10.96. This indicates a shift in Netflix's pricing strategy, potentially reflecting competitive pressures or changes in content value perception by consumers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s average monthly revenue per paying membership (ARM) rose modestly from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.70 in 2024, while total streaming revenue grew from $31.5 billion to $39.0 billion—a 16% year‑over‑year increase in 2024 and a 19% increase in 2023—indicating that the company’s pricing strategy (periodic price hikes and plan variations) has successfully boosted revenue per user without relying heavily on subscriber growth. This steady ARM growth, combined with a 16% rise in streaming revenues in 2024, reflects Netflix’s ability to generate higher average revenue per member through price adjustments while maintaining strong membership expansion.",

In 2024, the total costs increased significantly to $365 million, driven primarily by a substantial rise in compensation and benefits to $214 million and a large increase in other costs to $134 million, with facility exit costs also contributing $13 million. This represents a major transformation in both the magnitude and structure of costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The total restructuring and related costs for Investor Services decreased by $16 million from $365 million in 2023 to $349 million in 2024. The change reflects a reduction in both magnitude and a shift in composition: employee compensation and benefits fell by $214 million to $189 million, while facility exit costs rose modestly from $151 million to $184 million, resulting in a net decrease of $16 million overall.",

In 2024, the company reported a sharp increase in these impairments to $4,180 million, representing a substantial year-over-year increase from the 2023 level.

In 2023, LMT explicitly disclosed that the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these pension plans were recorded in a separate line item titled 'non-service FAS pension income (expense) account.' This indicates a more granular and transparent presentation of pension-related expenses in the financial statements in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the presentation of the non‑service components of LMT’s qualified defined‑benefit pension plans remained consistent: the service‑cost portion stays in cost of sales, while interest cost, expected return on assets, actuarial gains/losses, amortization of prior‑service costs and settlement charges are reported in non‑service FAS pension income (expense) or other non‑operating income.  \n\nThe accounting treatment also stayed the same—actuarial gains/losses and prior‑service costs are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized into income on a straight‑line basis over the average remaining life or service period—though the amounts recognized changed, reflecting higher actuarial losses in 2023 and a different amortization schedule.",

This suggests that LMT experienced an increase in new orders or delays in fulfilling existing orders, which could signal stronger future revenue potential assuming the company can execute on the growing backlog.",

This rise, driven primarily by higher orders on classified programs (Aeronautics) and on missile‑defense systems (MFC), signals that the company is securing new work and that its existing contracts are extending, which should support continued revenue growth and provide a larger pipeline of future earnings.",

      "question": "How did Cisco's APJC product revenue and its percentage contribution to total product revenue change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about the region's strategic importance during this period?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Cisco's APJC product revenue was $5,854 million, representing 15.4% of total product revenue. By 2023, this revenue had decreased to $5,466 million, accounting for only 13.9% of total product revenue. This reflects a decline in both absolute revenue and relative contribution, indicating a reduced strategic emphasis on the APJC region between 2022 and 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Cisco’s APJC product revenue fell from $5.85 billion to $5.47 billion—a 13 % decline (a $791 million drop). Its share of total product revenue also slipped from roughly 15.4 % in 2022 to 13.9 % in 2023. This contraction signals that the APJC region was losing strategic importance for Cisco’s product portfolio during that period.",

      "original_answer": "Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs increased from $2,357.7 million in 2022 to $11,180.6 million in 2023 in absolute terms. However, as a percentage of Total Net Revenues, these costs decreased from 34.0% in 2022 to 30.9% in 2023. This indicates that despite higher overall spending, the company became more efficient in managing these costs relative to revenue. The decline in the cost ratio suggests improved supply chain performance or cost containment strategies that allowed Starbucks to scale operations more efficiently year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs as a percentage of Total Net Revenues decreased from 31.7% in fiscal 2023 to 30.9% in fiscal 2024, a reduction of 80 basis points. This improvement, driven by pricing initiatives (70 basis points) and reduced supply chain costs (60 basis points), suggests enhanced supply chain efficiency during this period, as the company successfully leveraged revenue growth to lower cost pressures despite broader inflationary challenges.",

By 2024, the growth pattern had changed significantly, with total Other Aesthetics Sales growing by only 3.7% year-over-year. Specifically, U.S. sales increased slightly to $1,118M from $1,060M (5.5% growth), while international sales declined to $161M from $174M (-7.1% change). This indicates a substantial slowdown in growth momentum for the segment, shifting from rapid expansion to near-stable performance.",

By 2023, the category retained most of these items but showed subtle changes: 'electronics' was more specifically defined as 'small electronics,' 'garden and patio' was simplified to 'lawn and garden,' and 'automotive care' and 'postage' were shortened to 'automotive' and 'stamps,' respectively. These changes suggest a slight refinement in categorization and emphasis, though the overall scope of the Non-Foods segment remained largely consistent.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased to $1.6 billion. This represents a $200 million decline in the favorable impact of profit booking rate adjustments year-over-year, suggesting a moderation in the degree of positive revisions to contract cost estimates or an increase in unfavorable adjustments during 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's International Segment had $19.2 billion in assets held for sale, primarily related to its operations in the U.K. and Japan, which were subsequently closed. This indicated a strategic shift in international operations, though the segment still played a significant role. By fiscal 2024, the International Segment generated approximately 18% of Walmart’s consolidated net sales, highlighting its continued importance. However, the 2024 report noted that unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations were adversely affecting the reported performance of the International Segment and, consequently, Walmart’s consolidated results. This evolution shows that while the segment remained a substantial contributor, its exposure to currency risk had become a more explicitly stated financial vulnerability, with a direct negative impact on consolidated performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through its International Segment has increased in significance, particularly evident in fiscal 2024 where unfavorable currency movements directly impacted reported results. The 2024 10-K (page 22) explicitly states that \"fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance,\" directly linking currency volatility to negative impacts on the International segment's reported performance and consolidated results. This follows the pattern observed in prior years (2022: page 60 notes currency fluctuations \"adversely affected\" results), but with heightened emphasis in 2024 due to the segment's growing contribution (18% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025 per page 24) and the material effect of translation adjustments on financial reporting. Consequently, currency headwinds have consistently pressured Walmart's consolidated net sales growth and operating income, as unfavorable exchange rates reduce the U.S. dollar value of international revenues and increase the reported cost of internationally sourced goods.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, content amortization increased by $1,423 million due to the expansion of existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. This increase was a major driver of the overall rise in cost of revenues. By 2024, the focus had shifted toward the complexity and subjectivity of the amortization methodology itself, with Netflix emphasizing the judgment involved in estimating future viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. The company also implemented more rigorous internal controls and audit procedures to validate the assumptions and data used in amortization modeling, indicating a more refined and risk-aware approach to managing content amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s content amortization methodology—applying an estimated‑viewing‑pattern approach that uses historical and forecasted consumption to spread acquisition, licensing and production costs over the expected usage period—has remained consistent from 2022 through 2024. However, the company’s disclosures in the 2024 filing (page 38‑39) highlight that auditors flagged the estimation of future viewing patterns as a critical judgment, prompting Netflix to conduct sensitivity analyses and validate underlying viewership data. Consequently, while the amortization principle is unchanged, the 2024 discussion underscores a more rigorous, data‑driven validation process that better aligns the amortization schedule with actual viewing trends, potentially affecting the timing and amount of content expense recognized.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the increase in paid clicks was primarily attributed to growth in advertiser spending and improvements in ad formats and delivery. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include a broader set of factors such as changes in pricing (including fee structures, discounts, and customer incentives), general economic conditions, geopolitical events, regulations, new product launches, and seasonality. Additionally, 2023 introduced more nuanced factors like advertiser competition for keywords, changes in device mix, and traffic growth in emerging versus mature markets, which were not explicitly mentioned in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 the filing’s discussion of paid‑click drivers shifted from a focus on “growth in search queries, mobile adoption, advertiser spending, ad‑format improvements and the COVID‑19 impact on 2020” to a more explicit list that adds **device‑mix shifts, geographic‑mix changes, product‑mix effects, and the relative growth rates of different advertising channels**.  The 2023 text also introduces the notion that “changes in TAC paid to distribution partners and Google Network partners” and “partner‑agreement terms” affect the TAC rate, which was not highlighted as a separate factor in the 2022 disclosure.  Consequently, the 2023 narrative adds these partner‑related and channel‑growth factors as distinct influences on paid‑click volume and cost‑per‑click.",

In fiscal year 2023, these costs increased to $11,409.1 million, and their percentage of total net revenues rose from 30.9% to 31.7%.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Costco noted that square footage growth was 'generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets' and expected this trend to continue. In 2023, this observation remained consistent, with the company reiterating that 'certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth.' However, the 2023 filing added more emphasis on the strategic importance of international expansion by highlighting that these markets have 'lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales' and 'less or no direct membership warehouse competition.' This indicates that while the company maintained its focus on international square footage growth, it increasingly framed this strategy in terms of cost advantages and market opportunity. The evolution suggests a more deliberate shift toward leveraging international markets not just for growth, but for operational efficiency and competitive positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's approach to square footage growth in international markets has shifted from a more aggressive expansion of new warehouses to a more measured pace, reflecting a strategic focus on profitability and market maturity rather than sheer footprint growth. This evolution—evidenced by fewer new warehouse openings in 2023 and 2024 compared to 2022, particularly in international segments—indicates a transition toward optimizing existing operations and leveraging e-commerce, rather than relying on physical expansion to drive growth in global markets.",

However, by fiscal 2024, Membership and Other Income had declined to $1,408 million from $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a reversal in the earlier growth trend. This suggests a potential weakening in the performance or appeal of Walmart’s membership programs during this period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM used observable quoted prices primarily for equity securities held in separate accounts and relied on observable inputs of comparable market transactions for corporate, government, and asset-backed debt securities. In 2024, the company expanded the scope of observable quoted prices to include non-U.S. equity securities and specifically added government debt securities traded on active exchanges. Additionally, in 2024, XOM introduced a new category for cash balances subject to withdrawal penalties, which are treated as level 2 inputs. This indicates a more detailed and nuanced approach in 2024, with increased specificity in the application of observable quoted prices across a broader set of assets.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's reliance on observable quoted prices for fair value measurement of debt and equity securities has evolved from 2023 to 2024 by expanding the scope of Level 1 inputs to include more actively traded securities across both U.S. and non-U.S. plans, particularly in equity securities held in separate accounts where observable quoted prices on active exchanges are explicitly cited (e.g., U.S. equity securities at $84 million in 2024 vs. $70 million in 2023). The documentation also shows increased specificity in market inputs, such as citing observable inputs for corporate/government debt securities (Level 2) and noting that cash balances subject to withdrawal penalties are treated as Level 2 inputs (e.g., $78 million in non-U.S. cash at Level 2 in 2024), while maintaining consistent methodology descriptions across years with no fundamental shift in valuation approach.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "NVIDIA's approach to long-term supply commitments has evolved significantly from 2022 to 2023, shifting from shorter lead times to substantially longer planning horizons to mitigate supply constraints. In 2023, the company began placing orders \"at least twelve months in advance\" (compared to previous six-month lead times) and made \"non-cancellable inventory orders\" with premiums and deposits to secure capacity, particularly for critical products like Hopper architecture GPUs. This strategy directly addresses the \"significant mismatch between supply and demand\" described in the 2023 10-K, where inventory and purchase commitments were adjusted to reflect \"demand expectations for future quarters and long-term supply and capacity needs.\" Financially, this exposes NVIDIA to heightened risk of \"significant excess inventory or other charges\" if demand forecasts prove inaccurate, as noted in the 2023 filing's discussion of potential inventory write-downs and margin pressure from these commitments.",

On an adjusted basis, the increase was from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024. The year-over-year growth in adjusted income from equity investments was modest, driven by improved performance in certain investments, although in the prior year, a decline was attributed to the overall performance of investments in APAC. In 2024, no such broad regional drag was mentioned, suggesting a stabilization or slight improvement in equity investment performance.",

The modest change reflects stable underlying investment performance, though adjusted figures show a small uptick driven by improved portfolio returns. The primary factors behind any shift in this metric include the overall performance of Linde’s equity‑method investments and the impact of currency translation adjustments, which were offset by stable pricing and volume trends in its core gas business.",

      "question": "How has IBM's positioning in the hybrid cloud infrastructure market evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of the types of workloads its infrastructure is designed to support?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM highlighted that its hybrid cloud infrastructure was designed specifically for mission-critical and regulated workloads. By 2024, the company expanded its focus to include AI workloads, indicating a strategic shift toward supporting emerging AI-driven applications alongside traditional mission-critical systems. This reflects an evolution in IBM's infrastructure segment to align with growing market demands for AI capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's hybrid cloud infrastructure positioning has shifted from a broad, cross‑industry focus in 2023 to a more targeted emphasis on high‑value, mission‑critical and AI‑intensive workloads by 2024.  The 2023 filing describes IBM as a “leader” in hybrid cloud infrastructure that serves a wide range of applications, while the 2024 filing highlights that its infrastructure differentiates itself through “higher‑value capabilities, including security, scalability, and reliability, designed especially for mission‑critical and regulated workloads” and notes that these solutions are increasingly tied to AI and generative‑AI initiatives.  Consequently, IBM is now designing its hybrid cloud platform primarily to support workloads that demand strong security, scalability, and AI integration—particularly in enterprise and regulated sectors—rather than a generic set of cloud workloads.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MET reported Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues of $5,727 million. In 2024, this metric decreased by $212 million, or 3%, to $5,515 million on a reported basis. However, when adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations, the metric increased by $149 million, or 2%, compared to 2023. This change was driven by higher premiums in Korea and Australia, along with increased fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, which were partially offset by declines in premiums from Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, MET's consolidated Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues increased from $23,929 million to $24,870 million—a $941 million rise, or 4% growth. In the EMEA segment, the increase was more pronounced, rising from $2,346 million to $2,548 million (a $202 million or 9% increase), with constant‑currency growth of $277 million or 12%. The primary regional drivers of the 2024 growth were strong sales and persistency in the Gulf, the United Kingdom, and Egypt; expansion in the credit‑life and pension businesses in Turkey and Romania; and higher accident‑&‑health revenues across the region. These favorable volume gains were partially offset by foreign‑currency headwinds, as the Turkish lira and Egyptian pound weakened against the U.S. dollar.",

By 2024, the total revenue contribution from Venclexta increased to $2,583 million, representing a growth rate of 12.9% compared to 2023. This indicates a significant slowdown in the growth rate from 36.1% in 2022 to 12.9% in 2024, although the total revenue contribution continued to increase.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, Venclexta's growth rate evolved as follows:  \n- **2022 to 2023**: Venclexta net revenues increased **36.1%** (from $2,009M to $2,288M at actual currency rates).  \n- **2023 to 2024**: Venclexta net revenues increased **12.9%** (from $2,288M to $2,583M at actual currency rates).  \n\nThis indicates a **deceleration in growth rate** from 36.1% (2022→2023) to 12.9% (2023→2024).  \n\nRegarding total revenue contribution:  \n- Venclexta's **total net revenue contribution** (as part of \"Other Key Products\") was **$2,583M in 2024**, representing **~4.6% of AbbVie's total net revenues** ($56,334M).  \n- In 2023, it contributed **$2,288M** (~4.2% of total net revenues), and in 2022, **$2,009M** (~3.5% of total net revenues).  \nThus, Venclexta's **revenue contribution increased slightly** from 3.5% (2022) to 4.6% (2024), but its **growth rate slowed significantly** year-over-year.  \n\n*Note: The document confirms Venclexta's 16% growth in 2024 (driven by market share and market growth), but the growth rate decelerated from the prior year's 36.1%.*",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for qualified defined benefit pension plans were part of the accumulated other comprehensive loss, with actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recognized due to differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. By 2023, these non-service components were explicitly recorded in a separate line item called 'non-service FAS pension income (expense)' within the consolidated statements of earnings, indicating a shift in how these expenses were categorized and reported financially.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 the non‑service components of LMT’s qualified defined‑benefit pension FAS expense shifted from a net expense of **$971 million** in 2022 to a net income of **$443 million** in 2023.  This improvement was driven by a smaller actuarial loss (‑$168 million vs. ‑$425 million), a higher amortization of prior‑service credit ($348 million vs. $359 million), and the absence of the large 2022 settlement charge (‑$1.47 billion).  Consequently, the non‑service FAS pension income rose by roughly **$1.4 billion** year‑over‑year, while the related accumulated‑other‑comprehensive‑loss decreased from about **$7.8 billion** to **$8.7 billion** (net of tax).",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart recorded impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the Walmart International segment, primarily due to the write-off of one of Flipkart's fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as part of a strategic shift toward focusing on Myntra.com. By fiscal 2024, the nature of financial risk for Walmart International had evolved from internal strategic asset impairments to a more external and ongoing exposure to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations. Specifically, the 2024 filing highlights that unfavorable currency exchange rate movements would 'adversely affect the reported performance' of the international segment and notes that such fluctuations have already impacted results. This represents a shift from one-time strategic write-offs in 2022 to sustained financial risk from macroeconomic factors by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K pages, Walmart International's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has evolved as follows between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024:\n\n1.  **Increased Explicit Disclosure of Adverse Impact:** The 2024 filing (page 23) explicitly states that \"unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\" This direct language, absent in the 2022 filing, emphasizes the *current and ongoing* material risk, moving beyond general mention to a clear statement of material adverse effect.\n\n2.  **Specific Operational Exposure:** The 2024 document details *how* currency fluctuations directly impact the business: \"We may pay for products... with a currency other than the local currency... When we must acquire the currency... unfavorable fluctuations... may increase our cost of sales... and we may be unable or unwilling to change prices... with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit.\" This explains the *mechanism* of the risk (cost increases, pricing constraints, gross profit erosion) that wasn't articulated as specifically in 2022.\n\n3.  **Context of International Scale:** The 2024 filing notes Walmart International generated \"approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales\" (page 23), highlighting the significant scale of operations exposed to this risk. This quantifies the potential impact on the *overall company* results, a level of detail not emphasized in the 2022 filing.\n\n4.  **Broader Risk Context:** While the 2022 filing (page 72) mentioned currency fluctuations as a general risk (\"fluctuations in currency exchange rates from period-to-period... may result in significant adverse period-over-period changes\"), the 2024 filing (page 23) places it within a more comprehensive and urgent risk narrative, linking it directly to the International segment's performance and the company's consolidated results, reflecting a more pronounced and recognized evolution in the risk's materiality and operational impact between 2022 and 2024.",

In contrast, by fiscal year 2023, the company noted that additions to product warranty liabilities primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment, indicating a growing financial exposure tied to product warranties rather than acquisition-related goodwill. This shift suggests a transition in the nature of financial commitments associated with the segment, from acquisition-driven asset valuation to operational liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA’s Compute & Networking segment saw its goodwill increase from $3.43 billion (recorded at the Mellanox acquisition) to $3.43 billion plus any subsequent adjustments, while warranty liabilities for that segment rose to $306 million by the end of fiscal 2024 (up from $82 million in fiscal 2023).

      "question": "How has the nature and extent of McDonald's brand licensing arrangements evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of its description and associated financial implications?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements were described as a component of 'Other revenues' and were specifically tied to marketing and selling consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand. The 2023 filing also mentioned that the company provided an 'insignificant amount' of assistance, including royalty relief, to certain franchisees impacted by the war in the Middle East. By 2024, the description of brand licensing remained consistent as part of 'Other revenues,' but the company noted it provided only an 'immaterial amount' of assistance, including royalty relief or deferral of cash collection for certain franchisees. This indicates a slight evolution in the framing of financial assistance, suggesting a minor reduction in support or a shift in how the company assessed the materiality of such aid in the context of global events.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements remained structurally consistent but showed evolving financial dynamics. The company continued to derive the vast majority of its revenue (95% of restaurants globally) from franchised operations, with developmental licensees and affiliates contributing through royalty-based revenue streams that include initial fees and a percentage of sales. While the core model unchanged, revenue growth in the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment was impacted by the war in the Middle East, which negatively affected Systemwide sales and required royalty relief for some franchisees. Financially, franchised revenues grew 2% to $15,715 million in 2024 (up from $15,437 million in 2023), and total revenues increased 2% to $25,920 million, driven by strong performance in U.S. and International Operated Markets, partially offset by challenges in the developmental licensed segment. This reflects a continued focus on stable, predictable cash flows from franchisee sales, with minimal direct capital investment under licensing arrangements.",

      "question": "How has the scope and methodology of Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the factors considered and external data sources used for estimating these adjustments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments were influenced by factors such as legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices, unbilled claims, processing time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. The company also emphasized its compliance with the SEC Consent Order, which included procedures for limiting sales to direct customers and estimating inventory levels using internal and external data from U.S. wholesalers. By 2024, the GTN sales adjustments included additional details on external rebate programs in non-U.S. countries, such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing, and pricing claw-backs. The company also expanded its use of external information sources, including third-party market research data and written/oral inventory updates from wholesalers, and highlighted limitations in relying on such third-party estimates and timing lags. This indicates a broader and more detailed approach to GTN adjustments, especially in international markets and data integration.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s GTN sales‑adjustment methodology remained anchored in the same core elements—charge‑backs, cash discounts, Medicaid/Medicare rebates, and other rebates/returns—but the documentation shows a modest evolution in how those adjustments are estimated.  \n\nIn the 2022 filing (pages 81‑85) the company describes using wholesaler inventory data, historical sales‑return experience, and third‑party market‑research information to project inventory levels and pricing trends; by 2024 (pages 65‑69) the same sources are referenced, but the narrative emphasizes “projected prescription demand‑based sales,” “historical inventory experience,” and “external sources such as written and oral information from wholesalers and third‑party market‑research data,” indicating a continued reliance on both internal forecasts and external market data while tightening the linkage to prescription‑trend analytics.  \n\nThus, the scope of factors (inventory, pricing, payer mix, program rebates, returns) stayed consistent, but the 2024 approach places greater weight on forward‑looking prescription demand models and more explicit integration of third‑party market‑research inputs to refine the estimates of GTN adjustments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola did not mention labor unrest or risks associated with manufacturing facilities impacting net operating revenues. The 2022 filing primarily described how net operating revenues were generated through concentrate and finished product operations, with no explicit mention of labor-related risks. However, in 2023, the company explicitly stated that strikes, work stoppages, or labor unrest at major manufacturing facilities or bottling operations could impair the ability to supply concentrates and syrups, which could reduce net operating revenues and expose the company to customer claims. This represents a new risk factor introduced in 2023 related to labor disruptions affecting revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Coca‑Cola’s risk disclosures shifted from a general focus on cost pressures and commodity price volatility (2022) to a more explicit warning that labor unrest at its manufacturing facilities could impair the supply of concentrates and syrups to bottlers, thereby reducing net operating revenues (2023). The 2023 filing specifically cites the potential impact of strikes, work stoppages or other labor unrest at key bottling plants as a direct threat to the Company’s ability to deliver products and maintain sales.",

In 2023, this accounting treatment remained unchanged, continuing to be reported under 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. Therefore, there was no change in the accounting treatment for these components between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "The accounting treatment for the non‑service components of FAS expense for retiree medical and life‑insurance plans remained consistent in both years: the non‑service elements (interest cost, expected return on assets, recognized actuarial gains/losses, amortization of prior‑service credits and settlement impacts) are recorded in non‑operating income/expense and flow through accumulated other comprehensive loss before being amortized into earnings. However, the magnitude of these components shifted markedly—reflecting a lower discount rate in 2023 that generated actuarial losses for the plans, versus a higher discount rate in 2022 that produced actuarial gains—so while the methodology did not change, the resulting FAS expense for retiree medical and life‑insurance plans moved from a modest $56 million income in 2023 to a larger $106 million income in 2022.",

      "original_answer": "HD's merchandise inventories increased significantly from $30 million in fiscal 2022 to $110 million in fiscal 2023, representing a $80 million increase. This indicates a strategic shift toward building higher inventory levels, likely in response to supply chain challenges and efforts to 'continue to meet the demand environment' as mentioned in the 2022 filing. The significant increase suggests HD prioritized inventory availability to ensure product supply to customers, even at the cost of higher short-term working capital commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "HD's merchandise inventory increased from $30 million at the end of fiscal 2022 to $110 million at the end of fiscal 2023. This rise reflects the company’s strategy of building higher inventory levels to meet strong customer demand and to support its growth initiatives, indicating a deliberate expansion of inventory to better satisfy market needs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM disclosed that during an extended financial market downturn, it could be required to provide incremental pension plan funding, which would pose liquidity risk and negatively impact financial flexibility. In 2024, the company repeated the same language regarding potential incremental pension funding requirements under similar conditions, indicating no substantive change in its exposure to pension-related liquidity risk. While the qualitative risk remained consistent, there is no explicit quantitative disclosure in either year that indicates a change in the magnitude of potential funding obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's 2024 10‑K notes that, while no cybersecurity incident has yet had a material adverse effect, the company continues to face evolving threats—including those amplified by AI—and relies on a layered, enterprise‑wide risk‑management framework to detect, respond to, and remediate such events. The filing also warns that an extended financial‑market downturn could trigger additional pension‑plan funding requirements, creating incremental liquidity risk for the company.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, McDonald's highlighted Systemwide Sales as a key component of its 'Accelerating the Arches' growth strategy, emphasizing its dependence on the success of this metric to drive business growth, particularly through digital transformation, delivery, and restaurant development. However, in 2024, the company expanded its disclosure by formally integrating Systemwide Sales into its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), providing a detailed definition and linking it directly to franchisee health, loyalty programs, and as a driver of franchised revenues. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from merely setting goals around Systemwide Sales (2023) to institutionalizing its measurement and transparency (2024), reflecting a more mature and data-driven approach to managing and leveraging system performance.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, McDonald’s shifted its language around Systemwide Sales from describing it as a key performance metric tied to comparable sales and net unit expansion (2023) to presenting it as a standalone growth pillar under its “Accelerating the Arches” strategy, emphasizing its role in driving sales, operating income, and free cash flow (2024). This evolution reflects a strategic emphasis on scaling Systemwide Sales—particularly through digital, delivery, and drive-thru channels—as a primary lever for growth, rather than merely a byproduct of comparable sales trends. The change underscores a more deliberate focus on expanding the franchise model’s revenue base and unit growth to fuel overall financial performance.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022-2023 period, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia decreased by $377 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, and when net of foreign currency fluctuations, the decrease was minimal at $5 million. This was driven by declines in annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by higher premiums in Korea. In contrast, for 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $212 million, or 3%, compared to 2023, but net of foreign currency fluctuations, there was an increase of $149 million, or 2%, driven by growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products. Thus, while the reported revenue decline slowed from 5% to 3%, the underlying performance net of currency effects improved significantly, shifting from a slight $5 million decline to a $149 million increase.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022‑2023 and 2023‑2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia fell 3% on a reported basis (from $6,969 million to $6,757 million) but rose 2% when stripped of foreign‑currency effects (from $6,608 million to $6,757 million). The key driver of the reported decline was a weakening Japanese yen and Korean won against the U.S. dollar, which shaved roughly $34 million from earnings; however, constant‑currency growth came from higher premiums in Korea and Australia and fee income in Japan. In contrast, the prior comparison (2022‑2023) showed a 5% drop in reported revenues but a modest 4% increase net of currency, reflecting a shift from yen‑denominated life products toward foreign‑currency life and annuity fees in Japan. Thus, while both periods were impacted by foreign‑currency movements, the 2023‑2024 shift saw a smaller currency drag ($34 million vs. $34 million but offset by stronger constant‑currency growth) and a greater reliance on fee‑based income, whereas the 2022‑2023 period was weighed down more heavily by declining yen‑denominated premiums.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, Humira's global sales increased by 4% in 2021, with U.S. sales rising 8% due to market growth across all indications, though international sales declined 13% due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are highlighted as gaining market share and contributing to revenue growth, with Rinvoq benefiting from expanded regulatory approvals. By the 2024 filing, while no specific sales figures are provided, Humira is described in a broader product overview context without mention of growth metrics, and Skyrizi and Rinvoq are not explicitly referenced. This suggests a shift in strategic emphasis toward the broader immunology portfolio, likely in response to biosimilar pressures on Humira.",
      "llm_answer": "The strategic positioning of Humira has shifted from being the dominant immunology revenue driver to facing direct competition from newer agents like Skyrizi and Rinvoq, with biosimilar pressure evident internationally. While Humira's U.S. sales grew 8% in 2021 (outpacing Skyrizi's 79.6% and Rinvoq's 94.8% growth), international Humira revenues declined 13% due to biosimilar competition, and the filing notes that \"this increase was partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\" By 2024, Skyrizi and Rinvoq had become significant growth engines, with Skyrizi's total net revenues rising 84% and Rinvoq's exceeding 100% in 2021, signaling a clear evolution where newer immunology products are gaining market share in key regions to counterbalance Humira's biosimilar-driven international decline.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, LLY disclosed that the retiree health benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, but did not provide specific asset composition details. By 2024, LLY provided a detailed breakdown of the asset classes for these plans, showing that public equity securities (U.S. and International) totaled $216.9 million and private alternative investments, including hedge funds ($281.2 million) and equity-like funds ($335.1 million), accounted for a combined total of $616.3 million. This evolution indicates a shift toward more granular and transparent disclosure about the asset composition of the retiree health benefit plans.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, LLY’s disclosures show that the composition of assets in its defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans remained heavily weighted toward growth investments (approximately 75–80% of assets) with a smaller fixed‑income portion (about 20–25%).  The growth allocation includes U.S. and international public equity securities, hedge funds, private‑equity‑like investments, and real estate, while fixed‑income holdings consist of U.S. Treasuries, agencies, emerging‑market debt, corporate bonds, bank loans, and mortgage‑backed securities.  Private‑alternative investments—principally hedge funds and private‑equity‑like funds—are valued using partnership‑reported NAVs (adjusted for cash flows and fair‑value inputs) and represent a significant but non‑material portion of the overall portfolio.  The 2024 fair‑value tables confirm that public equity securities are the largest component, with private alternative investments (hedge funds and equity‑like funds) held at NAV or Level 3 valuations, and that the overall asset mix has not changed materially between 2023 and 2024.",

      "question": "How has the revenue recognition methodology for long-term aerospace contracts within the Raytheon segment evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of performance obligations satisfied over time?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX recognized revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis for substantially all defense contracts, primarily related to the Raytheon segment, using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. This approach was also applied to certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. By 2024, the company continued to use the percentage-of-completion method for defense contracts within Raytheon but expanded the explanation to include more nuanced treatment of variable consideration and performance obligations spanning multiple phases of the product life-cycle, such as production, maintenance, and support. Additionally, in 2024, RTX emphasized the allocation of transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices, which was not explicitly detailed in 2023. This indicates a more structured and granular approach to revenue recognition for long-term contracts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K pages, the revenue recognition methodology for long-term aerospace contracts within the Raytheon segment (which includes Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney) has not materially changed between 2023 and 2024. The core methodology for performance obligations satisfied over time remains consistent: revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion (EAC) to measure progress, particularly for defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM/aftermarket contracts. This approach is explicitly stated in both the 2023 (page 76) and 2024 (page 80) filings, with no indication of a methodological shift—only ongoing application of the same principles. The 2024 filing (page 81) confirms that substantially all defense business revenue, including Raytheon's, is recognized over time due to continuous customer control, but the underlying recognition method remains unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Content Amortization was $14,026,132 (thousands), representing a significant portion of NFLX's cost structure against $31,615,550 (thousands) in revenue and contributing to an operating income of $5,632,831 (thousands). By 2024, Content Amortization increased to $15,301,517 (thousands), while revenue grew to $39,000,966 (thousands), resulting in a higher operating income of $10,417,614 (thousands). This indicates that although amortization costs rose, they were accompanied by substantial revenue growth, leading to improved profitability. The amortization as a percentage of revenue decreased from approximately 44.4% in 2022 to 39.2% in 2024, suggesting improved efficiency or scaling in content cost management.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Content amortization rose steadily—from $14.0 billion in 2022 to $14.2 billion in 2023 and $15.3 billion in 2024—reflecting the growing library of licensed and original programming. Because this amortization is a major component of cost of revenues, it increasingly offsets revenue growth, but its absolute size remains modest relative to total revenue (which grew to $39.0 billion in 2024). Consequently, while Content amortization continues to weigh on operating income, its impact on the overall operating margin remains limited compared with the company’s expanding revenue base.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, consumer packaged goods sales were explicitly mentioned as part of the Company's 'Other revenues,' which included revenues from brand licensing arrangements using the McDonald's brand. In 2024, while the mention of brand licensing arrangements remained, the specific reference to consumer packaged goods was omitted from the description of revenue sources, suggesting a reduced emphasis or potential reclassification of this revenue stream. This evolution indicates a subtle shift in how the company is presenting its revenue sources, even though the overall structure remains largely franchising-focused.",
      "llm_answer": "The data shows that McDonald's revenue structure has remained heavily weighted toward franchised restaurant revenues, but the proportion of revenue derived from franchised restaurants has slightly declined. In 2023, franchised revenues represented $15,436 million of total $25,494 million revenue (60.5%), while in 2024 they represented $15,715 million of $25,920 million revenue (60.6%). However, the growth rate of franchised revenues slowed significantly - increasing only 2% in 2024 compared to 9% in 2023. Meanwhile, company-operated restaurant sales grew 11% in 2024 (from $9,742M to $9,782M) after a strong 11% growth in 2023, indicating a shift toward greater company-owned revenue contribution. The document notes that franchised margins represented approximately 90% of restaurant margin dollars in both years, but company-operated margins showed negative performance in the U.S. while international operated markets showed positive sales growth. The war in the Middle East has negatively impacted international developmental licensed markets revenue, which grew only 2% in 2024 (vs 12% in 2023), suggesting a structural shift in revenue composition.",

By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income and total CAS pension cost, indicating a shift from expense to income in the service cost component under FAS. This evolution suggests a favorable change in the company's pension adjustment dynamics, with CAS pension cost now exceeding the service cost component of FAS pension income to a greater extent than in the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that exclusivity assets had an estimated useful life ranging from 5 to 25 years, indicating a general framework for amortization based on contractual rights for new commercial aerospace platforms. By 2024, RTX provided more detailed financial disclosures, reporting that exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $3.3 billion at year-end, with remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, at approximately $5.5 billion. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely amortization-life-based disclosure to a more comprehensive valuation approach that includes forward-looking financial commitments and impairment assessments tied to the success of underlying aircraft platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX’s treatment of exclusivity assets shifted from amortizing them over 5–25 years (as disclosed in 2023) to recognizing them as part of indefinite‑lived intangibles that are tested annually for impairment, with $3.3 billion net of accumulated amortization reported as of Dec 31 2024 and remaining commitments of about $5.5 billion.  The company continues to assess recoverability based on assumptions about platform profitability and aftermarket revenue, and it amortizes these assets only when recoverable cash flows justify it, resulting in no amortization expense during early development phases and potential future impairment if assumptions change.  This evolution reflects a greater reliance on impairment testing rather than systematic amortization to reflect the economic value of exclusivity payments.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $8,024 million in 2023 to $8,635 million in 2024. This growth was driven by an increase in Segment Operating Profit from $9,070 million to $9,720 million. However, the reconciling items, including Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges, increased from $40 million in 2023 to $145 million in 2024, which partially offset the gains. The Purchase Accounting Impacts from Linde AG decreased from $1,006 million in 2023 to $940 million in 2024, contributing positively to the overall operating profit trend.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 Linde’s Total Operating Profit rose sharply from $5.369 billion to $8.635 billion, driven by higher segment operating profit across all divisions. The key contributors were a 7% increase in the Americas segment (to $4.55 bn), a 12% rise in EMEA (to $2.78 bn), and a 6% increase in APAC (to $1.92 bn). Engineering’s profit fell 16% (to $0.41 bn) due to lower margins on Russian projects, while “Other” profit grew 44% (to $0.062 bn). These favorable segment shifts more than offset prior‑year purchase‑accounting impacts and cost‑reduction charges, resulting in the overall profit surge.",

      "original_answer": "The total face value of Amazon's long-term debt increased from $50,553 million in 2022 to $67,182 million in 2023, but then decreased to $58,000 million by 2024. This indicates a reversal in trend, with a net reduction of $9,182 million between 2023 and 2024. Specific components contributing to this decline include the 2014 Notes, which decreased from $4,000 million in 2022 to $2,750 million in 2024, the 2017 Notes dropping from $16,000 million in 2022 to $13,000 million in 2024, and the 2021 Notes declining from $18,500 million in 2022 to $15,000 million in 2024. Additionally, the April 2022 Notes issuance of $12.8 billion decreased to $11,250 million by 2024, and the December 2022 Notes issuance of $8.3 billion dropped to $7,000 million by 2024. The credit facility, which was $803 million in 2022, was fully paid off by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Amazon's total face value of long-term debt declined from $67.2 billion to $58.0 billion. The reduction was driven by scheduled repayments of senior notes (e.g., $1.25 billion of 2014 notes, $8.25 billion of December 2022 notes) and the termination of short‑term facilities, while new issuances added only modest amounts of debt. Consequently, the debt composition shifted toward shorter‑dated maturities and lower overall principal, with the 2025‑2026 principal payments accounting for $7.75 billion of the remaining balance.",

In 2023, these figures increased to $161 million for Series B and $20 million for Series C. This indicates that the recovery mechanism became more effective for both series, particularly for Series C where the increase was more pronounced (from $6 million to $20 million). The upward trend suggests improvements in how the recovery mechanism responded to market conditions or structural changes in the instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "The conversion rate recovery for Series B and Series C preferred stock improved markedly from 2022 to 2023: the reduction in equivalent class A shares fell from 8 million (Series B) and 10 million (Series C) in 2022 to 5 million (Series B) and 6 million (Series C) in 2023, and the corresponding recovery amounts rose from $135 million/$6 million to $161 million/$20 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, foreign currency contracts positively impacted net operating revenues by $6 million, indicating a minor beneficial effect from currency fluctuations. In contrast, 2023 disclosures highlighted potential negative impacts on net operating revenues from labor-related risks, such as strikes or work stoppages, and consumer-related risks, including shifting preferences and health concerns around sweetened beverages. These represent a shift from direct financial instrument impacts to operational and market-based risks affecting revenues.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX was actively pursuing the divestiture of a portion of the Collins segment, specifically the actuation and flight control business, with a proposed sale to Safran S.A. for $1.8 billion, although the transaction was denied regulatory approval by the Italian government. This signaled a strategic intent to reduce or restructure parts of the Collins segment. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted toward operational transparency and financial reporting detail, particularly around revenue recognition for long-term aerospace contracts within Collins. The 2024 filing elaborates on the use of percentage-of-completion accounting for these contracts, including the use of incurred costs relative to total estimated costs as a progress metric. This shift indicates a strategic pivot from restructuring through divestiture to enhancing financial disclosure and operational clarity around key performance metrics in the Collins segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX’s strategic focus on the Collins segment shifted from growth‑oriented acquisitions (e.g., FlightAware, SEAKR) toward active divestiture and portfolio rationalization. The company announced a definitive agreement to sell its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services business (held within Raytheon) and, earlier, entered a deal to sell the actuation and flight‑control business within Collins to Safran, signaling a deliberate move to streamline the Collins aerospace footprint. At the same time, RTX disclosed heightened transparency around long‑term aerospace contract accounting, emphasizing that revenue from long‑term maintenance contracts is recognized over time using percentage‑of‑completion methods and that contract assets/liabilities are closely tracked. The firm also highlighted its annual “Estimates at Completion” reviews and the impact of EAC adjustments on operating profit, underscoring a more rigorous, data‑driven approach to managing the profitability of Collins’ long‑term aerospace contracts.",

      "question": "How did Amazon's investment in build-to-suit lease arrangements change from 2022 to 2024, considering the amounts disclosed for property and equipment additions under these leases in both years?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Amazon reported $3.2 billion in property and equipment additions under build-to-suit lease arrangements for that year. By 2024, this amount had decreased significantly to $89 million. This indicates a sharp decline in Amazon's reliance on build-to-suit leases for property investments over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Amazon's disclosed property and equipment additions under build-to-suit lease arrangements declined sharply: $3.2 billion in 2022, $356 million in 2023, and $89 million in 2024. This reduction is reflected in the total net additions to property and equipment, where AWS's additions under these leases fell from $20 million (2022) to $8 million (2024), and the consolidated net additions dropped from $60.8 billion (2022) to $48.3 billion (2023) before rising to $85.8 billion (2024), indicating a clear decrease in the scale of build‑to‑suit lease investments over the period.",

      "question": "How did AbbVie's use of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's floating-rate interest obligation management strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AbbVie had interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 (referencing 2021 data as the most recent in the 2022 filing), aimed at converting floating-rate interest obligations to fixed rates. By 2024, these contracts had matured in November 2022 and were not renewed, indicating a discontinuation of this specific strategy for managing floating-rate debt. This reflects a strategic shift away from hedging floating-rate obligations through cash flow hedges during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie's use of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges has declined significantly over the past three years. In 2022, the company recognized a $(1) pre-tax gain (loss) on these swaps in interest expense, net; by 2023 and 2024, no such gains or losses were recorded in earnings, indicating the swaps were either fully realized or no longer actively designated as cash flow hedges. This shift reflects a strategic move toward more stable interest rate management, likely to reduce exposure to floating-rate obligations amid rising rates, while relying more on fixed-rate debt issuances (e.g., the $15 billion senior notes in 2024) and other hedging instruments like foreign currency forwards and treasury rate locks to manage interest and currency risks.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company disclosed that contributions to defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans were among its key cash requirements, though no specific figures were provided for the retiree health plans at that time. By 2024, the company reported a total fair value of $2,580.3 million for Retiree Health Benefit Plans, with significant allocations across public equity securities, fixed income, and private alternative investments. This represents a notable increase in disclosed financial exposure and detail regarding Retiree Health Benefit Plans compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s financial exposure to retiree health benefit plans has remained relatively stable, with no material changes disclosed between 2022 and 2024. The 2024 disclosures (pages 98‑102) continue to describe the retiree health plan assets as being invested primarily in growth assets (≈80 %) and fixed‑income assets (≈20 %), with fair‑value measurements largely unchanged from the 2023 figures. Earlier pages (e.g., page 47) note that contributions to these plans are part of the company’s planned capital outflows, but no new quantitative exposure or significant shift in funding policy is reported for 2024. Thus, the exposure has not evolved materially over the period.",

By 2024, the segment experienced a 33% revenue decline, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion in 2024, attributed to customer inventory normalization. Additionally, while the 2023 report emphasized the segment’s strategic importance and product breadth, the 2024 report noted a shift in focus toward Data Center and Client segments as the primary growth drivers, indicating a relative de-emphasis of the Embedded segment in AMD’s strategic narrative.",

Despite this revenue contraction, the segment remained strategically positioned within AMD's broader portfolio, continuing to focus on embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, SOMs, and Adaptive SoC products for markets like healthcare, automotive, and industrial applications.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment was the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost, with a favorable adjustment occurring when CAS pension cost exceeded the service cost component. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (rather than expense) and total CAS pension cost, signaling a shift from an expense to income position under FAS. This reflects a notable evolution in the financial impact of pension accounting differences over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's disclosure of CAS pension cost relative to FAS pension income evolved from being characterized as a \"favorable FAS/CAS operating adjustment\" in 2021 (where CAS pension cost exceeded the service cost component of FAS pension expense) to a reduced but still favorable adjustment in 2023 ($1,660 million vs. $1,960 million in 2022), reflecting a continued but diminished favorable impact on segment operating profit due to the ongoing difference between CAS pension cost and FAS pension service cost. This adjustment, which is excluded from segment operating profit and reported in \"Unallocated items,\" remained a key reconciling item between business segment operating profit and consolidated operating profit, though its magnitude decreased from $1,960 million in 2022 to $1,660 million in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that obligations for unknown future titles under content agreements were not determinable as of the reporting date and did not provide any forward-looking estimate. However, by 2024, Netflix explicitly stated that while it does not include estimated obligations beyond the known minimum amount, these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant.' This marks a shift from a neutral disclosure to a forward-looking qualitative warning about the potential magnitude of future liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s disclosure of future content obligations shifted from a range of **$19.2 billion (2020) to $23.2 billion (2021)** in 2021, and by 2024 the company reported **$23.2 billion in total content obligations**, with **$4.4 billion classified as current** and **$1.8 billion as non‑current** on the balance sheet, while **$17.0 billion of obligations remained off‑balance‑sheet** because the related titles were still unknown. The structure of the table remained consistent across years, but the amounts grew, reflecting larger commitments for future titles, especially those with indeterminate quantities or fees that are not yet recorded as liabilities. This evolution shows an increasing reliance on off‑balance‑sheet obligations for unknown future content, even as the company continues to disclose the expected timing of payments across less‑than‑one‑year, one‑to‑three‑year, and longer‑term buckets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS was not significantly impacted by asset-related charges, as impairments and severance costs primarily affected the North America segment, with AWS assets described as consisting mainly of property and equipment and accounts receivable. By 2024, AWS became the primary beneficiary of a strategic change in the useful life assumptions for server and networking equipment, resulting in a $3.2 billion reduction in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.5 billion benefit to net income. This indicates a shift toward optimizing capital efficiency in AWS infrastructure, moving from passive asset ownership to active lifecycle management to enhance financial performance in cloud operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in AWS‑related financial impacts—from a $1.1 billion impairment and accelerated depreciation in 2022 to a planned reduction in depreciation expense and a $0.9 billion increase in operating income beginning in 2025—reflects Amazon’s move toward more disciplined capital‑expenditure management. By extending useful lives for heavy equipment and adopting shorter lives for newer server and networking gear, the company is optimizing its cost structure and improving cash‑flow efficiency in the cloud business.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Visa provided detailed quantitative breakdowns of Total Nominal Volume, including specific dollar amounts for consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial categories across U.S. and international segments, along with percentage changes year-over-year (e.g., Total Nominal Volume was $12,530 billion in 2022, up 11% from $11,334 billion in 2021). In 2023, while Visa continued to define Total Nominal Volume, it did not disclose updated dollar figures or comparative data. Instead, the focus shifted to qualitative disclosures, such as the relationship between service revenue and prior-quarter nominal payments volume, and explanations of data sources and potential updates. This represents a shift from quantitative transparency to methodological explanation without updated volume figures.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Visa’s disclosure of Total Nominal Volume (TNV) shifted from reporting nominal payments volume and cash volume separately in fiscal 2022 (page 39) to reporting nominal payments volume and cash volume in the same format but with updated growth metrics in fiscal 2023 (page 42). The methodology remained consistent—using U.S.‑dollar‑denominated nominal payments volume calculated each quarter with established exchange rates and including consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial components—but the presentation became more integrated, showing year‑over‑year growth rates for 2023 versus 2022 and adding constant‑dollar comparisons to isolate currency effects. This evolution reflects a continued emphasis on transparency, as Visa now provides both nominal and constant‑dollar growth figures and clarifies that service revenue is tied to prior‑quarter nominal payments volume, while also disclosing the components of TNV (e.g., consumer credit, debit, commercial) and the impact of foreign‑currency fluctuations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company anticipated that its cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services would be consistent with past levels relative to revenues. By 2024, the company disclosed that it had entered into agreements that could require payments of up to $14 billion if specified amounts of goods or services, primarily related to incretin medicines, are not purchased over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years. This indicates a significant shift from a stable outlook to a much larger financial commitment tied to supply agreements, driven by expansion in manufacturing capacity and contract manufacturing arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the company’s cash needs for purchasing goods and services remained broadly consistent with historical levels relative to revenue, as stated in the 2024 filing (page 49). However, the nature of these requirements evolved significantly: while ordinary course purchases stayed stable, the company increasingly relied on large-scale contractual commitments, including up to $14 billion in potential payments under supply agreements for incretin medicines over multi-year terms (page 49). Additionally, capital expenditures surged to $5.06 billion in 2024 (up from $3.45 billion in 2023, page 49), driven by investments in global manufacturing capacity to support growing demand for products like Mounjaro and Zepbound. This expansion, coupled with higher R&D and milestone-related spending, elevated the scale and complexity of cash outflows tied to ordinary operations, even as the company maintained that these requirements aligned with revenue trends.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple reported net repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days amounting to $2,645 million, while in 2024, the company no longer disclosed any activity in this category, indicating a strategic shift away from issuing longer-term commercial paper. This suggests Apple streamlined its short-term financing to focus exclusively on instruments with maturities of 90 days or less, such as the $3,960 million in net proceeds reported in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple’s net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities > 90 days were negative $2.6 billion in 2023 and turned positive $5.9 billion in 2024 (the table shows “Proceeds from commercial paper” of $‑ 2,645 million in 2023 versus $5,948 million in 2022; the net figure for >90‑day maturities is –$2,645 million in 2023 and $5,948 million in 2024).

In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that it was evaluating the impact of new segment reporting standards (ASU 2023-07), which required expanded segment disclosures including segment expenses and interim reporting of segment profit or loss and assets. Additionally, RTX announced the planned sale of its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within the Raytheon segment for approximately $1.3 billion, with related assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. By 2024, RTX provided detailed revenue recognition practices for its Raytheon segment, emphasizing that substantially all defense business revenue is recognized over time using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This reflects a shift from preparatory disclosures about upcoming standards to concrete implementation of those standards and more transparent reporting of performance obligations and contract accounting practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX’s Raytheon segment refined its revenue recognition practices by tightening the estimation of variable consideration—particularly for long‑term maintenance contracts—while continuing to allocate transaction price to distinct performance obligations on a standalone‑selling‑price basis. The segment also began recognizing revenue over time for most defense contracts using percentage‑of‑completion methods, and it recorded contract assets/liabilities for advances or retainages, reflecting the timing differences between billings and revenue realization. Additionally, the 2024 RPO figure rose to $218 billion, with about 25 % expected to be recognized within the next year, underscoring the segment’s shift toward longer‑term, over‑time revenue streams.",

      "question": "How did Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in DCAI evolve between 2023 and 2024 to reverse the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics into a growth trend?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing hyperscaler purchasing power, internal semiconductor development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware in cloud services, which made it harder to differentiate products and led to order volatility. These factors eroded Intel's competitive position and adversely affected DCAI results. However, in 2024, Intel reversed this trend by focusing on high core count server products that increased average selling prices (ASPs), despite lower volume. This strategic shift in product mix, aimed at optimizing for performance and customization needs of cloud service providers, contributed to a 1% increase in DCAI revenue year-over-year. The internal foundry operating model also took effect in 2024, aiming to improve cost efficiency and product competitiveness, which likely supported this strategic pivot.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel reversed the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics by shifting its DCAI strategy from a focus on pure volume to a differentiated, AI‑centric product portfolio and a new internal foundry operating model.  In 2024 the company launched the Core Ultra 200V “AI PC” processors and the Gaudi 3 AI accelerator, while restructuring its cost base and linking executive compensation to sustainability and efficiency targets.  These moves, together with the separation of Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary, restored growth to the DCAI segment and turned the prior decline into a modest 1 % revenue increase.",

By 2024, while no direct numerical update was provided, the company disclosed qualitative changes in how it accounts for content obligations, including more nuanced treatment of non-cancelable commitments, licensing of future titles, and obligations tied to creative talent agreements. This indicates a shift from purely quantitative disclosure to a more strategic and forward-looking explanation of content liabilities, suggesting increased complexity in content acquisition and production planning.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Netflix’s content obligations increased from $23.2 billion to $23.2 billion (2024) versus $21.7 billion (2023), reflecting a continued shift toward higher‑upfront cash outlays for original productions and larger licensing commitments, while amortization expense grew at a slower pace. This evolution indicates that Netflix is deliberately expanding its original‑content pipeline and securing more extensive licensing windows, prioritizing long‑term library control over cost‑efficient, amortized licensed titles. Consequently, the company’s content‑acquisition strategy emphasizes greater cash investment in proprietary programming to differentiate its service and sustain subscriber growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Amazon highlighted the general uncertainty in tax accruals due to the complexity of tax laws, audits, and controversies across jurisdictions, but did not specify any particular high-profile dispute. By 2024, the company disclosed a specific ongoing tax dispute with the Indian tax authority over cloud services fees, where the authority asserts that such fees are subject to tax in India. Amazon is contesting this, but an adverse outcome could result in additional payments for both current and prior periods. This evolution shows a shift from a more general risk disclosure to a concrete example of a material tax controversy affecting accrual adequacy.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon’s disclosures on tax accrual adequacy show a consistent focus on the uncertainty of tax positions and the potential for additional liabilities, but with increasing specificity in 2024 regarding high‑risk jurisdictions and emerging tax regimes. In 2022 the filing highlighted “additional tax expense” and “tax collection obligations” arising from changes in laws, the global tax framework, and new revenue‑based taxes on online marketplaces, while noting that the final outcome of audits could materially affect results. By 2024 the language is more detailed, citing concrete controversies such as the Indian tax authority’s claim on cloud‑service fees and the broader EU‑wide minimum tax and digital‑services‑tax initiatives, and it emphasizes that “interpretations of certain tax laws by authorities… can cause material differences” from recorded accruals. Thus, while the core themes of uncertainty and contingent tax liabilities remain, the 2024 disclosure adds clearer references to specific foreign tax disputes and the expanding patchwork of unilateral tax measures that could heighten future tax risk.",

In 2024, the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities was $3.8 billion, reflecting higher estimated Skyrizi sales and the passage of time, partially offset by higher discount rates.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, patient assistance program costs were a key component of sales rebate and discount accruals, with a 5% change in the consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability impacting revenue by approximately $615 million. By 2024, these costs remained a significant part of the accruals, but the company emphasized a more structured expected value approach to estimate these liabilities. This evolution suggests an increased focus on precision in financial exposure management related to patient assistance programs.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s revenue‑recognition methodology for patient‑assistance program costs was revised between 2023 and 2024 to incorporate a more detailed estimate of rebates, discounts, and returns tied to those programs, moving from a simpler accrual to an expected‑value approach that is updated as contract terms and program participation change. This evolution reflects heightened financial exposure, as the company now must maintain larger accrual reserves for patient‑assistance rebates and discounts, making its net product revenue more sensitive to fluctuations in program utilization and regulatory changes.",

      "question": "How did the shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024 reflect changes in Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in the data center market?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024 reflects Intel's evolving competitive positioning and product strategy in the data center market. While DCAI revenue increased 1% year-over-year in 2024, this modest growth occurred amid significant headwinds: the document notes that \"DCAI revenue, platform ASPs and market share were negatively impacted by the competitive environment and the shift of customer spend towards GPUs during the past few years\" (page 48), and that \"our DCAI revenue, platform ASPs and market share were negatively impacted by the competitive environment and the shift of customer spend towards GPUs\" (page 48). Despite launching new products like the Intel Xeon 6 processors with E-Cores and P-Cores, and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators, Intel faced delays in product rollouts (e.g., 4th Gen Xeon Scalable processors delayed from H1 to H2 2022) and competitive pressures from TSMC-based competitors, which \"have benefited from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us\" (page 50). The document also indicates that Intel's foundry strategy and internal restructuring (including $2.8B in restructuring charges and $3.3B in asset impairments) were undertaken to address these competitive challenges and reposition for future growth, but these efforts have not yet translated into strong DCAI revenue growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed that cost pass-through contributed positively to sales growth, accounting for a 2% change in sales variance. By 2023, the company emphasized that its long-term contracts provided not only cash flow stability but also the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, indicating a strategic reinforcement of this mechanism. This shows that cost pass-through evolved from being a minor contributing factor to a more integral and positively framed component of Linde’s contractual and pricing strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Linde's cost pass-through strategy intensified, particularly in the EMEA and APAC segments, where contractual billing of energy cost variances to onsite customers increased sales by 6% in EMEA and contributed to an 8% sales rise in APAC. This pass-through mechanism, which minimizes impact on operating profit, supported higher pricing and volume growth across all segments, directly boosting sales while maintaining margin stability. The 2023 outlook explicitly cited cost pass-through as a key driver of the 2% sales decline (due to lower volumes and currency) being offset by 6% higher price attainment, underscoring its strategic role in mitigating inflationary pressures while driving revenue growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, vendor allowances—primarily volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances—were described as reducing the carrying cost of inventory and were recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory was sold. These allowances were accrued as earned, particularly those tied to purchase levels, over the incentive period. By 2023, the focus shifted to the net presentation of inventory cost, which included acquisition costs, freight, and import costs, but was stated to be net of certain vendor allowances. This indicates a more direct impact on inventory valuation in 2023, where vendor allowances were factored into the gross inventory value before applying the lower of cost or market (LCM) or net realizable value (NRV) tests. The change reflects a more integrated treatment of vendor allowances in inventory valuation in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of vendor allowances in inventory valuation remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, as both years' disclosures (in the \"Cost of Sales\" and \"Vendor Allowances\" sections of the 10-K) state that allowances not reimbursing specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are included in cost of sales and that volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold. There was no evolution in the accounting policy during this period, as the methodology for handling these allowances was unchanged.",

By 2024, the description remained consistent, emphasizing that the unrealized mark-to-market impact of non-qualifying hedges continued to cause earnings volatility, with the same mechanism of economic offset through unmarked physical assets. While the qualitative description remained stable, the continued emphasis on 'could be significant' in both years indicates that the financial impact of the non-qualifying hedge category remained material and volatile, with no explicit quantitative change provided.",
      "llm_answer": "The non-qualifying hedge category’s impact on earnings volatility has generally declined from 2023 to 2024, as the economic offset mechanism involving physical asset positions increasingly offsets mark-to-market gains and losses in the non-qualifying hedge category, reducing the volatility reflected in adjusted earnings.

However, while the 2023 disclosure framed this as a new charge impacting the 2024 tax rate compared to 2023, the 2024 disclosure reflects that this charge had fully materialized and remained a key factor in maintaining a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate.

      "llm_answer": "The effective tax rate rose from 14.7% in 2023 to 24.1% in 2024 primarily because 2024 included a one‑time $10.2 billion income‑tax charge tied to the State Aid Decision, whereas 2023 did not have this charge; the 2024 rate was also affected by a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share‑based compensation.",

      "original_answer": "Walmart's operating income rate as a percentage of net sales decreased by 120 basis points in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year, primarily due to charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and reorganization in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, the operating income rate increased by 83 basis points in fiscal 2024, driven by lapping those prior-year charges and improvements in business performance. This represents a significant turnaround in the company's operating income trajectory.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating income as a percentage of net sales increased from 4.2% in fiscal 2024 to 4.4% in fiscal 2025. This improvement was driven by higher gross profit margin (up 40 basis points to 24.1%) due to pricing strategies that absorbed cost increases and favorable merchandise mix, coupled with controlled operating expense growth (up only 36 basis points to 20.7% of sales). The company specifically cited managing prices to maintain competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses like digital advertising as key factors behind the margin expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron's disclosures around Properties, Plant and Equipment were primarily limited to listing the note reference in the financial statements without detailed discussion of impairment triggers or sensitivity. By 2024, the company significantly expanded its disclosure, providing a detailed explanation of the impairment assessment process, including specific triggering events such as downward revisions in reserves, changes in commodity price outlook, and regulatory shifts related to environmental laws. The 2024 filing also elaborated on the complexity of sensitivity analyses due to the large number of assumptions involved, such as carbon costs, production profiles, and the pace of the energy transition—factors not explicitly highlighted in 2022. This represents a transformation in the depth and specificity of impairment-related disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 Chevron’s approach to impairments of Properties, Plant and Equipment remained consistent in that it assesses PP&E for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying value may not be recoverable, using undiscounted cash‑flow tests and comparing the carrying amount to estimated fair value. The key factors considered have not changed materially – management relies on assumptions about future commodity prices, reserve volumes, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and market supply‑demand conditions – but the sensitivity of those assumptions has increased. In 2024 the company noted that a 5 % reduction in proved‑reserve estimates would have raised depreciation‑depletion‑amortization expense by roughly $700 million, and it emphasized that a sensitivity analysis of impairment outcomes is “not practicable” because of the broad range of assets and the many variables involved. Consequently, while the underlying methodology stayed the same, the company’s public disclosures highlight greater uncertainty and the potential for larger, more varied impacts on impairment calculations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax-related adjustment impacting EBIT-adjusted consisted of a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation. In 2023, the adjustment also included a tax benefit, but this time related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a geographic and contextual change in the nature of tax-related adjustments affecting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax event in 2022 to a Korea-focused tax event in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the EBIT-adjusted figures declined from $14.5 billion to $12.4 billion, reflecting a reduction in the adjusted earnings base. The composition of adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted shifted markedly: while 2022 adjustments included items such as the Buick dealer strategy, Cruise restructuring, and Russia exit, the 2023 adjustments were dominated by a voluntary separation program, Cruise compensation modifications, and other one‑time items, with no comparable large‑scale tax‑related adjustments as seen in 2022. Consequently, tax‑related adjustments that had previously contributed to EBIT-adjusted (e.g., release of valuation allowances and related tax benefits) were far less significant in 2023, contributing to the lower EBIT-adjusted margin and a reduced ROIC‑adjusted return.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT highlighted liquidity risks tied to capital markets volatility and the potential inability to raise capital, which could hinder funding for future growth and expansion initiatives. By 2023, these risks were compounded by a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the India reporting unit, signaling a material decline in the unit's fair value and directly negatively impacting the company's ability to pursue growth initiatives. This evolution reflects a worsening financial outlook for expansion efforts due to both external market pressures and internal asset devaluations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, American Tower’s financial outlook for growth and expansion faced heightened liquidity risks and impairment pressures. Rising inflation and interest rates constrained debt capacity and increased borrowing costs, while declining tenant cash flows—especially in India—triggered goodwill impairments and asset write-downs, undermining expansion plans. Strategic initiatives like the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction remain subject to execution risks, regulatory hurdles, and potential indemnification liabilities, further complicating growth prospects amid tightening financial conditions.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and significance of variable rebates and incentives evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of their impact on net revenue and the level of management judgment required?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, variable rebates and incentives were described as being tied to customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds and were recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when volume- and transaction-based revenues were recognized. By 2024, these variable rebates and incentives had grown in importance, representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue. Additionally, the 2024 filing highlights that the estimation of variable rebates involves significant management judgment based on forecasted transactions, card issuance, and conversion volumes, leading to increased auditor scrutiny and classification as a critical audit matter. This indicates a transformation in both the scale and complexity of how variable rebates and incentives are managed and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the treatment of variable rebates and incentives evolved from being a material component of gross revenue that required significant management estimation and judgment to a more structured contra-revenue accounting practice. The 2024 filing (page 66) identifies rebates and incentives as “contra‑revenue” and explains that variable rebates are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when volume‑based revenues are recognized, with estimates of customer performance (volume thresholds, forecasts, historical experience) driving the amounts. The audit discussion (page 66) emphasizes that this process involves a high degree of auditor judgment due to the significant management estimation involved. Earlier years (2022 and 2023) describe similar variable rebate mechanics but place less emphasis on the contra‑revenue classification; the 2024 language makes the reduction of revenue explicit and underscores the reliance on management’s performance estimates, indicating a maturation and greater disclosure of the judgment required. Consequently, while the underlying economic substance—rebates reducing net revenue—has remained consistent, the reporting has become more explicit about the estimation risk and the need for professional judgment, especially as the company’s revenue base and acquisition activity have grown.",

This suggests Apple streamlined its short-term financing approach by focusing solely on instruments with maturities of 90 days or less, where it reported $3,960 million in net proceeds in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Apple's net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days were negative $2.645 billion in 2023 and negative $1.309 billion in 2022, indicating that the company repaid more long‑dated paper than it issued during those periods.

In 2023, this figure decreased by $64 million, or 12%, resulting in an operating profit of $409 million.

In 2023, the adjustment stemmed from a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This geographic shift—from an internal restructuring event in the U.S. (Cruise) to a regional tax realization in Korea—suggests GM strengthened its international tax position, particularly in Asia, while stabilizing its domestic tax asset base.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that ROU lease assets were being measured at fair value due to impairment charges that occurred in 2020, with impairment losses calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data. By 2024, PayPal's ROU lease assets had increased significantly to $599 million for operating leases and $73 million for finance leases as of December 31, 2024, up from $390 million for operating leases in 2023 (no finance leases reported then). This indicates a notable expansion in PayPal's leasing activities, particularly in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term commitments and potentially more capital-intensive operations.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Right-of-Use (ROU) lease assets increased from $390 million at the end of 2022 to $599 million at the end of 2024, reflecting new operating and finance leases (e.g., $343 million of new operating‑lease ROU assets and $82 million of new finance‑lease ROU assets in 2024) and modest growth in existing lease obligations. This expansion indicates that PayPal is actively expanding its physical footprint—particularly in office, data‑center and computer‑equipment spaces—while relying more on finance leases for equipment, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer‑term, cost‑controlled lease arrangements rather than short‑term or subleased spaces.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company considered historical rebate payments, patient assistance program costs by product as a percentage of historical sales, and evaluated current contracts, sales trends, and product pricing when estimating rebate accruals. By 2024, while historical rebate payments remained a key input, the estimation methodology evolved to include an 'expected value approach' for accruals, and the company expanded its consideration to include government rebate budget forecasts in large European countries, reflecting a more nuanced and diversified evaluation process.",
      "llm_answer": "The role of historical rebate payments in estimating sales rebate accruals has expanded significantly between 2023 and 2024, with the company increasingly relying on detailed historical payment patterns and trends to inform its accrual estimates. In 2023, the company noted that adjustments to accruals were less than 1% of consolidated revenue, but by 2024, it emphasized that historical rebate data—particularly for managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and patient assistance programs—was a critical input for estimating rebate liabilities, alongside factors like sales trends, contract evaluations, and program-specific percentages of sales. This evolution reflects a more granular and data-driven approach to forecasting rebate obligations, especially as the company faces complex program dynamics and timing lags in rebate payments (typically up to six months).",

By 2024, the breakdown showed a significant shift, with $3,945 million allocated for 2025, followed by a sharp decline in subsequent years (e.g., $815 million in 2026, $250 million in 2027). This indicates a strategic front-loading of investments in NEER, likely signaling a focus on accelerating growth or development in its competitive energy businesses in the near term.",
      "llm_answer": "NEE's projected capital expenditures for NEER declined sharply from $11.045 billion in 2025 to $7.485 billion in 2026, and then to $3.840 billion in 2027, reflecting a strategic pull‑back in its competitive energy investments. This reduction signals a shift toward prioritizing lower‑risk, regulated assets (such as FPL's generation, transmission and distribution projects) while scaling back aggressive expansion in the unregulated NEER portfolio.",

In contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1%, driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs but lowered volume compared to 2023. This shift indicates a stabilization and slight recovery in DCAI's performance, supported by a strategic focus on higher-value offerings despite ongoing volume challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "The DCAI revenue trajectory shifted from a 20% decline in 2023 to a modest 1% increase in 2024, driven by higher server revenue from high-core-count products and improved ASPs, despite ongoing softness in the broader CPU data center market. This change reflects Intel's strategic focus on AI accelerators (e.g., Gaudi 3, Jaguar Shores) and heterogeneous compute solutions, though the segment remains sensitive to cloud spending cycles and competitive pressures from NVIDIA and AMD.",

While earnings from continuing operations increased modestly by 21% (from $1,886 million to $2,286 million), the net earnings figure spiked due to an additional $9,988 million gain or adjustment, as evidenced by the large discrepancy between earnings from continuing operations and net earnings in 2023. This suggests a one-time event or accounting adjustment specific to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The 309% surge in net earnings attributable to common stockholders from 2022 ($3.2 billion) to 2023 ($13.2 billion) was driven almost entirely by non-recurring gains from the sale of the Copeland business and other strategic divestitures, as explicitly noted in the \"Results of Operations\" table (page 22) where \"Net earnings common stockholders\" jumped to $13,219 in 2023 (up 309% from $3,231 in 2022). This contrasts sharply with earnings from continuing operations, which actually declined 29% to $1,618 million in 2024 (down from $2,286 million in 2023) and fell to $2.82 diluted EPS, reflecting the negative impact of acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges, and the loss on the Copeland note sale that offset operational growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron reported Noncurrent Deferred Income Taxes at $14,665 million, which increased to $19,137 million by 2024. This indicates a significant growth in the company's long-term tax liabilities over this period, suggesting either increased deferrals or changes in tax regulations or corporate activities affecting deferred tax obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From the provided pages, the value of Noncurrent Deferred Income Taxes was $15,621 million at the end of 2024 and $14,661 million at the end of 2023. This increase indicates that Chevron’s long‑term tax liabilities have risen, reflecting higher deferred tax balances driven by factors such as asset sales and foreign‑exchange impacts.",

      "original_answer": "Apple's Products Gross Margin percentage increased from 36.5% in 2023 to 37.2% in 2024, reflecting a 0.7 percentage point improvement. In 2023, the increase was attributed to cost savings, partially offset by a different product mix and foreign currency weakness. In 2024, the margin expansion continued despite ongoing mix challenges and currency headwinds, suggesting that cost-saving measures had a sustained impact and potentially more effective mitigation of negative factors.",
      "llm_answer": "The change in Apple's Products Gross Margin percentage between 2023 and 2024 was an increase of 0.7 percentage points (from 36.5% to 37.2%). This improvement was attributed to cost savings, partially offset by a different product mix and weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, as noted in the 2024 gross margin analysis for Products. \n\nThe factors influencing this metric evolved year-over-year by shifting from cost savings and foreign currency pressures in 2023 to a more pronounced impact from product mix changes and currency fluctuations in 2024, while Services gross margin percentage also rose significantly (to 73.9%) due to higher Services net sales and a different Services mix, contributing to overall gross margin expansion.",

By fiscal 2023, the Treasury Stock Balance had significantly increased to $ (95,372) million, with the company repurchasing $ (8,074) million of its common stock during the year. This indicates a major shift in the company's stock repurchase strategy, moving from a relatively modest buyback in fiscal 2022 to a much more aggressive repurchase program in fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Home Depot's Treasury Stock Balance increased from $87,298 million at the end of fiscal 2022 to $95,372 million at the end of fiscal 2023—a rise of roughly $8 billion—driven by $8,074 million of repurchases during fiscal 2023 (including $7,951 million recorded in the cash‑flow statement) and additional purchases in prior periods. This growth reflects an aggressive stock‑repurchase strategy, underscored by the Board’s $20 billion authorization in May 2021 that replaced the prior $15 billion program, indicating the company is actively deploying capital to buy back shares and return value to shareholders.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for pension and postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a $428 million decrease primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and projected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a significant shift from a short-term net benefit expectation to a long-term near-complete reduction in costs, driven by changes in benefit structure and amortization patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 Disney’s post‑retirement medical net benefit fell from $29 million to $23 million, a $6 million decrease. The company now expects a net benefit of only $81 million in fiscal 2023—down $428 million from the prior year—driven mainly by lower amortization of previously deferred losses, while interest costs are higher. Amortization factors therefore declined, contributing to the reduced projected net benefit.",

By 2023, there was no further impact from the Dermstore sale, as no gain was reported either pretax or on a per-share basis.

This improvement was primarily driven by higher notebook volumes compared to 2023, partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to reduced demand and lower other CCG revenue from the exit of legacy businesses.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the backlog at year-end was $56,630 million, and by 2023, it increased to $60,156 million. This indicates that the company is receiving more orders than it is fulfilling within the same period, suggesting strong demand and potential for higher future revenue as the backlog is realized.",
      "llm_answer": "The backlog at year‑end grew from $147.1 billion in 2022 to $135.4 billion in 2021 (a decrease of about $11.7 billion), but the company’s order flow remained strong, driven by multi‑year awards in national‑security space and missile‑defense programs. This expanding backlog signals a robust pipeline of future work that should support continued revenue growth and improve the outlook for upcoming earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Walmart reported a total repayment of matured debt amounting to $2,689 million, which included repayments such as $927 million in April 2022 and $1,250 million in December 2022. In 2024, the company's total repayment of matured debt increased to $3,373 million, with specific repayments including $1,500 million in April 2024 and $630 million in December 2024. This indicates a significant increase in the volume of debt repayments in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's total repayment of matured debt decreased from $4,030 million in fiscal 2023 to $3,373 million in fiscal 2024. This decline reflects a lighter near‑term maturity profile, with the majority of upcoming principal payments concentrated in later years (e.g., $2.6 billion due in 2026, $3.5 billion in 2027, $1.7 billion in 2028, $3.3 billion in 2029, and $2.0 billion in 2030, plus $22.9 billion thereafter). Consequently, the company's debt maturity schedule shows a substantial portion of long‑term obligations remaining well beyond the next few years, indicating that near‑term debt servicing requirements are relatively modest compared with the overall long‑dated debt position.",

However, this decrease occurred alongside a dramatic reduction in the amount of short-term borrowings, which dropped from $1,599 million in 2022 to just $1 million in 2023. Therefore, while the interest rate itself declined significantly, the company's overall exposure to short-term borrowing costs was drastically reduced in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The weighted‑average interest rate on short‑term borrowings fell from 2.8 % at the end of 2022 to 0.4 % at the end of 2023, reflecting a substantial decline in short‑term borrowing costs.

In 2024, this same one-time tax charge of $10.2 billion continued to negatively impact the effective tax rate, which remained higher than the statutory rate due to this charge, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation. The magnitude of the tax charge remained unchanged, but its ongoing effect indicates a sustained financial impact from the State Aid Decision.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde leveraged its long-term contracts to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, contributing to cash flow stability. By 2023, the company explicitly quantified the impact of cost pass-through in its financial reporting, showing a negative 6% variance in sales growth due to this factor. This indicates that while cost pass-through remained a contractual mechanism, it had a dampening effect on reported sales growth in 2023 compared to the more neutral or supportive role implied in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms evolved between 2022 and 2023, with cost pass-through decreasing sales by 3% in EMEA and 1% in APAC, while having minimal impact on operating profit. In the Americas, cost pass-through decreased sales by 6% but similarly had minimal impact on operating profit, as higher pricing and productivity initiatives more than offset cost inflation. This strategic use of cost pass-through contributed to strong operating profit growth across segments, particularly in EMEA (23% increase) and the Americas (14% increase), driving overall segment operating profit up 15% year-over-year to $9,070 million. Consequently, this dynamic supported robust financial performance, including a 15% rise in total segment operating profit and improved margins, underpinning Linde's 15% growth in segment operating profit and enhanced financial results despite volume pressures in certain regions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney fully consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort) in its financial statements due to its management agreements that gave it control over day-to-day operations and strategic decisions, despite owning less than 50% equity. By 2023, the financial disclosures indicate a shift: while the Asia Theme Parks were still included in the consolidated borrowing figures, the presentation separates borrowings 'Before Asia Theme Parks Consolidation' and shows specific Asia Theme Parks borrowings as distinct. For example, total borrowings including the Asia Theme Parks amounted to $45,101 million in 2023, compared to $43,809 million before including them, indicating a $1,292 million contribution from the Asia Theme Parks. This structured separation suggests a more transparent or modified reporting approach compared to 2022, where the Asia Theme Parks were fully consolidated without such a detailed breakout.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Disney's financial relationship with the Asia Theme Parks shifted from consolidation to disclosure. In 2022, the Company consolidated Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (the Asia Theme Parks) in its financial statements due to its control through management agreements and significant influence, as detailed in the 2022 10-K (page 83). However, by 2023, the Company no longer consolidated these entities, as evidenced by the 2023 10-K (page 100) which only references \"Asia Theme Parks borrowings\" as a separate line item ($1,292 million in 2023 vs. $1,308 million in 2022) within total borrowings, without consolidation disclosures. The 2023 filing also explicitly states that the bank facilities \"specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default\" (page 99), confirming the de-consolidation. Borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks remained a distinct line item in the consolidated balance sheet but were no longer included in the consolidated financial statements.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, PayPal disclosed that TPV growth was directly impacted by the number of payment transactions enabled on its platform, and that transaction revenues were typically correlated with TPV growth. By 2024, PayPal reported TPV increasing from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, a 10% increase. This TPV growth trajectory indicates a positive trend in transaction revenue potential, as TPV is a key driver of transaction fees from merchants. The sustained increase in TPV across the filings suggests that PayPal's platform usage and merchant transaction volume were expanding, which would directly support revenue growth in line with the correlation described in the 2022 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal’s total payment volume (TPV) grew from $1.25 trillion in 2020 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, a 10% year‑over‑year increase, and the number of payment transactions rose from 19.3 billion to 26.3 billion, a 5% rise. Because transaction revenue grew only 7% in 2024 (to $2.0 billion) while TPV grew 10%, the company’s revenue trajectory is being constrained by a shift toward lower‑priced transaction mix (e.g., higher volume from large merchants and Braintree), indicating that future transaction‑revenue growth will likely lag behind TPV expansion.",

      "question": "How did the contribution of average transaction amount to comparable sales change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about Target's pricing strategy and consumer response during these periods?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average transaction amount contributed positively to comparable sales growth with a 0.4% increase, indicating that consumers were spending slightly more per transaction. However, in 2023, the average transaction amount decreased by 1.4%, becoming a drag on comparable sales performance. This shift reveals a change in consumer behavior where shoppers were spending less per visit, potentially due to economic pressures or changes in purchasing habits. Target responded with strategies such as offering 'attractive everyday price points on key items' and 'compelling promotions' to drive traffic, suggesting a shift toward value-oriented pricing to counteract declining transaction sizes.",
      "llm_answer": "The contribution of average transaction amount to comparable sales declined from a 15.0 percent boost in 2021 to a 1.4 percent drag in 2023, reflecting weaker pricing power and reduced willingness to spend per purchase. This shift signals that Target’s pricing strategy—relying more on promotional discounts and lower‑ticket items—failed to sustain prior growth, prompting consumers to cut back on average spend while still engaging with the brand through increased traffic and frequency‑driven categories.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Membership and Other Income increased by 7.0% compared to the prior year, and in fiscal 2024, the growth rate rose slightly to 7.5%. Additionally, in fiscal 2024, the income was positively impacted by higher Plus renewals and the expiration of a promotional offering that had offset membership fee increases in the prior year. By fiscal 2024, the dollar value of Membership and Other Income reached $1,408 million, compared to $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a short-term dip but sustained growth trajectory driven by membership base expansion and Plus penetration.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, Walmart’s “Membership and other income” grew from $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion—a roughly 1‑2 % increase (7 % growth reported in the 2024 filing when measured against the prior year). This modest rise reflects continued expansion of the Walmart+ subscriber base and higher renewal rates, but the incremental gain is modest compared with the broader revenue expansion. Consequently, the shift signals that while the membership program remains a stable contributor to earnings, its growth trajectory is now leveling off and is being outpaced by the company’s overall sales growth.",

      "question": "How has Chevron's explanation of the factors influencing its effective tax rate volatility evolved between 2022 and 2024, and what specific changes in context or emphasis are evident in the company's disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron attributed effective tax rate volatility primarily to 'mix effects' influenced by the absolute level of earnings or losses and their geographic distribution across tax jurisdictions. The company emphasized that a decline or increase in the effective tax rate might not indicate future results. By 2024, the explanation remained centered on 'mix effects' but placed additional emphasis on the impact of earnings volatility without reiterating the geographic component as explicitly. Instead, the 2024 disclosure focused more broadly on the non-indicative nature of tax rate changes and linked the discussion to broader financial reporting in Note 17 Taxes, signaling a subtle shift in framing from geographic mix to general earnings volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's explanation of the factors influencing its effective tax rate volatility has shifted markedly between 2022 and 2024. In the 2022 filing (pages 33‑37), the company emphasized that “the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility” and highlighted the “mix effects” driven by earnings levels and the jurisdictions in which they occur, noting that such changes “may not be indicative of expected results in future periods.” By contrast, the 2024 filing (pages 36‑37) retains this language but adds a concrete recent example—citing the 2024 restructuring charge and the resulting impact on pension and OPEB plans—and explicitly ties the tax‑rate discussion to the “mix effects” of both earnings volatility and the company’s evolving capital‑allocation strategy, including its $10 billion lower‑carbon investment plan. The newer disclosure therefore places greater emphasis on how strategic shifts (e.g., cost‑reduction programs and lower‑carbon capital spending) interact with earnings volatility to affect the effective tax rate, whereas the 2022 version focused more broadly on earnings‑mix effects alone. This evolution reflects a move from a generic volatility warning to a more integrated narrative that links tax‑rate risk to specific strategic initiatives and near‑term financial actions.",

By 2024, the company continued to face similar risks but emphasized a more pronounced focus on the complexity of complying with inconsistent international regulations, suggesting that the regulatory environment had become more challenging. This evolution indicates that Apple's exposure to investigatory expenses has increased due to the growing number and severity of global data protection requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Apple's exposure to investigatory expenses related to data protection and privacy compliance has increased, as evidenced by expanded regulatory scrutiny in the EU under the DMA, heightened antitrust investigations, and intensified focus on data privacy obligations across multiple jurisdictions. This indicates that Apple operates in a more complex and evolving regulatory environment, where compliance risks are rising due to stricter global data protection laws, potential fines, and the need for ongoing adjustments to business practices to meet diverse legal requirements.",

      "question": "How has the sales performance of Humira evolved between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about its market position following the expiration of its key patents?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Humira generated worldwide net revenues of $21.237 billion, reflecting its dominant position in the immunology market. By 2024, total worldwide sales of Humira had declined to $8.993 billion, representing a decrease of 36.9% at constant currency rates compared to 2022. This significant drop in sales follows the expiration of Humira's key patents, which began in 2016 in the U.S. and 2018 in the EU, leading to increased competition from biosimilars and eroding its market exclusivity.",
      "llm_answer": "Humira’s sales have declined sharply – worldwide net revenues fell 37 % in 2024, with a 41 % drop in the United States and a 13 % decline internationally – a direct result of biosimilar competition after the key patent expired in 2016 (U.S.) and 2018 (EU). This steep erosion underscores that, after the loss of patent protection, Humira’s market position has been largely supplanted by lower‑priced biosimilars, forcing AbbVie to rely on newer immunology and specialty products for growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that future pension risk transfer transactions could result in noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period, but did not specify the magnitude or likelihood of such charges. In 2023, the company maintained the same general disclosure but added that these transactions could also result in the company making additional contributions to the pension trust, indicating a more detailed articulation of the financial risks involved. While the core risk remained consistent, the 2023 disclosure expanded on the potential dual impact of additional contributions and noncash charges.",
      "llm_answer": "The disclosure regarding the potential financial impact of noncash settlement charges from pension risk transfer transactions evolved from 2022 to 2023 by expanding the discussion of how such transactions could affect earnings and cash flow. In the 2022 filing (pages 24‑28), the company described that while most group annuity contracts relieve it of pension obligations, it could still incur noncash settlement charges if it purchases additional GACs where the insurer reimburses the plan but the company remains responsible for paying benefits and bears the risk of insurer default. By 2023 (pages 17‑21), the language was refined to note that future pension‑risk‑transfer transactions “could result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period,” explicitly linking the size of future transactions to the magnitude of potential noncash charges. This progression shows a clearer articulation of the risk and financial impact of noncash settlement charges across the two years.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's operating expenses rate increased by 23 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to opioid-related legal settlement charges and restructuring costs in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the operating expenses rate decreased by 60 basis points, driven by the absence of those prior-year charges, particularly the $3.3 billion opioid-related settlements and $0.8 billion restructuring expenses. This represents a significant turnaround in the trend of operating expenses relative to net sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased from 20.4% in fiscal 2024 to 20.7% in fiscal 2025. This 36-basis-point increase was primarily driven by higher variable pay due to exceeding planned performance, increased marketing expenses, and higher depreciation costs, as noted in the \"Margin\" section of the 2025 financial results. The company attributes this rise to strategic investments in productivity and business initiatives, while emphasizing that operating income growth outpaced net sales growth (4.4% vs. 5.0% operating income margin increase).",

By 2024, the cumulative 'Day 2' ongoing impact was being calculated using the same 25% scaling factor, but the phase-in had progressed to 75% phased in by 2024, with full phase-in expected by 2025. This indicates that the capital impact evolved from an initial delayed implementation in 2022 to a more advanced phase-in stage by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 the CECL transition has been phased in at a 25 % annual rate, with the “day‑1” CECL impact added back in 2022 and the cumulative “day‑2” impact phased in 25 % in 2022, 50 % in 2023 and 75 % in 2024 (reaching full phase‑in by 2025).  Accordingly, the capital impact of CECL has been gradually increasing each year, reaching 75 % of the total delayed amount as of December 31 2024, and the CET1 ratio would be about 13.3 % on a fully‑phased‑in basis versus the reported 13.5 % including the transition adjustment.",

By 2024, Intel entered into a Purchase and Contribution Agreement and an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement with Arizona Fab LLC, suggesting a formalization and potential shift in the financial and governance structure of the relationship, although full operational control remained. The specific funding commitment from 2023 was not reiterated in 2024, indicating a possible transition from a funding phase to an operational phase.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Intel’s financial commitment to Arizona Fab LLC deepened through a $29 billion unrecognized funding obligation and a 49 % non‑controlling interest that rose from $874 million (2022) to $2.36 billion (2023), reflecting increased capital investment in the joint venture. Operationally, Intel retains full operator control of the new Arizona fabs, securing the right to purchase 100 % of their output and committing to minimum wafer‑start levels, while the partnership’s assets—now $4.8 billion in property, plant and equipment—are dedicated solely to settling Arizona Fab’s obligations.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel referenced the divestiture of its NAND memory business as part of its capital allocation strategy, indicating a shift toward investing in its IDM 2.0 strategy and away from non-core businesses. By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as an active segment, and instead, Intel emphasized its focus on new business areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and external foundry services through IFS. This evolution indicates a continued strategic realignment toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing capabilities, while exiting businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Intel shifted its NAND memory strategy from active development to exit and divestiture—having sold its NAND business to SK Hynix in 2020 and winding down Optane in 2022—thereby ending internal NAND investment and redirecting capital toward its foundry (IFS) and IDM 2.0 initiatives. This reflects a broader capital allocation priority of prioritizing manufacturing capacity expansion and foundry growth over legacy memory businesses, as evidenced by increased R&D and capital spending on process technology (e.g., Intel 20A, Ribbon FET) and strategic investments like the Brookfield Arizona campus partnership, while reducing focus on share repurchases.",

      "question": "How has Capital One's treatment of revolving loans in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of loan conversion and delinquency trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One converted $223 million of revolving loans to term loans in the domestic credit card portfolio. By 2024, the company reported a total domestic credit card loan portfolio of $155.618 billion, with $7.053 billion in total delinquent loans. This indicates a shift from proactive loan conversion strategies in 2022 to a focus on delinquency management in 2024, suggesting evolving credit risk dynamics in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s Domestic Credit Card portfolio shows a modest rise in 90+‑day delinquent balances that continue to accrue interest—$3,577 million in 2024 versus $3,367 million in 2023—while the allowance for credit losses on those revolving loans remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from $11.4 billion (2023) to $11.0 billion (2024) after accounting for charge‑offs and provisions.  The company also converted a small amount of revolving credit‑card balances into term loans ($223 million in 2021 and $602 million in 2020), but there is no indication of a material shift in the conversion trend between 2022 and 2024; delinquency rates have stayed around 1.4 % of total credit‑card loans, with a slight uptick in 2024.  Overall, the treatment of revolving loans has not changed dramatically, but the portfolio shows a gradual increase in delinquent balances and a modest reduction in the allowance for credit losses over the period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Grooming segment accounted for 8% of net sales, indicating its relatively smaller contribution to the company's overall revenue. In 2023, the segment saw high single-digit organic sales growth, which was notably stronger than the company's overall organic sales growth of 4%. This suggests that the Grooming segment outperformed the company average in terms of growth during fiscal 2023, showing an upward trend in its relative importance or market traction.",
      "llm_answer": "The Grooming segment’s net sales grew 4% in fiscal 2024 (to $6.65 billion) from fiscal 2023, driven by an 8% price increase and a modest 1% rise in unit volume, partially offset by a 5% adverse foreign‑exchange impact. This growth outpaced the company’s overall organic sales increase of 4% and contributed to the total 2% net‑sales rise for the company, indicating that Grooming was a key driver of the firm’s organic sales momentum.",

      "original_answer": "In FY2023, revenue from customers outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in FY2024, this dropped to 56%. This indicates a significant increase in U.S.-based demand for Compute & Networking segment products, which is attributed to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand. The shift suggests a growing adoption of NVIDIA's compute and networking solutions within the domestic market, potentially driven by data center expansion and enterprise AI initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "From FY2023 to FY2024, revenue from the Compute & Networking segment that was billed outside the United States fell from 69% of total revenue to 56%, indicating a clear shift toward greater U.S. market concentration. This decline suggests that demand in U.S. markets is rising relative to international demand, as the share of non‑U.S. revenue is decreasing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MMM's Personal Safety segment reported sales of $3.916 billion, reflecting a decline compared to the prior year and indicating reduced demand, particularly in contrast to the strong pandemic-related respirator mask demand in 2021. By 2023, the Personal Safety segment's sales further decreased to $3.487 billion, representing a continued downward trend. This indicates a sustained reduction in the segment's contribution to MMM's overall revenue, suggesting a potential strategic shift or reduced emphasis on this business line.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the Personal Safety segment’s sales declined from $3.916 billion to $3.487 billion, and its operating income margin fell from 20.9% to 20.8% (a modest 0.1‑percentage‑point drop), reflecting ongoing pressure from raw‑material, logistics and litigation costs that offset gains from restructuring and productivity initiatives. This downturn suggests that 3M is facing headwinds in its personal‑safety market, prompting the company to pursue strategic divestitures—such as the sale of its dental‑local anesthetic business—and to reposition the segment within its broader portfolio, while still maintaining a notable presence in safety‑related product lines.",

      "original_answer": "Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue increased by 1% in 2022 to $79.0 billion, driven by strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, despite lower notebook ASPs. In contrast, CCG revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 to $54.2 billion due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in the second half of the year. The decline in 2023 was also influenced by a higher mix of small core and older generation products, which lowered ASPs, despite some offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial and gaming segments.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) revenue declined 8% year-over-year in 2023 to $54.2 billion, down from $59.0 billion in 2022, primarily due to lower notebook and desktop volumes driven by reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by inventory normalization in the second half of the year.

      "original_answer": "The fair value of non-agency RMBS decreased from $996 million in 2022 to $690 million in 2024. This indicates a significant reduction in the company's exposure to non-agency RMBS over this period. In 2022, the fair value was $996 million with $205 million in gross unrealized gains and no gross unrealized losses. By 2024, the fair value had declined to $690 million, with $89 million in gross unrealized gains and $5 million in gross unrealized losses. The decline in fair value, coupled with the emergence of unrealized losses, suggests a strategic reduction and potential de-risking from this segment of the portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2024 data, the fair value of non‑agency RMBS in the available‑for‑sale portfolio was $621 million (up from $621 million in 2023, with a slight increase in 2024), while the total RMBS fair value rose from $65,328 million in 2022 to $65,328 million in 2024 (the non‑agency portion remained a small fraction of the overall RMBS exposure). This modest growth and the relatively small absolute amount indicate that the company’s exposure to non‑agency RMBS is limited and has remained relatively stable, suggesting limited direct risk from that asset class.",

By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing.

This divestiture was part of Intel's strategic shift away from non-core businesses, as explicitly stated in its non-GAAP financial disclosures where it excludes the NAND business from core operational metrics. The sale generated approximately $3.2 billion in revenue for Intel in 2023 (representing 6% of total revenue), though the exact financial impact on operating performance is not detailed in the provided documents. The move allowed Intel to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy, including foundry expansion and product development, while eliminating the NAND business from its long-term strategic direction.",

This represents a modest growth of $86 million, primarily driven by acquisitions during the year, which added $31 million to the segment's value.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Reported OCI increased by $409 million (4.1%), primarily driven by higher pricing of $1,688 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,158 million. In 2024, Reported OCI increased by $151 million (1.4%), mainly due to higher pricing that included higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration, and research costs by $56 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,648 million. The magnitude of the OCI increase was significantly higher in 2022 compared to 2024, indicating a decline in the growth rate of OCI over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, reported Operating Company Income (OCI) for the smokeable products segment showed modest growth, rising from $10,394 million in 2021 to $10,821 million in 2024, with adjusted OCI increasing from $10,111 million to $10,922 million over the same period. The primary drivers of this change were higher pricing—particularly list‑price increases and promotional investments—partially offset by lower shipment volumes and higher per‑unit settlement, manufacturing and exit costs. While pricing gains contributed positively to both reported and adjusted OCI, declining shipment volumes (e.g., a 10.2% drop in domestic cigarette shipments in 2024) and rising cost pressures limited the net upside, resulting in only modest margin improvements (reported margin up from 57.4% in 2021 to 61.0% in 2024).",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue and was specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also tied to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting a more pronounced dependency on major customers for this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compute & Networking segment's strategic positioning shifted from being highly concentrated on a few large customers in fiscal 2023 to maintaining concentration but with reduced dependency on any single customer in fiscal 2024, as evidenced by the fact that while Customer A represented 13% of total revenue in 2024 (up from no 10%+ customers in 2023), the segment's revenue growth was driven by broader Data Center demand rather than reliance on a single client. This evolution reflects a strategic move toward diversified growth across multiple large customers and ecosystem partners, reducing relative dependency while still operating in a concentrated market structure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed that it self-insures costs associated with employee disability programs and bases accruals on actuarially estimated costs of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. By 2023, the company continued to self-insure these benefits but provided more detailed insight into the actuarial estimation process, noting that the estimates incorporated judgment around claim severity, frequency, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. This indicates a more nuanced and detailed approach to estimating liabilities related to employee disability benefits in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, FedEx’s self‑insurance accruals remained largely unchanged in amount but were subject to heightened judgment due to evolving risk factors.  The company continued to rely on actuarial estimates for workers’ compensation, vehicle, property, and disability claims, and it disclosed that a 5% shift in claim severity would alter reserves by roughly $280 million.  Concurrently, the firm refined its impairment testing of long‑lived assets and goodwill, adopting more granular network‑level cash‑flow analyses and updating actuarial assumptions (e.g., discount rates and expected returns) that directly affect the valuation of pension obligations and the timing of asset impairments.  These adjustments reflect a more rigorous, estimate‑driven approach to both self‑insurance and asset‑valuation disclosures across the two fiscal years.",

By 2024, Adjusted OCI increased by $212 million (2.0%), again supported by higher pricing and, notably, lower marketing, administration, and research costs ($86 million). However, both years experienced headwinds from declining shipment volumes—$1,931 million in 2022 and $2,528 million in 2024. The company's ability to maintain Adjusted OCI growth, despite worsening shipment declines, indicates improved cost management and sustained pricing power.",

Although domestic cigarette shipment volume fell 10‑11 % in 2024 (and had been falling 7‑8 % in prior years), the pricing actions and cost reductions helped preserve profitability, indicating that the firm can still generate earnings growth even as overall shipments shrink.  However, the continued volume decline underscores the risk that future profitability will increasingly depend on price‑driven strategies rather than volume growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed that it self-insured for property and cargo loss, with accruals based on actuarially estimated costs of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. The company also indicated that it periodically evaluates insurance coverage levels and adjusts them based on risk tolerance and premium expense. By 2023, FedEx provided more detailed insight into its self-insurance reserves, emphasizing that its estimates for property and cargo loss incorporated actuarial assumptions about claim severity, frequency, volume, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The 2023 filing also highlighted sensitivity to changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, and insurance retention levels, indicating a more refined and dynamic risk exposure management approach compared to the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "FedEx’s self‑insurance reserves for property and cargo loss are estimated using actuarial techniques that weigh historical loss experience, current claim‑frequency and severity trends, and projected exposure levels; the resulting reserves are recorded on a gross basis with receivables for third‑party coverage.  Between 2022 and 2023 the company continued to rely on these actuarial estimates, but it refined its risk‑exposure management by tightening underwriting assumptions and adjusting the severity assumptions used in the reserve calculations, which can shift reserves by roughly $280 million for a 5 % change in severity.  The evolution reflects an ongoing effort to align reserve levels with the company’s broader fleet‑modernization and network‑capacity strategies, ensuring that self‑insurance accruals remain appropriate amid changing claim environments and aircraft retirements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, General Motors reported indefinitely reinvested basis differences in non-consolidated China joint ventures of $3.4 billion. By 2024, this amount decreased to $1.4 billion. This significant reduction indicates a shift in GM's reinvestment strategy, suggesting that a portion of these previously indefinitely reinvested earnings may no longer be considered permanently reinvested, potentially signaling a strategic move to repatriate or reallocate capital from these ventures.",
      "llm_answer": "The basis differences in GM’s investments in non‑consolidated China joint ventures remained essentially unchanged at about $3.4 billion in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2024 (the filing shows $3.4 billion at both dates). This stability indicates that GM has not significantly increased its reinvestment in these entities; rather, it continues to treat the basis differences as indefinitely reinvested, with no material change in the amount of tax‑related deferred liabilities.",

      "question": "How has FedEx's consideration of healthcare inflation in its self-insurance accruals evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this suggest about the company's risk assessment approach?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx explicitly stated that healthcare inflation was one of the key judgmental factors in estimating self-insurance reserves, indicating its importance in liability projections. In 2023, while the company continued to include healthcare inflation as part of its estimation methodology, it added language emphasizing that it believes its recorded obligations are 'consistently measured and appropriate,' suggesting a more confident stance in its risk assessment. This evolution indicates a shift from a cautious acknowledgment of uncertainty in 2022 to a more assured posture in 2023 regarding the impact of healthcare inflation on self-insurance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, FedEx’s self‑insurance accruals grew from $4.5 billion to $5.6 billion, and a 5 % change in assumed claim severity would alter reserves by roughly $230 million (2022) or $280 million (2024), indicating that the company’s risk‑assessment framework places considerable weight on healthcare‑cost volatility and other claim‑frequency factors when setting its self‑insurance reserves. This evolution reflects a systematic, actuarially‑driven approach that continuously updates estimates as medical inflation and claim trends evolve.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums outside the United States could negatively impact its financial results. In 2023, the company noted that premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the respective countries. In 2024, IBM repeated the same language, indicating that the risk remained consistent and no material change occurred in the exposure or the underlying factors affecting the premiums. Therefore, the potential financial impact of these premiums remained stable between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures, the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations has remained consistent between 2023 and 2024. IBM explicitly states that its results could be negatively impacted by \"premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States\" and notes that \"premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue\" (IBM_10k_2023.pdf, page 10; IBM_10k_2024.pdf, page 11). The company continues to monitor pension funding risks and the potential for adverse impacts from these premiums, with no indication of a material change in the nature or magnitude of this risk between the two years. The disclosures confirm that this risk factor remains a consistent concern in both the 2023 and 2024 filings.",

The increase in the percentage was primarily due to changes in product mix, including decreases in Veklury product sales globally, which were offset by increased sales in HIV and oncology products, along with shifts in payer mix. Specifically, rebates and chargebacks rose from $12.6 billion (30% of gross sales) in 2022 to $14.3 billion (33% of gross sales) in 2023, contributing to the overall increase in deductions.",

      "question": "How did RTX's financial relationship with Pratt & Whitney evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of asset valuation and credit risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX held a direct stake in Pratt & Whitney valued at $1,563 million as of December 31, 2021, with no significant credit loss allowance directly tied to the segment. By 2024, the relationship had shifted from a direct stake to a dependency relationship, with a notable increase in credit risk exposure as evidenced by the $491 million allowance for expected credit losses, driven by a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney in the fourth quarter of 2024. This marks a significant transformation from a stable asset holding to a risk-influenced dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, RTX’s financial relationship with Pratt & Whitney evolved primarily through changes in goodwill valuation and credit risk exposure.  The 2024 goodwill table shows Pratt & Whitney’s goodwill held steady at $1,563 million (down only from $1,563 million in 2023 after a $676 million reduction tied to divestitures), and the company performed annual impairment testing, concluding no impairment was required, indicating stable asset valuation.  Credit risk exposure is reflected in the allowance for expected credit losses on accounts receivable, which rose to $289 million in 2024 from $316 million in 2023, driven by a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney that increased reserves, while the allowance for expected credit losses on contract assets also grew due to that same event.  Thus, while goodwill remained stable, the allowance for credit losses expanded, signaling heightened credit risk exposure for the Pratt & Whitney segment.",

In 2023, Gross Dollar Volume growth slowed to 12% on a local currency basis, yet still supported a 13% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis.

This GDV growth was a primary driver of the 13% net revenue growth in 2023, mirroring the 21% local‑currency GDV growth reported for 2021, which together accounted for the bulk of the revenue expansion in each respective year.",

      "original_answer": "The sales per retail square foot increased from $604.74 in fiscal 2021 to $627.17 in fiscal 2022, representing a 3.7% growth. However, in fiscal 2023, this metric declined by 3.6% to $604.55. This reversal indicates that while the company was able to improve its in-store sales productivity in fiscal 2022, that momentum did not carry into fiscal 2023, suggesting a potential challenge in sustaining productivity gains.",
      "llm_answer": "The 3.6% decline in sales per retail square foot from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023—following a 3.7% increase in fiscal 2021—indicates that Home Depot’s in‑store sales productivity has turned negative after a period of growth, signaling weakening sales efficiency per square foot of retail space. This downward trend suggests that the company’s existing store formats are generating less revenue per unit of space, likely due to softer comparable sales and market conditions.",

This indicates a significant strengthening of Philip Morris's position in the Heated Tobacco Units segment over the two-year period.",

This growth, coupled with a stable total market size, indicates a strengthening competitive position in the European heated tobacco market, particularly as PMI's regional HTU market share rose to 10.0% (up 0.9 pp) while cigarette share declined slightly to 30.0% (from 30.3%). However, the document notes that this growth occurred amid challenges like the EU's flavor ban and regulatory pressures on HTPs, suggesting PMI is successfully expanding its heated tobacco footprint despite market headwinds.",

According to the 2023 filing, this represents the company's 'estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs' as of December 31, 2023. The 2023 report also explains that the company uses an actuarial process to estimate these liabilities, considering factors like time from service date to claim processing, seasonal variances, and healthcare cost trends. This indicates that the company's obligation for unpaid medical costs grew year-over-year, and the estimation methodology remained consistent and centrally controlled.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, KO reported net operating revenues of $45.754 billion, reflecting steady growth from $43.004 billion in 2022 and $38.655 billion in 2021. However, the 2024 filing highlights several operational and integration-related risks that could threaten this growth trajectory. Specifically, KO notes that challenges in integrating acquired businesses—such as delays in realizing cost synergies, difficulties in extending internal controls, and potential increases in costs due to integration issues—could negatively affect financial results. Additionally, risks related to third-party service providers failing to meet commitments, labor unrest affecting manufacturing and bottling operations, and the inability to offset cost increases through pricing or productivity initiatives all pose direct threats to maintaining revenue momentum. These risks, if realized, could materially reduce or even reverse the upward trend in net operating revenues observed in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the specific operational and integration-related risks identified in 2024 that could threaten the sustainability of KO's 2023 revenue growth include: (1) **Disruption of supply chain and input costs** – sustained or significant disruptions in manufacturing or sourcing of ingredients, packaging, energy, or transportation due to factors like commodity price volatility, climate events, geopolitical instability, or supplier concentration could increase costs and interrupt product supply, thereby reducing net operating revenues; (2) **Inability to successfully integrate acquired businesses or realize synergies** – challenges in integrating acquired brands, bottling operations, or joint ventures (e.g., BodyArmor acquisition, Vietnam bottling refranchising) may prevent the anticipated cost savings or revenue growth from materializing, directly impacting future net operating revenues; (3) **Failure to manage productivity initiatives and digital transformation** – if productivity programs (e.g., North America restructuring) cause operational disruptions, morale issues, or ineffective cost controls, or if digitalization efforts (e.g., AI, automation) are not successfully implemented, the company may miss revenue growth targets and face higher costs that erode profitability. These risks collectively threaten the sustainability of growth by potentially increasing costs, reducing sales volume, or diminishing the anticipated benefits of strategic initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, the Core Routing portfolio contributed to flat revenue in routed optical networking, with growth specifically noted in the Cisco 8000 series offerings and the webscale provider market. However, by fiscal 2024, the Core Routing portfolio was part of an overall revenue decline in the Networking product category, which fell by 15% ($5.3 billion), including a specific decline in enterprise routing. This shift indicates a deterioration in the Core Routing portfolio's ability to support revenue growth in the Networking category, despite pockets of strength like SD-WAN.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 the Networking product category—Cisco’s core routing, switching, wireless and server portfolio—saw revenue fall 15% (a $5.3 billion decline), driven by weaker demand in campus and data‑center switching, enterprise routing (though offset by SD‑WAN growth), and Wi‑Fi‑6/Meraki wireless products. This contraction signals that, despite the broader Networking segment’s share of total product revenue slipping from 58.0% in 2023 to 56.9% in 2024, Cisco’s overall product mix is shifting toward higher‑margin areas such as Security and Observability, underscoring a strategic evolution in which traditional core routing revenue is diminishing as a share of the company’s growth engine.",

By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had shifted to a positive contribution of 1.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, and 1.0% in 2023 compared to 2022.

The consistent growth suggests that Observability remained a strategic growth area for Cisco during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Cisco's Observability revenue increased by 27% year-over-year in fiscal 2024 (from $661 million to $837 million), driven by growth in its ThousandEyes offering and the contribution from the Observability Suite and Splunk. This growth indicates a strong upward trajectory for Cisco's Observability segment, reflecting successful expansion of its network assurance and analytics portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "Danaher's core sales growth declined significantly from 23.0% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2024, indicating a substantial slowdown in organic growth performance. In 2022, the company demonstrated strong non-GAAP core sales growth of 23.0%, reflecting robust performance across its business units. By 2024, this growth had slowed to just 3.0%, suggesting a marked decrease in the company's ability to generate organic revenue growth. This shift highlights a notable change in the company's market dynamics or operational performance over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Danaher’s core sales growth in the Life Sciences segment declined sharply: it was 23.0 % in 2021, fell to a 2.0 % decline in 2024, and the “core sales growth including Cytiva” dropped from 25.0 % in 2021 to a negative 2.0 % in 2024. This trend shows that organic growth has weakened significantly, indicating that Danaher’s core sales performance has deteriorated rather than improved over the period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016 through 2021 totaled $1,439 million. In 2023, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident years increased to $2,055 million. This significant rise indicates a lengthening of the claims settlement timeline, suggesting that AIG is taking longer to settle claims, which could imply either more complex claims or a more conservative approach to claims resolution. This also points to potential reserving implications, as the company may have initially underestimated the ultimate payout for these accident years.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, AIG’s cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016‑2021 declined from $24,207 million to $24,120 million – a reduction of about $87 million (‑0.36%).  This modest decrease, together with the continued emergence of unfavorable development in recent years, indicates that the company’s claims are settling more slowly than in prior periods and that its reserving practices have become more conservative, especially for newer accident years where expected loss ratios are given greater weight and development patterns remain uncertain.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the impact of currency exchange rates on reported sales was a 2.0% decrease compared to the prior year. By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had decreased reported sales by 0.5% year-over-year. This indicates that DHR's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations had lessened by 2024 compared to 2022, although the U.S. dollar's strengthening against other major currencies still had a modest negative impact on sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates on reported sales shifted from a positive contribution (a 1.0% increase in 2022, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar) to a negative drag (a 0.5% decrease in 2024, due to a strengthening U.S. dollar). This indicates Danaher's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has become more pronounced as a headwind, particularly in 2024, though the overall effect on reported sales was partially offset by other factors like acquisitions and core sales trends. The company's core sales metrics, which exclude currency effects, show underlying growth trends separate from these currency-driven fluctuations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel had already completed the divestiture of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, indicating a strategic exit from this segment as part of its capital allocation strategy that prioritized investment in core IDM 2.0 initiatives and away from non-strategic assets. By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as part of Intel's active operations, and instead, the company emphasized winding down other non-core businesses like Intel Optane, further signaling a sharpened focus on strategic areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and its internal foundry model. This evolution reflects a broader strategic shift toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing, while divesting or discontinuing businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's strategic involvement in its NAND memory business evolved significantly between 2022 and 2023, marked by the exit from the NAND market through the sale of its NAND business to SK Hynix in 2020 (announced in 2020 but completed by 2022), which allowed the company to fully divest from memory manufacturing and focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy. This divestiture, coupled with the winding down of Intel Optane in 2022, reflects a deliberate shift away from non-core, low-margin memory businesses toward high-growth areas like AI accelerators, foundry services (IFS), and software ecosystems, as evidenced by the company's emphasis on \"growth businesses\" and capital allocation priorities in its 2023 10-K. This strategic pivot indicates a broader capital allocation focus on investing in high-margin, future-oriented capabilities—such as advanced process technology, foundry expansion (with $20B+ R&D and capital spending), and AI/silicon photonics—while exiting lower-growth segments, signaling a clear prioritization of long-term competitiveness in semiconductors and software over legacy memory operations.",

      "question": "How did the spin-off of GE Vernova impact GE's deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE reported deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses of $1.0 billion, of which $0.6 billion was associated with losses from discontinued operations, including GE Vernova. By 2024, this figure had decreased to $0.5 billion, with only an insignificant amount tied to GE Vernova. This reduction reflects the tax implications of the spin-off, as GE no longer retained the associated tax benefits from the spun-off entity. The change indicates a significant shift in GE’s deferred tax position following the separation of GE Vernova, reducing the company’s future tax obligations tied to those non-U.S. losses.",
      "llm_answer": "The spin‑off of GE Vernova reduced the amount of non‑U.S. net operating loss carryforwards that remained on GE’s balance sheet, lowering the balance of deferred tax assets tied to those foreign NOLs from about $1.0 billion at the end of 2023 to roughly $0.5 billion at the end of 2024. This reduction reflects the transfer of the foreign NOLs (and associated valuation allowances) to the newly independent Vernova entity.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, currency exchange rates had a negative impact of 1.5% on total sales growth, whereas in 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates shifted to a positive contribution of 1.5% in one period and remained positive at 1.0% in the subsequent period. This indicates a reversal in how exchange rate movements affected the company's reported sales, suggesting a change in the company's geographic revenue mix or hedging strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 the company’s exposure to foreign‑exchange fluctuations shifted from a modest tailwind to a headwind. In 2022 the impact of currency translation was essentially neutral on reported sales growth, but by 2024 a stronger U.S. dollar reduced reported sales by about 0.5 % (and by roughly 1.5 % in the Diagnostics segment). At the same time, the company’s operating‑margin trends show increasing sensitivity to FX: margins fell 140 basis points in 2024 versus 2023, with the decline attributed in part to the dilutive effect of acquired businesses and foreign‑exchange headwinds. This indicates that while the firm still benefits from favorable currency moves in some periods, its overall revenue and profitability are now more vulnerable to adverse exchange‑rate shifts.",

By 2024, GE continued to disclose financial impacts related to GE HealthCare, specifically noting that $0.6 billion of non-U.S. net operating losses associated with discontinued operations at the end of 2023 were reduced to an insignificant amount by the end of 2024. This reflects a significant decrease in the financial exposure or tax implications tied to the previously spun-off GE HealthCare business within GE's consolidated disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of GE HealthCare in GE’s consolidated financial disclosures has shifted markedly between 2023 and 2024. In 2023 the company continued to disclose the spin‑off of GE HealthCare as a discontinued operation, noting cash‑flow impacts and the need to update forward‑looking statements about the transaction. By 2024, the spin‑off is reflected in the cash‑flow tables as a completed separation, with cash received from the disposition of retained GE HealthCare interests and related financing activities (e.g., debt issuance by the spun‑off entity) now reported under discontinued‑operations cash flows, and the forward‑looking discussion of the spin‑off is largely absent, indicating that the financial impact has been largely resolved.",

      "question": "How has the risk profile of American Express's Discount Revenue evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to merchant surcharging practices and airline merchant exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Discount Revenue was described as American Express’s largest revenue source, primarily earned from transactions at merchants accepting American Express cards, with no specific emphasis on surcharging or airline-related risks. By 2024, the company explicitly noted that surcharging and differential acceptance practices in regions like Australia, Canada, and the EU were materially impacting merchant discount rates and card usage. Additionally, in 2024, the company highlighted a 7% exposure of worldwide billed business to airline merchants, introducing credit risk if airlines fail to deliver services after payments are made. This indicates a shift from viewing Discount Revenue as a stable core income stream to recognizing it as increasingly vulnerable to external pressures such as regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and sector-specific credit risks.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, American Express's Discount Revenue faced evolving risk from merchant surcharging and airline merchant exposure, particularly as surcharging practices intensified in jurisdictions like Australia, Canada, and the EU, where merchants began applying higher or differential surcharges to Amex cards compared to Visa/Mastercard. This pressure, coupled with airline merchant exposure—where Amex bears loss if airlines cease operations or fail to deliver purchased tickets—has materially threatened discount revenue growth, especially as airline spending represented ~7% of worldwide billed business in 2024. Additionally, the company’s efforts to expand merchant acceptance and offset rate erosion through new partnerships and products (e.g., debit cards) remain vulnerable to competitive pricing pressures and regulatory shifts, potentially undermining its ability to sustain discount revenue.",

During this period, the gross margin contribution from Products slightly increased from $114,728 million in 2022 to $108,803 million in 2023, while the gross margin from Services grew significantly from $56,054 million in 2022 to $60,345 million in 2023.

      "question": "How has Medtronic's strategic emphasis within the Medical Surgical Portfolio evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its approach to innovation and market expansion?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Medtronic emphasized leveraging its pipeline to 'win market share' by bringing 'inventive and disruptive technology' to large healthcare opportunities, with a focus on increasing global product adoption through local presence and scale. By 2024, the company's language shifted to leveraging its pipeline to 'accelerate revenue growth,' maintaining a focus on innovation and patient-centric solutions but with a more explicit emphasis on financial outcomes. While the Medical Surgical Portfolio remained a reportable segment in both years, the change in phrasing indicates a strategic evolution from market share acquisition to revenue generation through innovation.",
      "llm_answer": "Medtronic’s Medical Surgical Portfolio has shifted from a broad, diversified focus toward a more innovation‑driven, market‑expanding strategy between 2022 and 2024.  The company emphasizes accelerating growth through a robust pipeline, leveraging AI and data analytics to create disruptive therapies, and expanding adoption of its products globally—particularly in emerging markets—while empowering its operating units to be more agile and competitive.  This strategic emphasis is reflected in its 2022 and 2024 10‑K filings, which highlight pipeline‑driven revenue growth, AI‑enabled real‑time therapy personalization, and efforts to increase market share through both new product launches and broader commercial reach.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PEP reported $5 million in amortization of intangible assets related to the AMESA segment, indicating an ongoing operational presence. However, in 2023, PEP disclosed a $5 million charge related to the AMESA segment under 'COVID-19 charges,' suggesting that the company's exposure had shifted from long-term asset amortization to short-term costs associated with the pandemic. This reflects a change in the nature of PEP’s involvement or financial impact from the AMESA segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures, PepsiCo's financial exposure to the AMESA segment evolved significantly between 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the company recorded a $6 million pre-tax impairment charge related to AMESA (primarily from the Pioneer Foods acquisition), and in 2023, it recorded a $13 million pre-tax credit (with $9 million reducing SG&A and $4 million reducing cost of sales) representing adjustments to previously recorded amounts. This shift indicates a reduction in direct impairment exposure, though the segment's amortization of intangible assets remained relatively stable ($3 million in 2023 vs. $4 million in 2022).",

      "question": "How did GE's financial obligations related to GE Vernova's credit support arrangements evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of indemnification responsibilities and deferred tax asset implications?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE disclosed that upon spin-off, GE Vernova would be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support-related payments, with an expectation that the fair value of this obligation would not be significant due to the low probability of loss. GE's exposure under these credit support arrangements could not be reasonably estimated, but contractual maturities of $15 billion each for Power and Renewable Energy segments within five years were highlighted. By 2024, the deferred tax assets associated with losses in discontinued operations, which include GE Vernova, decreased from $0.6 billion in 2023 to an insignificant amount, suggesting a reduction in the tax basis liability linked to these indemnifications. This indicates that the spin-off led to a material shift in how these obligations were accounted for, with GE no longer carrying the same level of tax-related exposure tied to GE Vernova's past credit support arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K pages, GE's financial obligations related to GE Vernova's credit support arrangements evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding indemnification and deferred tax asset implications. The 2024 filing (page 17) states that GE Vernova will pay a quarterly fee to GE for ongoing credit support and will be obligated to indemnify GE for any credit support payments GE must make post-spin-off, with the fair value of this indemnification obligation deemed not significant due to low loss probability. Regarding deferred tax assets, page 20 notes that GE's global and diversified operations allow for tax planning strategies to recover deferred tax assets, with $0.5 billion recorded for non-U.S. net operating losses (net of allowances) as of December 31, 2024, though this is not directly tied to GE Vernova's credit arrangements. The credit support obligations themselves are expected to total approximately $65 billion post-spin-off, with $33 billion and $32 billion tied to Power and Renewable Energy segments respectively, but no specific deferred tax asset impact related to these obligations is detailed in the provided pages.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple noted the risk of a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs' due to noncompliance with payment card industry data security standards, which could 'materially adversely affect the Company's business.' By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize not only the risk of increased costs but also the growing regulatory and compliance burden Apple faces globally, including 'an increasing number of federal, state and international laws' that heighten the potential for penalties. This indicates a shift from a general risk acknowledgment in 2022 to a more pronounced concern over the expanding regulatory environment in 2023, which likely exacerbates the financial exposure related to transaction costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The potential financial impact of payment‑card transaction costs has grown from 2022 to 2023, expanding both the magnitude of the risk and the associated compliance‑related cost exposure. In 2022 the filing highlighted that failure to meet payment‑card industry data‑security standards could trigger “significant fees or fines” and raise transaction costs, while by 2023 the discussion emphasizes that such failures could “materially adversely affect the Company's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition,” underscoring a heightened and more consequential risk profile.",

However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth in 2022 to stagnation in 2024 suggests a decline in the momentum of iPhone sales performance over time, potentially indicating market saturation or reduced consumer demand for new model releases during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth trajectory of iPhone net sales shows a peak in 2022 ($205,489 million) followed by a modest decline to $201,183 million in 2024, indicating that iPhone revenue has plateaued and is now essentially flat year‑over‑year.

In the 2023 filing, Apple maintained that potential penalties include 'significant fees or fines,' but added that the company could also experience a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards.' This evolution indicates a more detailed articulation of the financial and operational consequences tied to noncompliance in 2023 compared to 2022.",

Both years stress that failure to comply can trigger investigations, fines, reputational harm and material adverse effects, but the 2023 text specifically ties non‑compliance to increased payment‑card transaction costs and the possible loss of the ability to process payments.",

By 2024, the full-year sales for the Energy & Transportation segment were $28.854 billion, showing a 3% increase compared to the prior year, 2023.

In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the same metric positively contributed $402 million to licensing revenues. This represents a significant shift from a negative to a positive influence, with a total change in direction and magnitude of $701 million over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G‑based multimode products on QTL licensing revenues rose sharply from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, contributing $308 million of the $266 million increase in licensing revenue in 2024 (after accounting for a $90 million decline in revenues per unit and a $68 million drop from the ending of an upfront fee). In fiscal 2023, that same factor added roughly $402 million to licensing revenue, reflecting a $402 million increase in estimated sales of multimode products. Thus, the shift was an approximate $400 million boost in licensing revenue between 2023 and 2024, driven primarily by higher estimated sales of those multimode products.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the filing explicitly stated that 'our ability to return capital to shareholders [...] may be limited [...] by our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' In 2023, this language was expanded to include the phrase 'our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations [...] and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' This evolution indicates a more nuanced disclosure that retains the prior year's emphasis on preferred stock dividends as a limiting factor but adds a broader regulatory and governance context. This suggests the company is reinforcing the conditional nature of capital returns, particularly tied to preferred stock obligations, while emphasizing board discretion and regulatory constraints.",
      "llm_answer": "The company’s disclosures show that in 2022 the preferred‑stock dividend language was included in a broader risk‑factor list that emphasized “our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock” as one of many potential adverse factors. By 2023 the same language appears in a more concise, standalone risk‑factor statement that directly links the ability to return capital to shareholders to “the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations, including those governing capital and capital planning, applicable provisions of Delaware law and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.” This tighter framing suggests a more explicit focus on capital‑return constraints and a heightened awareness of regulatory limits on dividend and share‑repurchase decisions. Consequently, the evolution indicates that BNY Mellon is placing greater emphasis on ensuring that its shareholder‑distribution plans are aligned with capital‑adequacy requirements and Board discretion, reflecting a cautious approach to managing capital returns amid regulatory and liquidity considerations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Altria excluded NPM Adjustment Items from its adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate forecasts, noting that these items could be significant, unusual, or infrequent, and difficult to predict. The company did not provide a GAAP reconciliation for these exclusions. By 2023, Altria explicitly disclosed the financial impact of NPM Adjustment Items in its operating results, reporting a $29 million impact in Smokeable Products, which was factored into the reconciliation between reported OCI and adjusted OCI. This represents a shift from exclusion to explicit quantification within operating performance metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Altria's treatment of NPM Adjustment Items in its adjusted operating results shifted from a $63 million reduction in 2022 to a $29 million reduction in 2023, reflecting a smaller downward adjustment to adjusted OCI. This reduction directly impacted adjusted OCI, which declined slightly by $16 million (0.1%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to lower shipment volume, higher per-unit settlement charges, and increased costs, partially offset by higher pricing. The adjusted OCI margin improved marginally from 59.0% in 2022 to 59.9% in 2023, indicating that while NPM Adjustment Items continued to be excluded from adjusted results, their reduced magnitude had a less pronounced negative effect on adjusted performance relative to the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom allocated $110 million to intangible assets primarily within its infrastructure software segment through acquisitions. By fiscal year 2024, Broadcom significantly enhanced this segment through the acquisition of VMware, a leading provider of multi-cloud services, in a transaction valued at approximately $84.2 billion (including both cash and stock). This represents a major strategic shift from smaller-scale asset acquisitions to a transformative acquisition aimed at strengthening Broadcom’s infrastructure software capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024, Broadcom’s Infrastructure Software segment shifted from a focus on expanding its security portfolio via the 2019 acquisition of Symantec’s enterprise‑security business to a broader, cloud‑centric strategy anchored by the 2023 purchase of VMware. The Symantec deal (completed in 2019) added a large suite of cybersecurity products and generated $1.6 B of net revenue in 2020, while the VMware merger in late 2023 added a leading multi‑cloud platform and is expected to enhance Broadcom’s infrastructure‑software capabilities and drive future growth. Consequently, acquisition activity moved from primarily buying security‑focused assets to acquiring a comprehensive cloud‑infrastructure vendor, reshaping the segment’s strategic emphasis toward cloud‑based, mission‑critical software solutions.",

      "original_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue significantly declined from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, Paxlovid was part of a broader set of risks related to the company's efforts to develop and commercialize COVID-19 products, including Comirnaty, with specific concerns about reduced demand, inventory write-offs, and challenges transitioning to a commercial market. By 2024, Paxlovid's global revenue dropped by 57% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand globally, especially in China, where there was a non-recurrent surge in COVID-19 infections in early 2023, and a transition to an out-of-pocket market in the second quarter of that year. Additionally, the global market for COVID-19 treatments had become more endemic and seasonal, leading to reduced demand and lower contractual deliveries in most international markets.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue declined significantly from 2023 to 2024, with the document indicating a $4,452 million operational growth from Paxlovid in 2024 but a $5,905 million decline in U.S. revenue and $1,453 million decline in international revenue compared to 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by the transition of Paxlovid to the commercial market, reduced contractual deliveries in international markets, and lower demand globally, particularly in China following the non-recurrent surge in COVID-19 infections. The document also notes that the transition to commercial markets and the expiration of pandemic-related demand contributed to the revenue decline, with Paxlovid revenue being further impacted by the $3.5 billion non-cash revenue reversal recorded in Q4 2023 that was partially reversed in Q1 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software segment was described as generating a portion of the company's net revenue, with software solutions that enabled customers to manage and secure applications across various platforms. However, the segment was not yet a central strategic focus, as evidenced by the pending $61 billion acquisition of VMware, which was expected to close in fiscal year 2023. By fiscal year 2024, the relationship had transformed significantly: Broadcom had completed the VMware acquisition on November 22, 2023, and integrated VMware's infrastructure software capabilities into its portfolio. The acquisition involved a financial commitment of approximately $30,788 million in cash and $53,398 million in Broadcom stock, marking a substantial increase in both strategic emphasis and financial investment in the Infrastructure Software segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal years 2022 and 2024, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software segment underwent a strategic transformation anchored by its $61 billion acquisition of VMware, which was completed in November 2023 and integrated into its operations by fiscal year 2024. This acquisition marked a significant strategic pivot, expanding Broadcom's infrastructure software footprint and contributing to the segment's financial profile, as evidenced by the $53.4 billion in stock issued and $750 million in assumed equity awards related to the deal. Financially, the segment's commitment was underscored by substantial investments, including $7,176 million in common stock repurchases and $9.8 billion in dividends paid in fiscal year 2024, reflecting ongoing capital allocation priorities. The integration of VMware, which added $53.4 billion in stock-based consideration and $750 million in assumed equity awards, solidified Broadcom's positioning as a diversified infrastructure technology leader, with infrastructure software now a core growth driver alongside its semiconductor solutions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company reported a provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $ (1,115) million, reflecting a negative tax expense. By 2024, this figure had significantly shifted to just $ (28) million, indicating a substantial reduction in the tax benefit. This change suggests a major improvement in the company's tax position or a shift in taxable income between these years.",
      "llm_answer": "The provision/(benefit) for taxes on income shifted dramatically from a $3.3 billion expense in 2022 to a $1.1 billion benefit in 2023, and then to a $28 million benefit in 2024, reflecting a tax rate that moved from 9.6 % in 2022 to (105.4 %) in 2023 and (0.4 %) in 2024. This evolution indicates that Pfizer’s tax position improved substantially over the period, moving from a relatively high effective tax rate to a near‑break‑even or slightly negative effective tax rate, likely driven by tax law changes, discrete tax benefits, and the impact of global minimum‑tax legislation.",

By 2024, global Humira sales had decreased by 37%, primarily due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in early 2023. This marks a significant shift from growth to decline, reflecting the impact of market exclusivity expiration and intensified biosimilar pressure.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2021 and 2024, global Humira sales declined sharply—down 4% in 2021, then falling 37% in 2024—driven primarily by the loss of U.S. exclusivity in January 2023, which unleashed direct biosimilar competition and caused a 41% drop in U.S. sales; internationally, sales fell 13% in 2024 due to continued biosimilar pressure. The principal factors behind this downturn were the entry of biosimilars after patent expiry and the resulting market share erosion across both U.S. and global markets.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, AMD disclosed 'anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls' as a standalone risk factor without explicit linkage to strategic initiatives. By 2023, the disclosure expanded to frame these same information security costs within the context of broader strategic efforts, specifically mentioning the 'expected implications from the development of the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI.' This indicates a shift from viewing information security costs purely as an operational expense to positioning them as part of a strategic response to technological and regulatory trends.",
      "llm_answer": "AMD's disclosures on information security costs shifted markedly between 2022 and 2023, reflecting a strategic reframing tied to AI and regulatory priorities. In the 2022 filing, cybersecurity was presented as a standalone risk factor (Item 1A) and a brief note on \"anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls\" within forward-looking statements, without explicit linkage to business initiatives. By contrast, the 2023 filing (particularly in the \"Our Strategy\" section and MD&A) explicitly integrates AI-related security investments into broader technological ambitions, stating that \"AI capabilities are central to products across our markets\" and that recent acquisitions (e.g., Mipsology, Nod) expanded AI software capabilities to \"lower barriers of entry for customers through developer tools, libraries, and models.\" Crucially, the 2023 filing positions information security enhancements as part of enabling AI deployment and meeting regulatory demands, framing costs as investments to support AI growth and adaptive computing—moving beyond generic risk mitigation to align with strategic pillars like \"adaptive computing\" and \"AI product portfolios.\" This evolution reflects a deliberate pivot from viewing security costs as a compliance burden to presenting them as foundational to AMD's competitive strategy in AI-driven markets.",

By 2023, freight revenues decreased 3% to $22.6 billion, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenues and a negative mix of traffic, such as decreased lumber shipments and increased short-haul rock shipments, despite core pricing gains. Fuel surcharge revenues declined from $3.7 billion in 2022 to $3.0 billion in 2023, reflecting a 15% decrease in fuel prices and lower volume. These changes indicate a shift from growth driven by broad-based volume and pricing in 2022 to a contraction influenced by fuel and mix effects in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AbbVie spent $1.4 billion on Other Acquisitions and Investments, while in 2024, this amount increased significantly to $3.0 billion. This indicates a strategic shift toward more aggressive investment and acquisition activity, aligning with AbbVie's broader efforts to expand its portfolio through external innovation and partnerships. The increase also coincides with major acquisitions like ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics in 2024, which required significant financing and suggest a more active approach to portfolio transformation.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie's spending on Other Acquisitions and Investments increased significantly from $1.2 billion in 2022 to $18.5 billion in 2024 (including $18.5 billion for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics acquisitions), reflecting a strategic shift toward large‑scale bolt‑on acquisitions to expand its oncology and neuroscience pipelines. This heightened investment underscores a focus on broadening its product portfolio and driving future growth through targeted M&A activity.",

      "question": "How did AMD's inventory carrying value and its methodology for estimating inventory adjustments evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about the scale and complexity of its inventory management?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD reported a net inventory balance of $1,955 million as of December 25, 2021, and described its process of adjusting inventory carrying value based on historical and forecasted demand, with a focus on recent historical activity. By 2023, the net inventory balance had increased significantly to $4,351 million as of December 30, 2022. Additionally, AMD's language shifted from 'inventory carrying value adjustments' to 'inventory excess and obsolescence reserves,' indicating a more refined and possibly more conservative approach to inventory valuation. This evolution suggests a growing complexity in inventory management, likely due to increased inventory holdings and forward-looking risk assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMD's inventory carrying value decreased from $1,955 million to $4,351 million, reflecting a substantial increase in net inventory balance. The company continues to adjust inventory to the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value by reviewing on‑hand quantities against forecasted demand and considering recent historical activity, while also assessing excess and obsolescence reserves using assumptions about future sales quantities, pricing, and product life cycles—assumptions that are forward‑looking and subject to market volatility. This evolution underscores the scale and complexity of AMD's inventory management, which relies on significant judgment and external market factors to determine reserves and adjustments.",

      "original_answer": "Broadcom's strategic focus in the Infrastructure Software Segment significantly evolved from fiscal year 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company completed four acquisitions totaling $245 million, with $164 million allocated to goodwill and $110 million to intangible assets, indicating a continued investment in expanding the segment through smaller, strategic purchases. By 2024, Broadcom had made a transformative leap by acquiring VMware for approximately $84,186 million in total consideration (comprising $30,788 million in cash and $53,398 million in Broadcom common stock). This acquisition was explicitly aimed at enhancing the infrastructure software capabilities, signaling a major strategic shift from incremental growth via small acquisitions to a bold consolidation move that redefined the segment’s scope and market positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided documents, Broadcom's strategic focus in the Infrastructure Software Segment evolved significantly between fiscal years 2022 and 2024 through major acquisition activity aimed at expanding its infrastructure software capabilities. In 2022, Broadcom completed the $10.7 billion acquisition of Symantec's Enterprise Security Business to bolster its security portfolio, and later finalized the $61 billion acquisition of VMware in November 2023 (closing in fiscal year 2024), which was explicitly intended to \"enhance our infrastructure software capabilities\" and integrate VMware's multi-cloud services into Broadcom's offerings. This strategic shift is underscored by the inclusion of VMware's results in the infrastructure software segment starting November 22, 2023, and the allocation of $53.4 billion in Broadcom stock toward the transaction, reflecting a decisive pivot toward infrastructure software as a core growth driver.",

      "question": "How did AMD's licensing gain from the THATIC joint venture evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about milestone achievements and royalty income during these periods?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD recognized $102 million in licensing gain from a milestone achievement and royalty income under the THATIC JV agreement. In contrast, in 2023, the licensing gain from royalty income was significantly lower at $34 million, with no mention of milestone-related gains. This indicates a decline in licensing revenue, primarily due to the absence of milestone achievements in 2023 despite continued royalty income.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMD's licensing gain from the THATIC joint venture shifted dramatically from $102 million (primarily a milestone achievement and royalty income) in 2022 to $34 million in 2023, reflecting the realization of that milestone in the earlier year and subsequent royalty collections. This change indicates that the milestone was achieved in 2022, after which royalty income was received, while in 2023 the company recognized only ongoing royalty earnings, resulting in a lower overall licensing gain. Consequently, the milestone-driven gain was a one‑time boost in 2022, and subsequent periods reflect a steady but modest royalty stream.",

In 2024, the same factors were cited—increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—again contributing positively, with the same offsetting effect from increased 2% rewards. The specific contribution magnitudes were consistent across both years, indicating a sustained trend in margin performance drivers within the Canadian segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Canadian segment’s gross‑margin percentage rose in 2024 versus 2023, driven by higher core‑merchandise margins and stronger warehouse‑ancillary and other‑business contributions, while the U.S. segment’s margin moved in line with consolidated results.

Simultaneously, Pfizer received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) from the JV, which it repaid in July 2022 after receiving £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion. By 2024, this indemnification had been terminated in conjunction with the demerger, and there was no indication of ongoing loan obligations or new financing arrangements with the JV.

Upon receipt of dividends from the JV in July 2022 and the subsequent repayment of the JV’s loans, Pfizer’s indemnification obligation was terminated. Additionally, Pfizer recorded a $945 million gain from the sale of its remaining stake in Haleon (the Consumer Healthcare JV) in 2024, which reflects the termination of its equity method accounting and the transfer of its investment to a readily determinable fair value investment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, aircraft manufacturing revenue was $7 million, as disclosed in the financial breakdown. In 2024, this revenue stream increased, driven by additional aircraft deliveries, particularly the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. However, this growth came with added costs due to supplier quality escapes and late deliveries of components, which impacted operational efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial disclosures, revenue from aircraft manufacturing (within the Aerospace segment) increased by $2,101 million in 2024, driven by additional aircraft deliveries (including the entry into service of the G700 aircraft), but operating earnings only rose $213 million due to higher costs from supplier quality issues and late component deliveries. The segment's operating margin declined by 70 basis points in 2024, reflecting these added costs despite revenue growth. For 2025, the company expects Aerospace revenue to reach approximately $12.7 billion with an operating margin of about 13.7%.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal disclosed that retail e-commerce sales were among several macroeconomic factors influencing transaction and credit losses, specifically affecting the funding mix and consumer spending behavior. By 2024, the company placed a more structured and explicit emphasis on retail e-commerce sales as part of the macroeconomic forecasts used in its consumer loss models, particularly for the revolving credit portfolio. This shift indicates a more direct integration of retail e-commerce trends into the credit risk modeling process. The 2024 allowance for consumer loans receivable was $341 million, with models now explicitly incorporating forecasted retail e-commerce sales sourced externally using a single economic scenario for each period.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's allowance for consumer loans receivable incorporates macroeconomic forecasts that explicitly include retail e‑commerce sales, and the 2024 10‑K notes that these forecasts are applied to the revolving‑credit portfolio to estimate expected credit losses.  The 2023 filing shows the allowance was $461 million (with $341 million for consumer loans), and the 2024 filing indicates the allowance remained $461 million as of Dec 31 2024, reflecting continued reliance on external macroeconomic scenarios—particularly retail e‑commerce sales trends—to project credit losses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PFE reported Other (income)/deductions-net as a $4,878 million expense, largely driven by significant losses on equity securities ($1,344 million) and a $2,547 million expense related to net periodic benefit costs. By 2024, this line item reversed to a $4,388 million income, indicating major improvements or one-time gains not present in earlier filings. This transformation highlights a strategic or market-driven shift that significantly boosted non-operational income over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The reversal was driven by a combination of factors detailed across the filings: the 2024 Other (income)/deductions‑net swung to a $4,388 million gain primarily because of higher net gains on equity securities, lower net periodic pension costs, and a $945 million gain on the partial sale of the Hallen investment, while 2022’s expense reflected large asset‑impairment charges (e.g., $1.7 billion for Biopharma intangibles) and lower collaboration income. These shifts are outlined in Note 4 (components of Other (income)/deductions‑net) and the MD&A discussion of “Other (Income)/Deductions‑Net” where the 2024 change is attributed to higher net interest expense, pension costs, and equity‑security gains/losses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PFE had a pro rata indemnification obligation of 32% for GSK's guarantee of $8.75 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes issued by the Consumer Healthcare JV. Simultaneously, PFE received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) from the JV, which it repaid in July 2022 after receiving £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion. By 2024, the indemnification obligation had been terminated following the demerger, and there is no mention of ongoing loan arrangements or new obligations related to the JV. This indicates a significant reduction in PFE’s financial exposure and liability tied to the JV.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Pfizer's relationship with the Consumer Healthcare JV underwent significant structural changes that directly impacted its financial obligations. The JV, formed from the 2020 spin-off of Upjohn combined with Mylan to create Viatris, involved complex indemnification and financing arrangements. \n\nPfizer provided a $3.7 billion loan (repayable in 2022) to the JV using proceeds from the $8.75 billion senior notes issued by the JV, and it indemnified Viatris for 32% of any guarantee obligations related to those notes. This indemnification was terminated following the JV's dividend distributions and loan repayments in 2022. \n\nRegarding loan transactions, Pfizer recorded a $4.0 billion reduction in its investment in the JV (reclassified to short-term investments) and recognized $4.0 billion in gains from the sale of its remaining stake in Haleon (the JV's successor) in 2024. The financial implications included the termination of indemnification obligations and the reclassification of the JV investment, which shifted from equity-method accounting to equity security accounting with fair value changes recognized in other income. \n\n(Word count: 200)",

By 2024, the Graphics segment's strategic positioning had expanded beyond traditional gaming and workstation GPUs to include broader applications such as AI-driven PC computing, game streaming via GeForce NOW, and Omniverse Enterprise for industrial AI and digital twin applications. While the exact revenue figures for 2024 are not provided, the segment's scope now includes emerging technologies like AI-enhanced content creation and automotive infotainment systems, suggesting a transformation and deepening integration into AI and enterprise workflows.",

While the segment was historically central to gaming and professional visualization, its evolution has been overshadowed by the explosive growth of the Compute & Networking segment—driven by AI, data center, and automotive demand—particularly after the Mellanox acquisition integrated networking capabilities. This strategic pivot is underscored by the company's full-stack AI platform expansion (e.g., Blackwell architecture, AI Enterprise software) and the Graphics segment's role now being positioned as complementary to core AI and data center growth, rather than a primary revenue driver.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, subscription revenue accounted for 92% of Adobe's total revenue, reflecting a dominant reliance on subscription-based income. However, by 2024, subscription revenue had declined significantly as a percentage of total revenue to just 8%. This dramatic decrease indicates a major shift in Adobe's revenue mix, suggesting a growing proportion of revenue coming from non-subscription sources such as services and other revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe's subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from 93% in 2022 to 95% in 2024, reflecting a strategic shift toward a subscription-based business model. This transition has reduced the relative contribution of product and services revenue (from 7% to 5% combined), indicating Adobe is increasingly reliant on recurring subscription income from its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Digital Experience offerings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate was 0.94%, which decreased slightly to 0.93% in 2024. This minor decrease followed an increase in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by unfavorable changes in product mix, particularly a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing, partially offset by favorable regional mix changes. In 2024, the slight decline in the rate suggests that the company may have experienced more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies, although the overall rate remained relatively stable.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate was 0.93% in 2024 and 0.94% in 2023, representing a slight decrease of 0.01 percentage points. This change was primarily driven by favorable shifts in product mix, regional mix, and third-party pricing incentives within core PayPal products and services, partially offset by the higher expense rate associated with Braintree (which has a higher expense rate than other offerings and represented a larger portion of TPV in 2024). The rate remained relatively stable compared to 2023, with the 2024 rate being marginally lower.",

At the same time, the JV loaned Pfizer £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum. In July 2022, Pfizer received £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from the JV, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion, which was used to repay the £2.9 billion loan.

By 2024, the total paid membership grew to 76,200, with 63,700 Gold Star members (83.6%) and 12,500 Business members (16.4%). This reflects a slight increase in the dominance of Gold Star members in the overall membership base, while the Business segment saw a smaller proportional growth.

The composition shifted modestly: Gold Star members rose from 58,800 to 63,700, while Business members (including affiliates) increased from 12,200 to 12,500.  Consequently, the share of Business members fell slightly from roughly 17% of total paid members in 2023 (12,200 ÷ 71,000) to about 16% in 2024 (12,500 ÷ 76,200), while Gold Star members now represent the larger share of the paid‑member base.

By 2024, the company's total Transformation Strategy Costs had significantly increased to $322 million for 2024 from $435 million in 2023. This indicates a substantial shift in strategic investment focus, with UPS accelerating its transformation initiatives under Transformation 2.0, including efforts like 'Spans and Layers,' 'Business Portfolio Review,' and 'Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined.' The earlier phase of transformation was smaller in scale compared to the expanded and more diversified transformation initiatives undertaken in 2024.",

This reduction shows that the company is shifting its strategic investment focus from large‑scale cost‑cutting and organizational simplification toward targeted growth areas such as healthcare‑focused businesses, technology upgrades, and portfolio realignment, while still maintaining modest ongoing transformation spending.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Schwab disclosed that Estimated Current LTV ratios were updated monthly using a home price appreciation index and were used as part of the credit quality stratification for First Mortgages and HELOCs. By 2023, Schwab continued to update Estimated Current LTV ratios monthly using the same methodology, but expanded its disclosure to include detailed credit quality indicators that incorporated this metric, indicating a more comprehensive integration into credit reporting processes. This represents a transformation in how Estimated Current LTV is utilized, moving from a monitored metric to a disclosed and detailed credit quality component.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Schwab’s Estimated Current LTV disclosures shifted from a single consolidated table (2022) to a more granular, year‑of‑origination breakdown that is presented separately for First Mortgages and HELOCs (2023). The 2023 filing reports Estimated Current LTV by origination year and by LTV tier (≤70%, >70%‑≤90%, >90%‑≤100%, >100%), whereas the 2022 filing only provided a combined “Estimated Current LTV” column without the origination‑year segmentation. Additionally, the frequency of updates remained monthly (as noted in the methodology), but the 2023 disclosures integrate the Estimated Current LTV data more closely with credit‑quality metrics such as Origination LTV, Updated FICO, and delinquency, making it a dedicated component of the credit‑quality reporting rather than an ancillary line item.",

By 2023, the collaboration partners' share had decreased to $135 million at December 31, 2023. This indicates a reduction in the partners' exposure to these guarantees over the period, suggesting a potential de-risking or renegotiation of financing arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial disclosures, the costs associated with guarantees related to commercial aerospace customer financing arrangements remained relatively stable between 2022 and 2023, with collaboration partners' share of these guarantees decreasing slightly from $140 million to $135 million. The documents indicate that while the maximum potential payment for commercial aerospace financing guarantees declined from $304 million (2022) to $288 million (2023), the carrying amount of liability remained negligible ($0 in both years), and collaboration partners' share of these financing guarantees was explicitly reported as $135 million at December 31, 2023, compared to $140 million at December 31, 2022.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring significant fees or fines if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or loss of the ability to process payment cards. By 2024, the language evolved to emphasize not only the continuation of these risks but also the broader financial implications, such as materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. While the core risk remained consistent, the framing in 2024 suggests a heightened awareness and potential escalation in the severity of consequences, indicating an increased exposure or at least a more explicitly communicated risk posture.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Apple's exposure to fees or fines tied to payment‑card data security has remained significant and has not diminished. The company continues to be subject to liability for investigatory expenses and penalties if it fails to meet the Payment Card Industry data‑security standards, and such non‑compliance could materially increase transaction costs, reduce its ability to process payments, and adversely affect its business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. Consequently, payment‑card security risks constitute a persistent material component of Apple’s financial risk profile.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX disclosed that foreign exchange contract activity impacted financial statements through its effect on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the Consolidated Statement of Operations, with gains or losses primarily recorded as part of Products sales. By 2023, RTX not only reiterated this impact but also specified the use of the critical terms match method for assessing hedge effectiveness and introduced a €500 million euro-denominated long-term debt instrument designated as a net investment hedge against European business investments, which was deemed effective. This indicates a more detailed and structured approach to managing foreign exchange risk through specific debt instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, RTX’s foreign‑exchange hedging activity shifted from a larger notional amount of $11.6 billion in 2021 to $8.5 billion in 2021 (and further reduced to $15.8 billion in 2023 according to later notes), reflecting a more focused hedge program. The company continues to use the critical‑terms‑match method, deeming its hedges highly effective, and expects only a modest $28 million pre‑tax loss to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into sales over the next 12 months. Regarding debt instruments, RTX holds €500 million of euro‑denominated long‑term debt that serves as a net‑investment hedge for its European operations, and its overall debt exposure is reported at $41.6 billion (fair value $41.6 billion) for long‑term debt excluding finance leases as of 2023.",

However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth to stagnation suggests a notable change in the iPhone's sales momentum, potentially indicating market saturation, longer upgrade cycles, or weaker demand despite ongoing product releases.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth trajectory of iPhone net sales shows a clear shift: after a strong 7% increase in 2022 driven by new iPhone models, sales plateaued in 2023 (declining slightly to $200,583 million) and remained relatively flat in 2024 ($201,183 million), indicating a maturation and slowdown in the product line's growth. This stabilization suggests Apple has transitioned from aggressive expansion to a more mature phase where iPhone revenue growth is now primarily driven by incremental unit sales and pricing, rather than significant market share gains or new product cycles.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Schwab reported $1,409 million in revenue from Bank Deposit Account Fees, which decreased to $705 million in 2023. This significant decline suggests a reduced reliance on or a strategic shift away from off-balance sheet sweep programs, which were previously a notable source of income generated through marketing, recordkeeping, and support services for depository institutions.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue from Bank Deposit Account Fees declined sharply from $1,409 million in 2022 to $705 million in 2023, reflecting a significant reduction in fee income. This drop indicates that Schwab’s reliance on off‑balance‑sheet sweep programs—through which it earns such fees—has diminished, suggesting a weaker contribution from these programs to overall earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, Johnson & Johnson's European sales grew by 24.3%, driven by operational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. However, by 2023, European sales had declined by 1.2%, with an operational decline of 2.2% partially offset by a smaller positive currency impact of 1.0%. The decline in 2023 was significantly influenced by the net negative impact of 9.8% from the performance of the Covid-19 Vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of Zytiga. This marks a dramatic shift from the robust growth seen in 2021, indicating both operational challenges and changing market dynamics in Europe over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Johnson & Johnson's European sales performance from strong operational growth in 2021 to a decline in 2023 was driven by a combination of factors: in 2021, Europe saw 20.7% operational growth and a 3.6% positive currency impact, but by 2023, operational sales declined by 2.2% with only a 1.0% currency benefit, while the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures turned negative (-0.1% in 2023 vs. -0.5% in 2021). Additionally, the loss of exclusivity for Zytiga in Europe contributed a significant -9.8% drag on operational sales growth in 2023, and currency headwinds intensified from a 3.6% positive impact in 2021 to a 1.0% positive impact in 2023, exacerbating the decline.",

      "question": "How did RTX's disclosure and accrual approach for loss contingencies related to legal matters evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of the nature of the legal exposures and the materiality assessment?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX disclosed loss contingency accruals related to a DOJ grand jury investigation and civil antitrust lawsuits concerning alleged hiring restrictions, with the company stating that the amounts accrued were not material. By 2023, RTX shifted focus to new legal exposures stemming from the Powder Metal Disclosure Litigation and an SEC investigation, again noting that any related loss contingency accruals were not material. The evolution reflects a transition from antitrust-related employment issues to securities disclosure and manufacturing-related litigation, while maintaining a consistent stance on materiality.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 RTX’s loss‑contingency disclosures show a shift in the nature of its legal exposures: the company moved from primarily reporting discrete, high‑profile matters such as the Cost Accounting Standards claims and the Thales‑Raytheon investigations (which were disclosed in 2022) to a broader set of ongoing government investigations and litigation tied to the powder‑metal issue and related shareholder suits (highlighted in 2023). In its materiality assessment, RTX continued to treat these contingencies as “not material” to results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, but the 2023 disclosures added more detailed quantitative references (e.g., $2.9 billion charge, $300 million accrual for the DOJ matter, and updated accruals for multiple CAS claims) and clarified that the accrued amounts are based on the minimum estimate within a range of possible outcomes. This evolution reflects a more granular quantification of exposure while maintaining the same conclusion that the liabilities remain immaterial.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, revenue from sales outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in fiscal year 2024, this percentage decreased to 56%. This indicates a notable shift in the geographic concentration of the Compute & Networking segment's demand, with a relative increase in U.S.-based demand driving the segment's revenue. The decrease in international revenue share suggests a strategic or market-driven shift toward stronger domestic growth in Compute & Networking.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compute & Networking segment’s revenue grew from $15,068 million in fiscal 2023 to $47,405 million in fiscal 2024—a 215 % increase—driven primarily by higher Data Center sales of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU platform for AI workloads and stronger networking shipments.

By 2024, the Segment Income Margin had stabilized at 26.2%, slightly down from 26.3% in 2023, representing only a 0.1 percentage point decrease.

      "question": "How did the impact of 'Pension and Other' on Microsoft's Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) evolve between FY2023 and FY2024, and what does this indicate about the company's exposure to pension-related financial volatility?",
      "original_answer": "In FY2023, the 'Pension and Other' component of OCI stood at $ (595) million as of December 31, 2023, indicating a negative contribution to comprehensive income. By FY2024, this figure improved slightly to $ (583) million as of December 31, 2024, showing a reduction in the adverse impact. This change suggests a marginal decrease in the company's exposure to pension-related financial volatility over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of \"Pension and other\" on Microsoft's Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) shifted from a $43 million net gain in FY2023 to a $12 million net gain in FY2024, reflecting a modest decline in pension‑related OCI volatility. This reduction suggests that the company’s exposure to pension‑related financial volatility has diminished slightly, though pension obligations remain a material component of its OCI.",

      "question": "How did the operating profit as a percentage of revenue change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this shift indicate about the company's cost management and profitability trends?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 38.4%, while in 2023, it decreased to 29.9%. This indicates a significant decline in profitability relative to revenue, suggesting challenges in cost management or a shift in operational efficiency during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe operating‑profit margin fell from **50.6 % of revenue in 2022 to 41.8 % in 2023**—a decline of roughly nine percentage points.  This drop shows that cost growth (lower factory loadings, higher manufacturing and R&D/SG&A expenses) outpaced revenue growth, indicating weaker cost‑control and putting pressure on profitability despite the company’s overall sales performance.",
      "llm_thought": "The operating profit margin declined from 41.8% in 2022 to 41.8%? Wait need check. Actually 2022 operating profit was $7.33B (41.8% of revenue) and 2023 operating profit was $7.33B? Let's locate: In page page_19: Operating profit was $7.33 billion, or 41.8% of revenue, compared with $10.14 billion, or 50.6% of revenue. That's 2023 vs 2022? It says \"Operating profit was $7.33 billion, or 41.8% of revenue, compared with $10.14 billion, or 50.6% of revenue.\" That indicates 2023 operating profit $7.33B (41.8%) vs 2022 $10.14B (50.6%). So the percentage dropped from 50.6% to 41.8%, a decrease of about 9 percentage points (or roughly 17% relative decline). The question: \"How did the operating profit as a percentage of revenue change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this shift indicate about the company's cost management and profitability trends?\" So answer: It fell from 50.6% to 41.8%, indicating weakening cost control, lower factory loadings, higher fixed costs per unit, and pressure on profitability despite revenue changes. Provide concise 2-3 sentences.\n\nThus answer: The operating profit as a percentage of revenue fell from 50.6% in 2022 to 41.8% in 2023, a decline of roughly 9 percentage points. This drop signals that the company’s cost structure is expanding faster than revenue—driven by lower factory loadings, higher manufacturing costs and increased R&D/SG&A—resulting in reduced margin pressure on profitability.\n",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics reported a decrease in Aircraft Manufacturing Revenue due to fewer aircraft deliveries and the prior-year impact of the sale of a satellite communications business. By 2023, Aircraft Manufacturing contributed only $7 billion to a total increase of $52 billion in company revenue. This indicates a significant decline in the segment's contribution, suggesting a reduced strategic emphasis or operational scale in this business area compared to other divisions like Aircraft Services, which contributed $36 billion in the same year.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics' Aircraft Manufacturing revenue declined slightly from $22,428 million in 2022 to $22,188 million in 2023, a decrease of $240 million (1.1%). This dip reflects fewer aircraft deliveries and the impact of supply‑chain constraints, even though aircraft services revenue grew modestly. Consequently, the aircraft manufacturing portion contributed less to the company's overall revenue growth, underscoring that the broader segment's performance was driven more by services and other defense segments rather than aircraft production alone.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2023, there were no customers that accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A represented 13% of total revenue, specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also linked to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compute & Networking segment's revenue concentration remained heavily weighted toward a few large customers, with one direct customer (Customer A) accounting for 13% of total revenue and an indirect customer (via distributors) estimated to represent about 19% of total revenue in fiscal 2024, both attributed to the Compute & Networking segment. The segment's revenue growth (up 215% year-over-year to $47,405 million) was driven by higher Data Center revenue, particularly from increased shipments of NVIDIA Hopper GPUs for AI training and inference, as well as InfiniBand networking products, indicating continued reliance on a concentrated customer base within the Data Center market.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD recognized $102 million in licensing gain from the THATIC JV, which included both milestone achievement and royalty income. In 2023, the licensing gain from THATIC JV decreased to $34 million, which was solely from royalty income. This indicates a significant decline in licensing gain, primarily due to the absence of milestone-related payments in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, AMD's licensing gain from the THATIC JV evolved significantly between 2022 and 2023, reflecting changes in milestone and royalty income recognition. In 2023, the Company recognized $102 million in licensing gain from a milestone achievement and royalty income under the February 2016 agreement, compared to $34 million in licensing gain (primarily from royalties) in 2022. This indicates that the milestone payment recognition in 2023 was a major driver of the licensing gain, while 2022's gain was smaller and primarily royalty-based. The Company also noted that the THATIC JV investment had a carrying value of zero as of December 30, 2023, and the licensing income was classified under \"Licensing gain\" within operating income, with no receivables recorded from the JV as of December 30, 2023.",

By 2023, the company projected specific annual benefit payments, starting at $70 million in 2024 and declining to $56 million by 2028 before rising again to $207 million over the following five years. This shift from asset allocation disclosure to liability payment projections indicates a transition toward more defined, forward-looking liability management, with a notable decline in near-term obligations followed by a longer-term increase.",
      "llm_answer": "The funding obligations for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan declined from $820 million in 2021 to $480 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction in accumulated benefit obligations and a modest increase in plan assets, indicating that the company is easing its long‑term pension liability burden.

By 2024, the company decreased its projected U.S. Defined Benefit obligations, showing $80 million for 2025 and a reduced long-term liability estimate of $193 million for 2030–2034.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, TXN maintained a conservative investment strategy for U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations, with 65%-80% allocated to fixed income securities and cash equivalents and 20%-35% to equity securities. By 2023, the company showed a decrease in its projected payment obligations, with U.S. Retiree Health Care payments declining from $27 million in 2024 to $22 million in 2028. This indicates a shift toward reduced liability exposure, consistent with the earlier conservative investment approach that may have helped stabilize the funding position over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the company’s funding strategy for U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations shifted toward longer‑dated, higher‑coupon debt issuances—adding $1.2 billion of 5.05% notes due 2063 and $200 million of 4.90% notes due 2033—while retiring only a modest $500 million of maturing debt.  The new issuances expanded the weighted‑average maturity profile and increased the average interest cost of the debt used to finance the retiree health‑care plan, reflecting a deliberate move to lock in financing at longer terms despite the higher rates.  Consequently, projected payment obligations for the U.S. Retiree Health Care plan rose modestly, with the 2023‑2033 payment stream now showing $22 million in 2028 and $97 million in the 2029‑2033 aggregate range, up from $25 million in 2028 and $97 million in the 2029‑2033 range in the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan had a target asset allocation of 60% to 100% in fixed income securities and cash equivalents, and 0% to 40% in equity securities, indicating a conservative investment approach aimed at capital preservation. By 2024, the company projected increasing annual benefit payments starting at $85 million in 2025 and rising to $92 million by 2029, with a cumulative payout of $476 million from 2030 to 2034. This indicates a growing long-term financial obligation and suggests the company anticipates sustained liability in its Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan.",
      "llm_answer": "The funding outlook for the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan shows a stable to slightly improving trajectory from 2022 to 2024, with the weighted average asset allocation shifting toward higher fixed income and cash equivalents (79% in 2024 vs. 76% in 2022) and a declining equity allocation (21% in 2024 vs. 24% in 2022), reflecting a more conservative investment strategy. This evolution, coupled with rising accumulated benefit obligations ($1.47 billion in 2024 vs. $1.67 billion in 2023), indicates the company is actively managing long-term liabilities through asset allocation adjustments and debt refinancing, but the growing obligation size suggests increasing pressure on future funding requirements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, aircraft manufacturing reported a loss of $251 million. By 2024, this segment experienced an increase in revenue due to additional aircraft deliveries, particularly the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. However, the segment also faced cost overruns linked to supplier quality escapes and late deliveries of components, which impacted profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, aerospace revenue grew strongly—up about 16% in 2024 to $28.6 billion—driven primarily by higher aircraft manufacturing sales ($2.1 billion increase) and ship construction revenue ($1.5 billion), while operating costs rose faster than revenue due to supplier quality issues and late component deliveries on the Virginia‑class Block IV submarine contract and initial G700 deliveries. Consequently, the Aerospace segment’s operating margin slipped 70 basis points in 2024, even though the book‑to‑bill ratio held steady at 1‑to‑1 and backlog expanded to $19.7 billion. The 2025 outlook projects revenue of roughly $12.7 billion with a modestly higher margin of about 13.7%.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Abbott was actively streamlining operations within its Diagnostic Products segment as part of broader cost-reduction initiatives, incurring approximately $16 million in severance charges recorded under 'Cost of products sold' and an additional $4 million under 'Research and development.' This reflects a direct financial commitment to restructuring the segment for improved efficiency. By 2024, the Diagnostic Products segment was formally redefined and categorized under four distinct business units—Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics, and Point of Care Diagnostics—indicating a more structured and strategic classification within Abbott’s internal management reporting framework. This evolution from operational restructuring in 2022 to a clearly delineated, standardized segment in 2024 suggests a long-term strategic shift toward formalizing and stabilizing the diagnostic business as a core component of Abbott’s global health care portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 Abbott’s Diagnostic Products segment was progressively realigned within its broader segment structure: the 2022 10‑K (pages 32‑36) shows Diagnostics as a distinct segment that included Core Laboratory, Molecular, and Rapid Diagnostics, while the 2024 10‑K (pages 73‑77) re‑classifies the Acelis Connected Health business from Diagnostics to Medical Devices and reports Diagnostics and Medical Devices together under “Reportable Segments.”  This shift reflects a strategic move to separate the diagnostic testing operations from the broader device portfolio and to focus the Diagnostic Products segment on its core laboratory‑ and rapid‑test businesses.  Concurrently, Abbott continued to streamline its manufacturing network—evidenced by the 2021 restructuring of its COVID‑19 test production (page 33) that involved fixed‑asset write‑downs, inventory write‑downs and severance costs—thereby reshaping the cost base and operational footprint of the Diagnostic Products segment as it moved toward a more focused, high‑margin diagnostic offering.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Merck estimated that a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would result in a $648 million decline in the market value of its hedge instruments. By 2024, this estimated decline was $569 million at year-end. This indicates a reduction in the company's foreign exchange risk exposure over time, as the potential market value loss decreased by $79 million over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Merck’s estimated market value decline from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar fell from $754 million (2023) to $569 million (2024), indicating a reduced foreign‑exchange risk exposure as the company’s hedging program mitigated potential losses. This suggests that Merck’s foreign‑exchange risk has diminished over the period, with the lower potential loss reflecting a smaller net exposure to currency movements.",

      "question": "How has the structure and focus of QTL's licensing agreements evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices and royalty structures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, QTL's licensing revenues were primarily derived from per-unit royalties and lump sum payments, with the majority coming from sales of OFDMA-based products, including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices. Royalties were calculated based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of permissible deductions, with some products subject to minimums or caps. By 2024, the structure remained largely consistent, with QTL continuing to generate the 'vast majority' of its revenues from similar multimode devices. However, the 2024 filing emphasized ongoing investments in 5G and the expansion of its patent portfolio in LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro, and 5G NR, indicating a strategic shift toward reinforcing its leadership in next-generation technologies. While the royalty structure remained similar, the 2024 report placed greater emphasis on the foundational role of Qualcomm's inventions in both 3G/4G and 5G, suggesting a deepening alignment of QTL's licensing strategy with 5G innovation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Qualcomm’s QTL licensing framework continued to center on royalties from multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, with per‑unit royalties based on wholesale sales of those devices remaining the core revenue source. The company emphasized that its standard‑essential patents covering CDMA, LTE and OFDMA‑based 5G are licensed worldwide for both single‑mode and multimode products, and that the vast majority of QTL revenue still comes from sales of OFDMA‑based multimode handsets and related devices. No substantive shift in royalty structure was disclosed; instead, the focus stayed on expanding licensing coverage for emerging 5G multimode devices and maintaining industry‑standard per‑unit royalty rates.",

By 2024, QTL revenues increased to $5,572 million, with EBT rising to $4,027 million, indicating both revenue and profitability growth. Additionally, in 2024, QTL expanded its focus on licensing patents for 3G/4G/5G technologies, emphasizing its leadership in the 5G patent space and its ongoing investments in next-generation wireless technologies. The 2024 filing also highlights QTL’s commitments to standards bodies regarding essential patents and the competitive landscape for future wireless IP development, reflecting a more strategic and forward-looking posture compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2023 and 2024, QTL revenue increased modestly from $5.306 billion to $5.572 billion, while its EBT rose from $3.628 billion to $4.027 billion, indicating a slight improvement in both top‑line and profitability.  The segment’s licensing focus remains on 3G/4G/5G cellular patents, but its role has shifted toward emphasizing 5G‑centric royalty streams—particularly per‑unit royalties on OFDMA‑based multimode devices—while still drawing on its extensive portfolio of CDMA, LTE and 5G‑NR patents that underpin most of its license agreements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, CVS highlighted its sensitivity to the accuracy of forecasting health care costs, especially in the Medicare segment where revenue is based on bids submitted in June of the prior year. Premiums were fixed for 12-month periods, making the Health Care Benefits segment vulnerable to unanticipated cost increases, such as those caused by the lingering uncertainty of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and influenza seasons. In 2024, the company projected continued elevated utilization levels into 2025, which could pressure the Health Care Benefits segment and lead to premium deficiency reserves. Additionally, the company expected medical membership declines in Medicare and individual exchange products, contributing to financial volatility. These developments indicate an increased exposure to forecasting inaccuracies and a continuation of challenges in predicting utilization trends.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the Health Care Benefits segment faced heightened financial risk due to elevated Medicare utilization and increased medical cost volatility. This was compounded by higher-than-expected utilization trends observed through 2024, which pressured segment margins and necessitated potential premium deficiency reserves. The segment's ability to accurately forecast and manage rising health care costs—particularly driven by Medicare members and post-pandemic utilization patterns—directly impacted its operating results, contributing to a $3.7 billion decline in net income attributable to CVSHealth.",
