      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Sales to Wholesale Customers amounted to $8,377 million, representing approximately 67% of total revenues ($12,479 million). In fiscal 2023, Sales to Wholesale Customers were $3,736 million, accounting for about 58% of total revenues ($6,431 million). This decline from 67% to 58% indicates a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on wholesale distribution in favor of direct-to-consumer channels.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Nike's Sales to Wholesale Customers as a percentage of total revenues declined from 21.9% in fiscal 2022 to 20.4% in fiscal 2023 (calculated as $8,377M ÷ $46,710M = 17.9% in FY22 vs. $8,562M ÷ $45,000M ≈ 19.0% in FY23, but the document shows a 6% reported decline in wholesale revenues with a 15% currency-neutral decline, indicating a structural shift). This reduction reflects Nike's strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales, as evidenced by the 25% growth in NIKE Direct revenues in FY22 and continued expansion in FY23, which increased from $4,102M to $5,045M (23% growth). The company explicitly states that wholesale revenues declined while DTC channels grew, signaling a deliberate move to control branding, margins, and customer relationships by reducing reliance on third-party wholesale partners.",

      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, LinkedIn's revenue contribution to Microsoft evolved as follows:  \n- **Fiscal 2022**: LinkedIn revenue was $13,816 million (included in \"LinkedIn\" under \"Significant product and service offerings\" in the 2022 revenue table).  \n- **Fiscal 2024**: LinkedIn revenue was $13,816 million (reported in the same table for 2022, but the 2024 filing shows Microsoft Cloud revenue at $137.4 billion, with LinkedIn as part of this segment). However, the *growth rate* for LinkedIn specifically is not directly stated for 2024. The document notes LinkedIn revenue grew **9% year-over-year in fiscal 2024** (from $10,289 million in 2021 to $13,816 million in 2022, implying a 34% growth from 2021 to 2022; but the 2024 filing references \"LinkedIn revenue increased 9%\" compared to fiscal 2023, indicating slower growth).  \n\n**Percentage growth between fiscal 2022 and 2024**:  \nThe document does not provide LinkedIn revenue for fiscal 2024 explicitly, but the 2024 filing states LinkedIn revenue grew **9% year-over-year** (from fiscal 2023 to 2024). Since fiscal 2022 revenue was $13,816 million and fiscal 2024 revenue is not isolated, the growth *from 2022 to 2024* cannot be calculated from the provided data. The 9% growth cited applies to the *2023–2024* period, not 2022–2024.  \n\n**Answer**:  \nLinkedIn's revenue contribution to Microsoft remained stable at $13,816 million in fiscal 2022 (as reported in the 2022 filing), but its growth slowed to **9% year-over-year in fiscal 2024** (from fiscal 2023). The percentage growth *between fiscal 2022 and 2024* cannot be determined from the provided data, as the 2024 filing does not isolate LinkedIn revenue for that year. The document only confirms LinkedIn revenue grew 9% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil excluded items with an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter from its Earnings (Loss) excluding Identified Items metric. By 2024, the company introduced a slight modification by stating that the threshold is 'typically' $250 million, suggesting a more flexible approach. This change indicates that the company may be allowing for more judgment in determining which items are excluded, potentially affecting the consistency and comparability of its non-GAAP earnings metric over time.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's threshold for identifying items excluded from earnings was $250 million of absolute corporate‑wide earnings impact in a given quarter. In 2022 this threshold was applied to isolate \"Identified Items,\" and by 2024 the company continued to use the same $250 million benchmark to remove significant non‑operational events from its earnings measures. This consistent use of a quantitative, materiality‑based threshold reflects a disciplined approach to earnings transparency, allowing investors to focus on underlying business performance by stripping out large, one‑off items while still clearly disclosing those excluded items.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, while in fiscal 2024, this proportion increased to 37%. This indicates a continued upward trend in Oracle's cloud adoption and a strategic shift toward cloud-based offerings as a core revenue driver.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 55 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the lapping of elevated markdowns from the prior year, although partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories. This represents a significant turnaround in the trend of the gross profit rate between the two years.",

The 2024 increase was driven mainly by price management that aligned with historic competitive gaps and by lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, while the 2023 decline was attributed to net markdowns, shifts toward lower‑margin merchandise categories, and higher supply‑chain costs.",

      "llm_answer": "The \"Other Expense, Net\" figure is not directly provided in the financial statements, but the document indicates that Other Expense, Net was $4,677 million in 2023 and $2,448 million in 2022. This represents an increase of $2,229 million (or 90.9%) from 2022 to 2023. The document attributes this change primarily to charges related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities ($5.1 billion in 2023 versus $2.8 billion in 2022), which significantly impacted the Other Expense, Net line item.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company provided a detailed definition of Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, explaining how it is calculated from net income by excluding gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate-related impairment charges, and real estate-related depreciation, amortization, and accretion, while also adjusting for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company moved toward a more quantitative presentation, showing that Nareit FFO increased from $4,610.0 million in 2023 to $5,233.2 million in 2024, a 14% increase. Additionally, the 2024 filing included Nareit FFO within a broader comparative table that tracked changes across three years (2022–2024), indicating a shift toward emphasizing trend analysis and performance metrics over definitional explanations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders increased from $4,610.0 million to $5,233.2 million, reflecting a 14 % rise driven by higher operating profit, reduced straight‑line adjustments, and the removal of Consolidated AFFO from the presentation. The reconciliation shows that this growth stems from increased segment gross margin, lower depreciation/amortization, and the exclusion of non‑operational items such as goodwill impairments and straight‑line revenue/expense adjustments.",

This indicates that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations grew in 2024 compared to the previous year, contributing more positively to sales growth despite a decline in core sales during that period.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a 4.5% drag in 2022 to a 1.0% drag in 2023, and further to a 0.5% drag in 2024, indicating that the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations has diminished but remains present—primarily due to the strengthening U.S. dollar, which continues to suppress reported sales growth in constant-currency terms. This trend suggests the company is increasingly relying on core sales growth and price increases to offset currency headwinds, though significant exposure persists in international markets.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GE's Corporate operating profit was negatively impacted by a $12.5 billion decrease in gains on purchases and sales of business interests, primarily due to the absence of a $12.4 billion gain from the sale of the BioPharma business in 2020. By 2023, this metric improved significantly, with Corporate operating profit increasing by $6.7 billion, of which $5.7 billion was attributed to higher gains on retained and sold ownership interests, particularly from AerCap and GE HealthCare investments, although partially offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year gains on the Baker Hughes investment. This represents a transformation in both the magnitude and composition of these gains, indicating a strategic shift in asset management and investment realization.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GE’s gains on purchases and sales of business interests shifted dramatically from a $12.5 billion gain in 2020 to a modest $47 million gain in 2022 and then a $5.8 billion gain in 2023, reflecting the non‑recurrence of the large 2020 BioPharma sale and the inclusion of significant gains from retained ownership interests (e.g., AerCap and GE Healthcare) in 2023.  Concurrently, the sources of these gains evolved: earlier gains were driven primarily by the sale of major businesses such as BioPharma, whereas 2023 gains stemmed from equity‑method investments and other retained stakes, while related charges like restructuring, separation costs, and Russia‑Ukraine sanctions increased corporate expenses, partially offsetting the gains.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, streaming revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, despite a 7% overall revenue increase driven by membership growth. By 2024, NFLX had implemented more structured hedging strategies, including cash flow hedges for foreign currency-denominated revenue, which resulted in a $124 million gain included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year. This indicates a shift from passive exposure to active management of foreign exchange risk, reducing volatility in reported revenues.",
      "llm_answer": "NFLX's foreign exchange risk exposure on streaming revenues increased in 2024, with unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations negatively impacting reported revenue. However, hedging activities generated $124 million in gains for the year ended December 31, 2024, which were included in streaming revenues, partially offsetting the adverse FX impact.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Tower evaluated tenant-related intangible assets for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or cancellation of relationships, with recoverability assessed through projected undiscounted future cash flows. By 2023, the company continued this tenant-level impairment review but expanded the criteria to include the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations as a key impairment indicator. Additionally, in 2023, the company introduced a more detailed framework for measuring impairment, incorporating available market information relative to asset fair value alongside projected discounted future cash flows, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This represents a refinement in methodology and a more structured approach to impairment assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K excerpts, the evaluation and treatment of tenant-related intangible assets remained consistent between 2022 and 2023 in terms of impairment assessment methodology, but the *context* of impairment indicators and cash flow assumptions evolved due to specific operational and market factors. \n\nThe company continues to assess tenant-related intangibles for impairment on a tenant-by-tenant basis using projected undiscounted future cash flows, with no change in the core methodology (as noted in the 2022 and 2023 \"Critical Accounting Policies\" sections). However, the 2023 filing explicitly details heightened scrutiny of tenant cash flows in India due to regulatory changes (AGR ruling impacts), which directly affected the recoverability assessments of these assets. This included a $0.9 billion carrying value of Indian tenant-related intangibles (6% of consolidated intangibles) that required reassessment, potentially altering cash flow assumptions compared to 2022. \n\nWhile the impairment testing framework itself did not change, the *projected cash flow assumptions* used for tenant-related intangibles in 2023 were influenced by new market-specific risks (e.g., India’s AGR relief package and potential tenant cash flow reductions), which were not explicitly detailed in the 2022 filing. The 2023 goodwill impairment charges ($322 million for India, $80 million for Spain) further reflect that these revised cash flow assumptions led to formal impairment triggers, though the tenant intangible impairment process itself remained unchanged. \n\nIn summary: the *methodology* for evaluating tenant intangibles stayed consistent, but the *assumptions* underpinning cash flow projections for impairment testing were refined in 2023 to account for India-specific regulatory risks, resulting in new impairment charges not present in 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed nonmarketable investments totaling $5 million, grouped under the 'Other measurement basis' category alongside equity-method investments, with no change in value from the prior year. By 2024, while the specific dollar amount for nonmarketable investments was not quantitatively disclosed, the company expanded its qualitative disclosure, describing these investments as including interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities, and clarified that they are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more detailed discussion of counterparty risk concentration, which indirectly impacts the risk exposure of these nonmarketable investments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, TXN’s valuation methodology for nonmarketable investments remained anchored in cost basis with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, continuing to exclude fair‑value measurements. Disclosure of risk exposure highlighted that these nonmarketable holdings—primarily venture‑capital fund interests and other private securities—are recorded at cost and are not marked‑to‑market, meaning their carrying amounts reflect original purchase price net of any recognized impairments rather than current market values. Consequently, the primary risk exposure is limited to potential credit or impairment losses, which are recognized only when evidence of a decline in value occurs, and there is no ongoing fair‑value reporting or market‑based risk quantification for these investments.",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Visa recorded a charge within general and administrative expense associated with the consolidation of certain leased office spaces and explicitly excluded this amount from underlying performance metrics. This indicates that Visa began recognizing and disclosing Lease Consolidation Costs as a distinct item in 2024, reflecting a shift in how they report one-time or non-recurring expenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Visa's treatment of lease consolidation costs evolved from being excluded from non-GAAP measures in fiscal 2023 to being explicitly identified as an excluded item in fiscal 2024 within its reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. This change indicates a consistent financial reporting approach where the company continues to exclude one-time, non-recurring items—such as lease consolidation costs—to provide a clearer view of its underlying operational performance, reinforcing transparency in how it assesses and communicates its ongoing financial results.",

In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by better price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. This reflects a significant turnaround in the company's gross margin performance over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased modestly from 24.1% in fiscal 2022 to 24.4% in fiscal 2023, driven primarily by price management in the Walmart U.S. segment and favorable merchandise mix, while the International segment saw a 55-basis-point decline due to shifts into lower-margin formats and divestitures. The key drivers of change were U.S. pricing strategies offsetting supply chain cost pressures and international margin compression from portfolio restructuring.",

By 2023, the floating-rate debt principal had decreased to $5.4 billion, or about 13% of the senior notes portfolio, with a corresponding potential annual interest expense increase of $54 million. This reflects a reduction in both the absolute level of floating-rate debt and the sensitivity of interest expense to rate changes.",

Earlier in the 2022 filing (page 37), floating‑rate debt was $5.7 billion, with a one‑percentage‑point increase projected to raise annual interest expense by about $57 million. Thus, the floating‑rate debt principal fell slightly from $5.7 billion in 2022 to $5.4 billion in 2023, and a 1 % rate increase would increase annual interest expense by approximately $54–$57 million.",

      "question": "How did BMY's treatment and valuation of IPRD evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of impairment recognition and assumptions used in fair value estimation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, BMY disclosed an IPRD value of $11.4 billion, with $11.1 billion specifically tied to mavacamten, as part of its acquisition disclosures. By 2024, BMY had a more detailed and cautionary approach, emphasizing the vulnerability of IPRD to impairment and the need for annual reviews. The 2024 filing noted that impairment charges for IPRD and other intangible assets totaled $2.9 billion for that year, a significant increase from $101 million in 2022. This reflects a shift from primarily recognizing IPRD value in the year of acquisition to actively monitoring and adjusting it based on evolving expectations of future cash flows, regulatory timelines, and market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, BMY's treatment of IPRD evolved from recognizing it as a non-amortized intangible asset acquired in the Celgene transaction (valued at ~$19.5 billion using the multi-period excess earnings method) to continuing to carry it at fair value without amortization, while also recognizing new IPRD charges for subsequent acquisitions like MyoKardia ($11.4 billion) and Forbius (up to $815 million in milestones). The fair value estimation for IPRD and other intangible assets relied on discounted cash flow models with significant assumptions regarding future revenues, market share, probability of success, discount rates, and regulatory timelines, which were subject to change based on market conditions and clinical outcomes. Impairment reviews for IPRD and other long-lived assets were conducted annually or when indicators arose, requiring management to assess future cash flow expectations and market dynamics, with impairment charges impacting earnings in 2024 ($2.9 billion) and prior years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues were 38.9%. In 2023, this figure increased by 140 basis points to reach 40.3%, primarily driven by investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 170 basis points), deleverage (approximately 80 basis points), and increased promotional activity (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 170 basis points).",
      "llm_answer": "\nStore‑operating expenses rose as a share of company‑operated store revenue from roughly **46 % in fiscal 2022 to about 51 % in fiscal 2023**.  The increase was driven mainly by higher labor costs (partner‑wage and benefit investments adding ~350 bps), inflationary pressure on commodities and supply‑chain expenses (~350 bps), and additional promotional spend (~100 bps), which together more than offset the margin‑boosting effect of strategic pricing (~400 bps) and modest operational efficiencies.  (Pages 34‑38, SBUX_10K_2022; pages 38‑42, SBUX_10K_2023).",
      "llm_thought": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, Starbucks' store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased from 46.5% to 46.5%? Wait need to check. Actually in 2022 doc: Store operating expenses as % of North America total net revenues was 46.5% (2022) vs 45.8% (2021). But the question asks evolution from 2022 to 2023. The 2023 doc shows store operating expenses as % of company-operated store revenues increased to 51.4%? Actually 2023 doc shows Store operating expenses as % of related revenues = 51.4% (2024?) Hmm confusion. Let's parse: The question likely refers to the evolution from 2022 to 2023 using the provided pages. In 2022 doc, store operating expenses as % of company-operated store revenues was 46.5% (2022) vs 45.8% (2021). In 2023 doc, store operating expenses as % of company-operated store revenues is 51.4%? Actually the 2023 doc shows \"Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues\" = 51.4% (for fiscal 2024? maybe they mislabel). But the question: \"How did Starbucks' store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what were the primary drivers of this change?\" So we need to compare 2022 vs 2023 percentages. In 2022, store operating expenses as % of company-operated store revenues was 46.5% (2022) vs 45.8% (2021). In 2023, the percentage increased to 51.4%? Actually the 2023 doc shows 51.4% as a % of total net revenues? Wait: In 2023 doc, \"Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues\" is 51.4% (maybe for fiscal 2024?). The question likely expects answer: It increased from 46.5% in 2022 to 51.4% in 2023, driven by higher labor costs (wage increases), inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain, and increased promotional activity, which added basis points, while pricing and operational efficiencies partially offset. Let's craft answer: The percentage rose by roughly 5 percentage points (from ~46% to ~51%), primarily due to investments in partner wages and benefits, deleveraging of fixed costs, and higher promotional spend, which together added about 350 basis points of cost pressure, partially offset by strategic pricing gains of ~400 basis points.\n\nWe need to cite pages: Use 2022 doc pages 34-38 and 2023 doc pages 38-42.

In 2024, the reported income increased slightly to $170 million, while the adjusted income rose to $242 million.

However, the question specifically asks about the evolution between 2023 and 2024, where reported income from equity investments increased marginally from $167 million (2023) to $170 million (2024), representing a 2% year-over-year rise.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the weighted-average remaining contractual term of employee stock options was 7.3 years as of December 31, 2022. By the end of 2023, this term had decreased to 6.4 years. This represents a reduction of 0.9 years, indicating a shortening of the average time remaining for these options to expire.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the weighted-average remaining contractual term of employee stock options **decreased** from 2022 to 2023. Specifically, it was **8.3 years at December 31, 2021** (as reported in BKNG_10k_2022.pdf, page 108) and **6.4 years at December 31, 2023** (as reported in BKNG_10k_2023.pdf, page 90). This represents a **reduction of 1.9 years** over the period. The change reflects the expiration and forfeiture of older options, as well as the vesting of previously outstanding options, leading to a shorter remaining term for the remaining outstanding options.  \n\n*(Note: The question references \"2022 to 2023,\" but the source documents provide data for 2021 (BKNG_10k_2022.pdf) and 2023 (BKNG_10k_2023.pdf). The weighted-average remaining term at the end of 2021 was 8.3 years, and at the end of 2023 it was 6.4 years, resulting in a 1.9-year decrease.)*",

This 2.2 percentage point increase indicates that the company was able to generate more income relative to its revenues in 2023 compared to the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "The Segment Income Margin declined from 12.4% in 2022 to 14.6% in 2023? Wait, correction: The 2022 margin was 12.4% and 2023 was 14.6%? Actually looking at the 2023 data: \"Segment income margin: 14.6%\" for 2023 vs \"12.8%\" for 2022. So it increased from 12.8% to 14.6%, a 1.8 percentage point rise.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Oracle disclosed that unbilled receivables were included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets and specifically noted that interest revenue from financing arrangements was recorded as a component of non-operating expenses or income, net. By fiscal year 2024, Oracle continued to include unbilled receivables in accounts receivable and maintained similar revenue recognition timing under ASC 606. However, the 2024 disclosure reclassified interest revenue from financing contracts to 'non-operating expenses, net'—a more specific categorization than in 2022. This indicates a refinement in financial reporting terminology and structure, though the core treatment of unbilled receivables remained consistent.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle began reporting unbilled receivables in its May 31 2022 10‑K (Note 6), disclosing a $1.5 billion balance that is included in accounts receivable when revenue is recognized before invoicing. In the May 31 2024 filing, the company continues to present unbilled receivables as part of accounts receivable and notes that they arise from revenue recognized prior to billing, but it no longer emphasizes the separate “unbilled receivables” line item—instead it aggregates the amount within total receivables and references the figure only in the “Remaining Performance Obligations” discussion. The timing of revenue recognition remains unchanged: cloud‑license and on‑premise license revenues are recognized upfront when the software is made available, while license‑support and hardware‑support revenues are recognized ratably over the support period; unbilled receivables therefore reflect revenue recognized before the related invoice is generated.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 10-K, AIG reported cumulative paid losses of $1,557 million for accident year 2021 as of December 31, 2021. In the 2023 10-K, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident year increased to $1,640 million as of December 31, 2022. This $83 million increase indicates that AIG's initial estimate of paid losses for accident year 2021 was lower than the actual paid losses observed a year later, suggesting that the company may have initially underestimated the severity of claims for that year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident year 2021 increased from **$488 million (2022 10-K)** to **$53 million (2023 10-K)**—a significant decline of **$435 million**. This reduction in cumulative paid losses for the 2021 accident year, combined with the unchanged **$118 million unfavorable prior year development** reported in the UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines (as noted in the \"UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\" section), suggests that AIG's loss reserving for 2021 was **overstated in prior periods**. The decline in paid losses indicates that actual claims settled were lower than initially reserved, implying that the company had previously overestimated the ultimate losses for that accident year. This points to **improved reserving accuracy** in the 2023 filing, as the company is now recognizing less development and settling claims at lower amounts than previously anticipated.",

This decline occurred amid broader industry trends, with total revenue down 14% year-over-year to $54.2 billion, while CCG's performance was impacted by lower ASPs from a higher mix of smaller-core and older-generation products, though partially offset by higher desktop ASPs in commercial and gaming segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, a 25 basis point increase in the URR would have increased the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $140 million, while a 1 basis point increase in the WAC per point would have increased the liability by approximately $168 million. By 2024, these impacts had increased significantly, with a 25 basis point increase in URR leading to a $197 million increase in liability and a 1 basis point increase in WAC leading to a $220 million increase. This indicates a notable rise in the sensitivity of the liability to changes in these assumptions over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of changes in the Unredeemed Redemption Rate (URR) and Weighted Average Cost (WAC) per point on the Membership Rewards liability has increased over time, as reflected by higher estimated impacts in 2024 compared to 2021. Specifically, as of December 31, 2024, a 25 basis point increase in URR would raise the liability and rewards expense by approximately $197 million, and a 1 basis point increase in WAC per point would raise it by approximately $220 million—up from $140 million and $168 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. This indicates that the liability's sensitivity to these assumptions has grown, though the document does not provide specific year-over-year changes in the liability amount itself between 2022 and 2024.",

Additionally, the description of public service engagements expanded in 2024 to include transportation agencies, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2022. This indicates a slight relative decline in the importance of Public Service within the segment despite overall revenue growth, alongside a broadening of the scope of public service engagements.",

The segment's public service component—encompassing defense, public safety, justice, human/social services, education, non-profits, and government agencies—represented approximately 69% of the segment's revenue in both years, with U.S. federal government work (via Accenture Federal Services) accounting for about 35-37% of the segment's revenue.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, streaming revenues increased by 7% compared to 2022, rising from $4,069,973 thousand to $4,446,461 thousand. In 2024, streaming revenues further increased to $4,839,816 thousand, representing a 8.8% growth compared to 2023. This indicates an acceleration in revenue growth from 2023 to 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, NFLX's streaming revenues grew from $31,469,852 (2022) to $33,640,458 (2023), representing a $2,170,606 increase, or a 7% year-over-year growth. This growth was driven by an 8% increase in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 1% decline in average monthly revenue per paying membership due to pricing changes and regional mix.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Other Bets segment reported revenues of $1.527 billion, reflecting an improvement from the prior year with a decrease in operating loss by $541 million, primarily due to revenue growth and reduced valuation-based compensation liabilities. By 2024, the segment's revenues further increased to $1.648 billion, indicating continued, albeit moderate, growth. This trajectory suggests that Other Bets has been gradually improving financially, though the pace of growth remains relatively modest.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial performance of Other Bets shows a modest improvement: operating loss narrowed from $4.6 billion in 2022 to $4.1 billion in 2023, driven primarily by revenue growth and a reduction in valuation‑based compensation liabilities. This indicates that while the segment remains loss‑making, its trajectory is moving toward smaller losses, suggesting progress but still significant challenges to profitability.",

      "question": "How has the valuation methodology and disclosure around Texas Instruments' nonmarketable investments evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of measurement basis and risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, measured at cost with no changes mentioned during the year. The disclosure was limited to a brief mention within a table showing total investments categorized by measurement basis. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, explaining that nonmarketable investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and these investments include interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Additionally, 2024 included a broader discussion of counterparty risk related to investments, indicating a more comprehensive approach to risk management and transparency around these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "The valuation methodology for nonmarketable investments remained consistent—measured at cost with adjustments for observable price changes or impairments, and gains/losses recorded in other income (OI&E)—but the 2024 disclosures expanded the fair‑value hierarchy discussion and added more detail on Level 2 inputs, while the 2023 filing focused on the same cost‑based approach with limited hierarchy disclosure. Risk exposure related to these investments was unchanged in principle (credit risk limited by diversification and allowances), though the 2024 text explicitly notes that unrealized gains/losses on debt investments were immaterial and provides updated maturity schedules and fair‑value tables that reflect a larger portfolio. Overall, the core measurement basis stayed the same, but the 2024 filing offers richer fair‑value classification details and more granular maturity and credit‑risk disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil presented Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) without specifying its classification relative to GAAP standards. However, in 2024, the company explicitly labeled ROCE as a Non-GAAP measure in its disclosures. Additionally, the formatting of the term changed, with 'ExxonMobil' being inconsistently rendered in the 2024 document as 'Ex x onMobil' in certain sections, indicating a change in how the metric is internally standardized and presented.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's presentation of Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) has consistently classified it as a performance measure reflecting capital productivity, but its formatting and calculation methodology have evolved. In the 2022 10-K (pages 47-51), ROCE was defined using net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding after-tax financing costs, divided by average capital employed, with segment-level ROCE calculated as annual segment earnings divided by average segment capital employed. By the 2024 10-K (pages 35-39), the definition remained structurally unchanged—still using net income excluding financing costs divided by average capital employed—but the metric was explicitly labeled as \"Return on Average Capital Employed (Non-GAAP)\" in the new \"FREQUENTLY USED TERMS\" section, and the calculation now explicitly references \"average capital employed (Non-GAAP)\" in the corporate total ROCE table. The core classification as a measure of capital productivity has not changed, but the 2024 filing standardized its non-GAAP labeling and formatting for consistency with updated disclosures.",

By 2024, this figure had increased to $132 million, indicating a significant growth in the segment's asset base or long-term investments. This doubling of depreciation and amortization suggests that the Pet Nutrition segment became more financially significant to CL over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the depreciation and amortization expense data provided in the 2022–2024 financial statements, the Pet Nutrition segment's financial significance has evolved as follows:  \n\n- In 2022, depreciation and amortization for Pet Nutrition was $65 million; this increased to $101 million in 2023 and further rose to $132 million in 2024, reflecting growing capital investment and asset base expansion in this high-growth segment.  \n- Correspondingly, Pet Nutrition's share of total company depreciation and amortization expanded from approximately 12% (65/545) in 2022 to about 22% (132/605) in 2024, underscoring its increasing financial weight within the company's overall operations.  \n\nThis upward trend in depreciation and amortization expenses for Pet Nutrition aligns with its accelerating sales growth (15% in 2021, 14.5% organic growth in 2021, and continued strong performance in 2022–2024), indicating that the segment is becoming a more strategically and financially material contributor to Colgate-Palmolive’s overall profitability and asset utilization strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG not only capitalized interest during construction but also explicitly detailed that the amount of interest capitalized during the year was based on interest rates in place during the construction period. This indicated a clear policy with a specific reference to how the interest was calculated. In 2023, while SPG maintained the same general policy of capitalizing interest during construction, the level of detail was reduced, as the company no longer explicitly referenced the use of interest rates in effect during the construction period when determining the amount to capitalize. This suggests a subtle shift toward less granular disclosure, even though the core capitalization policy remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, SPG maintained consistent accounting policies for capitalizing interest during construction, continuing to capitalize interest on development and construction projects until assets were ready for their intended use. However, the level of detail in disclosures decreased slightly in 2023 compared to 2022. In 2022, the company explicitly detailed the interest capitalization amounts and provided a clear table of interest capitalized during the year, while the 2023 filing reduced this disclosure to a more general statement without specific quantitative examples or a dedicated table, though the underlying policy remained unchanged. The core methodology for capitalizing interest was consistent, but the 2023 filing provided less granular detail regarding the actual interest capitalized and its calculation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil explicitly stated that it did not view temporarily low prices or margins as an indication of impairment, emphasizing that long-term prices must be sufficient to generate investments in energy supply to meet global demand. By 2024, the company's language shifted, placing greater emphasis on the dependency of future cash flows on long-term oil and natural gas commodity prices and industry margins, signaling a more pronounced sensitivity to these metrics in impairment assessments. While both years reference industry margins, the 2024 filing reflects a stronger linkage between impairment indicators and sustained changes in margins, rather than just temporary volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, ExxonMobil’s approach to incorporating industry margins into impairment assessments has evolved to emphasize **longer-term price and margin assumptions** as critical indicators of potential asset impairment, particularly in the context of its upstream operations. While earlier assessments (e.g., in 2022) relied on short-term market volatility and current cash flows, the 2024 disclosures highlight that impairment evaluations now explicitly factor in **sustained reductions in long-term oil and gas prices or industry margins**, as well as strategic shifts such as decarbonization investments and capital allocation decisions. This reflects a more nuanced understanding that temporary price swings are not sufficient to trigger impairment, but structural changes in market fundamentals or corporate strategy (e.g., reduced capital spending, greenhouse gas pricing) may signal the need for impairment testing. The company also increasingly integrates **forward-looking scenarios** from its Corporate Plan and Energy Outlook, which include assumptions about future margins and commodity prices, to assess recoverability of long-lived assets. This evolution underscores a shift from reactive impairment triggers to a proactive, strategic framework aligned with its long-term operational and sustainability goals.",

By 2024, the company maintained the same description of these contracts, including the 10–20 year term range, minimum purchase requirements, and price escalation provisions, indicating no structural changes to the contract framework. This suggests that Linde preserved its long-term, committed contract model for on-site supply without modification across the two reporting years.",

However, the 2024 disclosures indicate a shift in emphasis toward future revenue estimates, noting that approximately half of revenue from minimum purchase requirements will be earned within the next five years (compared to the prior estimate of \"next five years\" in 2023), with the remainder thereafter. The core contract structure (10–20 year terms, minimum purchase obligations) and duration range (up to 20 years) remained unchanged, but the 2024 documentation explicitly references a revised revenue recognition timeline for these obligations, aligning with the updated $58 billion estimate of future consideration (excluding Russian projects) and the focus on near-term revenue recognition from minimum purchase requirements.

In 2024, the company revised its projections for Start-up capital expenditures downward, estimating a range of $50 million to $70 million for 2025. This indicates a shift in AMT's investment strategy, reflecting a more conservative approach or reallocation of resources away from new ventures.",

This reduction indicates a shift in the company's investment strategy toward prioritizing other capital allocation areas—such as discretionary projects, ground lease purchases, and redevelopment—while still maintaining modest funding for new venture initiatives.",

In 2023, these figures decreased significantly to $3.4 billion in unrealized gross gains and $159.2 billion in fair value of securities in an unrealized gain position. This indicates a substantial decline in the performance of LLY's investment portfolio over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the fair value of securities in an unrealized gain position declined from $46.8 million to $159.2 million (though the document shows a larger increase from $250.7 million in 2021 to $159.2 million in 2023, indicating a net decrease), while the unrealized gross gains fell from $20.9 million to $3.4 million. This reduction in both the fair value of securities in an unrealized gain position and the magnitude of unrealized gains suggests that LLY’s investment portfolio experienced a modest decline in performance, with fewer securities appreciating and those that did appreciate doing so to a lesser extent than in the prior year.",

This doubling of depreciation and amortization expense indicates a significant increase in capital investment or asset acquisition within the Pet Nutrition segment over this period, suggesting stronger focus or expansion in this business area.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the depreciation and amortization tables for 2022-2024 (pages 115-119 in both 2022 and 2024 10-K filings), the Pet Nutrition segment's depreciation and amortization expense increased from $55 in 2022 to $62 in 2023 and $132 in 2024. This upward trend indicates growing capital investment or asset acquisition within the Pet Nutrition business, likely reflecting expansion or increased asset utilization in this high-growth segment. The rising D&A expense aligns with the segment's net sales growth from $2,520 million in 2019 to $3,311 million in 2021 (and further to $4,483 million in 2024), suggesting the company is scaling its infrastructure to support Pet Nutrition's expanding operations.",

By 2024, this balance decreased to $19 million, with ($7) million in deductions and ($1) million in foreign currency adjustments. This indicates a consistent reduction in the noncurrent allowance, suggesting either improved credit quality of receivables or a strategic reduction in exposure to credit risk over time.",

By 2023, while leasing prospects were still referenced, SPG placed increased emphasis on changes in economic and operating conditions, tenant financial health, and the intent and ability to hold assets when assessing the recoverability of investments. This reflects a more dynamic and condition-sensitive approach to leasing prospects in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, SPG's assumptions regarding leasing prospects evolved between 2022 and 2023 in their evaluation of investment properties for impairment and purchase accounting by incorporating more current market data and sensitivity analyses. Specifically, in 2023, SPG refined its impairment assessments for investment properties and unconsolidated entities (like TRG and Klépierre) by comparing forecasted cash flows and operating income before depreciation and amortization to historical actual results and market-supported data, while explicitly evaluating the impact of changing economic conditions, demand, and competition on assumptions such as capitalization rates and leasing prospects. This evolution reflects a more rigorous, market-responsive approach to estimating undiscounted cash flows and assessing whether impairments were other-than-temporary, as detailed in the \"Evaluation of Investment Properties for Impairment\" and \"Evaluation of Investments in Unconsolidated Entities for Impairment\" sections of the 2023 10-K.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, streaming revenues were negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which acted as a drag on overall growth. However, in 2024, Netflix introduced a more detailed financial hedging strategy involving forward contracts to manage foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions. This strategy included the use of cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, and net investment hedges, with specific recognition of $124 million in hedging gains included in streaming revenues, indicating a proactive approach to mitigating currency risk.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on streaming revenues shifted from a headwind in 2023 to a tailwind in 2024, as the 2024 financials show streaming revenue growth of 10% in constant currency versus 7% reported in 2023, reflecting favorable FX movements that added approximately $597 million to revenue had rates remained constant. To address this volatility, Netflix introduced a formal hedging strategy in 2024, designating forward contracts as cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue transactions and fair value hedges for foreign-currency-denominated debt, with gains/losses on these derivatives now reclassified directly into revenues or cost of revenues rather than being recorded in AOCI.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo's Parent company was subject to federal banking laws that limited covered transactions with its subsidiary banks to 10% of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus for a single affiliate and 20% in aggregate, with requirements for secured collateral and arm’s-length terms. Additionally, the Parent was expected to act as a 'source of strength' to support its subsidiary banks during financial stress. By 2024, the regulatory framework evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). Under this new arrangement, the IHC is obligated to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank and other Covered Entities, and its ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted if certain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers. This represents a structural shift in how capital and liquidity are managed across the Parent and its subsidiaries, introducing new conditional restrictions beyond the earlier statutory limits.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the regulatory framework governing Wells Fargo’s parent‑subsidiary relationship continued to impose strict capital‑distribution limits and liquidity‑support requirements. The FRB’s enhanced supervision rules require large BHCs such as Wells Fargo to obtain approval for dividend and share‑repurchase plans and to maintain capital‑distribution restrictions that can be triggered by stress‑test, risk‑management or liquidity‑risk events. In addition, the 2017 Support Agreement (restated in 2019) ties the parent’s ability to pay dividends to liquidity and capital metrics of its intermediate holding company, and the FDIC/OCC can impose assessments or force asset sales if subsidiary bank capital becomes impaired. Consequently, capital distributions from subsidiary banks to the parent are constrained, and the parent must rely on the Support Agreement and periodic FRB‑approved capital plans to manage liquidity and meet regulatory capital surcharges (e.g., the G‑SIB requirement).",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil incorporated greenhouse gas emission prices into its upstream production volume estimates based on 'existing or anticipated policy actions that countries or localities may take in support of Paris Accord pledges.' By 2024, the company expanded this approach to include estimated greenhouse gas emission costs even for jurisdictions without current greenhouse gas pricing policies, and specifically accounted for costs in support of reaching its 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reduction plans, including the goal of net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions from unconventional operated assets in the Permian Basin and Pioneer assets by 2035.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, ExxonMobil’s approach to incorporating greenhouse gas emission prices into its upstream production volume estimates using risk‑adjusted unproved reserve quantities remained consistent: the Corporation’s impairment and cash‑flow assessments, as described in the notes on impairment testing and the Corporate Plan, continue to factor in estimated greenhouse‑gas emission costs (including anticipated policy‑driven pricing) when forecasting future cash flows, and these estimates rely on proved reserve quantities that may be supplemented with risk‑adjusted unproved reserves. The methodology for measuring future cash flows and discounting them has not changed materially, though the specific emission‑price assumptions are updated as new policy or pricing developments emerge.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE disclosed that NEER's asset retirement obligations (AROs) included dismantlement liabilities for certain wind and solar facilities, with the associated asset retirement costs capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived assets. For non-rate regulated operations, these costs were allocated to expense over the asset's estimated useful life, with changes in the ARO due to the passage of time recognized as an increase in the liability and as accretion expense, included in depreciation and amortization. By 2023, NEE further clarified that NEER includes in depreciation expense a provision specifically for dismantlement, interim asset removal costs, and accretion related to asset retirement obligations. This indicates a more explicit recognition and integration of dismantlement obligations into NEER’s depreciation methodology, showing a refinement in how these future liabilities are embedded into current financial reporting.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, NextEra Energy’s approach to dismantlement obligations for NEER’s wind and solar facilities shifted from a $26 million annual expense (effective under the 2016‑2021 rate agreement) to a $48 million annual expense approved in the 2021 rate agreement, which began to be amortized starting January 1 2022 and is reflected in the updated depreciation studies and reserve amortization used to meet the targeted regulatory ROE.

By 2024, the company explicitly reported depreciation and amortization expenses for the Pet Nutrition segment, showing a significant increase from $65 million in 2022 to $132 million in 2024.

The acquisition of **Hello Products LLC** in 2020, which included pet nutrition assets, was part of a broader strategy to focus on high-growth segments, including Pet Nutrition. This is further supported by the **Pet Nutrition** segment's revenue increasing from **$3,713 million in 2022** to **$4,483 million in 2024**, with operating profit rising from **$850 million to $965 million** over the same period. Additionally, the segment's share of total company operating profit has grown, indicating its increasing strategic importance.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax-related adjustment impacting EBIT-adjusted primarily consisted of a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation. In contrast, in 2023, the adjustment involved a tax benefit stemming from the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a change in the geographic and operational focus of tax-related adjustments impacting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax reconsolidation event in 2022 to a Korea-specific deferred tax asset realization in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the EBIT-adjusted adjustments decreased from $14.5 billion to $12.4 billion, a reduction of $2.1 billion. The primary drivers of this decline were lower tax-related adjustments (e.g., release of valuation allowances and tax benefits tied to subsidiary investments) and smaller one‑time items such as the Russia exit and patent royalty matters, which collectively offset some of the impact from higher non‑service pension income and Cruise restructuring costs. Consequently, the magnitude of adjustments impacting EBIT‑adjusted shrank, with tax‑related items playing a diminishing role compared with prior years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Wells Fargo was primarily subject to standard FRB capital distribution restrictions, including Basel III requirements and capital surcharges for G-SIBs, which limited the ability of subsidiary banks to pay dividends to the parent company. By 2024, the relationship had evolved significantly with the introduction of the Support Agreement involving the Intermediate Holding Company (IHC). This agreement obligated the IHC to provide capital and liquidity to the Bank, WFS, and WFCS, and also introduced conditional restrictions tied to liquidity and capital metrics. If these metrics fall below defined triggers, the IHC's ability to pay dividends to the Parent is restricted, and subordinated notes are forgiven, impacting the Parent's liquidity. These new mechanisms represent a structural shift in how the subsidiary banks support the parent company and how capital flows are regulated under stress conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Wells Fargo’s capital‑distribution restrictions and liquidity‑support mechanisms remained anchored in its status as a large bank holding company subject to stringent regulatory oversight. The company continues to operate under the Support Agreement (as amended in 2019), which can restrict dividend payments from its intermediate holding company (IHC) to the parent if certain capital or liquidity metrics fall below defined triggers, and it may be required to file for bankruptcy if those conditions are not remedied. Additionally, the FRB’s enhanced‑supervision rules impose capital‑distribution limitations—such as caps on dividend and share‑repurchase activities—whenever capital, stress‑test, risk‑management, or liquidity‑risk triggers occur, and the parent must maintain sufficient equity and unsecured long‑term debt to meet Basel III and G‑SIB loss‑absorbing requirements. These frameworks collectively constrain how capital can flow from subsidiary banks to the holding company while ensuring the firm retains enough liquidity to support its subsidiaries and meet regulatory obligations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the fair value of securities in an unrealized gain position was $46.8 billion, while in 2023 it increased significantly to $159.2 billion. This indicates a substantial improvement in the performance of Eli Lilly's investment portfolio, as the value of securities showing unrealized gains more than tripled year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "The fair value of securities in an unrealized gain position declined from $250.7 million in 2022 to $159.2 million in 2023, reflecting a $91.5 million decrease. This reduction indicates that the portion of the investment portfolio generating unrealized gains shrank, suggesting weaker performance or lower market valuations for those securities during the period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, IBM acknowledged the risk of financial loss due to cybersecurity incidents, noting that while it regularly addresses such threats, no material adverse effects had occurred. By 2024, the company highlighted an increase in the sophistication and number of cyber threats, particularly with the emergence of AI-driven attack methods, and referenced industry-wide incidents like MOVEit as examples of events that could lead to financial loss. Despite these developments, IBM still reported that no cybersecurity incidents had resulted in a material adverse effect, indicating that while the threat landscape has evolved and potentially increased in risk, the company's mitigation strategies have kept the financial impact within manageable bounds.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's exposure to financial loss from cybersecurity incidents has remained material but unchanged in magnitude between 2022 and 2024, with no material adverse effect reported in either filing. However, the company has significantly strengthened its mitigation efforts in response to increasingly sophisticated threats, particularly those involving AI-driven attacks and expanded attack surfaces from remote work and third-party ecosystems. While past incidents have not triggered financial losses, IBM acknowledges that evolving threats—especially those leveraging generative AI and targeting critical infrastructure—could materialize into material financial impacts in the future, necessitating continuous investment in security posture and compliance.",

This decline indicates that the company has been amortizing these costs more rapidly, likely due to lease terminations, lease modifications, or the adoption of new accounting standards (e.g., ASC 842), resulting in lower net deferred lease assets on the balance sheet.",

In 2024, the benefit was $190 million, up from $164 million in 2023, with the increase attributed to a higher expected return on assets and lower interest costs due to a decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the balance of preferred stock shares issued at the beginning of the period was 1.7 million, while in 2024, the balance at the beginning of the period was 0 million. This indicates a complete elimination of preferred stock shares in the capital structure by 2024, reflecting a strategic shift toward common equity.",
      "llm_answer": "The preferred stock balance declined from $1.7 million at the start of 2023 to $0 million by year‑end 2023 as all outstanding MCPS shares were converted to common stock, and no preferred shares remained outstanding in 2024. This elimination of preferred equity indicates that the company’s capital structure became fully common‑stock‑based, simplifying its equity composition and reducing the proportion of higher‑cost, fixed‑rate preferred financing.",

By 2023, this amount increased to $7.42 billion of unused committed bank credit facilities, with $7.00 billion available for the commercial paper program.

Concurrently, the utilization of these facilities for commercial‑paper financing grew, reflected by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities and the larger cash‑flow needs tied to debt repayments and share‑repurchase activities in 2023 versus 2022.",

This indicates that, despite the two-year gap, there was no change in the remaining capacity of the repurchase program during this time.",

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This represents a significant shift from a slight improvement to a notable decline in gross profit performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased slightly from 24.3% in fiscal 2022 to 24.4% in fiscal 2023, representing a 10-basis-point improvement. This modest growth was primarily driven by price management in the Walmart U.S. segment, which offset increased supply chain costs, while the international segment saw a gross profit rate decline due to shifts into lower-margin formats and divestitures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips disclosed that for performance periods beginning in 2018 or later, recipients of cash-settled PSUs received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense, with the accrued reinvested dividend paid at the time of settlement. In 2024, the company maintained the same structure, reiterating that for performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent, which was also charged to compensation expense and paid at settlement. This consistency indicates that the company did not alter its approach to dividend equivalents for these PSUs between the two years, maintaining a stable policy in how compensation is recognized and distributed for long-term incentive plans.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of accrued reinvested dividend equivalents for cash‑settled performance share units shifted from being charged to retained earnings in 2023 to being charged directly to compensation expense in 2024, and the classification of these cash‑settled PSUs remained as liability awards throughout. This change reflects ConocoPhillips’ move toward recognizing the dividend equivalents as part of share‑based compensation cost rather than as a retained‑earnings adjustment, indicating a more consistent accounting approach for PSU compensation.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, American Tower Corporation recorded a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $0.4 million, while in 2023, the company recorded a slightly lower loss of $0.3 million. This indicates a minor reduction in the financial impact of debt repayments or retirements in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease suggests that the company may have experienced fewer or less costly early debt retirements during the 2023 period.",
      "llm_answer": "The loss on retirement of long‑term obligations declined from $0.4 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2023, indicating that American Tower’s debt‑repayment activities were less event‑driven in 2023—primarily reflecting the repayment of the InSite and CoreSite securitizations in 2021 and a reduced need for early retirements thereafter. This decrease suggests the company is managing its long‑term obligations more steadily, with fewer large‑scale early retirements driving the loss.",

      "question": "How has Disney's treatment and recognition of affiliate fees evolved between fiscal 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of revenue recognition methodology and contextual disclosures?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney provided a detailed explanation of its revenue recognition methodology for affiliate fees, stating that fees are recognized as programming is provided, based on per subscriber rates and actual subscriber numbers. Fixed license fees were recognized ratably over the contract term, and minimum guaranteed fees were recognized ratably over the guaranteed period, with excess fees recognized after the guarantee was exceeded. By fiscal 2024, the specific revenue recognition methodology was no longer detailed in the disclosures. Instead, affiliate fees were mentioned in the context of fluctuating with MVPD subscriber levels and were listed among the significant revenue sources for the Sports segment, particularly related to ESPN-branded channels. This indicates a shift from detailed recognition methodology in 2022 to a more contextual and segment-focused disclosure in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2024, Disney’s treatment of affiliate fees remained consistent with its revenue‑recognition policy: affiliate fees are recognized as programming is provided based on contractually specified per‑subscriber rates, with fixed‑fee contracts recognized ratably over the term and minimum guarantees recognized ratably until the guarantee is exceeded. The 2024 filing continues to disclose that excess fees over guarantees are recognized when earned, and that on‑demand licensing fees are recognized as earned based on subscriber counts. However, the 2024 filing adds more granular context by separating affiliate fee revenue by segment (e.g., DMED, DPEP) and by noting the impact of early‑termination adjustments, whereas the 2022 filing only presented aggregate affiliate fee amounts within segment operating income. This evolution reflects a shift from a high‑level summary to a more detailed, segment‑specific disclosure of how affiliate fees are measured and recognized.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde identified cost pass-through as a 2% contributor to sales changes, indicating a limited but measurable impact of cost recovery mechanisms. By 2023, the company emphasized a structural advantage in its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, suggesting a more strategic and intentional reliance on cost pass-through as a financial management tool. This evolution indicates a shift from a reactive cost adjustment to a more proactive and contractual approach.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde’s cost pass-through mechanisms continued to be a key lever for offsetting inflationary pressures, with the 2023 MD&A noting that cost pass-through—primarily contractual billing of energy cost variances to onsite customers—reduced reported sales by 3% but had minimal impact on operating profit. This approach, consistent with prior years, allowed the company to pass rising costs to customers while maintaining profitability, reflecting a strategic focus on protecting margins amid cost fluctuations. The 2022 data similarly highlighted cost pass-through as a 3% sales contributor with negligible profit impact, underscoring its role as a structural tool for cost management rather than a temporary fix.",

In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 155 basis points, mainly due to higher inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges.

The primary driver for the 2022 increase was price management in the Walmart U.S. segment, driven by cost inflation and favorable merchandise mix, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. For fiscal 2023, the rate increase was primarily attributed to strategic sourcing initiatives, strong sales in higher-margin categories, and fewer markdowns, though this was partially offset by carryover effects from prior price investments and temporary store closures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GMI's revenue increased by $586 million (5.1%) compared to the prior year, with the variance attributed to volume (-$1.6 billion), mix (+$1.3 billion), price (+$0.9 billion), and other factors (+$0.1 billion). In 2023, GMI's revenue remained nearly flat with only a $2 million change (0%), but the variance components shifted significantly: volume contributed +$0.5 billion, mix decreased by $0.3 billion, cost reduced the revenue by $0.3 billion, and other factors added $0.1 billion. This reflects a transition from growth driven by pricing and mix in 2022 to a more neutral position in 2023 with offsetting effects across variance components.",
      "llm_answer": "The variance components for GMI’s revenue between 2022 and 2023 were driven primarily by favorable price (positive impact of $1.2 billion), favorable mix (positive impact of $0.4 billion), and unfavorable cost (negative impact of $0.3 billion), with volume effects largely offsetting each other (a slight negative volume impact of $0.6 billion partially offset by a $0.5 billion positive volume contribution). These factors together resulted in a modest overall revenue increase for GMI.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Netflix reported paid net membership additions of 29,529 thousand, a significant 232% increase compared to 2022, indicating rapid subscriber growth. In 2024, rather than disclosing specific membership figures, the company provided detailed information about its expanded use of forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk on forecasted revenue transactions and content licensing. This shift in disclosure suggests that Netflix anticipated sustained international growth in memberships and was proactively managing financial exposure to currency fluctuations, which could significantly impact revenue from global streaming. The detailed hedging strategy in 2024 reflects a strategic evolution from simply reporting growth to actively managing the financial implications of that growth.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix’s 2024 foreign‑exchange hedging strategy shifted from a focus on protecting the cost of its international content spend (as described in the 2023 filing) to a more proactive approach that directly ties hedge gains to streaming‑revenue growth. In 2024 the company began recognizing hedging gains of $124 million as part of “Streaming revenues,” whereas in 2023 such gains were excluded from revenue. This change reflects a strategic move to use FX hedges not only to limit currency‑related earnings volatility but also to offset the impact of foreign‑exchange fluctuations on its key growth metric—paid net membership additions—thereby aligning currency risk management more closely with its growth expectations for paid subscriber expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Disney's amortization policy for licensed rights to film and television content applied to content used on Linear Networks or DTC streaming services. By 2024, the company expanded the scope to include platforms such as the domestic ESPN television network and International Sports Channels, in addition to Linear Networks and DTC services. This indicates a broader application of the amortization policy across more platforms, reflecting a strategic evolution in how licensed content is managed and monetized as part of a group.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K disclosures, Disney's amortization approach for licensed rights to film and television content has remained consistent between 2022 and 2024 in terms of the underlying methodology, but the **platforms covered under group monetization have expanded significantly**. \n\nIn the 2022 filing (DIS_10k_2022.pdf), the document states that content initially intended for DTC streaming services or Linear Networks is generally classified as \"group assets,\" while content intended for theatrical release or third-party licensing is classified as \"individual assets.\" The 2024 filing (DIS_10k_2024.pdf) explicitly expands this framework to include \"DTC streaming services, Linear Networks, domestic ESPN television network, International Sports Channels, or DTC streaming services\" as monetization platforms for group classification. This reflects Disney's broader strategy to monetize content across its owned streaming platforms (like Disney+) rather than relying solely on third-party licensing, with group assets now encompassing content distributed via these direct-to-consumer services. The core amortization principles (e.g., group content amortized based on projected usage, individual content based on ultimate revenues) remain unchanged, but the scope of platforms qualifying as \"group\" has grown to include more DTC and linear network distribution.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Embedded Processing segment had a goodwill value of $172 million, indicating its relatively smaller asset base compared to other segments. By 2024, the segment's role had notably expanded, as it contributed approximately 16% of the company's total revenue. This shift suggests an increased strategic emphasis on Embedded Processing, particularly through products like microcontrollers, processors, and wireless connectivity solutions. The rise from a segment with modest goodwill to one generating a significant portion of revenue reflects a meaningful evolution in its importance to TXN's overall business model.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosures in the provided document pages, the Embedded Processing segment's financial significance has evolved as follows: In 2023, it generated $2.53 billion in revenue (representing approximately 16% of total revenue), and by 2024, its revenue share remained material but was not quantified in the excerpt. The segment's goodwill balance of $172 million (as reported in the \"Goodwill\" table) and its inclusion in the company's strategic focus on \"four sustainable competitive advantages\" (including diversity and longevity of products and markets) indicate its ongoing importance. However, the document does not provide explicit revenue figures or growth metrics for 2024 compared to 2023, making it impossible to quantify a specific evolution in financial significance beyond its continued role as a key segment within the company's portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the cost of natural gas resulted in a loss of $27 million in SO's derivatives in non-designated hedging relationships. By 2024, this relationship had reversed, with the cost of natural gas contributing a gain of $94 million to the same category. This indicates a significant shift in how natural gas pricing affected the company's financial instruments over this period. The change reflects a reversal in risk exposure, where previously rising natural gas costs hurt the company financially through derivatives, but more recently, those costs have benefited the company's position.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of rising natural gas costs on Southern Company's financial derivatives position shifted significantly between 2022 and 2024, reflecting changing market conditions and risk exposure. In 2022, the company's cash flow hedges related to energy derivatives showed a $3 million gain in OCI, but by 2024, this had reversed to a $7 million loss in OCI, with energy-related derivatives contributing to a $40 million loss in income (compared to a $37 million gain in 2022). This shift indicates increased volatility in natural gas markets and heightened hedging activity to manage cost exposure, particularly as the company faced higher gas costs ($1,619 million in 2022 vs. $972 million in 2020) and expanded its use of non-designated derivatives, which generated a $94 million gain in 2024 from natural gas revenues but also exposed the company to greater basis risk. The growing reliance on cash flow hedges for energy-related derivatives—now a material component of OCI movements—signals that Southern Company is actively managing heightened commodity price risks in a more volatile market environment, rather than relying on static hedging strategies.",

This significant drop indicates a substantial deterioration in the company's investment performance over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "UPS's Adjusted Investment Income declined by $798 million (a 58.1% drop) from $1,374 million in 2022 to $576 million in 2023, reflecting weaker pension‑related returns and lower expected asset returns, while the broader investment‑related income fell sharply from $2,435 million to $217 million. This shift signals that the company’s investment performance weakened in 2023, driven by reduced pension asset returns and modest gains from other sources.",

In 2024, these expenditures increased slightly to $12,118 million. This indicates a continued strategic emphasis on capital investment, particularly in core regions, suggesting a focus on long-term asset development and production capacity enhancement.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2023 and 2024 SEC 10-K filings, ConocoPhillips' consolidated capital expenditures and investments increased from $10.159 billion in 2023 to $11.248 billion in 2024, representing an 11% year-over-year rise. This growth was primarily driven by increased investments in the Lower 48 ($6.487 billion in 2023 to $6,487 million in 2024) and Canada ($456 million in 2023 to $456 million in 2024, though the document shows a slight decrease from 2022's $530 million), while Asia Pacific investments declined significantly from $1.880 billion in 2022 to $354 million in 2023. The company's strategic focus appears to be shifting toward its key operational regions in North America, particularly the Lower 48 and Canada, as evidenced by the substantial capital allocation to these areas despite the overall increase in total investments. This indicates a deliberate strategy to strengthen its core North American operations while reducing emphasis on international segments like Asia Pacific.",

By 2024, the company disclosed specific financial figures showing total Affiliate Fees reached $17,525 million, with $7,739 million attributed to Entertainment and $10,796 million to Sports.

The disclosed revenue figures show growth from $7.739 billion in 2022 to $6.872 billion in 2023 and $6.872 billion in 2024 for the “Affiliate fees” line within the Entertainment segment, reflecting the continued use of the same recognition approach across the three fiscal years.",

This consistent growth in Payment Network Revenue—rising from $14,358 million in 2022 to $15,824 million in 2023 and further to $17,335 million in 2024—indicates a stable and sustained performance in the company’s core payment services over the two-year period.",

In contrast, for 2024, the company reported a Core Sales Growth (non-GAAP) decline of (10.5)% for the comparison of 2023 vs. 2022 and a positive 3.0% for the 2024 vs. 2023 period. This indicates a significant shift from stable growth in 2023 to a notable decline in core sales growth in early 2024, followed by a partial recovery later in the year. The fluctuation suggests volatility in the company's underlying business performance during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in Danaher’s non‑GAAP Core Sales Growth shows a sharp decline in the Biotechnology segment – core sales fell 18% in 2023 versus 2022, and continued to drop 6% in 2024, driven by weaker demand for COVID‑19 products, inventory reductions and tighter credit.  In contrast, the Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments posted modest core‑sales growth (≈1% in Life Sciences and a 3% core‑sales increase in Diagnostics in 2024), indicating that while the overall company is facing headwinds in its bioprocessing business, its broader life‑science and diagnostic operations remain stable and are offsetting some of the weakness.  This mixed pattern suggests that underlying business performance is uneven: core growth is eroding in high‑margin bioprocessing but holding steady or improving in other segments, pointing to a company navigating a transition from pandemic‑driven demand to more sustainable, albeit slower, organic expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Engineering Segment Operating Profit was $473 million. In 2023, it decreased by $64 million, or 12%, to $409 million. This decline was primarily driven by a $602 million decrease in Engineering segment sales, which included $894 million from projects in Russia in 2022 compared to only $238 million in 2023. Although the wind down of terminated or suspended Russian projects contributed to higher margins, it only partially offset the overall decline in operating profit.",
      "llm_answer": "The Engineering segment's operating profit increased by 14% from $3,732 million in 2022 to $4,244 million in 2023. This growth was driven primarily by higher pricing (6% contribution), modest volume gains, and a 3% positive impact from acquisitions, which more than offset the negative effects of cost pass‑through declines (‑6%) and currency translation (‑%).",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to the previous year, primarily due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts. The change from a 50 basis point decrease in fiscal 2023 to a 20 basis point increase in fiscal 2024 indicates a significant turnaround in gross margin performance year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment's price management aligned with competitive historic gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by shifts in product mix toward lower-margin categories. Conversely, the gross profit rate decreased by 98 basis points in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, mainly due to markdowns, merchandise mix shifts, higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges in the U.S. segment.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's Gross Profit Rate increased by 65 basis points, driven by favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses, despite price investments and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 155 basis points, primarily due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges. This shift reflects a significant change in the drivers of gross profit, moving from improvement due to internal efficiencies and product mix in 2022 to external pressures and cost increases in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The gross profit rate for Walmart U.S. increased 51 basis points in fiscal 2022 due to price management, favorable merchandise mix (including lapping temporary store closures), and growth in advertising, partially offset by higher supply chain costs; this contrasted with fiscal 2021, where the gross profit rate was flat, supported by strategic sourcing and fewer markdowns but offset by mix shifts and pandemic-related closures. In contrast, Walmart International saw its gross profit rate decrease 55 basis points in fiscal 2022, driven by shifts into lower-margin formats and the impact of divestitures (Asda and Seiyu), while fiscal 2021 saw an increase due to improved margin mix at Flipkart and reduced fuel sales in the U.K.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for approximately $2.7 billion in cash, with potential future contingent payments of up to $0.4 billion CAD. By 2024, the company had fully integrated Surmont into its Canada segment, now owning 100% of the working interest, with the final consideration reported at $3.0 billion CAD $4.1 billion after adjustments. This represents a strategic consolidation of ownership in the Surmont asset.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ Surmont asset evolved from a partially owned project to full ownership after closing the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in October 2023, with the transaction finalized and integrated by early 2024. The company paid approximately $2.7 billion in cash (plus up to $0.4 billion CAD in contingent payments tied to WCS pricing) and began producing about 62 MBD of bitumen from the acquired interest in Q4 2023; this acquisition contributed roughly $572 million of revenue and $119 million of net income in 2023 and was later reflected in the 2024 supplemental pro‑forma results. Additionally, in late 2024 the firm completed a separate $296 million purchase that boosted its working interests in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit, further solidifying its strategic position in the Surmont region.",

By 2023, the Company expanded its criteria to include an additional indicator: the customer's ability to meet its contractual obligations. This reflects a more comprehensive approach to assessing impairment risk, incorporating both behavioral and financial indicators of tenant health.",
      "llm_answer": "The Company's monitoring and impairment assessment criteria for tenant-related intangible assets remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, requiring evaluation of indicators such as high tenant turnover, non-renewal of significant contracts, or termination of relationships to assess recoverability via projected undiscounted cash flows. In 2023, the Company introduced new impairment indicators, including monitoring for \"high levels of turnover or attrition\" and \"the customer's ability to meet contractual obligations\" as specific triggers for testing tenant-related intangible assets, alongside ongoing assessment of lease cancellations or terminations. Additionally, the Company expanded its impairment testing scope to include new triggers related to strategic reviews of reporting units, as evidenced by the goodwill impairment charges recorded in India and Spain during 2023.",

It was presented alongside other DPEP revenue categories like merchandise, food and beverage sales, and resort stays. By 2024, Theme Park Admissions was explicitly quantified at $11,171 million and categorized under the 'Experiences' segment, showing a distinct and separate reporting structure from other revenue streams such as Subscription fees ($18,796 million) and Advertising ($7,506 million). This indicates a shift toward more granular and segmented financial reporting, with Theme Park Admissions now clearly distinguished and directly measured against other major revenue categories.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 through fiscal 2024, Theme Park Admissions revenue grew sharply—from $8.6 billion in 2022 to $11.2 billion in 2023 and $11.2 billion in 2024—reflecting a $2.6 billion increase (≈30 %) over the two‑year period.  In the segment breakdown, this category is reported under “Disney Parks, Experiences and Products” and, while it remains a sizable contributor, its share of total segment revenue declined slightly as other streams (e.g., DTC subscriptions, advertising, and merchandise licensing) expanded, causing its relative contribution to fall from roughly 22 % of total segment revenue in 2022 to about 12 % in 2024.  The revenue is recognized as “Theme park admissions” within the Parks & Experiences line and is distinct from the broader merchandise, resort‑vacation, and licensing revenues that also flow through the same segment.",

This indicates a minor decline in its growth contribution, suggesting a slight slowdown in the performance trajectory of this segment despite maintaining a strong overall growth rate of 17% in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The contribution of Value-Added Services and Solutions to net revenue growth accelerated from 14% in 2022 to 18% in 2023, and continued to grow at a 17% rate in 2024 (currency-neutral), indicating a strengthening performance trajectory for this segment. This growth outpaced the payment network's 10% revenue increase in 2023 and 11% in 2024, reflecting the company's successful scaling of cyber, intelligence, fraud, security, consulting, marketing, and loyalty solutions.",

In fiscal 2024, the company maintained the same accounting treatment for unrealized credit-related losses, indicating consistency in recognition and presentation methodology. However, the context of significant financial activity—such as the $1 billion non-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition—suggests increased scrutiny on financial disclosures, though this did not alter the accounting approach for credit-related losses.",

This indicates that the company's interest burden related to its automotive operations remained relatively stable, with a modest increase of $37 million, or approximately 3.9%. The small change in interest expense suggests that GM's financing strategy for its automotive segment did not undergo significant alterations during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "General Motors' Automotive interest expense decreased from $950 million in 2022 to $911 million in 2023, reflecting a $39 million reduction. This decline indicates that the company is effectively managing its borrowing costs, likely due to refinancing activities and the repayment of higher‑cost debt, supporting a strategy of strengthening cash flow and reducing financing expenses.",

In fiscal 2024, these figures changed to $1,384 million for operating leases and $153 million for finance leases. This indicates a significant decrease in both categories, especially in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on finance leases and moderating overall lease-driven asset acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024 the company’s lease‑related liabilities rose sharply – operating lease liabilities grew from $7.082 bn to $7.633 bn and finance lease liabilities from $3.000 bn to $2.749 bn – reflecting a significant increase in new lease commitments, especially through the $15 bn of commercial‑paper borrowings taken on to fund the SRS acquisition.

      "question": "How did ExxonMobil's treatment or disclosure of future dismantlement costs within the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of its dependency on pricing assumptions?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil disclosed future dismantlement costs as part of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, noting that this measure includes costs for dismantlement, abandonment, and rehabilitation obligations. However, the company emphasized that the measure is based on first-day-of-the-month average prices, which can cause significant variability in cash flows year to year. In 2023, ExxonMobil maintained the same inclusion of future dismantlement costs but explicitly stated that the standardized measure 'depends on' these pricing assumptions, indicating a more direct acknowledgment of the sensitivity of dismantlement cost estimates to price fluctuations. This evolution shows a shift in how the company characterizes the relationship between external pricing and its long-term cost obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, ExxonMobil’s standardized measure of discounted future cash flows declined sharply from $189.6 billion to $116.4 billion—a reduction of about $73 billion. This decrease reflects lower future cash inflows and higher future costs, driven by falling commodity prices and increased dismantlement, abandonment and rehabilitation obligations, which are now more heavily weighted by pricing assumptions in the calculation. Consequently, the 2023 figure shows a greater sensitivity to price volatility compared with the 2022 level.",

      "question": "How has NEE's financial exposure through its NEER segment evolved from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of contracted versus merchant generation assets and their associated revenue commitments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER had approximately 28,759 MW of contracted generation capacity with long-term power sales agreements, and only 1,842 MW of merchant generation assets that required active marketing and hedging. By 2024, NEER's disclosed future revenue commitments showed a significant shift, with $3,945 million in 2025 declining sharply to $370 million by 2029 and beyond, indicating a reduced long-term financial exposure and likely a strategic shift away from long-term contracted generation or a reclassification of assets. This reflects a transformation in NEER's business model under NEE, moving away from long-term commitments toward shorter-term or market-driven strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, NEE's NEER segment saw a shift in its generation mix toward contracted assets, with contracted capacity increasing to approximately 28,759 MW (from 20,147 MW of wind and 5,856 MW of solar ownership interests at year-end 2023) and merchant capacity declining to 1,842 MW. This evolution is reflected in NEER's strategy of developing long-term power sales agreements for the majority of its clean energy assets, including wind, solar, and battery storage projects, while maintaining a smaller merchant generation footprint primarily in the Northeast. The segment's contracted assets, which include 20,147 MW of wind and 5,856 MW of solar capacity under long-term agreements, now dominate its portfolio, reducing reliance on merchant generation and ensuring stable revenue through fixed-price contracts.",

This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on cloud-based offerings, aligning with Oracle's strategy to provide flexible deployment options and migrate customer workloads to the Oracle Cloud. The consistent rise in cloud services' revenue share suggests that Oracle's pivot toward cloud technologies is gaining traction and is expected to continue.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Oracle's cloud services revenues (included within the \"Cloud and license\" business segment) represented 84% of total revenues in fiscal 2024 compared to 83% in fiscal 2023, reflecting a modest increase in the proportion of cloud revenues. This shift indicates a continued strategic emphasis on cloud adoption, with cloud services revenues growing through increased customer renewals and new cloud contract uptake, partially offset by declines in traditional cloud license revenues. The rising cloud revenue share suggests a strategic pivot toward higher-margin, recurring cloud services, which aligns with management's focus on expanding cloud infrastructure investments and driving long-term growth in this segment.",

However, in 2024, the Core Operating Loss increased sharply by $9,982 million compared with 2023, signaling a significant deterioration in performance.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP accounted for dry hole expenses under the successful efforts method of accounting, where exploratory well costs are capitalized pending evaluation and expensed as dry holes if economically recoverable reserves are not found. This is detailed in the 2023 disclosures regarding oil and gas exploration and development. By 2024, COP provided explicit financial figures showing a significant increase in dry hole expenses, rising from $109 million in 2023 to $251 million in 2024. This indicates a notable increase in the number or cost of unsuccessful exploratory wells during the year, reflecting a shift toward more aggressive or riskier exploration activities or changes in success rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ treatment of dry hole expenses evolved in financial reporting and categorization. In 2023, dry hole costs were explicitly disclosed as a separate line item within exploration expenses, amounting to $40 million (as noted in the 2023 exploration expense breakdown on page 83 of the 2023 10-K). By 2024, this line item was no longer separately listed in the exploration expense breakdown; instead, dry hole costs were implicitly included under broader exploration and development costs, with no distinct disclosure of dry hole expenses in the 2024 financial statements (as seen in the 2024 exploration expense details on page 83 of the 2024 10-K, which only reports total exploration expenses without a dry hole subtotal). This reflects a shift toward more aggregated reporting of exploration costs, aligning with the successful efforts method where exploratory well costs are capitalized if reserves are found or expensed as dry holes only when evaluation determines no economic reserves exist—though the lack of explicit disclosure in 2024 suggests reduced emphasis on this categorization. The change is consistent with the company’s broader trend of consolidating and streamlining financial presentation, particularly in how exploration costs are integrated into overall operating performance metrics.",

By 2024, this figure transformed into a significant unrealized gain of $914,369 thousand.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast highlighted that lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, particularly for NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's channels, had an adverse effect on advertising sales and rates. The company noted that audience measurement methodologies could negatively affect advertising revenue if they did not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. By 2023, the company formalized its approach to advertising contracts by disclosing that it guarantees audience ratings for advertisements in some contracts. If a shortfall occurs in meeting these guaranteed ratings, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units within one year. This represents a shift from merely identifying audience ratings as a risk factor to actively managing the financial implications through contractual guarantees and revenue deferral policies.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast's approach to audience ratings guarantees in advertising contracts evolved from 2022 to 2023 by introducing deferred revenue recognition for shortfalls in guaranteed ratings. In 2023, the company began deferring a portion of advertising revenue until rating shortfalls were settled—typically by providing additional advertising units within one year of the original airing—whereas 2022 did not include such deferral mechanisms. This change directly impacted revenue recognition timing, causing a delay in recognizing full advertising revenue until compliance with rating guarantees was achieved, potentially slowing revenue realization compared to the prior year.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' financial commitment and disclosure around the Surmont asset evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of acquisition cost and contingent payments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips acquired the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $2.7 billion in cash, with an additional contingent payment arrangement of up to $0.4 billion CAD ($0.3 billion) over five years. By 2024, the company disclosed the final consideration as $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion) after customary adjustments, indicating a slight increase in the total acquisition cost compared to the initial 2023 disclosure, though the contingent payment structure remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ commitment to the Surmont asset shifted from a $2.7 billion cash acquisition of the remaining 50 % working interest (plus up to $0.4 billion CAD of contingent payments tied to WCS price thresholds) in October 2023 to full ownership and operational control as the 100 % operator, while continuing to fund the contingent consideration through financing activities. The company disclosed that the contingent payments—potentially reaching $0.3 billion USD—would be paid over a five‑year term and were reflected in financing cash flows, whereas the 2024 filings show no new acquisition cost for Surmont but rather the ongoing contingent payment schedule and the asset’s integration into the broader Canada segment strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AbbVie disclosed an upfront payment of $130 million related to the acquisition of Syndesi Therapeutics SA, with additional future contingent payments mentioned but not quantified. By 2024, AbbVie provided a significantly more detailed disclosure, specifying that the agreement includes potential additional payments of up to $870 million contingent on development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. This represents a substantial increase in the visibility and scale of financial commitments tied to the acquisition.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, AbbVie’s financial commitments related to the Syndesi Therapeutics acquisition remained focused on contingent milestone payments rather than an expanded scale of new commitments. In 2022, AbbVie paid a $130 million upfront amount and agreed to future payments of up to $870 million tied to development, regulatory and commercial milestones. By 2024, the company continued to honor this structure, with the most recent disclosures indicating that the potential milestone payments (up to $870 million) were still pending as of the acquisition date, and no additional upfront financing or debt arrangements specifically tied to Syndesi were disclosed beyond the original terms. Thus, the nature of the commitment stayed the same—a milestone‑based payment schedule—while the scale of financial exposure remained limited to the previously disclosed maximum amount.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment contributed 2% to organic sales growth. In 2024, the segment's organic sales growth remained at a low single-digit level, indicating minimal change in its growth trajectory. Despite this stability, the segment's performance lagged behind other business units like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, which showed higher growth rates, suggesting that Baby, Feminine & Family Care was not a primary growth driver in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment showed no organic sales growth (0% organic growth) in fiscal 2024, as reported in the organic sales growth table (5% total company organic growth, with Baby, Feminine & Family Care at 2% organic growth but listed as \"- %\" in the segment column, indicating no growth). This stagnant performance contrasts with stronger organic growth in other segments (e.g., Grooming at 9%, Fabric & Home Care at 5%), highlighting its limited contribution to PG's overall growth strategy. The segment's lack of organic growth, combined with its 24% share of total net sales, suggests it is not a primary driver of PG's targeted mid-to-high single-digit core EPS growth and 90%+ adjusted free cash flow productivity, which rely on higher-growth segments like Grooming and Fabric & Home Care.",

In fiscal year 2024, this growth rate slowed to $3,142 million, or 10%.

      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, AMT’s projected spending on start-up capital projects decreased from a range of $65 million to $85 million in 2023 to a projected $50 million to $70 million in 2024. This reduction indicates a more conservative investment strategy, focusing less on new venture capital projects and likely emphasizing core infrastructure and existing portfolio initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment was described as including the design, manufacture, installation, sales, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and related services, with a general emphasis on solar energy systems incentives. By 2024, the segment maintained its dual focus on solar and storage but provided more detailed emphasis on specific products like Powerwall and Megapack, with Powerwall being explicitly positioned for homes and small commercial facilities, and Megapack targeting large-scale commercial and utility customers with installations reaching gigawatt-hour capacities. Additionally, Tesla introduced real-time energy control and optimization platforms to manage these systems remotely. This indicates a strategic evolution toward more sophisticated integration and software capabilities in energy storage solutions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment shifted focus from solar retrofit offerings toward energy storage products like Powerwall and Megapack, while maintaining solar energy system sales through Solar Roof and incentive-driven models. The segment's revenue grew from $1,994 million in 2020 to $2,789 million in 2021, with gross profit turning from a $129 million loss in 2021 to $18 million in 2020 and $190 million in 2019, indicating improving profitability despite ongoing structural investments. The company continued to emphasize solar energy system design, installation, and incentive monetization, while expanding energy storage solutions for residential, commercial, and utility-scale applications.",

At the same time, the company advanced other Malaysian exploration blocks (e.g., Ubah Cluster, WL4‑00, SK304) and continued development of existing fields such as Gumusut Phase 4 (drilling completed in 2024 with first oil expected in early 2025) and the Penglai phases, while maintaining its overall Asia‑Pacific production share at roughly 4 % of consolidated liquids and 2 % of natural gas.",

By 2024, the disclosure no longer mentioned the Pending ATC TIPL Transaction, suggesting that the company had either completed or abandoned this specific agreement, and instead focused on broader financing activities and debt service obligations without tying them to a named transaction. This evolution reflects a shift from a transaction-specific risk to a more generalized disclosure around leverage and financing.",
      "llm_answer": "The discussion of AMT’s substantial leverage and debt‑service obligations was moved from a forward‑looking statement in the 2023 filing to an explicit risk disclosure in the 2024 filing, reflecting heightened concern about the company’s ability to service its debt amid the pending sale of its India business and the associated $2.5 billion consideration. Consequently, the 2024 10‑K places greater emphasis on the risks tied to its leverage, noting that the leverage could materially affect liquidity and that any adverse changes in cash‑flow from operations or the timing of the ATC TIPL transaction could strain debt‑service capacity.",

By fiscal year 2024, while the segment still includes GeForce GPUs for gaming, its strategic positioning has expanded to include broader AI applications, such as Omniverse Enterprise software for industrial AI and digital twin applications, and it now plays a more integrated role in NVIDIA's AI-driven computing platforms. The segment's evolution reflects a shift from being primarily consumer-focused to being more deeply embedded in enterprise and AI workflows.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal year 2022 through fiscal 2024, the Graphics segment’s revenue contribution has continued to shrink relative to the overall company, while its strategic positioning has shifted toward a more focused, niche role within NVIDIA’s broader portfolio.  The segment—encompassing GeForce gaming GPUs, RTX graphics, vGPU software, and Omniverse enterprise tools—still generates a sizable absolute revenue base but now represents a smaller share of total sales, reflecting the rapid growth of the Compute & Networking (Data‑Center/AI) segment driven by Mellanox‑derived networking, DPUs, and the Blackwell architecture.  Consequently, Graphics is now positioned primarily as the company’s consumer‑facing, gaming‑and‑professional‑visualization engine, whereas the Compute & Networking segment has become the primary growth engine and the main contributor to revenue and profitability.",

In contrast, the prior growth from 2022 to 2023 was modest, rising only $14 million (1%).

      "original_answer": "In 2023, COP capitalized appraisal drilling costs as part of its successful efforts method of accounting, suspending exploratory well costs on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of economically recoverable reserves. If appraisal drilling and seismic work continued to indicate potential, these costs could remain capitalized for several years. By 2024, COP disclosed that appraisal drilling was complete in certain areas, with costs now being incurred to assess development, while additional appraisal wells were still planned in other areas. This indicates a shift from capitalizing uncertain exploration costs to actively evaluating development feasibility, reflecting a more mature phase in those projects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips’ treatment of appraisal drilling costs shifted from capitalizing suspended exploratory well costs (recorded as “Exploratory well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year” in 2023) to a more explicit distinction in 2024 between costs capitalized for ≤1 year ($33M) and >1 year ($163M), with $196M ending balance—reflecting ongoing appraisal drilling (e.g., Malaysia, Alaska) that remains suspended pending reserve evaluation, though still capitalized until determination of economic viability. Disclosure practices evolved to include detailed aging of suspended costs (e.g., 2021–2023: $19M; 2018–2020: $114M; 2017 and prior: $30M) and explicit note that appraisal drilling costs are capitalized \"on the balance sheet pending further evaluation,\" with no material change in capitalization policy, but enhanced transparency on project-specific suspensions and future capital needs.",

By 2024, NEE had transitioned toward a more structured and larger-scale use of equity units and debentures through NEECH, issuing $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion in equity units in June and October 2024, respectively, and later selling $4.5 billion in fixed-rate and $500 million in floating-rate debentures in February 2025. This reflects a strategic shift from project-based commitments to more complex capital market instruments involving NEECH as a financing vehicle.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, NEECH's equity financing strategy evolved through multiple debt issuances tied to its equity unit programs. In 2022, it completed a $1.5 billion remarketing of Series J Debentures (4.255% interest) tied to September 2019 equity units, issuing 21.6 million shares of NEE common stock upon settlement. In 2023, it remarketed $2.5 billion of Series K Debentures (6.051% interest) from February 2020 equity units, issuing 33.4 million shares, and $2.0 billion of Series L Debentures (5.749% interest) from September 2020 units, issuing 27.3 million shares. In March 2024, NEECH issued $1.0 billion in exchangeable senior notes due 2027 (5.35% interest), using $52 million of proceeds for capped call transactions to offset potential exchange obligations. These actions reflect a structured approach to raising capital through debt instruments linked to equity units, with maturities extending through 2029 and interest rates adjusted to current market conditions.

This indicates that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, as the cost of amortizing its content library grew year-over-year. The increase in content amortization suggests that Netflix is either producing or licensing more high-cost content, or extending the availability windows of existing content, which results in higher ongoing amortization expenses.",

      "original_answer": "BlackRock's revenue from Fixed Income ETFs increased from $1,230 million in 2023 to $1,367 million in 2024, indicating a growing emphasis and success in this product category. This upward trend suggests that Fixed Income ETFs became more integral to BlackRock's revenue stream over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "BlackRock's financial performance related to Fixed Income ETFs shows strong growth in both AUM and revenue. Fixed income ETFs represented 30% of long-term AUM at year-end 2023 and generated $1,367 million in revenue in 2023 (up from $1,230 million in 2022), with $112 billion in net inflows during 2023. This growth, combined with the company's overall 11% CAGR in total AUM over five years, indicates a sustained upward trajectory for Fixed Income ETFs as a key growth driver within BlackRock's diversified product portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company reported $17.8 billion in market-based contracts for commodity product purchases, while in 2024, this figure decreased slightly to $16.8 billion. This represents a $1.0 billion reduction in exposure to market-based commodity contracts year-over-year. The slight decline suggests a more cautious or strategic adjustment in procurement commitments, potentially reflecting a shift toward more stable or long-term agreements, or a response to market volatility and pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's exposure to market-based contracts for commodity product purchases increased significantly from 2023 to 2024, rising from $17.8 billion in purchase obligations related to market-based contracts in 2023 to $16.8 billion in 2024 (as disclosed in the \"Capital Requirements\" section of the 2024 10-K).

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEE's equity units carried total annual distribution rates of 4.872% and 5.279%, with debenture interest rates of 2.10% and 1.84%, respectively. By 2024, the distribution rates had increased significantly to 7.299% and 7.234%, with corresponding debenture interest rates rising to 5.15% and 4.635%. This indicates a notable shift in the financial structure of these instruments, reflecting potentially higher financing costs or altered market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, NEE's equity units—specifically the NEECH debentures embedded within these units—evolved through scheduled interest resets tied to market conditions and refinancing activities. In 2022, the Series J Debentures (part of September 2019 equity units) were remarketed with a reset interest rate of 4.255% annually, up from the prior 2.10% rate, reflecting rising market rates. By 2023, the Series K Debentures (from February 2020 units) reset to 6.051%, and in 2024, the Series L Debentures (September 2020 units) reset to 5.749%, while the newly issued Series N and O Debentures (2022 and 2024 equity units) carried interest rates of 4.60% and 4.635%, respectively, with resets planned for 2025 and 2027. These adjustments maintained distribution rates aligned with prevailing market conditions, ensuring consistent annual distributions of approximately 6.926% (Series M), 7.299% (Series N), and 7.234% (Series O) through interest payments and stock purchase contract obligations. The underlying debenture interest rates directly influenced the fixed-income component of equity unit distributions, with rates increasing over time to reflect higher market benchmarks.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, AbbVie consistently expensed business valuation costs as incurred in connection with business combinations. However, the 2024 disclosure includes a more detailed emphasis on the treatment of contingent consideration liabilities, noting that 'subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings.' This evolution in disclosure suggests a more transparent or refined approach to communicating the financial impact of post-acquisition adjustments, potentially indicating a shift toward more complex acquisitions with greater contingent payment structures.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie's treatment of business valuation costs in relation to business combinations has evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024. In 2023, business valuation costs (including legal, due diligence, and business valuation fees) were explicitly stated as being \"expensed when incurred\" under Note 2's \"Business Combinations\" section. However, in the 2024 filing (Note 2), this language was removed, and the focus shifted to the accounting for acquired IPR&D and milestones, with no mention of expensing valuation costs. Instead, the 2024 document emphasizes that these costs are now part of the broader acquisition accounting framework, where fair value assessments for assets/liabilities and IPR&D are capitalized or expensed based on specific criteria (e.g., regulatory approval timelines), but valuation costs themselves are not highlighted as a separate expense category. This shift indicates a more integrated approach to acquisition accounting, where valuation costs are likely subsumed under the broader \"business combination\" methodology rather than being explicitly tracked or expensed as a distinct line item, reflecting a streamlined accounting practice that aligns with standard GAAP requirements for business combinations without isolating valuation costs as a separate expense. This evolution suggests AbbVie is refining its acquisition strategy to more closely align with GAAP's acquisition method, focusing on the economic substance of acquired assets rather than discrete cost categorization.",

By 2023, the company's variable-rate debt had shifted significantly to $200 million maturing in 2024, with no debt scheduled for 2025 onward, and the average interest rate increased to 6.0% for 2024. This indicates a substantial reduction in variable-rate debt exposure and a rise in borrowing costs in the later year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2022 and 2023 10-K excerpts, CMCSA's variable-rate debt composition and interest rate evolution are as follows:\n\n1.  **2022 Variable-Rate Debt Maturity Profile**: The company had $500 million of variable-rate debt maturing in 2024 and $3,148 million maturing thereafter (total $3,648 million), with an average interest rate of 4.0% (as shown in the 2021 table, reflecting rates as of Dec 31, 2021, but representing the structure for future years).\n\n2.  **2023 Evolution & Maturity Shift**: By 2023, the variable-rate debt maturity profile shifted significantly, with $500 million maturing in 2024 (as noted in the 2023 table under \"Variable-rate debt\" for 2024), and the total variable-rate debt outstanding decreased to $0.2 billion (likely reflecting repayments or reclassifications), though the text indicates a $5.2 billion variable-rate term loan was repaid in December 2023. The average interest rate on remaining variable-rate debt was 6.0% (as per the 2023 table).\n\n3.  **Interest Rate Trends**: The average interest rates on variable-rate debt increased from 4.0% (as of Dec 31, 2021, per 2021 table) to 6.0% (as of Dec 31, 2023, per 2023 table), reflecting rising market rates. This is further supported by the 2023 interest rate risk disclosure noting a $56 million decrease in interest expense in 2023 (compared to $66 million in 2022), indicating the impact of higher rates on derivative instruments.\n\n**In summary, CMCSA's variable-rate debt matured primarily in 2024 ($500M in 2024, $3.1B thereafter in 2022 structure, though reduced by 2023 repayment), and its average interest rate rose from 4.0% (2021 baseline) to 6.0% (2023), reflecting broader market rate increases.** The 2023 table confirms the remaining variable-rate debt structure and the higher rates applied to new maturities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Block SB405 was described as an 'operated exploration block acquired in 2021' with no mention of plans to relinquish or pause exploration. By 2024, the company had completed a 3D seismic survey (acquired in 2022) and processed the data, but in the fourth quarter of 2024, it elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration and relinquished the block. This indicates a strategic decision to exit the block after initial evaluation yielded insufficient promise.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, ConocoPhillips shifted its exploration strategy in Block SB405 from active development to a strategic pause. In 2023, the company held an 85% working interest in the block and completed a 3D seismic survey, but by the fourth quarter of 2024, it elected not to proceed to the second phase of exploration and relinquished the block. This decision reflects a strategic pivot away from further investment in SB405, contrasting with its continued focus on other operated blocks like Block SK304 and Block WL4-00, where exploration activities remain ongoing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the residual growth rates for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were aligned with brand operating plans and approximated expected long-term category market growth rates. By 2024, the residual growth rates remained conceptually similar but were now explicitly stated to depend on additional factors such as grooming habit changes and sustained deceleration in category growth. This evolution in assumptions reflects increased sensitivity to market dynamics, which contributed to the $1.3 billion impairment charge recorded in 2024 due to a higher discount rate, currency devaluation, and restructuring impacts. The 2024 analysis also introduced a more explicit sensitivity to a 25 basis-point decrease in residual growth rates, indicating a heightened risk of future impairment.",
      "llm_answer": "The assumptions for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset’s residual growth rates were revised downward in 2024, reflecting expectations of slower long-term category growth, heightened competitive pressures, and adverse currency movements. This reduction directly lowered the estimated fair value of the asset, triggering a $1.3 billion non‑cash impairment charge ( $1.0 billion after tax) and increasing the asset’s impairment risk, as future cash‑flow projections now have a smaller cushion before falling below carrying value.",

      "llm_answer": "The net carrying amount of acquired trade secrets and processes decreased from $2.8 million in 2022 to $0.3 million in 2024, reflecting the full amortization of the $27.6 million gross carrying amount over two years and no remaining balance thereafter. This trend indicates that Starbucks is amortizing this intangible asset over a very short useful life, resulting in rapid expense recognition and essentially zero book value by the end of 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had an operating lease with Piedmont with a weighted average remaining lease term of 5 years and a weighted average discount rate of 3.6%. By 2024, Duke Energy disclosed that its total remaining performance obligations for Piedmont amounted to $405 million, with $64 million due in 2025 and decreasing annually until $151 million in 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from a short-term lease-based relationship to a more structured, multi-year financial commitment with defined performance obligations.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the lease maturity tables in the 2022 and 2024 10-K filings, Duke Energy's total operating lease payments for Piedmont declined from $5 million in 2022 to $5 million in 2024 (remaining flat), but the remaining performance obligations under those leases decreased—reflected by the lower operating lease payments in the 2024 column ($5 million vs. $5 million in 2022) and the reduced future periods shown for 2023‑2024—indicating a modest evolution in commitment over the two‑year span.",

In 2023, this revenue increased to $803 million, driven by a rise in both U.S. revenue to $433 million and international revenue to $370 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Mondelēz explicitly excluded contingent consideration adjustments from its non-GAAP financial measures, noting in the footnotes that these adjustments were added to the non-GAAP definitions starting in the third quarter of 2021 to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance. By 2024, the company not only continued to exclude these adjustments from non-GAAP metrics but also provided a concrete financial figure—$60 million in contingent consideration adjustments were excluded in 2023 as part of the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. This shows that while the policy of exclusion remained consistent, the company evolved its reporting by quantifying the impact of these adjustments in 2024, offering greater transparency into their financial effect.",
      "llm_answer": "Mondelēz International began including contingent consideration adjustments in its non‑GAAP Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted EPS calculations starting in 2021 (as disclosed in the 2021 Form 10‑K footnote 2). In 2023, the company specifically adjusted for these items—recording a $0.14 per‑share impact in Adjusted EPS and a $110 million benefit in Adjusted Operating Income—reflecting the resolution of acquisition‑related contingent consideration liabilities. Consequently, while the adjustments were excluded from GAAP results, they were incorporated into the non‑GAAP measures to present a clearer view of underlying performance, with the 2023 impact being a positive $0.14 to Adjusted EPS and $110 million to Adjusted Operating Income.",

By 2024, this amount had increased to $48 million, indicating a significant growth in the financial benefits derived from the licensing arrangement.

Consolidated AFFO itself is defined as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) adjusted for a range of items—including straight‑line revenue, stock‑based compensation, deferred taxes, non‑real‑estate depreciation, amortization of financing costs, and cash capital‑improvement payments—while AFFO (common stockholders) strips out the noncontrolling‑interest effect to isolate the equity‑holder portion.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Comcast’s approach to valuing and testing impairment of cable franchise rights shifted from performing quantitative assessments roughly every four years (as noted in the 2022 filing) to relying primarily on qualitative assessments in 2024, conducting quantitative testing only when the qualitative review indicated a potential impairment—such as in the Media segment’s goodwill, where a quantitative test was performed and found no impairment. The company continues to use the same unit of account (cable franchise rights as a whole) and applies a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, but quantitative assessments are now less frequent and triggered only when necessary.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment of $(3) million, indicating a slight negative adjustment. However, in 2024, this figure shifted significantly to $(28) million, showing a much stronger negative impact on the company's financials. This indicates that AIG's claims management or reserving practices may have faced unforeseen challenges in 2024, leading to a larger-than-expected increase in loss adjustment expenses from prior years.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior‑year development declined markedly from 2023 to 2024 – falling from **$21 million** in 2023 to **$13 million** in 2024 – a reduction of roughly **$8 million** (about a 38 % decrease).  \n\nThis drop signals that the company is experiencing less unfavorable development in its loss‑adjustment reserves than in the prior year, suggesting improved claims‑management or reserving practices and a more favorable emergence of loss development trends.",

By 2024, the company maintained a similar framework but placed a more explicit emphasis on 'past payment experience' as a core component of its credit risk assessment, suggesting a strategic refinement in prioritizing historical payment behavior in determining creditworthiness.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ disclosed that definite-life intangible assets were evaluated for impairment in the same manner as other long-lived assets and that amortization occurred over their estimated useful lives. By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure to include specific details about impairment testing, such as performing undiscounted operating cash flow analyses at the lowest identifiable asset group level and calculating impairment losses as the excess of an asset's carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is determined using discounted cash flows or expected proceeds less disposal costs. This evolution indicates a more detailed and structured approach to impairment evaluation in 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the treatment of definite-life intangible assets evolved in two key ways: (1) impairment testing became more rigorous, requiring ongoing review for recoverability and impairment when indicators arise, with impairment losses calculated as the excess of carrying value over estimated fair value (using discounted cash flows or expected cash proceeds); and (2) amortization policies were updated to align with the asset's estimated useful life, with definite-life intangibles amortized on a straight-line basis over that period, consistent with other long-lived assets. These changes were disclosed in the 2024 10-K (pages 75-79) and were consistent with prior practices described in 2022 (pages 89-93), though the 2024 filing expanded the scope to include new highly inflationary economies (Egypt and Nigeria) affecting overall financial statement impacts.",

In 2023, the expense increased significantly to $191 million, with $171 million utilized or paid, leaving a remaining liability of $105 million. This indicates a transformation in the company's utilization and funding approach, shifting from a relatively modest expense and moderate utilization in 2022 to a much higher expense and substantial utilization in 2023, suggesting a more active management or restructuring of severance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "The document does not provide specific quantitative data on the utilization and expense patterns for Severance and benefits between 2022 and 2023. However, it indicates that restructuring expenses related to severance and benefits decreased from $46 million in 2022 to $191 million in 2023 (as shown in the restructuring liability table), with $79 million utilized/paid in 2022 and $171 million utilized/paid in 2023. This suggests a significant increase in severance-related expenses and utilization in 2023 compared to 2022, potentially reflecting heightened workforce restructuring activities. The text also notes that 2022 included approximately 2,200 workforce reductions, while 2023 actions involved about 2,250 positions, indicating expanded restructuring efforts.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Licensed Stores Revenue increased by $972 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales and royalty revenues, including a significant contribution from the conversion of the Korea market to a fully licensed model. By fiscal 2024, Licensed Stores Revenue had reached $2,747.4 million, accounting for 10.2% of North America Total Net Revenues, up slightly from $2,659.1 million or 10.0% in fiscal 2023. This indicates a continuation of growth, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the substantial year-over-year increase in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Licensed Stores revenue grew sharply in absolute terms—rising from $3.66 billion in FY 2022 to $1.77 billion in FY 2024 (a net increase of roughly $1.1 billion over the two‑year span, driven by higher product and royalty income and new store openings).  However, as a share of total net revenue, Licensed Stores declined from about 12.6 % of total revenue in FY 2022 to roughly 5.5 % in FY 2024, indicating that while the dollar amount grew, its proportional contribution to the company’s overall revenue base shrank.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Veralto Distribution contributed approximately $2.6 billion in cash to Danaher, a portion of which was used to redeem certain outstanding indebtedness. By 2024, the distribution had a residual impact on accumulated comprehensive income, with a reported $974 million credit to the Accumulated Comprehensive Income (Loss) account as part of the comprehensive income reconciliation. This indicates that while the immediate liquidity benefit was realized in 2023, the 2024 figures reflect the ongoing financial restructuring and capital optimization effects of the distribution, particularly in terms of balance sheet adjustments and long-term investment positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the Veralto Distribution on Danaher's comprehensive income shifted from a $543 million earnings gain (net of tax) in 2023 to an $881 million gain in 2022 and $986 million in 2021, indicating that the disposal contributed a substantial but declining positive effect on earnings. This trend suggests that while the distribution initially provided a notable boost to comprehensive income, its long‑term contribution is diminishing, implying that future earnings will rely more on Danaher’s ongoing operations rather than the one‑time gain from the Veralto sale.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had a $400 million unsecured debt issuance linked to Piedmont. By 2024, this relationship had transformed from a debt-based connection to one involving performance obligations, with Duke disclosing a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations related to Piedmont, spread across 2025 through 'Thereafter'. This indicates a shift from direct debt financing to contractual performance-based financial commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed debt maturities and commitments across the 2022–2024 timeframe, Duke Energy's financial relationship with Piedmont has evolved through increased long-term debt obligations tied to specific strategic initiatives. Piedmont's long-term debt maturities rose from $40 million in 2022 to $40 million in 2023 and $205 million in 2024 (reflecting new issuances like the $350 million March 2021 unsecured debt and $40 million maturity in 2024), while its available credit capacity under Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility declined from $228 million (2021) to $228 million in 2021 but was reduced by $472 million in commercial paper backstop usage, indicating tighter financing flexibility. Additionally, Piedmont's debt issuances were explicitly tied to storm restoration financing (e.g., November 2021 secured debt for Hurricane Florence/Michael/Dorian/Diego recovery), and its total long-term debt obligations increased from $2.99 billion (2021) to $2,660 million in 2024, reflecting ongoing reliance on Duke Energy's credit infrastructure for funding.",

By 2023, the company had incurred total cumulative charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 for the same integration plan. This indicates that the integration efforts extended beyond initial cost estimates, reflecting potentially more complex integration activities or expanded restructuring initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, AbbVie’s cumulative charges related to the Allergan integration plan declined sharply—from $696 million in 2022 to $288 million in 2023—reflecting that most integration costs were incurred earlier and only a residual amount remains. The decreasing expense indicates that the company has largely completed its integration activities, with only minor ongoing charges now being recorded.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MDLZ excluded the impact from pension participation changes as part of the adjustments to derive Adjusted Operating Income, but did not provide a specific dollar amount for this exclusion. By 2024, MDLZ explicitly disclosed the pension participation changes as a quantified item with an impact of $(3) million that was excluded from Adjusted EPS calculations. This represents a shift from a general exclusion to a specific, numerically disclosed adjustment, indicating more transparent and detailed reporting of pension-related impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "MDLZ’s disclosures show that pension participation changes were excluded from non‑GAAP results beginning in 2022 (as noted in Note 11 of the 2022 filing) and continued to be omitted in 2023 and 2024, with the related charge consistently reported as a separate non‑GAAP adjustment in the Adjusted Operating Income tables for each year.

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points, mainly due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, DD&A expenses had a negative impact on COP's earnings, primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions resulting from increased costs and higher overall production volumes. This contributed to a net income (loss) decrease of $7,723 million. By 2024, DD&A expenses were reported at $9,599 million, up from $8,270 million in 2023, indicating a continued rise in these costs. While the explicit negative impact was not reiterated in 2024, the increase in absolute dollar terms suggests that DD&A remained a growing pressure point for the company, likely tied to sustained high production volumes and ongoing reserve adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of DD&A expenses on ConocoPhillips' financial performance evolved from a $766 million increase in 2023—driven by higher reserve‑revision rates and greater production volumes—to an additional $1.33 billion rise in 2024, reflecting even higher volumes, higher DD&A rates from further reserve revisions, and the effect of the Marathon Oil acquisition. This upward trend signals that the company’s cost structure is being pressured by both higher production (especially in the Lower 48 and Canada) and higher depletion, depreciation and amortization rates tied to reserve re‑valuations, indicating that while output is growing, the rising DD&A expense is a growing drag on profitability and reflects a shift toward higher‑cost, higher‑volume production.",

      "question": "How has Comcast's approach to impairment testing for owned content evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of the basis for estimating fair value and the level of specificity in impairment assessments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Comcast primarily used a discounted cash flow analysis involving significant judgment and market participant estimates of future cash flows, supported by internal forecasts, to estimate fair value for impairment testing of owned content. By 2024, the company continued to assess fair value using Level 3 inputs, but with a more detailed emphasis on market participant estimates of future cash flows and a more structured approach to impairment assessments, including evaluating content either individually or in identified film groups depending on monetization strategy. Additionally, 2024 introduced a more nuanced explanation of impairment triggers, including events or changes in circumstances known or knowable as of the balance sheet date, and clarified the treatment of abandoned content, which is now recorded as substantively abandoned in programming and production costs. This represents a moderate transformation in methodology and specificity.",
      "llm_answer": "Comcast's approach to impairment testing for owned content has evolved to increase specificity and shift toward more granular assessment methods. In 2022, impairment testing for film and television content was conducted on an individual title basis for owned content and on a channel/network/platform basis for licensed content, with fair value estimated using discounted cash flow analyses that relied on significant judgment, including market participant cash flow forecasts and discount rates. By 2024, this methodology remained consistent but was refined to emphasize individual title evaluation for owned content and more precise grouping of cable franchise rights into division-level units of account, while still using discounted cash flow models with Level 3 inputs for fair value estimation. The company continues to prioritize qualitative assessments when fair values substantially exceed carrying values, but quantitative testing now requires more detailed assumptions about future cash flows and market conditions to determine impairment triggers.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Starbucks recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to its Reinvention Plan, which focused on increasing efficiency and improving the customer experience. Additionally, the company had completed a prior restructuring plan in fiscal 2021 that included $155.4 million in restructuring and impairments, primarily from store closures and lease-related costs. By fiscal 2024, Starbucks reported no restructuring and impairments charges, in contrast to fiscal 2023, which had a $1.1 million charge. This indicates a reduction in impairment activity and a stabilization of restructuring efforts following the earlier strategic changes.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and 2024, Starbucks' restructuring and impairment approach shifted from major, one-time actions to more targeted, limited charges. In 2022, the company recorded an immaterial impairment charge related to its Reinvention Plan restructuring, while fiscal 2021 saw significant $155.4 million in restructuring and impairment charges tied to store portfolio repositioning and lease asset write-downs. By fiscal 2024, impairment charges were no longer material, as evidenced by the absence of restructuring/impairment amounts in the current period and the focus on operational efficiency rather than large-scale asset write-downs. The strategic focus evolved from aggressive store closures and portfolio repositioning to incremental efficiency initiatives, with impairment risk now primarily tied to specific store-level assessments rather than broad portfolio changes.

By 2024, this figure significantly worsened to $(28) million, showing a substantial negative development. This suggests that AIG experienced greater-than-anticipated loss adjustment expenses in 2024, which could signal challenges in accurately forecasting or managing claims-related costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT amortized its acquired intangible assets, including tenant-related intangibles, on a straight-line basis over a weighted average period of 15 years. By 2024, the company extended the estimated useful lives of certain intangible assets, aligning them more closely with the 30-year estimated useful life of tower assets. This change in accounting estimate, effective January 1, 2024, led to a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense by approximately $730 million for the year. The evolution reflects a strategic shift in how the company accounts for and values tenant-related intangibles in relation to long-term tower asset utilization.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, AMT revised its treatment of tenant-related intangibles by extending the estimated useful life from up to 20 years to a weighted-average remaining period of 15 years, and it now amortizes these intangibles on a straight-line basis over that revised life. The company also updated its methodology for assessing impairment and renewal assumptions for these intangibles, reflecting more granular tenant-level analysis and updated renewal probability estimates. This change resulted in a more conservative amortization schedule and impacted the net book value of tenant-related intangibles, which decreased slightly from $13,113.5 million in 2022 to $12,195.9 million in 2023.",

These costs were included in other deferred charges and assets on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2024, the company noted that amortization of these costs was immaterial for Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in the years 2024, 2023, and 2022. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of accounting treatment in 2022 to a more specific, quantitative assessment of materiality across subsidiaries by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Southern Company's treatment of deferred cloud implementation costs has evolved from 2022 to 2024 with increased amortization and materiality across subsidiaries. In 2022, deferred cloud costs were $162M (Southern Co), $38M (Alabama Power), $58M (Georgia Power), and $7M (Mississippi Power); by 2024, these rose to $321M (Southern Co), $92M (Alabama Power), $111M (Georgia Power), and $13M (Mississippi Power), reflecting higher capitalization of implementation costs. Amortization began once hosted software was placed into service, with $56M recognized in 2024 (Southern Co), and the costs are now material enough to be disclosed separately in Note 2 under \"Regulatory Assets and Liabilities,\" though Mississippi Power's amortization remains immaterial. The 2024 amortization schedule shows remaining performance obligations for cloud-related contracts will be recognized through 2029, with $937M expected in 2025 alone.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's Gross Profit Rate increased by 51 basis points, primarily due to price management in response to cost inflation and a favorable merchandise mix, including the impact of lapping temporary closures of Auto Care and Vision Centers. In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This reflects a significant shift in the trajectory of the Gross Profit Rate, moving from a period of improvement in 2022 to a decline in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased from 24.4% in fiscal 2022 to 23.7% in fiscal 2023, representing a 70 basis point decline. The key drivers of this change were lower gross profit margins in the Walmart U.S. segment due to increased supply chain costs and merchandise mix shifts into lower-margin categories, as well as the impact of currency fluctuations and the divestiture of international operations. These factors partially offset gains from price management and cost control initiatives.",

In October 2023, the company completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd. for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), bringing its total ownership to 100%. This marked a significant shift in its involvement in Surmont, transitioning from a joint interest to full ownership.",

In February 2024 the company announced a $9 billion shareholder‑return framework that includes a $2.7 billion debt issuance to fund the Surmont acquisition and a $1.1 billion debt refinancing to repurchase existing debt, underscoring the financial commitment tied to the Surmont transaction.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, cloud services revenues represented 32% of Oracle's total revenues, which increased to 37% in fiscal 2024. This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on cloud-based offerings and aligns with Oracle's corporate strategy of providing customer choice in deployment models. The increase suggests a successful pivot toward cloud adoption, with customer demand for Oracle Cloud Services rising and a corresponding decline in reliance on traditional revenue streams such as hardware and on-premise licenses.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Oracle's cloud services revenues (included within the \"Cloud and license\" business segment) grew from $41,086 million in fiscal 2023 to $44,464 million in fiscal 2024, representing an 8% increase. This growth elevated the proportion of cloud services revenues relative to total revenues from 83% (fiscal 2023) to 84% (fiscal 2024), reflecting a strategic shift toward higher-margin cloud offerings. The document explicitly states that cloud services revenues represented 37% of total revenues in fiscal 2024 (up from 32% in fiscal 2023 and 25% in fiscal 2022), confirming an accelerating transition to cloud-based revenue streams. This shift suggests Oracle is prioritizing cloud growth to drive higher operating margins (which increased to 29% in fiscal 2024 from 26% in fiscal 2023), as cloud services typically carry higher margins than hardware or services, and is likely a deliberate strategy to enhance profitability and reduce reliance on lower-margin hardware.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and recognition of Licensed Content Costs evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of amortization methodology and asset classification?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, CMCSA recognized licensed content costs by capitalizing them when the license period began, the content was made available for use, and the costs were known, with amortization occurring as the associated programs were broadcast. Additionally, licensed content was tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network, or platform basis, except for broadcast networks and local stations, which were tested on a daypart basis. By 2024, the company maintained the capitalization criteria but refined the amortization methodology by incorporating 'estimated viewing patterns' into the process. Also in 2024, CMCSA explicitly classified licensed content as noncurrent assets under 'film and television costs' and clarified that production costs incurred in advance of airing are included in licensed content. The 2024 filing also introduced more detailed descriptions of co-financing arrangements and tax incentives, which were absent in 2022. These changes indicate a more nuanced and structured approach to licensed content asset management and cost recognition over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the treatment of Licensed Content Costs evolved in two key ways: (1) Amortization methodology shifted from recognizing licensed content costs over the contract term based on estimated relative value to amortizing them as the associated programs are broadcast, incorporating estimated viewing patterns; (2) Asset classification remained as licensed content but with enhanced impairment testing—content is assessed individually (for owned) or by channel/network (for licensed), using discounted cash flow models with Level 3 inputs, and impairment charges are recorded when unamortized costs exceed fair value. The 2024 filing confirms this approach aligns with prior years, emphasizing that licensed content is not subject to impairment except when fair value falls below carrying value.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, TXN disclosed that its expected long-term rate of return assumptions were based on future expectations for returns by asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. By 2024, the company clarified that it actively rebalances the plans' investments specifically when they fall outside the target allocation ranges, indicating a more defined and action-oriented approach to asset management. This reflects a shift from a general disclosure of rebalancing practices to a more prescriptive and rule-based strategy tied directly to the target ranges.",
      "llm_answer": "The target allocation ranges for the defined‑benefit plans remained unchanged from 2023 to 2024 – fixed‑income and cash equivalents were targeted at 60‑80 % (U.S.) and 60‑100 % (non‑U.S.), while equity was targeted at 20‑35 % (U.S.) and 0‑40 % (non‑U.S.) – but the company rebalanced assets when allocations drifted outside these ranges. Consequently, the weighted‑average actual allocations shifted slightly: U.S. defined‑benefit plans moved from 65 % fixed income / 35 % equity in 2023 to about 61 % fixed income / 39 % equity in 2024, while non‑U.S. plans stayed near 77 % fixed income / 23 % equity. This evolution reflects the ongoing use of asset‑liability modeling to match interest‑rate sensitivity while keeping investments within the prescribed target ranges.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $94 million, indicating a net negative impact on reserves from prior year adjustments. In 2024, this figure changed significantly to a negative impact of $28 million. This represents a substantial reduction in the magnitude of prior year development, suggesting that AIG's reserving practices may have become more accurate or that claims settlements for prior years were more favorable than previously estimated.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior‑year development improved markedly from 2023 to 2024, falling from **$57 million** in 2023 to **$32 million** in 2024. This reduction indicates that the company is releasing less reserve for pending loss‑adjustment costs, reflecting tighter claims management and a more favorable development trend in its reserving practices.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth was 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact remained at 1.0% compared to the prior year. However, this consistency occurred in the context of a significant shift in total sales growth performance—implying a growing relative influence of currency effects as overall growth slowed. In 2023, the company experienced total sales growth of 1.5%, with currency exchange rates contributing positively at 1.0%. In contrast, by 2024, total sales growth turned into a decline of 2.0%, while the currency impact remained unchanged at 1.0%. This suggests that despite the company's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations remaining constant, the importance of this factor in the broader context of sales performance increased as overall growth weakened.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a 4.5% drag in 2022 to a 1.0% drag in 2023, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies during 2023. This indicates Danaher remains significantly exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, as currency movements continue to materially affect reported sales growth across all segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported $2.3 billion in structural cost savings realized during the year, contributing to a cumulative total of $9.7 billion since 2019. These savings were attributed to increased operational efficiencies, reduced staffing costs, and initiatives such as supply chain optimization and improved maintenance. By 2024, the company formalized 'Structural Cost Savings' as a defined earnings driver, explicitly incorporating it into its financial reporting framework to provide greater transparency into its cost management performance. This shift indicates that XOM elevated structural cost savings from an internal efficiency metric to a strategic financial reporting category, aligning it with other key earnings drivers like advantaged volume growth and base volume. The change reflects a broader strategic emphasis on sustaining cost discipline as a core component of earnings power.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, ExxonMobil's structural cost savings accelerated significantly, with $2.3 billion of savings realized in 2023 alone and additional opportunities identified in areas like supply chain efficiency, maintenance, and data modernization. This reflects a strategic focus on sustaining cost discipline through operational efficiencies and technology, even as the company expands into lower-emission investments and faces evolving policy landscapes. The company's cost management strategy emphasizes leveraging scale and integration to drive long-term earnings resilience amid market volatility.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's relationship with Piedmont was characterized by an allocation of 4% of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets, indicating a relatively minor role in the company's pension and post-retirement benefit structure. By 2024, Piedmont had a significantly different profile in Duke Energy's disclosures, with a total of $405 million in remaining performance obligations attributed to it, showing a growing financial commitment or operational involvement with Piedmont. This evolution reflects a shift from a minor stakeholder role in retirement funding to a more substantial contractual obligation.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed asset allocation trends in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, Piedmont's allocated share of the trust declined from $2 million in 2022 to $2 million in 2023 and remained $2 million in 2024, reflecting a stable but minimal exposure as the overall trust shifted toward lower‑risk liability‑hedging assets (60% by 2022 target) and reduced return‑seeking allocations. This evolution indicates that Piedmont’s financial relationship with Duke Energy has become increasingly peripheral, with its portion of the pension assets staying constant while the broader fund’s risk profile shifted.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company amortized tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, with a weighted average amortization period of 15 years as of December 31, 2023. These intangibles were directly tied to tenant contracts and relationships at the time of acquisition. By 2024, the company's disclosures expanded to emphasize a more detailed impairment review process for tenant-related intangibles, assessing them on a tenant-by-tenant basis for indicators such as high turnover, non-renewal of contracts, or customer financial instability. The company also began determining recoverability based on projected undiscounted future cash flows and measuring impairment losses using discounted cash flows or market data. This marks a shift from a purely amortization-focused approach to a more dynamic model involving periodic impairment assessments.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment and evaluation of tenant-related intangibles remained consistent in methodology but evolved in practice from 2023 to 2024, particularly in amortization assumptions and impairment review processes. The Company continues to amortize tenant-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of up to 20 years, consistent with prior periods, but refined its assessment of renewal options and economic factors when determining useful lives and cash flow projections. Impairment reviews now incorporate more granular tenant-level analysis and updated assumptions about lease renewals and attrition, especially following the $322 million goodwill impairment in India and $80 million in Spain in 2023, which were driven by third-party valuation inputs and revised cash flow forecasts reflecting higher weighted average cost of capital. These adjustments underscore a more rigorous, market-sensitive approach to evaluating the recoverability of tenant-related intangibles, particularly in high-risk or strategically reviewed markets.",

By 2023, the change in fair value again reflected higher estimated Skyrizi sales, but this was driven by stronger market share uptake and the passage of time in combination with lower discount rates. This indicates a more favorable outlook for Skyrizi sales in 2023 compared to 2022 due to improved market dynamics and a decrease in discount rates.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Skyrizi’s net revenues increased by 51%, driven by continued strong market share growth across all indications, partially offset by unfavorable pricing.

This acquisition was completed in October 2023. In 2024, the company disclosed that the final consideration for this Surmont acquisition was $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion) after customary adjustments, indicating a significant financial commitment to the asset.

      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024 ConocoPhillips’ stake in the Surmont oil‑sands asset was fully acquired in October 2023 (the remaining 50 % was bought from TotalEnergies EP Canada Ltd., giving the company a 100 % working interest). The company then continued to develop the asset, bringing Pad 267 on‑stream in December 2023 and planning first production from Pad 104 in 2025. In 2024 the firm also made a separate, non‑Surmont acquisition of an additional 5 % working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and a 0.4 % interest in the Prudhoe Bay Unit from Chevron and Union Oil for $296 million, further expanding its exposure to the North Slope. Thus, ConocoPhillips’ ownership in Surmont went from a 50 % stake (pre‑Oct 2023) to 100 % after the acquisition, and the company added incremental North Slope working‑interest assets in early 2024.",

By 2024, the company reported that the termination dates for these office leases now extend from 2025 to 2034. This indicates a multi-year extension in lease commitments, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term occupancy agreements for office spaces.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages for SPG (Simon Property Group), the company's fixed annual rental payment obligations under office leases have evolved as follows between 2022 and 2024:\n\n1.  **Termination Dates**: Office leases generally have termination dates ranging from **2023 to 2028**, with some ground leases extending to **2090** (including extension options that are reasonably assured). The specific lease commitments table shows future minimum lease payments due through 2029, with the \"Thereafter\" category including obligations beyond 2029.\n\n2.  **Evolution of Obligations**: The minimum fixed lease consideration under non-cancelable office leases is projected to increase annually:  \n    - **2022**: $32,838 thousand  \n    - **2023**: $32,979 thousand  \n    - **2024**: $33,114 thousand  \n    - **2025**: $33,124 thousand  \n    - **2026**: $33,138 thousand  \n    This indicates a gradual, steady increase in annual fixed obligations through 2026, with the \"Thereafter\" category showing a significant jump to $855,079 thousand (though this includes all obligations beyond 2026, not just office leases).\n\nThe document confirms that these obligations are part of operating leases classified under \"Lease Commitments\" (Note 10), with the fixed annual payments being a component of the broader lease structure that includes ground leases and office leases. The evolution reflects a consistent, incremental increase in the minimum fixed payments over the period, with the 2024 data showing the obligation extending through 2029 and beyond.",

      "question": "How did Linde's environmental protection costs and related financial expectations evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's approach to environmental compliance expenditures?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde stated that environmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant and anticipated that future annual expenditures would remain similar to 2021 levels unless there were significant regulatory changes. By 2024, the company reiterated that environmental protection costs for that year were not significant and expected future expenditures to remain consistent with 2024 levels, barring major regulatory shifts. This indicates that Linde's approach to environmental compliance has remained stable over the three-year period, with no substantial increase in spending anticipated despite growing global emphasis on climate change mitigation and stricter environmental regulations in key markets like the EU, U.S., and China.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde’s environmental protection costs remained “not significant” and were expected to stay at similar levels in future years, subject to changes in laws and regulations. The company continues to manage climate‑related risks through its Sustainability Committee, incorporates GHG provisions into contracts, and expects to recover increased energy costs from long‑term customers, indicating that environmental compliance expenditures are treated as manageable, non‑material components of its overall cost structure.",

      "question": "How did the shift in Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership from 2022 to 2023 reflect changes in its pricing strategy and international market focus, particularly given the constant currency adjustments?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $8.50, which decreased to $7.64 in 2023—a drop of $0.86 or 10%. This decline occurred alongside a constant currency adjustment of -6% in 2023, suggesting that foreign exchange rates were not the primary driver of the drop. Instead, the decrease indicates a deliberate shift in pricing strategy, potentially to attract more subscribers in emerging markets where affordability is a key factor. This aligns with Netflix's broader strategic pivot toward global expansion and subscriber growth over short-term revenue per user, as evidenced by the significant increase in paid net membership additions from 5,391 thousand in 2022 to 7,315 thousand in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership from $11.67 in 2022 to $11.64 in 2023 reflects a modest 1% decline, driven by strategic pricing adjustments and a deliberate shift toward international markets with lower price points. While constant currency analysis shows a 2% increase in revenue per membership (accounting for foreign exchange fluctuations), the overall dip stems from a higher proportion of new members in lower-priced international regions and limited price increases, offsetting growth in membership volume. This underscores Netflix's focus on global expansion over pure revenue per user growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $1 million. By 2024, this figure had changed to -$28 million, indicating a significant negative adjustment. This shift from a small positive adjustment to a substantial negative one suggests that AIG may have revised its prior estimates downward in 2024, reflecting either improved claims resolution or a reassessment of loss reserves that year.",
      "llm_answer": "The unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior‑year development shows a modest improvement in reserving discipline.  In 2023 the net ULAE prior‑year development was **$ (333) million**, down from **$ (313) million** in 2022—a reduction of roughly **$ 20 million** (about 6 %).  This decline indicates that AIG’s claims‑management and reserving practices are becoming slightly more efficient, as the estimated amount of unallocated loss‑adjustment expense needed to close prior‑year loss triangles is decreasing.  However, the magnitude of the change remains small relative to the overall loss reserve position, so while it suggests a positive trend, it does not yet signal a major shift in the company’s reserving approach.",

      "llm_answer": "The core sales decline in the Biotechnology segment deepened from a 18.0% drop in 2023 to a 4.5% decline in 2024, reflecting continued weakness in bioprocessing demand (particularly for COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccine inventory drawdowns) and tighter credit conditions affecting emerging biotech customers.

By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted focus from quantitative values to a more qualitative discussion around impairment risks and dependencies on uncertain assumptions. Specifically, the 2024 filing emphasized the sensitivity of Properties, Plant and Equipment valuations to volatile factors such as future commodity prices, carbon costs, production profiles, and regulatory changes. This reflects a strategic shift from reporting stable asset growth to highlighting increased exposure to external risks and uncertainties, particularly in the context of the energy transition and potential impairments.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of Properties, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) shows a continued reliance on depreciation and amortization based on proved reserves, with impairment reviews triggered by events such as reserve revisions, price outlooks, or regulatory changes. Valuation of PP&E remains closely tied to reserve estimates and cash‑flow projections, and the company assesses assets for impairment when carrying values exceed expected undiscounted cash flows. In 2023‑2024, deferred tax liabilities for PP&E increased (from $18,295 M to $20,303 M), reflecting higher tax bases, while valuation allowances for related deferred tax assets were maintained at $20,416 M, underscoring the risk that future tax benefits may not be realizable.",

By 2024, the company expanded its disclosure, noting that value-based arrangements at Optum Health involve receiving per-patient per-month premiums under single performance obligations, where revenues are recognized as health care services are made available. This evolution indicates a more structured and service-linked approach to value-based premium revenue recognition over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group’s premium revenues have increasingly shifted toward risk‑based arrangements, with premiums from these products representing nearly 80 % of consolidated revenue. The company continues to recognize premium revenue from value‑based contracts in Optum Health, where it receives a fixed per‑member fee for assuming medical and administrative costs, and this component now comprises a substantial share of total premiums. However, the company also faces ongoing risk that medical cost trends, regulatory changes, or unexpected events (e.g., pandemics) could outpace its ability to price and manage those costs, which could compress margins despite the growing proportion of value‑based premium revenue.",

      "question": "How has Procter & Gamble's Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's cash generation relative to its net earnings?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Procter & Gamble stated that its long-term target for Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity was to maintain it at or above 90 percent, indicating a strategic focus on strong cash conversion relative to net earnings. By 2024, the company exceeded this target, reporting an Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity of 105%. This evolution suggests an improvement in the company's ability to generate cash relative to its net earnings, surpassing its own long-term benchmark. The increase from the targeted 90% to an actual 105% reflects enhanced efficiency in converting earnings into cash, despite the inclusion of significant non-cash charges such as the Gillette intangible asset impairment and foreign currency translation losses.",
      "llm_answer": "Procter & Gamble’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity rose from 93 % in fiscal 2022 to 105 % in fiscal 2024, indicating that the company’s cash generation now exceeds its net earnings on an adjusted basis. This improvement shows that P&G is producing more cash relative to its earnings, underscoring stronger cash‑flow efficiency compared with the earlier period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Texas Instruments disclosed the value of nonmarketable investments as $5 million, reported under 'Other measurement basis' in the investment table. By 2024, the company no longer provided a specific dollar value for nonmarketable investments but instead elaborated on the valuation methodology, stating that these investments are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. This shift indicates a move from quantitative disclosure to qualitative explanation without updating the specific value, suggesting a more opaque but methodologically clarified approach to reporting these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "The valuation methodology for nonmarketable investments remained consistent, but the 2024 filing shows a more detailed breakdown of fair‑value hierarchy (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs) and expanded disclosures of related assets and liabilities, including a larger valuation‑allowance increase ($14 million in 2024 vs. $9 million in 2023). This indicates TI is placing greater emphasis on transparent, market‑based inputs and on quantifying the impact of valuation adjustments on its overall tax and investment reporting.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the unrecognized actuarial losses for Other Plans were $33 million, whereas in 2024, there was an unrecognized actuarial gain of $23 million. This represents a shift of $56 million from a loss position to a gain position, indicating a significant change in the underlying assumptions or market conditions affecting the valuation of these plans.",
      "llm_answer": "The unrecognized actuarial gains and losses for the Other Plans (retiree medical and life insurance) improved from a net pre‑tax loss of $416 million at the end of 2023 to a net pre‑tax gain of $518 million at the end of 2024. This shift reflects a modest increase in the discount rate (from 5.00 % to 5.50 %) and favorable demographic assumptions, indicating that the volatility in valuation assumptions and market conditions has eased for these plans.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that it accrues fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over lease terms when it believes substantially all lease income, including straight-line rent receivable, is probable of collection. The company also described specific conditions under which lease income would be recorded on a cash basis, such as when receivables are deemed not probable of collection. By 2024, SPG provided concrete financial figures showing fixed lease income increased from $3,858,592 in 2022 to $4,145,288 in 2023, and further to $4,365,734 in 2024, indicating a consistent upward trend. This evolution reflects both continuity in accounting methodology and a measurable growth in fixed lease income over the period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, SPG's reporting of fixed lease income evolved in methodology and presentation. In 2022, fixed lease income was reported as part of total lease income without explicit breakdowns in the provided excerpts, but by 2024, the company clearly disclosed fixed lease income of $4,365,734 (in thousands) in its consolidated results, up from $4,145,288 in 2023 and $3,858,592 in 2022, reflecting growth in fixed minimum rent and CAM reimbursements recorded on a straight-line basis. This increase aligns with broader lease income growth driven by property reopenings and new leases, while the accounting methodology remained consistent—accruing fixed lease income on a straight-line basis over lease terms when collectability is probable—though the 2024 disclosures provide more granular detail on fixed vs. variable components and include forward-looking minimum lease payments in the $15,769,991 total over five years and beyond.",

In fiscal year 2024, Xbox content and services revenue again increased by 50%, and the acquisition continued to be a key driver, specifically noted as contributing 44 percentage points of net impact due to the shift of Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party. This indicates that the acquisition remained central to sustaining the same high growth rate in this segment year-over-year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Chevron reported an ARO reduction of $1.3 billion, whereas in 2024, this figure decreased significantly to an ARO reduction of only $0.3 billion. This indicates a notable slowdown in the rate at which the company was reducing its asset retirement obligations, suggesting either an increase in new obligations or a strategic decision to defer certain retirement activities.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's ARO reduction/(build) shifted from a $1.3 million reduction in 2023 to a $0.3 million reduction in 2024, indicating a modest decline in the company's asset‑retirement obligation adjustments—likely reflecting lower estimated decommissioning costs or a more conservative outlook on future retirement liabilities. This shift suggests that Chevron is managing its AROs with slightly less aggressive reductions, potentially signaling tighter cost controls or a reassessment of the timing and magnitude of future retirement obligations.",

This change was influenced by several liability adjustments, including a $470.0 million increase in 2024 related to the extension of estimated settlement dates. Additionally, in 2024, revisions in estimates included a $125.0 million decrease and a $22.8 million increase in liability related to foreign currency translation for the years ended 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2023, revisions included a $22.3 million increase and a $24.6 million decrease in liability for foreign currency translation for the years ended 2023 and 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 the estimated undiscounted future cash outlay for asset‑retirement obligations rose from **$4.0 billion to $4.5 billion**.  The increase was driven primarily by **$470 million of additional liability** from extending settlement dates (revisions in estimates) and by **foreign‑currency translation adjustments** that added roughly **$125 million** to the obligation.

In contrast, in fiscal 2023, the Gross Profit Rate decreased by 50 basis points, driven by continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories.

      "llm_answer": "The gross profit rate increased 51 basis points in fiscal 2022, driven primarily by price management, favorable merchandise mix (including the lapping of temporary Auto Care and Vision Center closures), and growth in advertising, partially offset by higher supply chain costs. In contrast, the gross profit rate was flat in fiscal 2021, supported by strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, but offset by changes in merchandise mix and pandemic-related closures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM Financial indicated that used vehicle prices were expected to decrease relative to 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. It also stated that no impairment indicators were present in the leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. By 2023, the company quantified the financial impact of a 1% relative change in estimated residual values at year-end, showing that such a shift could directly affect depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio. This evolution indicates a shift from a qualitative assessment of residual value risk in 2022 to a more quantitative and scenario-based analysis in 2023, suggesting a more refined risk management approach.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GM Financial’s exposure to residual value changes in its leased vehicle portfolio shifted from a $291 million total impact at the end of 2021 to a $227 million impact projected for 2024‑2027 in 2023, reflecting a modest decline in the estimated residual‑value sensitivity. The company continues to monitor used‑vehicle price trends and adjusts residual estimates accordingly, indicating a proactive risk‑management approach that emphasizes regular re‑valuation of residuals and impairment testing to mitigate potential losses from lower‑than‑expected vehicle values.",

In 2024, however, the total revenue from Investment and Brokerage Services increased to $17,766 million from $15,563 million in 2023. This growth was driven by increases in both asset management fees (from $12,002 million to $13,875 million) and brokerage fees (from $3,561 million to $3,891 million). Thus, the segment shifted from a decline in 2023 to a significant recovery and growth in 2024.",

By 2024, the core sales decline had improved to (1.5)%, showing a substantial reduction in the rate of decline. This evolution suggests that the company's underlying business performance strengthened significantly year-over-year, with core operations stabilizing and nearing growth. The improvement from (10.0)% to (1.5)% indicates a positive shift in demand, pricing, or unit sales, despite the broader market or economic challenges.",

This core sales decline indicates weakening underlying demand across key markets, particularly in North America and China, despite price increases contributing positively to revenue. The company's 2024 core sales decline of 1.5% (versus 2023) shows stabilization but continued pressure, with core sales in high-growth markets falling mid-single digits due to weakness in China and capital spending reductions.",

However, in 2024, Refined Product Sales slightly declined from 1,287 thousand barrels per day (MBD) to 1,286 MBD.

However, this growth occurred amid declining downstream margins and earnings pressures, indicating that the volume increase alone does not reflect strong operational performance—rather, it masks underlying margin compression and operational challenges in refining and marketing.",

This indicates a significant improvement in the company's ability to generate free cash flow relative to its net earnings over the two-year period.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reported no restructuring and related costs, indicating a period of relative stability or absence of major operational changes. However, in 2023, the company incurred $92 million in restructuring and related costs, signaling a renewed focus on organizational changes or cost optimization efforts. This shift suggests that the company initiated new restructuring activities in 2023 after a period of inactivity.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, restructuring and related costs declined sharply from $119 million to $92 million (a $27 million reduction), reflecting the company’s completion of prior cost‑reset initiatives and a continued focus on operational efficiency. This reduction, together with higher earnings and margin expansion, indicates that Emerson is shifting its strategic emphasis from aggressive cost‑cutting to leveraging growth in its core segments while maintaining tighter expense discipline.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Canadian Segment Gross Margin Percentage increase was driven by improvements in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, contributing a combined positive impact of 35 basis points, partially offset by increased 2% rewards. In 2024, the same factors—core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—continued to positively influence the gross margin percentage, again contributing a combined 35 basis points, despite the same offsetting pressure from increased 2% rewards. This indicates a consistent upward trend in gross margin performance from these areas, with no material change in the magnitude of their contributions.",
      "llm_answer": "The Canadian segment’s gross‑margin percentage rose in 2024, driven by higher core‑merchandise margins and ancillary businesses, but the improvement was partially offset by increased 2% rewards; overall, the segment’s gross‑margin percentage increased, reflecting stronger performance in both core categories and warehouse‑related activities.",

In 2024, the CAS pension cost decreased to $1,684 million, while the FAS pension service cost was $60 million, leading to a total FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment of $1,624 million. This reflects a decrease in both the CAS pension cost and the operating adjustment, indicating a reduction in pension-related financial pressure on operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The CAS pension cost declined modestly from $1,725 million in 2023 to $1,684 million in 2024, while the service‑cost component of FAS pension expense also fell (from $65 million to $60 million). Consequently, the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment dropped from $1,660 million in 2023 to $1,624 million in 2024, leaving the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment at $1,686 million for 2024 versus $2,103 million in 2023. This reduction lessened the favorable impact on the overall FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment, contributing to a lower consolidated operating profit in 2024.",

By 2024, the company clarified that fixed lease income included both fixed minimum lease consideration and fixed CAM reimbursements recorded on a straight-line basis. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward stabilizing revenue streams by emphasizing predictable income components such as fixed minimums and CAM reimbursements, while reducing reliance on variable tenant-sales-based income.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on SPG's disclosures in the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, fixed lease income increased by $286.7 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher fixed minimum lease consideration and improved occupancy rates, while variable lease income declined slightly. This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward securing more stable, predictable revenue streams through long-term, fixed-lease structures—reducing reliance on variable tenant sales-based income and emphasizing operational control and risk management over retail property revenue. Consequently, the company is increasingly prioritizing lease structures that insulate revenue from retail sales volatility, aligning with its focus on maximizing cash flow stability and mitigating economic cyclicality in its property portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Installed Base Growth was explicitly stated as a key driver of Office Commercial revenue alongside average revenue per user expansion and the shift from on-premises Office to Office 365. In 2024, while the same factors were mentioned, the relationship was reframed such that revenue was described as 'mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth'—indicating a continued but potentially more stable or assumed role rather than a newly emphasized growth lever. This suggests that Installed Base Growth transitioned from being a highlighted growth catalyst in 2023 to a foundational, ongoing component of revenue in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, the role of Installed Base Growth in driving Office Commercial revenue evolved from being a primary growth driver in 2023 to being integrated with average revenue per user expansion and the shift to Microsoft 365 subscriptions in 2024. Specifically, the 2023 filing states that Office Commercial revenue is \"mainly affected by a combination of continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365\" (Page 8, 2023), while the 2024 filing refines this to emphasize that growth depends on \"continued installed base growth and average revenue per user expansion, as well as the continued shift from Office licensed on-premises to Office 365\" (Page 9, 2024), confirming that Installed Base Growth remained a foundational element but was now explicitly paired with revenue-per-user dynamics and subscription adoption as the core drivers of Office Commercial revenue growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix's streaming revenues grew by 7% compared to the prior year, with paid net membership additions totaling 8,903 thousand. By 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained stable at 7%, but paid net membership additions surged dramatically, increasing by 232% to reach 29,529 thousand. This indicates a significant improvement in user acquisition in 2023 despite a similar revenue growth rate, suggesting more efficient scaling or successful new market penetration.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's streaming revenue growth slowed from 19% to 7%, while paid net membership additions surged from 18,181 to 29,529 (a 62% increase). This indicates a shift toward slower revenue growth but accelerating user acquisition, suggesting the company is prioritizing subscriber base expansion over price increases or revenue per member.",

By 2024, the unfunded capital contributions increased to $7.5 billion, continuing the pattern of manageable expected commitments.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Chevron disclosed an oil production GHG intensity of 24 kg CO₂e/boe and had spent $6.5 billion of its planned $10 billion lower-carbon capital spend through 2028, with $2 billion allocated to reducing carbon intensity in oil and gas operations. By 2024, Chevron maintained the same GHG intensity target of 24 kg CO₂e/boe but had increased its total lower-carbon investments to $7.7 billion since 2021, indicating a continued commitment to its 2028 targets and broader 2050 net zero upstream production aspiration. Additionally, in 2024, Chevron placed more emphasis on external dependencies like technology development and policy incentives to achieve its long-term goals, signaling a strategic shift toward integrating external enablers into its GHG reduction pathway.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron's approach to reducing oil‑production GHG intensity has shifted from a focus on modest intensity targets to a more capital‑intensive, long‑term strategy aligned with its net‑zero aspirations.  In 2023 the company reported upstream GHG intensity of 24 kg CO₂e/boe and set 2028 targets of 24 kg CO₂e/boe for oil and gas, 2 kg CO₂e/boe for methane and 3 kg CO₂e/boe for flaring, while also introducing a portfolio‑wide carbon‑intensity goal of 71 g CO₂e/MJ by 2028.  To meet these goals, Chevron has earmarked roughly $8 billion of the $10 billion lower‑carbon capital budget through 2028 for renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon‑capture projects, and it has already spent about $7.7 billion (including $2.9 billion for the REG acquisition) on such investments.  This capital allocation reflects a strategic pivot toward lowering the carbon intensity of its operations while still growing its oil and gas business, positioning the company to meet its 2050 net‑zero upstream aspiration despite volatile commodity prices and evolving regulatory landscapes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group estimated risk adjustment premium revenues based on submitted diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, and physician treatment settings, with these data being subject to government review and audit by regulators. By 2024, the company maintained a similar estimation methodology but placed increased emphasis on the completeness and accuracy of data submitted to CMS, reflecting a more mature and refined process for capturing risk adjustment data. The 2024 disclosure also specifically highlights the role of both the company and healthcare providers in collecting, capturing, and submitting the necessary data within prescribed deadlines, suggesting a more collaborative and systematic approach to data submission compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's risk adjustment premium revenue estimation has evolved significantly between 2022 and 2024, particularly regarding data submission processes and regulatory oversight. The company now explicitly states that risk adjustment data for Medicare Advantage plans are subject to government review, including audit by regulators, and that it estimates revenues based on data submitted to CMS within prescribed deadlines. This represents a shift from the 2022 approach, which only mentioned submitting data to CMS without emphasizing regulatory review. By 2024, the process has become more formalized with specific references to CMS risk adjustment methodology, data submission deadlines, and the critical importance of audit compliance, indicating heightened regulatory scrutiny and a more structured data governance framework for risk adjustment calculations.",

This shift suggests that while the company maintained strong earnings, the cash flow conversion became less efficient, with operating cash flow declining 9% year-over-year to $16.7 billion and adjusted free cash flow dropping 13% to $13.8 billion.

This represents a $30 million increase in unrecognized tax benefits, suggesting a slight upward trend in the company's potential tax savings in the future, though the company noted that it is still not possible to reasonably estimate the expected change in these benefits over the next twelve months.",
      "llm_answer": "The unrecognized tax benefits (tax positions) disclosed by GM declined from $1,086 million at the end of 2022 to $634 million at the end of 2023. This reduction reflects a net decrease in uncertain tax positions, including $473 million of reductions to prior‑year positions and $15 million of settlements, resulting in a lower balance of $634 million reported at year‑end 2023. Consequently, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that could favorably affect GM’s effective tax rate fell from $411 million (at the end of 2022) to $386 million (at the end of 2023). The decline in these benefits suggests a modest downward pressure on GM’s future effective tax rate, as fewer tax positions remain subject to potential adjustments.",

In 2023, the streaming revenue growth rate remained consistent at 7%, while the operating margin improved to 21%. This indicates that despite a similar pace of revenue growth, Netflix enhanced its profitability through better cost management or operational efficiencies.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix's streaming revenue growth slowed to 7% (from $31.5B to $33.6B), while its operating margin expanded to 21% (up from 18% in 2022), indicating improved profitability despite modest revenue growth. This trajectory reflects a shift toward higher-margin operations, driven by revenue growth outpacing cost increases and strategic pricing adjustments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron stated it had increased its planned capital spend to approximately $10 billion through 2028 for lower-carbon initiatives, with $2 billion allocated to reducing the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and $8 billion for investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen, and carbon capture and offsets. By 2023, Chevron had already spent $6.5 billion on lower-carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022. This indicates significant progress toward its 2028 target and suggests an acceleration in implementation, particularly in scaling lower-carbon business lines such as renewable fuels.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron increased its planned lower‑carbon capital spending to about $10 billion through 2028—roughly $2 billion aimed at cutting the carbon intensity of its conventional oil and gas operations and $8 billion earmarked for renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon‑capture projects.  The company’s 2028 targets call for a 40 % cut in upstream GHG intensity (to ~24 kg CO₂e/boe), a 26 % cut in gas‑intensity, a 53 % cut in methane intensity and a 66 % cut in flaring intensity, while also targeting a portfolio‑wide carbon‑intensity of 71 g CO₂e/MJ.  Progress is tracked against a 2016 baseline, with updates slated every five years, and the firm reports that about $6.5 billion of the planned spend has already been deployed, including the $2.9 billion purchase of Renewable Energy Group.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group listed 'medical costs payable' as a key component of its short-term cash requirements, indicating it was a primary liability to be settled within twelve months through cash flows from operations and available cash. The company emphasized that it expected to meet these obligations using operational cash flows and did not foresee liquidity issues due to its strong capital position. By 2024, the treatment of medical costs payable shifted to being a central focus in the company's accounting estimates and judgments, specifically under 'Use of Estimates' in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Here, medical costs payable was described as one of the most significant estimates requiring complex assumptions due to its inherent uncertainty and likelihood of change over time. The 2024 disclosure also highlighted that changes in estimates for medical costs payable were recognized in earnings during the period of adjustment, indicating a more dynamic and potentially volatile nature compared to the more static view in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable decreased from $47.5 billion in 2022 to $45.9 billion in 2023, reflecting favorable development of prior‑year claims and lower new claim accruals; this reduction lessened the cash needed to fund ongoing medical obligations, while the company continues to rely on operating cash flows, debt issuances and commercial‑paper financing to meet its short‑term liquidity requirements. The accounting policy for medical costs payable remains consistent—estimating incurred but unreported claims using completion factors and medical‑cost trend assumptions, with changes in estimates recorded as favorable or unfavorable development in the period they occur.",

This indicates a clear upward trend in the relative contribution of cloud services to Oracle’s overall revenue base during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, Oracle’s cloud services revenue grew from **$36.1 billion (85 % of total revenue)** to **$36.1 billion (still 85 % of total revenue)** in the reported figures, indicating that the proportion of cloud services revenue within total revenue remained essentially unchanged. The data shows a modest increase in cloud‑related revenue (up 6‑7 % in constant currency) but does not show a material shift in its share of overall sales.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed a 2% increase to sales, reflecting higher costs being transferred to customers. By 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of 1% on sales, indicating a reversal in this dynamic. This shift suggests that LIN experienced a change in its cost structure or pricing strategy, where rising costs were no longer fully recoverable through pricing adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, cost pass-through contributed to sales growth in all three geographic segments, but its impact on operating profit remained minimal. In 2022, cost pass-through added 3% to Americas sales with negligible profit impact; by 2024, it slightly reduced Americas sales (1% decrease) while still having minimal profit effect, indicating pricing dynamics increasingly drove margin expansion rather than cost pass-through. This shift suggests LIN's pricing power became the primary driver of profitability growth, particularly evident in the Americas where operating profit rose 7% in 2024 despite modest sales growth, reflecting that cost pass-through no longer significantly influenced profit margins.",

By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 41,033 thousand, representing a 44% growth, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership dropped to $7.64, a decrease of 20%.

However, in fiscal 2024, these costs surged by 157.4% in dollar terms, rising from $20.2 million to $52.0 million. This indicates that while the company was able to manage these costs effectively in 2023, it faced significant cost pressures in 2024, undermining earlier efficiency gains.",
      "llm_answer": "Starbucks' product and distribution costs decreased by 80 basis points as a percentage of total net revenues in fiscal 2024, primarily due to pricing benefits (70 basis points) and reduced supply chain costs (60 basis points), partially offset by other cost pressures. However, store operating expenses increased by 140 basis points as a percentage of total net revenues, driven by higher wage and benefit investments (170 basis points), deleverage (80 basis points), and promotional activity (70 basis points), partially offset by operational efficiencies (170 basis points). This indicates that while Starbucks managed to reduce specific cost categories like product and distribution, its overall cost management faced challenges from wage inflation and other operational investments, contributing to a 130 basis point contraction in operating margin year-over-year.",

In 2023, EMEA product revenue slightly increased to $10,645 million but its percentage contribution to total product revenue decreased to 27.1%.

However, despite the sales growth, operating profit for the Engineering segment decreased by $81 million, or 16%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher margins in the prior year from the wind-down of sanctioned Russian projects. This suggests that while sales grew, profitability was negatively impacted by the absence of those prior-year benefits.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GM's net warranty expense was $2,592 million, composed of $2,593 million in warranties issued and assumed, $-261 million in supplier recoveries, and $260 million in adjustments and other. In 2023, this figure increased significantly to $4,778 million, driven by a substantial rise in warranties issued and assumed (from $2,593 million to $3,282 million) and a dramatic increase in adjustments and other (from $260 million to $1,493 million). The supplier recoveries also shifted slightly from a negative $261 million in 2022 to a positive $3 million in 2023, indicating a reversal in net recovery position. This represents a significant transformation in GM's net warranty expense.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 GM’s net warranty expense rose sharply from $2.6 billion to $4.8 billion. The increase was driven by higher warranty accruals for recall campaigns ($2.8 billion in 2021, $864 million in 2023) and additional product‑warranty provisions ($2.4 billion in 2023), while supplier recoveries fell dramatically ($2.0 billion in 2021 versus only $646 million in 2023), leaving the net warranty balance at $8.6 billion after recoveries. This combination of larger accruals and weaker offsetting recoveries caused the net expense to more than double.",

This indicates that the company's selling, general, and administrative costs grew at a faster rate than its sales, suggesting a potential decline in cost management efficiency over the period.",

At the same time, operating‑profit margins fell by about 170 basis points, reflecting the sales decline and the dilutive impact of acquisitions, which together signal that the company’s cost‑management efficiency has deteriorated as fixed costs are spread over lower revenue.",

By 2024, the total paid membership grew to 76,200, with Gold Star members increasing to 63,700 and Business members rising slightly to 12,500.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through was described as a positively impacting factor due to Linde's long-term contracts that allowed for the transfer of energy and feedstock cost fluctuations to customers, contributing to stable cash flow. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact, contributing to a (1)% change in sales. This shift indicates a change in the effectiveness or direction of cost pass-through mechanisms, possibly due to market conditions or contract renegotiations, affecting Linde's pricing dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the impact of cost pass-through mechanisms on Linde's sales shifted from a **positive contributor (+5% to sales in 2021, driven by contractual energy cost pass-through to onsite customers)** to a **negative or neutral factor** in 2024, where cost pass-through **decreased sales by 1%** (as explicitly stated in the 2024 outlook). This shift indicates a **decline in pricing power and market dynamics**, as the company could no longer leverage cost pass-through to boost revenue—instead, it became a headwind due to competitive pressures or contractual constraints. Consequently, the **flat sales growth in 2024 (vs. 2% growth from price/mix alone)** reflects a strategic pivot toward **pricing discipline** (e.g., \"higher price attainment\" as the primary sales driver) rather than relying on cost-based revenue uplifts, signaling tighter margins and a more mature pricing strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Verizon recognized overage usage revenue for postpaid wireless plans on a month-to-month basis as the customer exercised their option for incremental services beyond their monthly allowance. In 2024, this recognition method remained consistent; however, the company placed increased emphasis on the month-to-month nature of these overage fees, reinforcing that they are recognized only when the customer actually uses the service beyond the plan's allowance. While the core revenue recognition principle remained unchanged, the 2024 disclosure provided more explicit language around the timing and conditions of overage fee recognition, indicating a subtle refinement in how the company communicates its policy, rather than a substantive accounting change.",
      "llm_answer": "Verizon continues to recognize revenue from postpaid wireless plans with usage exceeding monthly allowances on an as‑used basis, treating the overage fees as usage‑based consideration that is recognized when the customer exercises the option (typically month‑to‑month). This approach was consistent in both the 2023 and 2024 filings, with no material change noted in how the company accounts for such overage usage revenue.",

In 2024, the company instead stated that unamortized ITCs 'impact' regulatory liabilities, suggesting a broader, potentially more indirect influence rather than a primary attribution. This shift reflects a change in how the company describes the role of unamortized ITCs in its tax-related regulatory liabilities.",

However, in 2023, the company disclosed restructuring and related costs totaling $10 million, signaling a shift toward active restructuring efforts. This change suggests that the company initiated cost optimization or strategic realignment initiatives in 2023 that were not present in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, restructuring and related costs declined sharply—from $119 million in 2022 to $68 million in 2023—reflecting the company’s transition away from major cost‑reset initiatives and a focus on sustaining margin gains from operational improvements. This reduction, coupled with rising adjusted EBITA margins (from 22.4 % to 24.6 %), indicates that Emerson is streamlining its cost base while leveraging higher sales volume and pricing power to drive profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, cost pass-through positively contributed 2% to the year-over-year sales growth, indicating that rising costs were at least partially transferred to customers. However, by 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on the year-over-year sales comparison, suggesting that either cost pressures eased or LIN was less able to pass through cost increases to customers. This shift reflects a reversal in the company's cost pass-through dynamics, moving from a supportive factor to a slight drag on sales growth.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of cost pass-through on sales declined from 3% of sales growth in 2021 (with minimal profit impact) to a 1% negative contribution in 2024, indicating that Linde's cost management dynamics shifted from actively passing through cost increases to experiencing cost pass-through that actually reduced sales revenue while having little effect on profitability. This reflects a strategic shift where cost pass-through became a drag on top-line growth rather than a driver, suggesting improved pricing power and cost control that offset external cost pressures rather than relying on pass-through mechanisms.",

      "original_answer": "Visa's Total Nominal Payments Volume increased from $11,464 billion in 2022 to $12,087 billion in 2024, representing a 5% growth. However, the growth rates for specific segments changed over time. In 2022, the Consumer Credit segment grew by 17% globally, while in 2024, this growth rate slowed to 6%. Similarly, the Commercial segment saw an increase in growth rate, from 29% in 2022 to 12% in 2024 globally. This indicates a moderation in the expansion of Consumer Credit and a sustained but slower growth in Commercial payments volume.",
      "llm_answer": "Visa's Total Nominal Payments Volume grew from $5.546 billion in fiscal 2022 to $6.387 billion in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 15 % increase from 2022 to 2023 and a further 6 % rise from 2023 to 2024.  Within this total, the Consumer Credit segment’s nominal volume rose from $2.047 billion (2022) to $2.355 billion (2024), a cumulative 15 % gain, while the Commercial segment’s volume expanded from $882 million (2022) to $1.042 billion (2024), representing a 18 % overall increase.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, CVX reported current-year dry hole expenditures of $83 million, while in 2023, this figure increased significantly to $326 million. This represents a more than threefold increase in dry hole costs year-over-year. The substantial rise in dry hole expenditures suggests that CVX experienced a notable increase in unsuccessful exploration activities in 2023 compared to the prior year, indicating a higher exploration risk profile during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "CVX's current-year dry hole expenditures declined sharply from $83 million in 2022 to $326 million in 2023 (a $243 million decrease), reflecting a reduced exploration risk profile as the company curtailed costly dry‑hole drilling activities.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer's Upjohn Business was still referenced in the context of historical spin-off activities, with its financial results reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Additionally, Pfizer noted that approximately 75% of the expected $700 million in separation costs had been incurred by the end of 2021. By 2023, the Upjohn Business was formally defined in the glossary as 'Pfizer's former global, primarily off-patent branded and generics business,' which had been spun-off on November 16, 2020, and combined with Mylan to create Viatris. This shift indicates a move from active financial tracking and cost reporting to a more historical and definitional reference, suggesting the integration and separation process had largely concluded by 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Pfizer reorganized its commercial operations to focus on a single reportable segment, Biopharma, following the spin-off of its Upjohn Business in late 2020 and the formation of the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2019. This restructuring, which included separating the Upjohn Business and shifting to a new global structure with two operating segments (Biopharma and PC1), was completed by the end of 2021, with Meridian's financial results reflected as discontinued operations starting in Q4 2021. The company emphasized that this transformation aimed to align its cost base and support model with its new focused strategy, eliminating indirect costs that did not transfer to the spun-off entities.",

By 2023, this revenue decreased to $5,466 million, and its percentage contribution dropped to 13.9%. This indicates a decline in both the absolute revenue and relative importance of the APJC region to Cisco's overall product revenue during this period.",

This growth indicates that the APJC region remained strategically important, particularly driven by strong performance in China (18% growth) and Australia (10% growth), despite declines in Japan and India.

By 2023, Automotive Interest Expense decreased to $911 million, but Automotive Financing - GM Financial Interest Expense rose sharply to $4,685 million, resulting in a total interest expense of $5,596 million.

In contrast, by 2024, the cost of wireless equipment surged to $26,100 million, with $21,259 million attributed to the Consumer segment and $4,841 million to the Business segment. This significant increase of over $21 billion indicates a major shift in strategy, likely tied to increased investment in or sales of wireless equipment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, wireless equipment revenue in the Business segment decreased from $4.0 billion in 2022 to $3.7 billion in 2023, reflecting a $300 million decline. This reduction was driven by lower volume of devices sold (particularly a 11% decrease in upgrades) and a shift toward higher-priced equipment in the mix, partially offset by a $174 million increase from pricing. The decline indicates Verizon is prioritizing higher-value device sales over volume growth, aligning with strategic shifts toward premium equipment and potentially reducing reliance on mass-market device activations.",

      "original_answer": "The approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under IBM's publicly announced program remained unchanged at $2,007,611,768 in both 2022 and 2024. This indicates that, despite the two-year interval, the company's remaining repurchase capacity under the program did not change in dollar terms.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the approximate dollar value of shares available for repurchase under IBM's publicly announced program remained essentially unchanged at about $2.0 billion each year. This flat level indicates that IBM's capacity to repurchase stock has not expanded—it is constrained by the original $4 billion authorization, with roughly half still available—so any additional repurchases would have to come from that limited remaining amount rather than from a larger, growing reserve.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Visa reported a 25% year-over-year increase in U.S. Consumer Credit Volume, rising from $1,641 billion to $2,047 billion, while the 2024 filing shows a much slower growth rate of 6%, with U.S. Consumer Credit Volume increasing from $2,230 billion in 2023 to $2,355 billion in 2024. This indicates a significant moderation in the rate of credit volume growth over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of Visa's Consumer Credit Volume increased from 25% in 2022 to 17% in 2024, indicating a slowdown in growth but still showing positive expansion.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's Other Income and Expense, Net increased primarily due to lower non-service pension costs and gains on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund. By 2023, the net figure for Other Income and Expense was $392 million, which included contributions from various components such as interest income ($27 million), AFUDC equity ($197 million), post-in-service equity returns ($34 million), and nonoperating income, other ($134 million). This indicates a shift in the composition of the net income, with AFUDC equity and nonoperating income, other playing significant roles in 2023 compared to the 2022 drivers.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Duke Energy’s “Other Income and Expenses, net” increased by $68 million, rising from $75 million in 2022 to $143 million in 2023. The primary drivers of this increase were $111 million of higher depreciation and amortization (mainly accelerated depreciation of retired Crystal River coal units and plant‑base additions, partially offset by nuclear‑facility life extensions), a $105 million rise in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power (due to higher demand, generation‑mix changes and REC purchases), and a $50 million increase in operation, maintenance and other expenses (driven by higher employee costs, prior‑year severance adjustments and outage costs, partially offset by lower storm amortization). These cost increases were partially offset by $111 million of coal‑ash insurance litigation proceeds, lower non‑service pension costs and unrealized gains on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at Duke Energy Florida. Consequently, the net figure grew substantially over the two‑year period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer defined Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. By 2023, the definition changed to exclude amortization of intangible assets instead of purchase accounting for acquisitions, along with acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. This indicates a shift in the nature of adjustments being emphasized in the metric's calculation.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer's definition of Adjusted Cost of Sales remained consistent between 2022 and 2023, both excluding purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items (such as restructuring charges, asset impairments, and gains/losses on equity securities) to present a normalized view of recurring operational performance. The 2023 definition explicitly maintained the same exclusions as prior years, emphasizing that Adjusted Cost of Sales reflects cost of sales before these non-recurring or non-core items, enabling comparable year-over-year analysis of core business operations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MO's total oral tobacco products held a retail share of 42.5%, which declined to 37.5% in 2024. This indicates a weakening in the company's competitive position in the oral tobacco segment over this period. Specific brands like Copenhagen and Skoal experienced notable declines, with Copenhagen dropping from 23.5% to 19.1%, and Skoal from 9.3% to 7.6%. While on! saw an increase from 6.8% to 8.3%, it was not enough to offset the overall decline.",

This downward trend indicates a weakening competitive position in the oral tobacco category, as our core MST brands (Copenhagen, Skoal) and the on! pouch brand are losing ground to newer pouch offerings that are capturing a larger share of the expanding nicotine pouch segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx's pension plan assumptions included future salary increases as a key component in calculating the projected benefit obligation, which stood at $28.7 billion. By 2024, while the company continued to disclose pension plan assumptions, it emphasized a strategic shift by closing its U.S. defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees starting 2020 and introducing an enhanced 401(k) plan with an 8% company match. This indicates a reduced emphasis on defined benefit plans and a shift toward defined contribution plans, suggesting a moderation in long-term salary-linked pension liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, FedEx's pension assumptions regarding future salary increases evolved from a 5.11% rate in 2022 to 5.29% in 2024, reflecting a gradual upward trend in expected compensation growth.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of stock-settled PSUs issued prior to 2013 received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to retained earnings. However, by 2024, the company clarified that recipients of stock-settled PSUs authorized beginning in 2013 receive an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent that is charged to compensation expense, rather than retained earnings, and these are paid at the time of settlement. This reflects a shift in both the timing and accounting treatment of dividend equivalents for newer PSU grants.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of dividend equivalents for stock‑settled performance share units (PSUs) has remained consistent: recipients receive a cash dividend‑equivalent (or accrued reinvested dividend‑equivalent) while the PSUs are unvested, and this amount is charged to compensation expense. Beginning in 2013, PSUs authorized for future grants vest upon settlement after the three‑year performance period, and compensation expense is recognized from the grant date through the conclusion of that performance period. The accounting method—measuring expense using the grant‑date fair value for equity‑classified awards and adjusting it with changes in the company’s stock price through the settlement date—has not changed between 2023 and 2024.",

This modest revenue per membership decline, coupled with an 8% increase in average paying memberships, indicates that Netflix’s pricing strategy yielded limited growth, likely due to market saturation, competitive pressures, and the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, suggesting that subscriber growth alone was insufficient to drive meaningful revenue expansion without price increases.",

In 2024, the year-over-year growth was lower at 5.9%, amounting to approximately $393.4 million (from $4,446,461 thousand to $4,839,816 thousand). This indicates a slight slowdown in the rate of revenue growth despite a larger absolute dollar increase in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, NFLX's streaming revenues grew by 7% year-over-year in 2023 compared to 2022, with an absolute dollar increase of $2,170,606 (from $31,469,852 in 2022 to $33,640,458 in 2023). This growth was primarily driven by an 8% increase in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The document also indicates that streaming revenue growth was further impacted by unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BK's Other Segment included corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments, and certain business exits. By 2024, the segment continued to include corporate treasury activities, derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, and certain business exits; however, 'renewable energy' was replaced with 'tax credit investments' as a highlighted component. This indicates a strategic shift in the types of corporate investments being emphasized within the Other Segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the composition of BK's Other Segment shifted toward greater emphasis on corporate treasury activities, derivatives and trading, bank‑owned life insurance, renewable‑energy and other corporate investments, and specific business exits. The 2023 filing describes the Other segment as including “the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank‑owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits,” while the 2024 version expands this description to explicitly list “the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank‑owned life insurance, tax credit investments and other corporate investments and certain business exits.” Thus, the 2024 filing adds tax‑credit investments as a distinct component and refines the wording around “other corporate investments,” indicating a modest evolution in the segment’s focus.",

      "question": "How did AMD's provisions during the period evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's financial commitments or liabilities over time?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD's provisions during the period were $106 million, while in 2024, they increased significantly to $213 million. This indicates a doubling of provisions over the two-year period, suggesting that AMD faced greater financial commitments or anticipated higher liabilities in 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, AMD's provisions for warranty and related liabilities increased significantly from 2022 to 2024. The warranty liability balance rose from $37 million (as of Dec 25, 2021) to $51 million (Dec 26, 2020), and then to $188 million by Dec 28, 2024, with provisions jumping from $106 million (2021) to $213 million (2024). This indicates growing financial commitments to cover potential product defects and warranty claims, likely driven by expanded product lines and market share growth. While the company's overall contingent liabilities (like litigation) appear resolved or immaterial as of 2024, the rising warranty accruals reflect heightened financial obligations tied to product reliability and customer support.",

      "question": "How has the treatment and disclosure of the current and deferred income tax impact on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of the company's rationale for excluding these impacts?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the income tax expense (benefit) on non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments was determined using applicable tax rates in relevant jurisdictions and included both current and deferred tax amounts. The rationale for excluding purchase accounting impacts focused on the merger of equals structure, geographic management approach, and the need for comparability across segments and with peers. By 2024, the company retained the same technical explanation for the tax impact but added specificity to its rationale by referencing the 2018 business combination explicitly, reinforcing the long-standing nature of the merger and its ongoing influence on financial reporting. This evolution indicates a more detailed contextualization of the merger's lasting effects on financial disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 the company’s non‑GAAP disclosures have consistently treated the tax effect of purchase‑accounting adjustments in the same way – the tax expense (or benefit) on those adjustments is calculated using the applicable jurisdictional tax rates and includes both current and deferred tax amounts, and this tax impact is reported separately in the “Adjusted Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate” tables.  The company excludes these tax impacts from its non‑GAAP pre‑tax measures (e.g., Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted EPS) because the underlying purchase‑accounting items are non‑cash, not reflective of ongoing operating performance, and management evaluates performance and sets compensation on a basis that omits them; consequently, investors and analysts are encouraged to understand the purchase‑accounting effects while the company presents the results on a tax‑adjusted basis to improve comparability.",

However, in 2023, the company experienced a strong rebound with paid net membership additions rising to 4,298 thousand, representing a 147% increase from 2022.

This strong rebound in net additions, coupled with a 13% rise in total revenues and improved operating margin, signals a renewed trajectory of robust subscriber expansion, particularly driven by international markets and strategic pricing adjustments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NFLX's streaming revenues increased by $2,170,606 thousand (7%) compared to 2022. In 2024, the company reported $4,839,816 thousand in streaming revenues, with a significant increase in paid net membership additions to 7,330 thousand, up from 4,298 thousand in 2023. This suggests an acceleration in revenue growth driven by stronger membership expansion.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 filing, streaming revenue grew 7% year‑over‑year (from $31.47 bn to $33.64 bn), driven by an 8% rise in average paying memberships that more than offset a 1% dip in average monthly revenue per member. The 2024 data shows a sharp slowdown in paid net membership additions—down to roughly 9.5 k in the U.S. and Canada and far lower growth elsewhere—suggesting that future revenue gains will rely increasingly on price adjustments and existing‑member monetization rather than rapid subscriber expansion.",

Additionally, the carrying value of tenant-related intangible assets in India was $344.8 million as of December 31, 2023, with tower portfolio and network location intangible assets valued at $916.2 million and $243.6 million, respectively. By 2024, the Company finalized a review of estimated useful lives of its tower assets, extending the depreciation period from 20 to 30 years, which led to a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for the year. This change in accounting estimate reflects a shift in the long-term valuation and treatment of the India reporting unit's assets.",

Additionally, the Company revised its asset life estimates for tower assets in early 2024, extending the useful life from 20 to 30 years, which resulted in a $730 million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense for 2024 (after tax), reflecting a more sustainable assessment of asset longevity.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD benefited from the FDII (Foreign-Derived Intangible Income) tax benefit, which contributed $147 million to its income tax provision. By 2024, the impact of FDII had evolved due to a change in U.S. tax regulations under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which required AMD to capitalize and amortize R&D expenditures instead of deducting them as incurred. This change increased taxable income in 2024 and 2023, which in turn increased the income eligible for the FDII tax benefit, indicating a growing influence of FDII on AMD's tax position despite no direct benefit amount being disclosed for 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, the FDII tax benefit became a larger component of AMD's taxable income due to the company's growing profitability and the capitalization of R&D expenses under the 2022 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which increased taxable income eligible for the FDII deduction. This evolution was driven by the U.S. tax regulation change requiring capitalization of R&D expenditures, which boosted taxable income and allowed AMD to claim a larger foreign-derived intangible income (FDII) tax benefit, as noted in the 2024 financial disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, paid memberships at end of period grew by 2% (from 73,936,000 to 75,215,000). In 2023, the growth rate increased significantly to 10% (from 41,699,000 to 45,997,000). This indicates a substantial acceleration in Netflix's membership acquisition momentum year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of paid memberships at the end of the period slowed significantly from 2022 to 2023, with paid net membership additions increasing by 232% in 2023 compared to 2022 (from 8,903 to 29,529), but the year-over-year growth rate for paid memberships at the end of the period decelerated from 9% in 2022 to 13% in 2023, indicating a continued but moderating momentum in membership acquisition. This deceleration, coupled with a 1% decline in average monthly revenue per paying membership in 2023, suggests that while Netflix is still acquiring members (especially internationally), the pace of growth is slowing and revenue per member is pressured, reflecting a shift toward more price-sensitive market expansion.",

By 2023, Total PMI Net Revenues increased to $35.174 billion, with combustible products contributing $22.334 billion and smoke-free products contributing $12.840 billion.

      "question": "How has the treatment and financial impact of dividend equivalents evolved between 2023 and 2024 for ConocoPhillips' equity-based compensation programs?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, recipients of cash-settled performance share units (PSUs) received a cash payment of a dividend equivalent that was charged to compensation expense. This applied particularly to PSUs with performance periods beginning before 2018, where recipients received dividend equivalents only after the performance period ended and until settlement. For PSUs with performance periods starting in 2018 or later, recipients received accrued reinvested dividend equivalents, which were paid at the time of settlement. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted to stock-settled restricted stock units (RSUs), where most recipients received either a cash payment of a dividend equivalent or an accrued reinvested dividend equivalent charged to retained earnings. Additionally, the grant date fair market value of RSUs that did not receive a dividend equivalent was adjusted to reflect the net present value of estimated dividends not received. This represents a shift from cash-settled to stock-settled instruments with distinct implications for dividend equivalent treatment and financial accounting.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of dividend equivalents has remained consistent—recipients of unvested RSUs, PSUs and other restricted awards continue to receive a cash dividend equivalent (or accrued reinvested dividend) that is charged to retained earnings or compensation expense until the awards settle. However, the financial impact has shifted: in 2023 the company recognized $334 million of share‑based compensation expense (including related tax benefits), while in 2024 that expense fell to $268 million, reflecting lower overall compensation costs and a reduced accrual of dividend‑equivalent charges as fewer awards remain unvested. Consequently, the cash outflow for dividend equivalents has declined in line with the reduced unrecognized compensation expense.",

The key changes were: the Americas segment’s operating profit rose 21 % (2021→2022) then 7 % (2023→2024), driven by higher pricing and volumes; EMEA’s operating profit grew 29 % (2021→2022) and 12 % (2023→2024) due to stronger pricing and productivity gains; APAC’s operating profit rose 18 % (2021→2022) and 6 % (2023→2024) from volume and project start‑ups; Engineering’s operating profit fell 16 % (2023→2024) after a prior‑year boost from Russian project wind‑downs; and Other turned from a $153 million loss in 2022 to a $62 million gain in 2024. Reconciling items shifted from purchase‑accounting impacts of $1,919 million (2022) and $1,969 million (2023) to $940 million in 2024, while cost‑reduction charges declined from $273 million (2022) to $145 million (2024).",

In 2024, the company disclosed that it had implemented foreign exchange hedging strategies that directly impacted its streaming revenues. Specifically, hedging gains of $124 million were included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year ended December 31, 2024. This indicates that while the core streaming revenue growth trajectory remained positive, the company actively managed foreign exchange risk in 2024, which contributed an incremental $124 million to its reported streaming revenues.",
      "llm_answer": "NFLX's streaming revenues increased 7% from 2023 to 2024, rising from $33,640,458 (in thousands) in 2023 to $33,640,458 (2024 figure shown as $17,359,369 in the 2024 regional breakdown but confirmed as 7% growth in the consolidated results). Foreign exchange hedging gains of $124 million were included in streaming revenues for 2024, as noted in the \"Streaming revenues\" footnote (which states \"Hedging gains of $124 million are included in 'Streaming revenues' for the year ended December 31, 2024\"). This hedging impact contributed to the revenue growth, though the core growth was driven by 8% growth in average paying memberships, partially offset by a 1% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron described crude oil liftings as a factor that 'impacted' its forward-looking statements, indicating an external influence among many others. By 2024, the company shifted its language to state that its forward-looking statements 'depend on' crude oil liftings, placing it among a narrower group of critical factors affecting outcomes. This change in phrasing indicates a more direct and central framing of crude oil liftings in relation to the company's projections, though the document does not quantify or elaborate on the extent of this dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 Chevron’s forward‑looking statements shifted from a general “crude oil liftings” reference to a more specific “timing of crude oil liftings” phrasing, reflecting a tighter focus on the timing of those liftings as a factor that could affect future performance. This evolution is evident in the 2022 filing’s broader language about “timing of crude oil liftings” and the 2024 filing’s more precise wording that directly ties the timing of crude oil liftings to forward‑looking statements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, gasoline costs were described as a negative impact on Costco's business, with rising energy prices contributing to adverse effects on demand, cost of inventory, and operational expenses. The company expressed concerns about its ability to pass on these cost increases without negatively affecting consumer demand. By 2024, however, the framing shifted: gasoline cost fluctuations were described as a factor influencing comparable sales growth, indicating that Costco had begun to treat gasoline price volatility not just as a cost burden, but as a lever affecting sales performance and potentially pricing strategy. This evolution shows that gasoline costs became a more integral, strategic variable in Costco's financial dynamics, rather than solely a risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, the role of gasoline costs in Costco’s financial performance shifted from being a significant drag on gross margin (as noted in 2023 when rising fuel prices pressured margins) to a more nuanced driver of results. In 2024, while gasoline remains a low-margin segment that can depress overall gross margin percentage, its impact was partially offset by stronger performance in warehouse ancillary businesses and e-commerce, contributing to a 35-basis-point gross margin expansion. The document indicates that rising gasoline prices historically affect consumer behavior and cost structures, but Costco’s ability to leverage scale and maintain pricing authority allowed it to mitigate some sensitivity. However, the company still acknowledges that gasoline price volatility remains an external risk that can influence merchandise costs and member spending patterns, underscoring its ongoing sensitivity to this economic factor despite strategic adaptations.",

      "llm_answer": "From 2021 to 2023, Netflix’s paid net membership additions grew dramatically—from 18,181 in 2021 to 29,529 in 2023 (a 62% increase from 2021 to 2022 and a 106% increase from 2021 to 2023). This surge in net additions drove a steady rise in paid memberships at the end of each period (221,844 in 2021 → 260,276 in 2023), indicating accelerating membership acquisition momentum. However, the growth rate of paid net additions slowed significantly in 2022 (50% decline from 2020) before rebounding sharply in 2023, reflecting a temporary deceleration followed by renewed acceleration in subscriber growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Lowe's completed the sale of its Canadian retail business, which included 232 company-operated stores and 210 dealer-owned stores, and began accounting for contingent consideration related to the transaction. By 2024, Lowe's no longer had an ownership stake in the Canadian retail business and instead recognized $177 million in pre-tax income from realized gains on the contingent consideration related to that sale, indicating a full transition from operational involvement to post-sale financial settlement.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Lowe's Canadian retail business was fully divested in February 2023, ending its operations and financial involvement. The company recorded a $177 million pre-tax gain in 2024 related to contingent consideration from the 2022 sale, while 2023 included a $63 million gain from the same transaction. This strategic exit allowed Lowe's to focus on its U.S. operations and capital allocation, with no ongoing financial or operational ties to the Canadian business.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, BMY reported IPRD-related impairment charges of $136 million, primarily due to discontinuation of development for certain investigational compounds. By 2024, these impairment charges surged to $2.9 billion, indicating a significant increase in the write-down of intangible assets, particularly IPRD. This evolution reflects a more aggressive reassessment of asset valuations, likely due to changing market conditions, regulatory challenges, or internal strategic shifts. The increase from $136 million to $2.9 billion shows a substantial change in how BMY evaluated the recoverability of its IPRD assets within a single year.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, BMY’s approach to IPRD-related impairment charges shifted markedly: in 2023 the company recorded only $136 million of intangible‑asset impairment, but in 2024 it recognized $2.9 billion of impairment charges (primarily for IPRD projects that were discontinued or downgraded). This increase reflects a more aggressive reassessment of the recoverability of its pipeline assets, indicating that BMY is now more willing to write down or retire intangible assets when market, clinical or regulatory outlooks change, and it signals a stricter, more conservative stance toward managing its intangible portfolio.",

However, in 2023, the company saw a significant turnaround with a 147% increase in paid net membership additions, adding 4,298 thousand new memberships compared to 2022. This indicates a strong recovery and positive shift in the company's growth trajectory after a period of membership stagnation and decline.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's paid net membership additions surged from 18,181 in 2021 to 29,529 in 2023, reflecting a 232% increase year-over-year in 2023 and a 50% decline from 2020 to 2021.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Converse's direct to consumer revenues increased by 22%, driven by strong digital demand, while wholesale revenues decreased by 4%, primarily due to ongoing marketplace dynamics in China and global supply chain constraints. By fiscal 2024, both channels experienced declines: direct to consumer revenues decreased by 14% on a currency-neutral basis, mainly due to reduced traffic in North America and Western Europe, and wholesale revenues fell by 16%, driven by declines across all geographies. The shift from growth to decline in direct to consumer and the deepening of the wholesale decline reflect changing market dynamics and increased promotional activity that reduced ASP by 3% in fiscal 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Converse’s direct‑to‑consumer (DTC) revenue grew sharply—up 22 % in fiscal 2022 and then fell 14 % in fiscal 2023 and 15 % in fiscal 2024—while wholesale revenue declined modestly (‑5 % in fiscal 2022, ‑16 % in fiscal 2023 and ‑16 % in fiscal 2024).  The key drivers were: (1) strong digital demand that lifted DTC sales in 2022, followed by reduced traffic and weaker wholesale demand in China and other markets that drove the later declines; and (2) a shift in product mix and pricing—higher ASPs in DTC lifted margins early on, but later lower full‑price ASPs and higher discounts, plus elevated freight and logistics costs, pressured margins.  Consequently, earnings before interest and taxes rose 23 % in fiscal 2022 (driven by gross‑margin expansion and revenue growth) but fell 30 % in fiscal 2024 as revenue contraction and margin pressure outweighed cost reductions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group highlighted its cash and investment balances, including $21.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and emphasized that fluctuations in asset values would not materially impact liquidity due to strong operating cash flows and access to credit facilities. Medical costs payable were part of the short-term obligations expected to be covered through operational cash flows and available liquidity. In 2023, the company placed greater emphasis on the estimation methodology for medical costs payable, noting that these estimates require complex assumptions and are inherently uncertain, often changing in subsequent periods. The 2023 disclosure also explicitly tied changes in estimates directly to earnings in the period they are adjusted, signaling a more dynamic and risk-sensitive approach to financial reporting around medical liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, UnitedHealth Group refined its medical costs payable estimates by applying more advanced actuarial methods—using observed medical cost trend factors for the most recent two months and completion factors for prior periods—to project incurred but unreported claims. This approach, which incorporates completion factors reflecting the percentage of claims adjudicated, allowed the company to adjust prior-period estimates, resulting in favorable development of $1.7 billion in 2021 that reduced current-period medical costs. Concurrently, the firm enhanced risk management by tightening assumptions around claim lag (approximately 47 days outstanding) and leveraging data-driven trend analysis to improve accuracy in forecasting medical cost liabilities.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' strategic involvement with Surmont evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what financial implications did this shift have in terms of asset ownership and capital structure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% working interest in Surmont for $3.0 billion (CAD $4.1 billion), transitioning from a partial owner to full ownership. This marked a significant shift in strategic involvement, as disclosed in the 2024 filing. The acquisition was funded through new debt issuance of $2.7 billion, increasing total debt from $16.6 billion in 2022 to $18.9 billion by the end of 2023. This reflects a transformation from a shared-operational model to full control, which likely influenced capital allocation decisions, including the planned $9 billion return of capital in 2024, signaling confidence in the company’s post-acquisition financial positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024 ConocoPhillips shifted from a 50 % stake to full ownership of the Surmont asset by acquiring the remaining half from TotalEnergies in October 2023 for roughly $2.7 billion (plus a contingent‑payment mechanism tied to WCS prices). This move gave the company 100 % control of the Canadian heavy‑oil project, adding about $3 billion of proved and unproved reserves to its balance sheet and expanding its Canadian production base.  \n\nFinancially, the acquisition was funded largely through new long‑term debt issuance ($2.7 billion) and a $1.1 billion debt‑refinancing that extended maturities and reduced near‑term obligations. The added leverage raised total debt from $16.6 billion at year‑end 2022 to $18.9 billion at year‑end 2023, but the company mitigated pressure on its capital structure by simultaneously refinancing existing obligations and maintaining a strong revolving credit facility. The transaction also supported the firm’s broader capital‑return framework, enabling larger shareholder payouts while preserving liquidity through its $5.5 billion commercial‑paper program and a $11–$11.5 billion 2024 capital‑expenditure budget.",

This indicates a consistent or growing level of investment in capital projects over the two-year period, as interest capitalization typically reflects ongoing major capital investments. The increase from $62 million to $68 million suggests a moderate upward trend in the company's capital spending.",
      "llm_answer": "The interest capitalized declined from $57 million in 2022 to $38 million in 2023 and further to $68 million in 2024, indicating a modest increase in recent years but still representing a relatively small portion of total interest expense. This trend suggests that the company’s capital‑project investment has been limited or that financing costs have been managed conservatively, with only modest capitalization of interest during the construction or development of long‑term assets.",

In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with current content liabilities remaining unchanged at $4.5 billion, but non-current content liabilities decreased to $2.6 billion.

The majority of the obligations—about $14.6 billion in 2023 versus $14.2 billion in 2022—remain off‑balance‑sheet and are expected to be paid over the next several years, with the bulk due within one year.",

However, by fiscal 2024, Converse revenues had decreased by 15% on a currency-neutral basis. This decline was primarily attributed to drops in North America and Western Europe, with combined wholesale and direct-to-consumer unit sales down 12%, driven largely by a decrease in wholesale. Additionally, average selling price (ASP) fell by 3%, mainly due to increased promotional activity in the direct-to-consumer channel.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, Converse’s revenue trajectory showed a clear shift from growth to decline. In fiscal 2022, Converse revenues increased 6% to $2,346 million (up from $2,205 million in fiscal 2021), driven by strong performance in North America and Asia Pacific, with a 7% reported revenue growth (8% excluding currency changes). However, by fiscal 2024, revenues had dropped 15% to $2,082 million (down from $2,427 million in fiscal 2023), with a 15% decline on a currency-neutral basis. This downturn was primarily attributed to reduced sales in North America and Western Europe, where combined unit sales fell 12% due to lower wholesale volumes and reduced direct-to-consumer traffic, compounded by a 3% decrease in average selling price (ASP) from heightened promotional activity. The decline was partially offset by growth in Asia, but overall, Converse’s financial trajectory shifted negatively due to weakening demand in key markets and margin pressures from lower ASPs and higher promotional discounts.",

By 2024, the company had already spent $7.7 billion on lower carbon investments since 2021, including $2.9 billion from the acquisition of REG in 2022, reaffirming its commitment to the same $10 billion total target through 2028. This indicates that Chevron has maintained its long-term capital commitment to lower carbon initiatives, while accelerating spending in the early years, particularly through strategic acquisitions that support its broader decarbonization goals.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power had $26 million in derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes, split between $11 million current and $15 million non-current. By 2024, this amount increased significantly to $110 million total liabilities, with $69 million current and $41 million non-current. This indicates a substantial increase in Alabama Power's risk exposure tied to regulatory hedging instruments over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided pages, Alabama Power's derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes decreased from $122 million at December 31 2023 to $110 million at December 31 2024 (as shown in the \"Derivative Financial Statement Presentation and Amounts\" table for Alabama Power). This decline indicates a reduction in its regulatory‑hedged derivative liabilities, suggesting a modest decrease in its exposure to fuel‑price volatility that is recoverable through regulated rates.",

      "question": "How did Thermo Fisher Scientific's strategic focus within the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of acquisitions and revenue performance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Thermo Fisher Scientific expanded its Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment through the acquisition of CorEvitas, LLC, a provider of regulatory-grade, real-world evidence solutions aimed at improving drug development efficiency. This signaled a strategic move to enhance decision-making tools in biopharma services. By 2024, the segment's revenues increased slightly from $23.041 billion to $23.157 billion, indicating a continuation and consolidation of prior strategic initiatives, though no new major acquisitions were disclosed for that year. This reflects a shift from active expansion through acquisitions in 2023 to a more stable growth phase in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 Thermo Fisher’s Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment showed modest revenue growth (up 2 % in 2023, essentially flat in 2024), driven by higher sales in clinical‑research and pharma‑services channels, while segment‑income margin fell from 14.6 % to 13.3 % due to unfavorable business mix and strategic investments, despite productivity gains. The segment also saw a new acquisition—CorEvitas, LLC in August 2023 and Olink Holding AB in July 2024—that expanded its real‑world‑evidence and proteomics capabilities, but these deals did not materially shift the segment’s organic growth trajectory. Overall, revenue performance remained steady, with only slight organic growth and margin pressure.",

In 2023, the company's strategy shifted significantly, with wind expenditures decreasing to $2,820 million and solar expenditures increasing substantially to $3,270 million.

      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed capital expenditures in the \"Capital Expenditures\" table (NEER section), NEER's capital allocation strategy in wind and solar projects evolved from 2022 to 2023 as follows:  \n- **Wind**: Capital expenditures increased from **$3,359 million (2022)** to **$2,820 million (2024 estimate)**, but the 2023 figure ($3,777 million) shows a *decrease* from 2022 ($3,359 million) in the \"Years Ended December 31\" table (though the 2024 projection indicates a strategic shift toward higher wind investment in subsequent years).  \n- **Solar**: Capital expenditures rose significantly from **$1,920 million (2022)** to **$2,011 million (2023)**, with a notable increase in solar-plus-storage projects (e.g., $304 million for battery storage in 2023 vs. $168 million in 2022).  \nOverall, NEER prioritized *expanding solar capacity* (including storage integration) while maintaining wind investment, reflecting a strategic shift toward diversified clean energy projects with higher near-term solar spending.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Tire Installation was listed among other warehouse ancillary services, but it was embedded within a broader list that included gasoline, pharmacy, optical, and food court services. By 2024, Tire Installation was explicitly called out as a distinct category under warehouse ancillary services, indicating a more deliberate emphasis on its importance. This evolution suggests that Costco may have elevated the strategic positioning of Tire Installation, potentially aligning it more closely with core member services to drive traffic or enhance the value proposition for members.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco's Tire Installation service has evolved from being a peripheral, ancillary offering highlighted only in the 2022 filing as part of its broader \"warehouse ancillary\" category (e.g., listed alongside gasoline, pharmacy, and optical services) to a more prominent, strategically integrated component of its business model by 2024. By the 2024 filing, tire installation is explicitly grouped under \"Warehouse Ancillary\" but now carries greater emphasis as a key driver of member engagement and revenue, reflected in the expanded description of ancillary services and the inclusion of tire-related benefits within the broader context of member value propositions, though specific tire installation metrics or dedicated financial impact are not detailed in the provided excerpts.",

This indicates a slight strategic emphasis on the segment, potentially driven by expanded provisioning of missile subsystems, including next-generation capabilities such as hypersonic rocket cases, which were specifically highlighted in 2023.",

This modest growth and the 10‑basis‑point rise in operating margin to 14.5% indicate that the segment is being strategically positioned to leverage higher‑margin international wheeled‑vehicle contracts and U.S. Stryker M‑SHORAD production, supporting a stable, high‑margin revenue base.",

      "llm_answer": "Honeywell's repositioning charges declined from $1,266 million in 2022 to $860 million in 2023, reflecting a reduction in workforce‑related severance, asset impairments and exit costs as the company progressed with its restructuring initiatives. This decrease indicates that Honeywell is winding down many of its prior repositioning projects and shifting focus from large‑scale cost‑cutting to more targeted productivity and transformation actions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, Linde plc reported income from equity investments at $119 million, with an adjusted figure of $231 million, primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in APAC effective January 1, 2021. By 2024, the reported income from equity investments had stabilized at $170 million, with values of $167 million in 2023 and $172 million in 2022. This represents a decrease from the adjusted 2021 level but shows relative stability in recent years. The earlier increase in 2021 was partially offset by a $35 million impairment charge in the third quarter of that year related to an APAC joint venture, while the more recent figures suggest a normalization following the structural change in 2021.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's income from equity investments increased from $85 million in 2020 to $119 million in 2021 on a reported basis, and rose further to $231 million on an adjusted basis versus $142 million in 2020. The growth was driven primarily by the deconsolidation of an APAC joint venture that shifted to equity‑income treatment, partially offset in 2021 by a $35 million impairment charge. Consequently, the composition shifted from a smaller, relatively stable equity‑income figure to a larger, more variable component reflecting both the new equity‑income stream and the impairment impact.",

By 2023, Booking Holdings reclassified these indirect taxes into 'Sales and other expenses' to align with a presentation that reflects costs more closely tied to revenue changes.

This reclassification, disclosed in Note 21, adjusted 2022 Sales and Other Expenses by $168 million and 2021 by $98 million, improving alignment with revenue-driven cost variability. The composition of Sales and Other Expenses remained focused on merchant transaction costs, payment processing fees, and credit loss provisions, which increased due to higher merchant activity but were partially offset by reduced credit loss expenses.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported $21.8 billion in total content obligations, consisting of $4.5 billion in current content liabilities, $3.1 billion in non-current content liabilities, and $14.2 billion in off-balance-sheet obligations. In 2023, the total content obligations slightly decreased to $21.7 billion, with $4.5 billion in current content liabilities, $2.6 billion in non-current content liabilities, and $14.6 billion in off-balance-sheet obligations. This reflects a minor shift in the composition of obligations, with a small decrease in non-current liabilities offset by a slight increase in off-balance-sheet commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Netflix's content obligations remained largely unchanged in amount ($21.8 billion in 2022 vs. $21.7 billion in 2023), but the accounting treatment shifted: a larger portion was recorded on‑balance‑sheet (current and non‑current content liabilities) while the remainder stayed off‑balance‑sheet as unrecorded commitments. This reflects the same multi‑year, fixed‑cost nature of its streaming content liabilities, with the on‑balance‑sheet portion growing slightly and the off‑balance‑sheet commitments decreasing marginally.",

In the 2023 tables (COF_10k_2023.pdf, pages 180‑184), total derivative liabilities were shown as $2,932 million before netting and $2,335 million after the netting adjustment; the 2024 tables (COF_10k_2024.pdf, pages 190‑194) reflect $2,032 million gross and $1,728 million net after netting.

At the same time, overall production in the Norway segment increased modestly, with Total MBOED growing from 135 MBOED in 2021 to 115 MBOED in 2023 (reflecting a net increase in crude oil and natural‑gas volumes from the Greater Ekofisk Area, Heidrun, Aasta Hansteen, Troll, Visund and other Norwegian fields).",

This indicates a decline in the segment's financial performance year-over-year. The drop from $105 million to $69 million suggests a reduced contribution to the company's consolidated results, signaling a potential challenge or strategic shift affecting this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Life Sciences Solutions segment’s revenue declined 26% organically in 2023 (from $13.532 bn to $9.977 bn), driven primarily by a moderation in COVID‑19‑related sales, which also caused its segment‑income margin to fall from 41.2% to 34.3%. This downturn contributed to the overall consolidated revenue drop of 5% and a 18% decline in GAAP operating income, indicating that the segment’s weakness was a key factor behind the company’s reduced profitability and cash‑flow outlook.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Honeywell detailed a specific methodology for estimating asbestos-related liabilities, including the use of average resolution values over a defined look-back period for both pending and future claims projected through 2059. The company also recorded probable insurance recoveries, factoring in the solvency status of insurers, and acknowledged the uncertainty in projections due to variables like future claims filing rates and disease classifications. By 2024, the disclosure became more generalized, focusing on the unpredictability of litigation outcomes and contingent liabilities without specifying the same detailed methodology. The 2024 filing emphasized broader uncertainties, including the potential impact of new developments, settlement strategies, and evidentiary requirements, but omitted the detailed actuarial assumptions present in the 2023 report.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Honeywell’s methodology for estimating asbestos-related liabilities remained consistent—continuing to accrue for pending claims using average resolution values over a defined look‑back period and projecting future claims through 2059 based on historic filing and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and anticipated resolution values. However, the 2024 disclosures highlight increased uncertainty in insurance recoveries: the company now explicitly reassesses the probability and amount of probable insurance recoveries each year, acknowledging that changes in projected liabilities, recovery experience, insurer solvency, and other factors could cause the estimated insurance reimbursement to be higher or lower than previously recorded. This heightened focus on re‑evaluation reflects the inherent unpredictability of future claim volumes and the potential volatility of insurance recoveries.",

By 2024, there was no indication of any divestiture or change in ownership of Surmont; however, the company disclosed plans to sell noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment for approximately $400 million.

The company subsequently maintained this full ownership through 2024, while also making contingent payments under the acquisition agreement (up to $0.4 billion CAD) and recognizing $158 million of such payments during 2024.

      "question": "How has Linde's treatment and disclosure of purchase accounting impacts evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its influence on segment operating profit and management's performance evaluation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde excluded purchase accounting impacts from its non-GAAP measures, emphasizing that these adjustments were critical for investor understanding due to their uneven geographic impact and the fact that management and variable compensation were assessed based on results excluding these impacts. By 2024, purchase accounting impacts were explicitly included in the company's definition of segment operating profit, indicating a shift in how these impacts are communicated and evaluated internally and externally. This evolution reflects a more integrated approach to reporting these adjustments within segment performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde’s purchase‑accounting disclosures have become more prominent and standardized from 2022 to 2024, with the company explicitly quantifying the impacts of fair‑value step‑ups in assets, debt‑amortization and non‑controlling‑interest adjustments on segment operating profit and adjusted EBITDA. These adjustments are now presented separately in the “Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations” and “Adjusted EBITDA” reconciliations, and the firm emphasizes that excluding purchase‑accounting effects is essential for comparing segment performance and evaluating management because the merger of equals created significant, non‑comparable variances across geographies. Consequently, the adjusted metrics—particularly adjusted EBITDA margins, which rose from 31.6 % (reported) to 33.1 % (adjusted) in 2024—reflect a clearer view of underlying operating profitability that drives segment profit and performance‑based compensation.",

However, the key quantitative shift occurred between 2022 and 2023, where ARM rose sharply from $11.76 to $11.64 (a 1% decline), followed by a slight rebound to $11.70 in 2024. The most significant change was the 16% year-over-year revenue growth in 2024, driven by both membership expansion and price increases, though ARM growth remained minimal due to pricing adjustments and foreign exchange headwinds.",

By 2024, the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment reported $6,030 million in performance obligations, reflecting a measurable financial commitment to this area. This suggests that the company elevated both the strategic and operational emphasis on Energy and Sustainability Solutions through leadership changes and increased contractual financial obligations.",

The company’s pension‑related disclosures show that the 2024 expected rate of return on plan assets was raised to 7.00 % (up from the 2023 level) and the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations fell to 4.97 % at year‑end 2023, producing a $538 million expected pension ongoing income for 2024 (versus $528 million in 2023).  These changes, together with the sensitivity analysis, indicate that the firm’s pension accounting assumptions have been adjusted upward for asset returns while the discount rate has been lowered, affecting both ongoing expense and projected benefit obligations.",

      "question": "How did the composition and total value of Non-Marketable Securities evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of the Measurement Alternative and Equity Method components?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Total Non-Marketable Securities were valued at $1,223 million, with the Measurement Alternative at $1,008 million and the Equity Method at $215 million. By 2024, the Total Non-Marketable Securities increased to $1,370 million, driven by a rise in the Measurement Alternative to $1,140 million and a slight increase in the Equity Method to $230 million. This shows both components contributing to the overall growth in Non-Marketable Securities.",
      "llm_answer": "The composition of Non‑Marketable Securities shifted from 2023 to 2024, with Measurement‑Alternative holdings rising to $1,140 million (up from $1,008 million) and Equity‑Method holdings increasing to $230 million (up from $215 million); total Non‑Marketable Securities grew to $1,370 million from $1,223 million.  The overall value of these securities therefore expanded by roughly $147 million, driven primarily by upward adjustments and new purchases in the Measurement‑Alternative component, while the Equity‑Method portion saw modest growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average monthly revenue per paying membership was $9.56, while in 2023 it decreased to $8.66. This represents a decline in the average revenue generated per membership, suggesting a potential shift in the company's pricing strategy or a change in the mix of membership plans offered. The decrease could also indicate efforts to attract more subscribers by offering lower-cost plans, as evidenced by the increase in paid memberships at the end of the period.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the average monthly revenue per paying membership declined slightly from $11.76 to $11.64, a decrease of about 1%. This modest drop indicates that Netflix's pricing strategy remained largely stable, with only limited price increases offset by shifts in plan mix and growth in lower-priced regional markets. The company maintained its value proposition through incremental content investment and global expansion rather than aggressive price hikes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power was listed as a Southern Company subsidiary with a capital investment of $2,746 million, but no specific disclosures were made about derivative liabilities or hedging instruments. In 2024, Alabama Power had specific disclosures showing $26 million in total derivatives designated for regulatory purposes, with $42 million in non-current liabilities and $23 million net recognized liabilities on the balance sheet. The 2024 disclosures also included a breakdown of current and non-current portions of these derivatives, indicating a more detailed regulatory reporting structure compared to the general segment reporting in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, Alabama Power's treatment of energy-related derivatives designated for regulatory purposes shifted from being recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets (with gains/losses initially captured in regulatory accounts) to a more structured balance sheet presentation that includes both current and non‑current regulatory assets and liabilities. In the 2024 balance sheet, these derivatives are shown net of offsetting amounts, with current regulatory liabilities of $30 million and non‑current regulatory liabilities of $41 million (total $71 million), while corresponding regulatory assets were $7 million (current) and $23 million (non‑current), reflecting a net regulatory asset position of $30 million.

However, this was partly offset by higher manufacturing costs and unfavorable volume/mix due to lower cigarette mix. In 2024, Operating Income Excl. increased by 25.1%, primarily due to favorable pricing and volume/mix driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. However, lower manufacturing costs were largely offset by higher marketing, administration, and research costs, and a favorable comparison to the prior year was noted due to the South Korea indirect tax charge of $204 million in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating income (excluding currency and acquisitions) declined 41.1% in the Americas segment from 2023 to 2024, primarily due to higher marketing, administration, and research costs (including incremental U.S. investments), elevated restructuring charges of $169 million, and increased amortization of intangibles ($355 million), which outweighed the favorable volume/mix and pricing impacts from growth in ZYN nicotine pouches and pricing advantages.",

      "question": "How has the composition and growth trajectory of Windows Commercial revenue evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in relation to security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and cloud services?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Windows Commercial revenue was described as being driven by demand for volume licensing, Software Assurance, and advanced security offerings such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, with an emphasis on the number of information workers in enterprises rather than PC sales. By 2023, the revenue categorization expanded to include 'Windows Commercial products and cloud services,' explicitly listing Windows cloud services as a component alongside volume licensing. The inclusion of 'cloud services' in the 2023 breakdown indicates a strategic shift toward integrating cloud-based offerings into the Windows Commercial portfolio. This evolution suggests that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, as part of the broader cloud services, became more embedded within a diversified set of commercial offerings, aligning with the company's emphasis on cloud transformation and subscription-based models. The 2023 filing also introduced a formalized growth metric for this revenue segment, signaling a more structured approach to tracking and expanding this part of the business.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Windows Commercial revenue grew significantly, driven by increased demand for volume licensing and advanced security offerings like Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, while Windows OEM revenue remained relatively independent of PC unit sales. The Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes Azure and server products, grew 20% year-over-year, with Azure revenue rising 30% due to cloud consumption growth and hybrid solution demand, reflecting a strategic shift toward cloud-based services. This transition is further evidenced by Microsoft's reclassification of Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers to include Basic tiers and the emphasis on Microsoft Cloud revenue metrics in its financial reporting.",

      "original_answer": "The estimated potential contract value in Gulfstream's defense segments increased from $35.9 billion in 2022 to $37.9 billion in 2023, indicating a modest growth in future revenue visibility. This suggests that Gulfstream has seen an expansion in the value of unexercised contract options and unfunded work under IDIQ contracts, which contributes to longer-term revenue potential despite the uncertainty around future funding.",
      "llm_answer": "The estimated potential contract value in Gulfstream's defense segments declined from $42.4 billion at the end of 2020 to $35.9 billion by the end of 2022, reflecting a downward trend in unfunded work and exercised options within the Technologies and Combat Systems segments.

This modest dip indicates that while the company continued growing its subscriber base (paid net additions surged 232%), it faced pressure from lower pricing in certain regions and a shift toward more price-sensitive plans, suggesting a strategic focus on market expansion over pure pricing power.",

In 2024, the company recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million specifically for the India reporting unit as of September 30, 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 10.4%, driven by a favorable pricing variance mainly from combustible tobacco, a favorable comparison related to Saudi Arabia customs assessments of $246 million, and a favorable volume/mix primarily from higher cigarette and HTU volumes. In 2024, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix mainly from higher HTU volume, but partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a shift in growth drivers from broad pricing and volume gains across both product lines in 2023 to a more HTU-focused volume/mix benefit in 2024, with some moderation in pricing impact.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions grew 11.7% in SSEA/CIS/MEA and 19.3% in the Americas, driven by favorable pricing (especially higher combustible tobacco and ZYN pricing) and positive volume/mix dynamics (higher HTU and nicotine pouch volumes), though pricing variance was partially offset by lower cigarette volume in some regions. Operating income rose 26.8% in SSEA/CIS/MEA due to favorable pricing and volume/mix, while it declined 41.1% in the Americas due to higher marketing, restructuring, and amortization costs despite strong volume/mix growth.",

In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, increased by $122 million, but after write-offs of $199 million and adjustments for foreign currency, ended at $577 million. This indicates a shift in inventory risk exposure, with a notable reduction in the allowance balance by the end of 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting either improved inventory management or a strategic reduction in inventory holdings.",
      "llm_answer": "The Allowance For Inventory Losses increased from $631 million at the beginning of 2023 to $658 million at the end of 2023, reflecting additions of $201 million and write‑offs of $183 million, and it rose further to $631 million at the start of 2024 before ending the year at $658 million.

      "question": "How did the average paying memberships and their associated revenue per membership evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about Netflix's subscriber growth and pricing strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported an average of 40,000 thousand paying memberships with an average monthly revenue per membership of $8.48. By 2023, the average paying memberships increased to 42,802 thousand, while the average monthly revenue per membership rose slightly to $8.66. This indicates that Netflix experienced both subscriber growth and a modest increase in pricing, likely reflecting a combination of successful market expansion and strategic price adjustments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, average paying memberships grew 8% (from 222,924 to 240,889), while average monthly revenue per paying membership declined 1% (from $11.67 to $11.64). This indicates Netflix achieved subscriber growth through a larger member base but faced pressure on pricing, likely due to competitive market dynamics and strategic pricing adjustments, while maintaining overall revenue growth through volume expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Philip Morris's cigarette market share in Europe was 30.3%, down from 31.1% in 2022, reflecting a decline of 0.8 percentage points. In 2024, the cigarette market share remained unchanged at 30.3% compared to the prior year, indicating that the rate of decline slowed to zero. This suggests a potential stabilization in PM's cigarette business in Europe, which may reflect strategic adjustments or competitive responses to market pressures, including competition from heated tobacco products which saw continued growth in market share.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Philip Morris International's cigarette market share in Europe declined slightly from 31.1% to 30.3%, while its heated tobacco (HTU) share increased from 7.8% to 9.1%, resulting in a modest overall regional share increase from 39.0% to 39.4%. The slower decline in overall market share (0.4 percentage point increase) suggests improved competitive positioning, particularly through growth in the faster-expanding heated tobacco segment, despite overall market contraction. This indicates PMI is gaining relative ground in Europe, especially in the high-growth HTU category, even as total market volumes shrink.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, IBM described its business as 'depending on' client spending budgets, highlighting that a downturn in economic environment and client spending could impact its revenue and profit. In 2024, the company shifted its framing, describing the relationship as being 'impacted by' client spending budgets and economic conditions. This indicates a more passive but still significant sensitivity to external spending trends, suggesting a strategic reframing of how client budgets influence IBM's business outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "The document shows that IBM's view of the link between client spending and its own performance has shifted markedly from 2023 to 2024. In the 2023 filing, IBM warned that a downturn in the economic environment and client‑spending budgets could “impact the company’s business” and that “if overall demand for IBM’s products and solutions decreases… the company’s revenue and profit could be impacted.” By the 2024 filing, this language is expanded and reframed to stress that such a downturn could “impact the company’s revenue and profit” and also “could impact the company’s ability to maintain and increase its market share and its profit margins,” indicating a more explicit concern that reduced client spending directly threatens both top‑line growth and margin performance. Thus, IBM’s characterization evolved from a general caution about demand to a specific focus on how cuts in client budgets could erode revenue, market share, and profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Mastercard classified its net revenues into two categories: (i) payment network and (ii) value-added services and solutions, with the payment network primarily generating revenue from fees based on GDV (including both domestic and cross-border volume) and for providing switching and other network-related services. By 2024, the company consolidated its reporting into a single reportable operating segment called 'Payment Solutions,' which derives revenue from a wide range of payment solutions provided to customers, including access to the continuous payment network and value-added services either integrated or sold standalone. This evolution indicates a shift from a dual classification of revenue sources to a more unified segment reporting approach, where all activities are considered interrelated and supportive of each other.",
      "llm_answer": "Mastercard has consolidated its payment network and value‑added services under a single “Payment Solutions” reportable segment, and in its 2024 10‑K it continues to classify revenue from the network as “payment network” revenue and from value‑added services as “value‑added services and solutions.”  The 2023 10‑K similarly presented two categories—payment network and value‑added services—so the classification has remained unchanged; however, the 2024 filing expands the segment‑reporting tables and adds more detail on geographic revenue and on the internal allocation of resources by the chief operating decision maker.  No fundamental shift in how the network segment is measured or reported occurs between 2023 and 2024; the evolution is limited to greater granularity and additional disclosures in the 2024 filing.",

By 2024, the segment's revenue sources were described as primarily coming from 'healthcare-related services' and internet services, suggesting a shift from general health technology toward more direct healthcare services. While internet services remained a consistent revenue contributor in both years, the evolution from 'health technology' to 'healthcare-related services' implies a more specialized or clinical orientation in the later year. This change may reflect a strategic pivot toward monetizable healthcare solutions within the Other Bets portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Alphabet’s Other Bets segment saw healthcare-related revenue grow from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, driven by increased sales of health‑technology products and services, while overall Other Bets revenue remained relatively flat around $2.5 billion.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company underwrote consumer loans using proprietary models that included deal structure data, and Table 21 provided credit score distribution details for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. By 2023, the company continued to incorporate deal structure data into its underwriting process, but Table 21 was updated to reflect credit score distribution metrics as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. This indicates that while the use of deal structure data remained consistent, the underlying credit score metrics used in underwriting evolved to reflect more recent borrower risk profiles.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the disclosed credit score metrics for the domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, the use of deal structure data in underwriting has remained consistent in its reliance on credit scores as a core underwriting input, but the specific credit score thresholds and performance metrics have evolved slightly year-over-year. In 2023, the proportion of auto loans with FICO scores above 660 increased to 53% (from 50% in 2022), while the share of subprime borrowers (620 or below) decreased to 27% (from 34% in 2022), indicating a modest improvement in credit quality. For domestic credit cards, the proportion of borrowers with FICO scores above 660 remained stable at 68% (vs. 69% in 2022), with the 660 or below segment slightly increasing to 32% (from 31%). These shifts reflect a continued use of credit score data to segment risk and inform underwriting adjustments, particularly in auto lending, where higher credit score tiers are now associated with a larger share of the portfolio, potentially signaling a strategic shift toward more creditworthy borrowers.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, AMT evaluated strategic alternatives for its India operations, receiving third-party indications of value that were lower than the carrying value of the India reporting unit. This information was used as a significant input in determining the fair value of the unit during the goodwill impairment test, although no impairment was explicitly recorded in that year. By contrast, in 2024, the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the India reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, leading to a goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2023. This marks a shift from a potential strategic exit with uncertain impairment implications to a concrete recognition of value loss.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial impact of the India reporting unit on AMT evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024, marked by a substantial goodwill impairment charge of $322.0 million recorded in 2023 due to declining fair value indicators from third-party valuations and strategic review of the India operations. This impairment, along with a $80.0 million impairment in Spain, contributed to a total goodwill impairment of $402.0 million in 2023, reflecting the unit's diminished fair value relative to its carrying amount. By 2024, the India operations were fully divested through the ATC TIPL transaction, eliminating the reporting unit and its associated goodwill from AMT's balance sheet, with no further impairment charges related to India thereafter.",

      "question": "How did Amgen's treatment and valuation of developed-product-technology rights evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of asset composition and acquisition activity?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Amgen reported developed-product-technology rights with a gross carrying amount of $25,561 million as of December 31, 2021, and $25,591 million as of December 31, 2020, indicating relative stability in the overall valuation of these assets. By 2023, Amgen's disclosures revealed a shift in the composition and sourcing of these rights, noting that developed-product-technology rights now included assets acquired through the Horizon and ChemoCentryx acquisitions. This marks a change from 2022, where no such specific acquisitions were cited in the description of these rights. The inclusion of these new acquisitions in 2023 suggests a strategic expansion in Amgen’s portfolio of developed-product-technology rights, likely influencing the valuation and structure of these assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023 Amgen’s developed‑product‑technology rights grew from $25.6 bn (gross) with $12.8 bn accumulated amortization in 2022 to $48.6 bn gross and $18.0 bn accumulated amortization in 2023, reflecting the addition of new acquired rights (e.g., from the Horizon and Teneobio acquisitions) and increased amortization expense. This expansion was accompanied by a rise in total finite‑lived intangible assets from $32.0 bn (net $14.1 bn) in 2022 to $55.2 bn gross (net $31.4 bn) in 2023, indicating a broader portfolio of acquired technology and licensing rights. At the same time, acquisition activity shifted toward larger, indefinite‑lived IPR&D investments (e.g., $1.1 bn of IPR&D from Teneobio) and the company continued to record new finite‑lived intangibles, but the pace of new product‑technology right acquisitions accelerated, driving the overall increase in asset composition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, net revenues excluding currency and acquisitions increased by 11.2%, driven by favorable volume/mix primarily from higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume and unfavorable smoke-free product mix, along with favorable pricing variance. In 2024, this growth slowed to 8.6%, still driven by favorable pricing variance and volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, with lower cigarette volume as a partial offset. The decline in growth rate from 11.2% to 8.6% indicates a moderation in the rate of expansion despite continued strength in HTU volume.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, slowed from 11.7% in 2023 to 8.6% in 2024, driven primarily by favorable pricing and volume/mix gains—especially in heated tobacco—partly offset by lower cigarette volume and unfavorable mix. Operating income rose 13.4% overall, with a much stronger 25.1% increase when excluding currency and acquisitions, reflecting similar favorable pricing and volume/mix dynamics but also lower manufacturing costs and a favorable comparison to prior-year charges.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums could negatively impact its financial results, particularly outside the United States, due to the potential for significant premium increases driven by the insolvencies of unrelated companies. However, in 2024, the company expanded its discussion to include more detailed context on how it manages broader financial risks, such as currency and financing risks, which may indirectly influence the impact of these premiums. Despite this broader framing, there was no explicit quantitative change in the disclosed exposure related to pension insolvency insurance premiums between the two years, indicating a stable risk profile for this specific item.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures, the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on IBM's results of operations is expected to be negative and could be significant. Specifically, IBM's 2024 Annual Report notes that \"premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States\" could be \"significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the country at issue,\" and that \"the company's results could be negatively impacted by premiums for mandatory pension insolvency insurance coverage outside the United States.\" This risk is explicitly tied to potential increases in insurance costs driven by broader insolvency trends, which would directly affect IBM's financial results.",

By 2024, Alphabet's involvement in Other Bets evolved into a more active investment and development approach, with a focus on 'using technology to solve big problems' across industries like transportation and health technology. The 2024 report also highlights that some Other Bets are 'already generating revenue and making important strides,' showing a shift from early-stage exploration to more mature, revenue-generating ventures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Alphabet's strategic involvement in Other Bets shifted from early-stage R&D toward more concrete product integration and commercialization. The 2022 filing emphasizes AI as a long-term moonshot foundational to future growth, while the 2024 filing shows tangible progress: AI features like Gemini Nano (on-device AI), Gemini for Google Search (AI Overviews), and Circle to Search are now embedded in core products like Pixel devices and Android, driving user engagement. This reflects a move from theoretical investment to operational deployment, with Other Bets (including health tech and autonomous driving via Waymo) now contributing measurable revenue streams and strategic focus areas like AI infrastructure (Vertex AI, Gemini for Cloud) and sustainability. Investment remains heavily weighted toward AI and cloud, with Other Bets operating as independent entities but increasingly integrated into Alphabet's core monetization strategy.",

      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, Tesla's relationship with its Megafactory in Lathrop, California evolved from being a leased facility in 2022 to being actively referenced in 2023 as part of its energy storage production strategy. The 2022 document notes construction had begun on the Megafactory to increase energy storage product manufacturing, while the 2023 document explicitly states the facility is \"leased\" and emphasizes that \"better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher customer interest\" for Powerwall, with the Megafactory being part of the broader energy storage expansion. Strategically, the Megafactory's development was tied to Tesla's goal of scaling energy storage production to meet high demand and improve margins through greater volumes, though its operation remained subject to \"global component constraints\" mentioned in both years. The facility's status shifted from a planned construction project to an operational leased site integral to Tesla's energy storage deployment strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed that a 1% difference in medical costs payable estimates would have impacted 2021 net earnings by approximately $184 million. In 2023, the company provided a more granular sensitivity table showing specific dollar impacts of completion factor changes on medical costs payable, with a 0.75% change leading to an $867 million impact. This evolution indicates a shift from a general sensitivity estimate to a more detailed, scenario-based analysis of medical cost liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "The sensitivity analysis shows that a 1% change in the completion factors and medical cost trend factors would shift medical costs payable by roughly $290 million to $880 million (in 2021) or $292 million to $1,128 million (in 2023), translating to about a $245 million impact on net earnings for a 1% variance in the 2023 estimate.",

In contrast, in 2024, the increase in net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, was significantly higher at 8.6%, driven by a favorable pricing variance and favorable volume/mix, mainly from higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume. This indicates a substantial improvement in revenue performance from 2023 to 2024.",

By fiscal 2023, this reserve increased significantly by approximately $106 million, reaching $245 million as of February 2, 2024.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle described its Services Business as one of three operating segments, but the strategic positioning focused primarily on general enterprise IT environments with a broad spectrum of applications and infrastructure technologies. The Services Business was not explicitly tied to cloud adoption but rather positioned as a flexible offering across deployment models. By fiscal 2023, Oracle significantly evolved its strategic positioning of the Services Business, explicitly linking it to cloud adoption and customer support. The 2023 filing emphasized that customers could 'continue to benefit from our offerings, research and development efforts and deep IT expertise by electing to purchase and renew Oracle support offerings for their license and hardware deployments.' This included integration with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and AI-enhanced offerings like Oracle Autonomous Database, which used machine learning to automate traditionally manual functions. The Services Business in 2023 was framed as a key enabler of cloud migration and customer retention, with a focus on supporting Oracle Cloud Services contracts and product enhancements.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's Services Business shifted from being a smaller, lower-margin component of its overall strategy to a more central pillar of growth, particularly through deeper integration with cloud adoption. In fiscal 2023, the company explicitly highlighted that \"the proportion of our cloud services and license support revenues relative to our total revenues has increased\" and that \"we expect these trends to continue,\" signaling a strategic pivot toward cloud-driven services. This included expanding programs to help customers migrate existing workloads to Oracle Cloud and emphasizing SaaS and OCI offerings as key growth engines, while services revenue represented a stable 8% of total revenue in both 2022 and 2023 but with a stronger focus on supporting cloud transitions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM reported capturing $9.7 billion of structural cost savings compared to 2019, including $2.3 billion of savings realized specifically during that year. By 2024, the company continued to emphasize structural cost savings as a key earnings driver, incorporating it into its newly introduced earnings driver framework. While the 2024 disclosure does not provide a new cumulative savings figure, the explicit inclusion of structural cost savings as a defined earnings driver indicates a strategic shift to institutionalize cost efficiency as a recurring component of earnings performance. This evolution shows that XOM transitioned from achieving cost savings as a阶段性 initiative to embedding it as a core financial metric in its reporting and operational strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's structural cost savings accelerated from $2.3 billion realized in 2023 to an estimated $12.1 billion of cumulative savings by 2024, reflecting ongoing operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and supply‑chain improvements; this demonstrates a strategic focus on sustaining lower‑cost, higher‑margin operations amid a shifting energy landscape.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, the Core Routing portfolio contributed to flat revenue in the routed optical networking segment, with growth specifically attributed to the Cisco 8000 series offerings and the webscale provider market. By fiscal 2023, the Core routing portfolio continued to grow, contributing to an overall 18% increase in the Networking product category. This growth was driven by Catalyst 8000 routers, SD-WAN, and IoT routing offerings. Therefore, the Core Routing portfolio evolved from maintaining stability in revenue during fiscal 2022 to actively driving growth in fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, Cisco’s Core Routing portfolio revenue declined, driven by a 15% drop in overall Networking product revenue. However, within that category, revenue from the Core routing segment grew, supported by strong demand for the Cisco 8000 series and related webscale provider offerings. This growth helped offset broader declines in campus switching, data‑center switching, and Wi‑Fi‑6/Meraki wireless products.",

In 2024, the year-over-year growth rate for the Family of Apps revenue slowed to approximately 22%, based on the $133,006 million in 2023 and $162,355 million in 2024 disclosed in the 2024 10-K filing. This indicates a significant decline in the growth rate of Meta's core advertising business, suggesting a potential maturation or slowdown in expansion momentum.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of the Family of Apps revenue slowed from 16% in 2023 to 16% in 2024 (as reported in the 2024 filing), but this reflects the same 16% year-over-year increase rather than acceleration; the key shift is that advertising revenue growth (driving the FoA increase) relied on higher ad volume offsetting lower average ad prices, suggesting the core advertising business is maturing with volume-driven growth but facing pricing pressure.",

By 2023, this level of detail was no longer included; instead, the company only provided a brief definition of net charge-off rates without historical data or specific loan category breakdowns. This represents a significant reduction in transparency regarding credit quality and charge-off practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Capital One’s disclosures of net charge-off calculations shifted from relying on “average loans held for investment” (used in 2022) to explicitly stating that rates are calculated by dividing net charge-offs by “average loans held for investment for the period” (still used in 2023), but with clearer linkage to the allowance for credit losses and more granular portfolio-level breakdowns. The 2023 filing (Table 26) provides enhanced transparency by separating domestic and international card business metrics, including pandemic-related modifications, and explicitly connecting charge-off rates to allowance build metrics, reflecting a more detailed and policy-transparent approach to credit quality reporting.",

      "question": "How has ExxonMobil's treatment and strategic emphasis on the Specialty Products segment evolved between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of integration and value creation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil described the Specialty Products segment as part of its Product Solutions business, emphasizing its role in integration with Energy Products and Chemical Products to reduce risk from commodity price fluctuations. The segment was positioned within a long-term corporate planning framework supported by the Global Outlook and annual Corporate Plan. By 2024, the company elevated the strategic importance of Specialty Products by categorizing it under 'Advantaged Projects' and explicitly linking it to value creation through integration, higher-value product yields, and above-average returns. Additionally, in 2024, Specialty Products were tied to performance chemicals and lubricants, highlighting differentiation and customer value enhancement, a shift from the broader integrated business model focus of 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's Specialty Products segment has evolved from a standalone reporting category to an integrated component within the broader Product Solutions business, reflecting a strategic shift toward tighter integration and enhanced value creation. While the 2023 financials show a decline in earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items to $2,807 million (down from $3,259 million in 2022), the segment's earnings excluding Identified Items remained relatively stable at $3,065 million in 2024 (compared to $2,807 million in 2023), indicating improved resilience. This stability, coupled with the segment's inclusion under the unified Product Solutions structure, underscores ExxonMobil's focus on leveraging synergies across Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products to drive integrated value rather than treating Specialty Products as an isolated unit.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Combat Systems segment's estimated potential contract value had decreased compared to the prior year due to continued performance on significant multi-year contracts. By 2023, the estimated potential contract value had increased to $6.2 billion from $5.4 billion at year-end 2022, indicating a positive shift in growth potential. This increase was driven by several large contract awards, including a $1.7 billion award for munitions and ordnance with a maximum potential value of $3.2 billion, and a $1 billion award for 155mm projectile production with a potential value of $2.4 billion.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the estimated potential contract value for the Combat Systems segment increased from $5.4 billion at the end of 2022 to $6.2 billion at the end of 2023, reflecting a 14.8% growth. This upward trend indicates strengthening demand for combat vehicles, weapons systems, and munitions programs, particularly driven by significant contract awards such as the $1 billion Army contract for 155mm projectile production and the $920 million Stryker vehicle upgrades, underscoring the segment's expanding growth potential.",

      "original_answer": "UNH's medical costs payable increased from $29.056 billion at the end of 2022 to $32.395 billion at the end of 2023. In 2022, the company reported $210.842 billion in total medical costs, with $206.577 billion paid out during the year, leaving a smaller increase in payable liabilities. In contrast, 2023 saw $241.894 billion in total medical costs and $238.556 billion in payments, indicating a larger buildup of unpaid liabilities compared to the prior year. This suggests that UNH's liability for medical costs grew more significantly in 2023, reflecting either higher incurred costs or a strategic shift in payment timing.",
      "llm_answer": "UNH's medical costs payable increased from $29.1 billion at the end of 2022 to $32.4 billion at the end of 2023, reflecting a $3.3 billion rise driven by higher current‑year medical costs and only modest favorable development ($840 million in 2023 versus $410 million in 2022). This growth indicates that the company's liability for current medical obligations has expanded, while prior‑year reserves continued to develop favorably but at a diminishing rate, suggesting ongoing pressure on the medical‑cost reserve but still managed through favorable development trends.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the accrued balance for U.S. rebate accruals related to Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D was $2.3 billion, and the company used prior payment history as a key input in estimating the expected provision for rebates. In 2024, this accrued balance decreased slightly to $2.2 billion, and prior payment history continued to be used as a foundational element in the estimation process. The slight decrease in the accrued balance suggests a minor adjustment in expected rebate obligations, which may reflect either a refinement in the use of prior payment data or a shift in rebate claim trends. This indicates that while the methodology remained consistent, the underlying assumptions or data inputs based on prior payment history may have evolved slightly to reflect updated trends in rebate claims.",
      "llm_answer": "The use of prior payment history in estimating U.S. rebate accruals remained part of the Company’s methodology, but the 2024 discussion emphasizes that the accrual estimate now incorporates “historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history” to project the contractual rebate obligations for Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D. This represents a continuation and refinement of the prior‑payment‑history approach rather than a fundamental change.",

By fiscal year 2023, Microsoft Cloud revenue increased by 23% to $137.4 billion, driven by strong growth across key components such as Azure and other cloud services, which grew by 30%, and Dynamics 365, which increased by 24%. This indicates a significant expansion in the cloud segment, reflecting Microsoft's growing emphasis on cloud-based offerings.",

By 2024, Reality Labs generated $2,146 million in revenue, marking a significant shift from a loss to a positive financial contribution. This indicates a notable turnaround in the segment's performance, suggesting improved monetization or cost management within Reality Labs.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 10‑K (page 75‑79) and the 2024 10‑K (page 99‑103), Reality Labs revenue fell from **$2,159 million in 2022 to $1,896 million in 2023**, a **12 % decline** (see the “Reality Labs” row in the revenue table). The 2024 filing shows a modest rebound to **$2,146 million in 2024**, but this is still below the 2022 peak and represents only a **13 % increase** from 2023. The shift indicates that after a period of contraction, Reality Labs is attempting to recover, yet it remains a net loss‑generating segment and its revenue trajectory is still well below its prior growth level.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM disclosed that due to the complexities of its business and tax jurisdictions, significant judgments were required, and final tax-related assets and liabilities might differ from those currently reported. By 2024, JPM adopted new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2024, for Investments in Tax Credit Structures using the Proportional Amortization Method, applied under the modified retrospective method, signaling a specific procedural update in how tax consequences are accounted for. This indicates a shift from general acknowledgment of complexity and estimation risk to the implementation of a new structured accounting methodology for tax-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, JPMorgan Chase's approach to accounting for tax-related assets and liabilities, particularly regarding expected future tax consequences, evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024. The firm adopted updated accounting guidance for investments in tax credit structures using the proportional amortization method effective January 1, 2024 (referenced in Note 25), which impacted how it recognizes and measures deferred tax assets and liabilities related to these investments. Additionally, the firm refined its deferred tax asset valuation, including adjustments to the valuation allowance for non-U.S. deferred tax assets (notably NOL carryforwards) and the inclusion of estimated deferred tax assets from the First Republic acquisition in its 2024 calculations (Note 25, \"Deferred taxes\"). This evolution reflects a more detailed assessment of future tax consequences, particularly in relation to complex tax attributes and cross-border operations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, GD's Marine Systems segment contributed to revenue growth driven by U.S. Navy ship construction. By 2023, the segment's performance was negatively impacted by supply chain disruptions affecting the Virginia-class submarine schedule and cost overruns on the Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) guided-missile destroyer program. These challenges were partially offset by improved performance on the John Lewis-class (TAO-205) fleet replenishment oiler program in 2023. Additionally, GD highlighted increased risk in 2023 around variable consideration for long-term U.S. Navy contracts, particularly the Virginia-class submarine program, indicating a shift toward greater financial uncertainty compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, GD's Marine Systems segment revenue grew 12.5% to $12.46 billion, driven primarily by increased U.S. Navy ship construction—particularly on the Columbia‑class submarine, John Lewis‑class fleet‑replenishment oiler, and Arleigh Burke‑class destroyer programs—while commercial ship volume declined. Operating earnings rose modestly to $874 million (up 2.3%), but operating margin slipped to 8.3% as the segment shifted toward early‑stage submarine work with lower initial profit rates.

      "original_answer": "For the 10-year period ending December 31, 2023, the actual annualized total return was approximately 6.60% for U.S. plan assets and 4.90% for non-U.S. plan assets. In contrast, for the 10-year period ending December 31, 2024, the actual annualized total return increased to 7.20% for U.S. plan assets but decreased to 4.00% for non-U.S. plan assets. This indicates a positive performance trend for the U.S. plans, while the non-U.S. plans experienced a decline in performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The actual annualized total return for U.S. pension plan assets was approximately 7.20% for the 10-year period ending December 31, 2024, while non‑U.S. pension plan assets returned about 4.00% over the same period. This indicates that U.S. plans have outperformed their non‑U.S. counterparts in recent years, although both regions show relatively modest returns that are below their respective expected long‑term rates of 7.00% (U.S.) and 6.02% (non‑U.S.).",

By 2023, the company expanded the detail of cost categories to include stock-based compensation and facilities expenses under personnel-related costs. This evolution indicates a more nuanced breakdown of internal cost drivers tied to content production and talent management.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, amortization of content assets grew modestly (from $17.33 bn to $19.72 bn), but its share of total cost of revenues remained stable at roughly 58%. The 2023 disclosure emphasized content amortization as the primary driver of cost of revenues, while highlighting added categories such as streaming‑delivery costs, payment‑processing fees, and other operations expenses that together make up the remainder of cost of revenues.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a decrease of $428 million due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and expected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a strategic shift toward significantly reducing or eliminating postretirement medical costs over the medium term.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, Disney’s post‑retirement medical cost expectations declined sharply—from a $790 million liability to $76 million—driven by lower amortization of prior‑year losses and other favorable plan changes. This reduction signals that the company anticipates a continued downward trend in these expenses, projecting virtually negligible pension and post‑retirement medical costs in fiscal 2025.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Merck recorded $190 million in pretax costs related to the upcoming 2024 Restructuring Program, which included facility shut-down expenses as a key component. By 2024, the company disclosed that the cumulative pretax costs for this restructuring program were estimated at $4.0 billion, with facility shut-down costs continuing to represent a significant portion of the cash outlays. This indicates a substantial increase in restructuring activity and signals an escalation in the execution phase of the program, aligning with the company’s plan to optimize its global manufacturing networks for both Human and Animal Health. The shift from initial costs in 2023 to broader implementation in 2024 reveals a deliberate scaling of restructuring efforts.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck recorded $190 million of pretax facility‑shut‑down costs in 2023 as part of its 2024 Restructuring Program, and the company expects to incur an additional $4 billion of cumulative pretax costs over the next several years, with roughly 60 % of that amount being non‑cash accelerated depreciation and the remainder representing cash outlays for facility closures. This escalation shows that the 2024 restructuring initiative is expanding in scope—building on the earlier 2019 program, which has already generated about $4.1 billion of pretax costs—while the 2024 program adds new manufacturing‑network optimizations and animal‑health network upgrades that are slated for completion by the end of 2031.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment faced significant operating cash flow challenges due to lower deliveries and concessions paid to 737 MAX customers, with net cash used by operating activities reaching $3.4 billion in 2021. The company had $16.2 billion in cash and short-term investments and $58.1 billion in debt as of December 31, 2021, and anticipated continued negative operating cash flows until commercial deliveries ramped up. By 2024, the Commercial Airplanes segment reported a contractual backlog of $498,802 million, up slightly from $497,094 million in 2023, indicating a gradual recovery in order book stability. While liquidity improved as the company moved past the worst of the 737 MAX and pandemic-related disruptions, the segment was still not fully back to pre-crisis financial health, though the trend suggests improvement.",
      "llm_answer": "Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment has faced significant operating cash flow challenges since 2022, with negative operating cash flows continuing through 2024 due to lower commercial airplane deliveries, pandemic impacts, and the 737 MAX grounding. The company's backlog value has declined from $520.2 billion in 2022 to $521.3 billion in 2024 (with contractual backlog at $498.8 billion), though this reflects a slight increase in 2024 driven by defense and global services offsets to commercial backlog reductions. The segment's loss from operations widened to $7,969 million in 2024 from $1,635 million in 2023, primarily due to reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, lower deliveries, and production disruptions.",

In 2023, the company reiterated this approach but added more emphasis on the significance of these unknown obligations, explicitly stating that 'the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.'

By 2023, the 10-K filing included specific financial disclosures showing that Disney reported $128 million in borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks for fiscal year 2025 and $1,164 million in borrowings thereafter.

This consolidation is explicitly detailed in the \"Principles of Consolidation\" section (page 81 of DIS_10k_2022.pdf) and reinforced by disclosures on Asia Theme Parks borrowings (page 99 of DIS_10k_2023.pdf), which show $1.292 billion in borrowings related to these parks as of September 28, 2024, with interest rates tied to regional financing arrangements.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPM described that borrowers in the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel were frequently referred to a mortgage banker by a banker in a Chase branch, real estate brokers, home builders, or other third parties. In 2024, the description remained largely the same but omitted 'home builders' as an explicitly named referral source, instead only mentioning 'real estate brokers' and 'other third parties.' The removal of 'home builders' could imply a strategic shift away from partnerships with home construction firms, potentially signaling a reduced emphasis on new home purchase financing or a refocusing of referral partnerships within the retail mortgage channel.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, JPMorgan Chase’s 10-K filing shows a shift in how it describes borrower referral sources for the Retail Mortgage Origination Channel. In the 2023 filing (page 315), the firm explicitly lists \"home builders\" as a key referral source for retail mortgage originations, alongside real estate brokers, banks, and other third parties. However, in the 2024 filing (page 330), this reference to \"home builders\" is omitted from the description of referral sources, with the firm now only mentioning \"real estate brokers, banks, and other third parties\" without specifying home builders. \n\nThis omission likely signals a strategic shift away from relying on home builders as a primary referral channel, potentially due to declining builder-driven demand, increased focus on direct consumer channels (e.g., digital or branch-based origination), or a broader industry trend toward reducing dependence on builder networks amid market volatility. The change may reflect a pivot toward more controlled, direct-to-consumer acquisition strategies to mitigate risk or align with evolving market conditions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group reported medical costs payable of $24,483 million at the end of the period. In 2023, the company disclosed how medical costs payable were sensitive to changes in completion factors, with a 0.75% change in these factors leading to an $880 million increase in medical costs payable. This indicates a shift from a static reporting of medical costs payable in 2022 to a more dynamic and sensitivity-based disclosure in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealth Group's medical costs payable increased to $24,483 million at the end of 2023, up from $21,872 million at the end of 2022. The change reflects higher reported medical costs and payments, with the balance being sensitive to completion‑factor adjustments—e.g., a 0.25 % decrease in completion factors would raise medical costs payable by about $292 million, while a 0.25 % increase would lower it by roughly $290 million.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Target reported experiencing higher inventory shrink as a percentage of sales compared to historical levels, with significantly elevated shrink rates at certain stores. The company noted that this trend was industry-wide and had an adverse impact on its results of operations, including impairment of long-lived assets. In 2024, inventory shrink is explicitly listed as a component of the cost of sales, indicating it is now formally recognized and accounted for as a direct cost of merchandise operations. This shift reflects a more structured financial acknowledgment of inventory shrink within the company's expense framework.",
      "llm_answer": "Target's inventory shrink has worsened in 2023 compared to 2022, with management explicitly stating that \"increased shrink has had, and if current trends persist will continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations.\" This deterioration occurred despite overall inventory reductions achieved through supply chain improvements and strategies implemented in 2022 to align inventory with declining sales trends. The company attributes this industry-wide trend to persistent challenges across its discretionary categories (Apparel & Accessories, Hardlines, Home Furnishings & Décor), which have experienced sales declines since 2022. While operating cash flow improved significantly in 2023 ($8.6 billion vs. $4.0 billion in 2022), the rising shrink rate—measured as a percentage of sales and exceeding historical levels—represents a growing financial risk that could impair long-lived assets through future impairment charges.",

The differentiation was tied to the Adobe Experience Platform's integration capabilities and the segment's four strategic growth pillars: data insights, content and commerce, customer journeys, and marketing planning and workflow. The go-to-market strategy focused on a direct sales force and an ecosystem of partners, including marketing agencies and systems integrators.\n\nBy fiscal 2024, Adobe expanded its differentiation by emphasizing natively embedded AI services and end-to-end content supply chain solutions within the Adobe Experience Cloud. These AI services included attribution, automated insights, customer journey management, and one-click personalization, all working with Adobe Experience Platform. The go-to-market strategy also evolved, with a stronger emphasis on C-suite partnerships, transformational accounts, and a scaled approach to customer acquisition and value realization. Additionally, Adobe highlighted strategic investments in expanding its ecosystem of partners and routes to market, aiming to drive continued revenue growth in the Digital Experience segment for fiscal 2025 and beyond.",

By 2024, the operating loss for the same segment had increased to $5.413 billion. This indicates a significant worsening in the financial performance of the BDS segment over this two-year period.

The company emphasized internal stewardship to support management oversight over time. By 2024, Structural Cost Savings were reframed as an earnings driver, with a focus on after-tax earnings effects and inclusion of cash operating expenses related to divestments previously captured in volume/mix drivers. This shift indicates a broader integration of cost savings into financial reporting and performance analysis.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil's approach to Structural Cost Savings has evolved in its definition and internal management between 2023 and 2024. In the 2023 filing, structural cost savings were defined as decreases in cash operating expenses (excluding energy and production taxes) driven by operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, and other sustainable measures relative to 2019 levels, with cumulative savings estimated at $9.7 billion. By 2024, the definition was updated to reflect a revised cumulative savings estimate of $12.1 billion, incorporating additional savings from recent initiatives and revisions to prior estimates, while emphasizing that the savings are stewarded internally to ensure sustainability compared to 2019 levels. The calculation methodology also expanded to include more detailed components of operating costs and adjustments for market factors like inflation and foreign exchange.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Payment Network contributed 11% to Mastercard's net revenue growth, reflecting its strong operational performance and a key role in driving revenue. By 2024, the Payment Network was fully integrated into the newly defined 'Payment Solutions' segment, which Mastercard now treats as its sole reportable operating segment. This shift indicates a strategic move toward unifying its payment network with value-added services under a single framework, emphasizing holistic payment solutions rather than distinguishing between core network operations and supplementary services. The consolidation of reporting and the repositioning of the Payment Network within a broader segment reflect a significant transformation in how Mastercard organizes and evaluates its core business performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2023 and 2024 SEC 10-K filing excerpts, Mastercard's Payment Network contribution to net revenue growth has evolved through two key dimensions: First, payment network revenue grew 10% year-over-year in 2023 (currency-neutral), driven by increased domestic and cross-border transaction volumes and switched transactions, while the broader Payment Solutions segment (which includes the Payment Network) grew 13% in total net revenue, with value-added services growing faster at 18%. Second, the Payment Network's strategic positioning has shifted toward deeper integration within the Payment Solutions segment, as evidenced by its 10% contribution to the segment's overall 13% net revenue growth in 2023, and its role as a foundational component supporting the segment's higher-margin value-added services that drove the majority of the segment's growth. This reflects a strategic emphasis on leveraging the Payment Network as a platform for expanding higher-value services rather than relying solely on transaction-based assessments.",

In 2024, the definition of Operating Overhead Expense remained consistent, including wage and benefit-related costs, but the company also highlighted increased prepayments for advertising, rising from $755 million in 2023 to $814 million in 2024. This indicates a strategic increase in investment in demand creation activities, which in turn affects overhead costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Nike's Operating Overhead Expense increased from $17,568 million in 2023 to $18,766 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, JPMorgan disclosed that the Core Deposit Intangible from the First Republic acquisition was valued at $1.3 billion and was being amortized over a projected period of approximately 7 years. The valuation methodology was described, including the use of after-tax cost savings and assumptions about market participant behavior. In 2024, the disclosure remained consistent in terms of the $1.3 billion valuation and the 7-year amortization period, but the language was slightly refined, emphasizing that the intangibles 'are amortized' rather than 'will be amortized,' indicating that the amortization process had commenced. Additionally, the 2024 filing made a new reference to 'disputed amounts with the FDIC as of April 30, 2024,' which was not present in the 2023 filing, suggesting an ongoing financial or legal development affecting the acquisition-related assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, JPMorgan Chase's treatment of Core Deposit Intangibles related to the First Republic acquisition evolved significantly between the 2023 and 2024 10-K filings. In the 2023 filing (Note 34), the initial estimated bargain purchase gain was $2.7 billion, with adjustments totaling $63 million made during 2023 to increase it to $2.8 billion. By the 2024 filing, the final bargain purchase gain had been further adjusted to $2.9 billion, reflecting additional adjustments of $103 million made during the measurement period ending April 30, 2024, as explicitly stated in the 2024 Note 34: \"The final bargain purchase gain of $2.9 billion reflects adjustments of $103 million and $63 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\" This demonstrates a continued refinement of the fair value estimates and the resulting intangible valuation over the measurement period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, a 2% increase in market interest rates resulted in $401 million in additional investment income and a $8,700 million decrease in the fair value of financial liabilities. In 2023, the same 2% increase led to a higher investment income of $629 million, while the fair value of financial liabilities decreased by $7,365 million. This indicates that UnitedHealth Group's exposure to interest rate changes increased in magnitude over the year, particularly on the investment income side, while the sensitivity of liabilities slightly decreased.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the sensitivity analysis for a 1% change in market interest rates shows a $250 million increase in investment income and a $67 million increase in interest expense in 2022, while in 2023 the corresponding impacts are $344 million for investment income and $196 million for interest expense. Thus, the effect of a 2% interest‑rate increase on investment income grew from $499 million in 2022 to $688 million in 2023, and the effect on interest expense rose from $133 million to $393 million over the same period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, currency exchange rates positively impacted total sales growth by 1.0%, whereas in 2024, the impact decreased to 0.5%. This indicates a reduced positive contribution from exchange rate movements, suggesting a decline in the company's exposure or a shift in the direction of foreign exchange fluctuations affecting sales during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a 4.5% drag in 2022 to a 1.0% drag in 2023, indicating reduced exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations as the U.S. dollar's strength continued to affect reported sales but to a lesser extent than the prior year.

In 2024, these figures increased to $3.9 billion in short-term investments and $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

By 2024, the segment's backlog revenue stood at $64,023 million for the year, compared to $59,012 million in 2023. While the facilities footprint remained relatively stable, the significant increase in backlog revenue—approximately 8.5% from 2023 to 2024—suggests a growing demand for the segment's offerings, indicating a positive growth trajectory despite no major changes in physical capacity.",

This incremental backlog increase—driven primarily by growth in BDS and BGS contracts—signals a steady, albeit modest, expansion of the segment’s pipeline, suggesting a cautious but ongoing growth trajectory as the company aligns its footprint with staffing reductions and strategic investment priorities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil acquired Denbury Inc. by issuing 46 million shares with a fair value of $4.8 billion. The year also saw the sale of Esso Thailand and upstream asset divestitures in the U.S. In 2024, the company significantly scaled up its acquisition activity by acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources through the issuance of 545 million shares valued at $63 billion, along with $5 billion in assumed debt. Additionally, the scope of asset sales expanded geographically in 2024 to include upstream assets in Argentina and Nigeria, compared to only the U.S. in 2023. This reflects a major increase in both the size and geographic diversity of ExxonMobil's transactional activity.",
      "llm_answer": "The scale of ExxonMobil's acquisitions increased significantly between 2023 and 2024, with the 2024 acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources involving $63 billion of stock and $5 billion of assumed debt, compared with the 2023 Denbury Inc. purchase that used only $4.8 billion of stock. This larger transaction contributed to a higher number of shares issued (545 million vs. 46 million) and reflected a broader geographic and asset diversification, extending the company’s upstream portfolio into the Permian Basin and other U.S. regions. In contrast, the divestitures reported in 2023 involved smaller, more regionally limited asset sales (e.g., Esso Thailand and certain U.S. upstream assets), whereas the 2024 cash‑flow notes indicate broader upstream disposals across the United States, Argentina, and Nigeria, suggesting a more geographically diverse portfolio of divested assets.",

In 2023, while the revenue increased due to the mix of products shipped, the operating profit decreased primarily due to higher manufacturing costs, despite the revenue growth. This indicates a shift in profitability dynamics even as revenue expanded.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Embedded Processing revenue increased 3% to $3.368 billion, while its operating profit fell 20% to $1.008 billion (down from $1.253 billion in 2022), reducing its operating‑profit margin from 38.4% to 29.9%. The profit decline was driven primarily by higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and lower factory loadings, partially offset by a more favorable product mix.",

This treatment remained consistent in fiscal 2024, where the company continued to recognize unrealized credit-related losses in the same manner. However, in 2024, Adobe provided additional context around financial activities, such as the $1 billion non-tax-deductible termination fee related to the Figma acquisition, which may have influenced overall financial statement presentation and emphasis, even though the accounting treatment for credit-related losses remained unchanged.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe did not record any allowance for credit‑related losses on its short‑term investment securities in either fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2024, and it likewise did not recognize any impairment losses on contract‑acquisition costs during those periods. The company’s disclosures indicate that unrealized credit‑related losses were not material enough to trigger an allowance, and any related losses would be recorded in other income (expense) with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet.",

By 2023, the company specifically disclosed a liability of $39 million principally related to travel transaction taxes.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that it had approximately $7.4 billion of total content liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, with significant additional streaming content commitments that did not meet the criteria for liability recognition. These obligations were described as long-term and fixed-cost in nature, limiting Netflix’s flexibility in reacting to changes in business conditions and potentially requiring access to capital markets at unfavorable times. By 2023, Netflix expanded its description of content obligations to include non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements, as well as production-related obligations. While specific dollar figures for total content liabilities were not explicitly stated in 2023, the company emphasized that obligations for unknown future titles under certain licensing agreements were expected to be significant, indicating a growing complexity and financial exposure in its content commitments. This evolution reflects both an increase in the scale and inflexibility of content obligations, heightening liquidity risk.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Netflix’s content obligations remained a major fixed‑cost driver, with total streaming‑content commitments essentially flat at about $21.7 billion, but the composition shifted toward larger non‑current liabilities and a growing portion of obligations that were not yet recorded on the balance sheet.  The company continued to face liquidity pressure because these multi‑year, largely fixed‑cost commitments require upfront cash outlays that cannot be adjusted quickly if membership growth slows, and the long‑term nature of the commitments limits operational flexibility and can strain cash flow if revenue growth does not meet expectations.  Consequently, Netflix’s ability to service its debt and other obligations increasingly depends on sustained subscriber and revenue growth to avoid having to raise capital under potentially unfavorable market conditions.",

By fiscal 2024, this figure increased significantly to $33,427 million under the Nike Brand, with additional footwear revenue of $1,800 million attributed to CONVERSE. The 2024 report provides a regional breakdown not explicitly detailed in 2023, showing $14,537 million in North America, $8,473 million in Europe, Middle East & Africa, $5,552 million in Greater China, and $4,865 million in Asia Pacific & Latin America. This indicates a more granular reporting structure in 2024, highlighting Nike's geographic revenue distribution, which was not itemized in the prior year's consolidated footwear revenue.",
      "llm_answer": "**Answer**\n\n- **Footwear revenue** fell 2% in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023 (from $14,897 M to $14,537 M), driven by lower sales in men’s, women’s and kids’ categories, only partially offset by growth in the Jordan brand.  \n- **Regional shift**: The share of revenue coming from **Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA)** stayed essentially flat (up 1% nominally, 0% in constant currency), while **Greater China** grew 4% nominally (8% in constant currency) and **Asia‑Pacific & Latin America (APLA)** rose 5% nominally (5% in constant currency).  \n\nThus, while overall footwear sales slipped slightly, the later reporting period saw a modest re‑allocation of footwear revenue toward Greater China and APLA, with EMEA remaining stable.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT allocated between $280 million and $300 million for Start-up capital projects. In 2023, this allocation dropped significantly to $128.1 million. This indicates a strategic shift where AMT reduced its investment in new start-up projects, possibly reallocating resources to other priorities such as ground lease purchases or redevelopment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2022 and 2023 10-K excerpts, AMT's allocation for start-up capital projects increased from **$211.2 million in 2021** (reported under \"Capital expenditures\" for start-up projects in 2021) to **$280–$300 million in 2022** (as stated in the 2022 capital expenditure guidance: \"Start-up capital projects: $280 to $300\"). This represents a **~30–40% increase** in dedicated start-up capital spending year-over-year.  \n\nThis shift indicates a strategic pivot toward **accelerated investment in new infrastructure initiatives**, particularly in data center assets and site expansion (e.g., the $395 million allocated to data center spend in 2023 and the focus on \"new site and data center facility construction\" in capital planning). The company explicitly ties this capital allocation to its long-term growth objectives, emphasizing deployment toward \"investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria\" while maintaining financial discipline. The increase aligns with expanded acquisitions (e.g., Telxius, CoreSite) and international expansion efforts, signaling a deliberate scaling of new high-potential projects to drive future revenue growth and market share.  \n\n*(Note: The 2022 10-K explicitly references start-up capital projects as part of its 2022 capital expenditure guidance, while the 2023 10-K shows a similar but slightly higher range ($65–$85 million for 2024 start-up projects, implying continued growth in this category.)*",

By 2024, this amount was no longer present as a separate line item, and Accumulated Comprehensive Income had declined from $(1,748) million in 2023 to $(3,218) million in 2024.

In fiscal year 2024, Oracle maintained the same classification of unbilled receivables within accounts receivable but updated the presentation slightly, referring to 'non-operating expenses, net' instead of 'non-operating expenses or income, net' when discussing interest revenue from financing arrangements. This indicates a subtle evolution in financial statement presentation without a substantive change in the treatment of unbilled receivables.",
      "llm_answer": "Oracle's treatment of unbilled receivables has remained consistent between fiscal 2022 and 2024: revenue recognized before invoicing is recorded as an unbilled receivable, which is included within accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet. This practice aligns with ASC 606 requirements, where unbilled receivables arise when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing, particularly for services performed or contracts with financing components. The timing of invoicing varies by revenue type—license support and hardware support contracts are typically invoiced annually in advance, while cloud services and SaaS contracts may be invoiced monthly or quarterly in advance—yet the classification of unbilled amounts within accounts receivable remains unchanged.",

By 2024, the growth rate of average paying memberships had slowed to 15% year-over-year (from 240,889 in 2023 to 277,730 in 2024), yet streaming revenues still grew by 16% year-over-year. This indicates that despite a lower growth rate in memberships compared to earlier years, Netflix was able to maintain strong revenue growth, likely due to more stable monetization per membership and a larger base of paying members.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s average paying memberships grew from 152,984 (2019) to 210,784 (2021) and then to 277,730 (2024), reflecting consistent expansion. However, the growth rate of paid net membership additions slowed significantly—from 27,831 in 2019 to 36,573 in 2020 (32% growth) but then dropped to 8,903 in 2022 and 29,529 in 2023 (only 16% growth in 2023 vs. 2022), indicating a decelerating acquisition pace. This growth in average paying memberships, combined with a 7% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership (driven by price hikes and favorable foreign exchange), directly fueled a 19% surge in streaming revenue from 2020 to 2021 and a 16% increase from 2023 to 2024, contributing to higher operating margins (18% to 21% to 27%).",

Additionally, PayPal mentioned a matured net investment hedge from 2020, with its gains and losses remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until the foreign subsidiary was sold or liquidated. By 2023, PayPal expanded its disclosure to clarify that foreign currency exchange gains and losses due to remeasurement of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities were included in other, net, along with forward points on derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges and fair value changes on non-hedging derivative contracts. The 2023 filing also introduced more structured categorization under 'Other income (expense), net,' which included a more detailed breakdown of components such as interest income, interest expense, and strategic investment gains/losses alongside foreign exchange impacts. This evolution indicates a more comprehensive and structured approach to disclosing foreign exchange exposures and their financial effects.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, PayPal's treatment of foreign currency exchange gains and losses remained consistent in its core accounting approach, but the scale and specific impacts evolved. In 2022, the company reported a favorable net impact of $69 million to operating income from foreign currency movements (as detailed in the 2022 10-K's \"Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\" table), driven by $250 million in favorable net revenue impacts offset by $181 million in unfavorable operating expense impacts. By 2023, this dynamic shifted significantly: the company reported a $250 million favorable impact to net revenues (exclusive of hedging) and a $181 million unfavorable impact to operating expenses in 2021 (which was the prior year's data), but the 2023 filing (PYPL_10k_2023.pdf) explicitly states that gains and losses on foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in \"transaction revenues\" in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings. Crucially, the 2023 filing confirms that the foreign currency exchange contract used for net investment hedging matured in 2020, meaning no such hedges were active in 2023, and all foreign currency gains/losses on assets/liabilities are now recorded directly in \"other income (expense), net\" without offsetting hedging impacts in operating income. Thus, while the accounting methodology for hedging and recognition remained unchanged, the 2023 results reflected a more direct and less offsetting impact on net income compared to 2022, with no remaining net investment hedge to defer gains/losses into AOCI.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed that approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services were known and settled within 90 days, with substantially all settled within twelve months. By 2023, the company provided a more quantified sensitivity analysis, stating that a hypothetical 1% difference between its December 31, 2023, estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable would have increased or decreased 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This indicates a more explicit quantification of risk exposure in 2023 compared to the more qualitative disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, UnitedHealth Group's sensitivity analysis for medical costs payable shows that a 0.75% decrease in completion factors would increase medical costs payable by $880 million, while a 0.75% increase would decrease it by $867 million. This indicates that the company's risk exposure to unpaid claims is material and sensitive to changes in actuarial assumptions, particularly regarding claim processing timelines and completion rates. The company explicitly states that actual claim payments may differ from estimates, and a hypothetical 1% difference in estimates would impact 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin's Space segment generated $11.8 billion in net sales and focused on programs for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, NASA, and other defense and commercial customers, emphasizing missile defense systems, satellite systems, and space exploration. By 2024, the segment strategically expanded through the acquisition of Terran Orbital for $314 million, enhancing its satellite design, production, and on-orbit support capabilities. This acquisition marked a clear shift toward strengthening space-based technologies and services to meet evolving customer demands, particularly in satellite operations and mission support.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Lockheed Martin's Space segment expanded its strategic focus on advanced missile defense and hypersonic systems while maintaining its core satellite and national security satellite programs. The segment continued to develop and produce critical systems like the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, SBIRS/Next Gen OPIR infrared warning satellites, and GPS III modernization, alongside new hypersonic strike weapons programs for the Army and Navy. This evolution reflects a sustained emphasis on strategic deterrence, space-based missile defense, and next-generation capabilities to support national security priorities, with the Space segment contributing 18% of total consolidated net sales in 2021 and maintaining strong government demand despite the termination of the UK AWE program in 2021.",

This represents a $0.5 billion or approximately 26% increase in restricted funds. The increase suggests a more conservative liquidity strategy in 2024, with a greater portion of cash being set aside for specific purposes, potentially to mitigate credit and settlement exposures or to meet regulatory or contractual obligations.",

A 1% difference between the December 31, 2023 estimates of medical costs payable and actual amounts would have impacted net earnings by approximately $245 million. The sensitivity analysis shows that adjustments to completion factors (e.g., a 0.75% decrease could increase medical costs payable by $880 million) and medical cost trend factors (e.g., a 3% increase could raise medical costs payable by $1,128 million) directly affect the liability estimate, which in turn influences earnings through the recognition of favorable or unfavorable development in subsequent periods.",

By 2024, this metric had decreased further to (5.2)%, primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accruals.

      "original_answer": "Lockheed Martin's pension plan funding approach evolved significantly from 2021 to 2024. In 2021, the company made no contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans, while in 2024, it contributed $990 million. The ERISA-funded status also improved, with the company achieving at least 80% funded status across all qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024, compared to a funded status of approximately 92% in 2021 after a $1.0 billion contribution in 2020. This indicates a shift from a period of minimal contributions and moderate funded status to a more active funding strategy aligned with ERISA requirements.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin’s pension funding approach shifted markedly between 2021 and 2024: in 2021 it executed a large pension‑risk‑transfer transaction that moved $4.9 billion of defined‑benefit obligations to an insurer and generated a $1.7 billion non‑cash settlement charge, while thereafter it continued to use risk‑transfer trades to reduce plan size and PBGC premiums.  By 2024 the company was making cash contributions of $990 million to its qualified pension plans (versus none in 2023) and projecting CAS pension‑cost recoveries of about $1.7 billion, whereas in 2021 it had made no contributions but recovered $2.1 billion of CAS pension costs.  The funded status under ERISA improved to roughly 92 % in 2021 and remained at or above the 80 % target through 2024, reflecting higher discount rates (5.625 % in 2024 vs. 2.875 % in 2021) and lower long‑term return assumptions, which together reduced the GAAP benefit obligations by about $1.8 billion in 2024.  These changes meant that contributions were now being recovered through U.S. government contract pricing under CAS, creating prepayment credits that grew to roughly $2.2 billion by end‑2024, whereas earlier years relied on prior prepayment balances and risk‑transfer gains.  Overall, the evolution reflects a transition from large one‑time risk‑transfer settlements and zero cash contributions in 2021 to ongoing cash funding and recovery mechanisms, with the funded status and expense volatility increasingly driven by actuarial assumptions and ERISA‑based funding levels.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities, as noted in the consolidated statements of equity under noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the company further disclosed that this deconsolidation was a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and was treated as an asset group impairment event under long-lived assets testing, indicating a shift from a focus on equity treatment to a broader asset impairment and financial impact analysis.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, Linde's treatment and disclosure of its Russian gas and engineering business evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024, particularly regarding financial consolidation and asset impairment considerations. In 2022, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022, as explicitly noted in Note 3 (referenced in the Noncontrolling Interests section of Note 14), which removed these entities from its consolidated financial statements. This deconsolidation was a key step in discontinuing financial reporting for the business. By 2024, the company no longer included these entities in its consolidated results, and the focus shifted to other strategic priorities, though the document does not indicate any new impairments or specific disclosures related to these assets in 2023–2024 beyond the initial deconsolidation. The financial statements now reflect only the remaining operations, with no material adjustments to goodwill or long-lived assets tied to the Russian business in the provided disclosures.",

      "original_answer": "The fixed employer contribution under the enhanced defined contribution plan remained unchanged at 2% of the employee's annual eligible earnings in both 2022 and 2023. However, the aggregate U.S. defined contribution plan expenses increased from $70 million in 2022 to $75 million in 2023, indicating a rise in overall employer contributions or participation, despite the fixed contribution rate remaining stable.",
      "llm_answer": "The fixed employer contribution under TI’s enhanced defined contribution plan remains at 2 % of eligible earnings for employees who elected to continue accruing benefits in the qualified defined‑benefit pension plan, while employees who opted out receive only the matching contribution (up to 4 %). This fixed 2 % contribution is a component of the company’s overall U.S. defined‑contribution expense, which increased from $63 million in 2021 to $75 million in 2023. Consequently, the rise in the fixed employer contribution helped drive the aggregate U.S. defined‑contribution plan expenses upward between 2022 and 2023.",

In 2024, revenue increased to $2,909 million, reflecting a 4.5% total change, with exchange rates again having a negative impact of 6.0%. This indicates consistent performance and exchange rate pressure across both years.",
      "llm_answer": "The International Adult Nutritionals segment showed revenue growth of 6.2 % in 2023 versus 2022, driven by a 11.4 % price increase and a modest 0.2 % volume gain, while exchange‑rate headwinds reduced the segment’s sales by 4.2 % (3.5 % on total international sales).

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Hill's Pet Nutrition contributed 23% to the company's total program charges, but by 2024, this contribution decreased to 6%. This indicates a significant reduction in the segment's relative financial importance to the overall business, suggesting a potential strategic repositioning or performance challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "Hill's Pet Nutrition's contribution to the company's program charges declined from 2023 to 2024, with operating profit decreasing 5% to $806 million (18.8% of net sales) in 2023 versus $850 million (22.9% of net sales) in 2022, and further deterioration reflected in the 2024 operating profit of ($784) million versus ($704) million in 2023. This decline indicates Hill's Pet Nutrition's strategic role has diminished within the organization, as its profitability and contribution to overall program charges have weakened despite revenue growth, likely due to cost pressures from raw materials, packaging, and mix shifts from acquisitions.",

In contrast, in 2024, the company started with $13.1 billion in November and only decreased slightly to $12.0 billion by the end of January. This indicates a more stable and potentially more actively managed repurchase strategy in 2024 compared to the more rapid depletion seen in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, Walmart's approved share repurchase authorization decreased from approximately $12.4 billion remaining as of January 31 2022 (fiscal 2022) to $10.6 billion remaining as of January 31 2024 (fiscal 2024).

This indicates a shift in the company's pricing or value proposition strategy over the two-year period, potentially reflecting promotional pricing, changes in regional mix, or adjustments in service tiers.",

This stability, coupled with a 15% compound annual growth in average paying memberships (from 222,924 in 2022 to 277,730 in 2024), indicates that the company prioritized expanding its member base over aggressive price hikes. The modest ARM growth (1% from 2022–2024) and the emphasis on constant currency metrics (which exclude foreign exchange impacts) suggest a strategy focused on value-driven growth rather than frequent price increases, likely to retain subscribers amid competitive streaming markets.",

Financially, AT&T maintained its focus on debt management and dividends, with no material debt issuances tied to WarnerMedia post-separation, and its 2022 financing strategy emphasized operational cash flow, debt reduction, and asset sales rather than WarnerMedia-related commitments.",

      "question": "How did Texas Instruments' approach to target allocation ranges for defined benefit plans evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of rebalancing and asset class assumptions?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Texas Instruments stated that it rebalanced the plans' investments when they were outside the target allocation ranges. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the fact that assumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets were based on future expectations for returns for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. Additionally, in 2023, the company explicitly mentioned adjusting results for the payment of reasonable expenses of the plan from plan assets and that assumptions for non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflected different economic environments. This indicates a more detailed and forward-looking approach to asset allocation in 2023 compared to the more general rebalancing policy described in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Texas Instruments adjusted its target allocation ranges for defined benefit plans, increasing the fixed income and cash equivalent range from 65%-80% to 65%-80% (U.S.) and 60%-100% to 60%-100% (non-U.S.), while reducing equity ranges from 20%-35% to 20%-35% (U.S.) and 0%-40% to 0%-40% (non-U.S.). The company rebalanced plan assets when allocations fell outside these ranges, maintaining a higher fixed income allocation (65% in 2023 vs. 70% in 2022 for U.S. plans) and lower equity exposure (35% vs. 30% for U.S. plans). Asset class assumptions also shifted, with the long-term rate of return on plan assets rising to 5.70% (U.S.) and 3.50% (non-U.S.) in 2023, reflecting updated return expectations and target allocation rebalancing.",

In 2024, the growth rate slowed to 6%, with the volume reaching $2,990 billion from $2,826 billion the previous year.

Overall nominal payments‑volume grew 6% year‑over‑year in 2024 (up from 6% in 2023), while consumer‑debit volume rose 6% in 2024 versus 6% in 2023, reflecting continued expansion in Visa’s core U.S. debit segment and supporting the company’s overall revenue gains.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement disclosed serving 4.4 million seniors through various Medicare Supplement products in association with AARP. By 2023, the company reported 4,355,000 members in Medicare Supplement (Standardized) plans, indicating a slight decrease of 45,000 members from the prior year. This small decline suggests relative stability in the company's Medicare Supplement market share, despite broader growth in other senior-focused segments like Medicare Advantage. The change reflects a minor contraction in this specific product line, even as the company maintained its overall presence in senior insurance offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "UnitedHealthcare's Medicare Supplement enrollment remained stable at 4.4 million seniors in 2023, essentially unchanged from the 4.355 million reported in 2022 (a decline of only 20 members). This flat growth reflects a mature, steady market position rather than expansion, underscoring UnitedHealthcare's focus on maintaining its established share in the senior insurance segment rather than aggressively adding new Medicare Supplement members.",

By 2023, the composition shifted to 47%, 18%, 6%, and 6% respectively for the same categories, with oil and gas production assets increasing slightly to 16%. This indicates a decrease in the relative share of wind facilities and a corresponding increase in solar and oil and gas assets.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, NEER’s depreciable electric plant and other property shifted markedly toward renewable generation assets: wind‑related capital expenditures fell from $2,630 million in 2022 to $240 million in 2023, while solar‑related capital expenditures dropped from $3,445 million to $1,010 million, and battery storage investments declined from $270 million to $120 million.  Conversely, NEER continued to hold a substantial base of oil‑and‑gas production assets, which represented roughly 16 % of its depreciable plant at both 2023 and 2022, indicating that the composition remained weighted toward conventional fossil‑fuel generation rather than a rapid transition to wind or solar.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA noted that it had begun placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance—up from its historical lead time of approximately six months—to secure supply amid industry shortages. These actions were associated with increased product costs and the risk of significant excess inventory or charges if demand declined or was met by competitors. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased its supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. However, the company also noted that lead times for certain components were shortening, which impacted its overall purchase commitments. This reflects a shift from a purely defensive posture in 2022 (longer lead times, higher risk of overcommitment) to a more dynamic and diversified sourcing strategy in 2023, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, NVIDIA’s approach to long-term supply commitments evolved significantly to address extended lead times and heightened supply constraints. The company shifted from approximately six-month lead times to placing orders at least twelve months in advance, particularly for critical products like Hopper architecture GPUs, and increased prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to secure supply. This strategy, however, introduced greater financial risk exposure, as evidenced by inventory provisions, potential excess inventory charges, and the need to pay premiums or deposits to secure capacity, all while acknowledging uncertainty about the duration of supply shortages and the accuracy of demand forecasts.",

      "question": "How did Netflix's average paying memberships and average monthly revenue per paying membership evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what was the impact on streaming revenue growth?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix reported average paying memberships of 73,904 thousand and an average monthly revenue per paying membership of $10.99, contributing to a streaming revenue of $9,745,015 thousand. By 2024, average paying memberships had increased to 94,200 thousand, a growth of 16%, while the average monthly revenue per paying membership slightly declined to $10.96. Despite the minor decrease in per-member revenue, streaming revenues grew significantly to $12,387,035 thousand in 2024, representing a 17% increase compared to 2023. This indicates that the growth in paying memberships was the primary driver of revenue expansion, offsetting the small drop in average monthly revenue per member.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's average paying memberships grew from 210,784 (2021) to 277,730 (2024), reflecting a 31% increase, while average monthly revenue per paying membership remained relatively stable at $11.67 (2021) to $11.70 (2024), with only a 1% rise. Streaming revenue grew significantly, increasing from $29.5B (2021) to $39.0B (2024), driven by both membership growth and price increases, though this growth was partially offset by foreign exchange headwinds. Consequently, streaming revenue growth contributed to a 50% increase in operating income (from $6.95B in 2023 to $10.42B in 2024) and expanded operating margin to 27%.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Johnson & Johnson's MedTech segment was undergoing a restructuring program that involved exiting certain markets and product lines, particularly in Orthopaedics, with a pre-tax expense of $319 million and an estimated total cost of $700 million to $800 million. This reflected a strategy of streamlining operations and reducing exposure to underperforming areas. In contrast, by 2024, the company shifted toward expansion in the MedTech space through acquisitions, including Shockwave Medical Inc., a leader in intravascular lithotripsy technology, indicating a strategic pivot from cost-cutting to growth through innovation. The shift demonstrates a transformation in the company's approach to the MedTech segment, moving from contraction to investment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NEER's depreciable electric plant and other property were composed of 51% wind, 14% solar, and 7% rate-regulated transmission facilities. By 2023, the composition shifted to 47% wind, 18% solar, and 6% rate-regulated transmission. This indicates a decrease in the proportion of wind and rate-regulated transmission facilities, while solar facilities increased. These changes reflect a strategic shift toward solar energy and away from wind and transmission assets within NEER's portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, NEER's depreciable electric plant and other property saw a significant shift in composition toward renewable generation assets, particularly wind and solar. The data shows wind-related additions increased to $3,777 million in 2021 (up from $3,359 million in 2020), solar additions rose to $2,011 million in 2021 (up from $1,920 million in 2020), and rate-regulated transmission investments grew substantially to $980 million in 2021 (up from $360 million in 2020). This reflects a strategic expansion in clean energy infrastructure, with wind and solar now representing approximately 47% and 18% of NEER's depreciable plant, respectively, compared to 51% and 14% in 2022. The growth in rate-regulated transmission ($980 million in 2021) also underscores investments in grid modernization to support these new generation resources.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment experienced a $143 million increase in goodwill due to acquisitions, reflecting strategic investments to expand its capabilities. By fiscal year 2023, the financial exposure shifted toward post-sale obligations, as warranty liabilities primarily related to this segment were highlighted, indicating increased responsibility for long-term product support and customer commitments. This evolution shows a transition from upfront investment risk to ongoing operational liability.",

The only post‑acquisition adjustments were the $1.36 billion charge recorded in fiscal 2023 for the terminated Arm purchase agreement, which was expensed rather than reflected as goodwill.

By 2024, the company provided a more concrete and quantifiable disclosure, showing that tax incentives on qualified production spend directly reduced the cost basis of content assets, resulting in lower amortization. Specifically, tax incentives reduced content amortization by $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023, and $899 million in 2024, indicating a growing impact of these incentives over time.",

Tax incentives significantly reduced amortization costs for produced content, lowering it by $719 million in 2022, $835 million in 2023, and $899 million in 2024, as noted in the 2024 10-K disclosure.

      "question": "How did MetLife's assumptions regarding withdrawal rates and their impact on the estimated fair value of guarantees for GMWBs and GMABs/GMIBs evolve between 2022 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife disclosed that for GMWBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates resulted in an increase (decrease) in the estimated fair value of the guarantees, and for GMABs and GMIBs, any increase (decrease) in withdrawal rates led to a decrease (increase) in the estimated fair value. By 2024, MetLife continued to apply the same directional relationships between withdrawal rates and fair value for GMWBs, GMABs, and GMIBs, but the context shifted from valuing embedded derivatives to valuing MRBs (Market Risk Benefits), indicating a refinement or reclassification of how these guarantees are internally categorized and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MetLife’s assumptions for withdrawal rates in the valuation of embedded derivatives for guaranteed minimum benefits evolved as follows:  \n- **Withdrawal rates** were held at **0%** for valuation inputs but were adjusted dynamically based on policyholder behavior assumptions. For GMWBs, higher withdrawal rates increased the estimated fair value of guarantees, while for GMABs and GMIBs, increases in withdrawal rates *decreased* the estimated fair value.  \n- **Long-term equity volatilities** rose from **18.60% (2021)** to **25% (2021)** and further to **22.27% (2024)**, reflecting updated expectations for equity volatility beyond observable periods.  \n- **Mortality rates** and **lapse rates** were refined using company experience data, with mortality improvements (e.g., 0.06% to 0.05% for ages 0–40) and adjusted lapse assumptions (e.g., 6.30% to 12.86% for durations 1–10) impacting liability valuations.  \n- **Nonperformance risk spreads** declined slightly (e.g., 0.35% to 0.64%), reducing the estimated fair value of guarantees.  \n\nThese adjustments were part of ongoing refinements to reflect market conditions and policyholder behavior, with withdrawal rate changes directly influencing the estimated fair value of guarantees depending on the benefit type.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, QFNA was described as a reportable segment with accountability for share-based compensation expense, indicating its active role in the company's organizational structure and performance metrics. However, in 2024, the financial data shows that QFNA's allocation was only $11 million, a significant drop compared to other segments like FLNA ($150 million) and PBNA ($238 million). This suggests that QFNA's strategic importance may have diminished relative to other divisions, as reflected in the reduced financial resources allocated to it.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 10‑K (pages 68‑72) and the 2024 10‑K (pages 80‑84), the share‑based compensation expense allocation table shows that QFNA’s allocated expense remains a consistent **1 %** of total share‑based compensation each year (13 % – 13 % – 13 % in 2023, 2022, 2021). This unchanged 1 % share indicates that QFNA’s compensation cost is treated as a relatively minor, stable component of the company’s overall share‑based expense. Consequently, the limited and steady allocation suggests that QFNA is not a primary driver of PepsiCo’s equity‑based incentive strategy, implying that its strategic importance is modest compared with segments receiving larger expense allocations (e.g., PBNA at 18 %).",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 68 basis points, primarily due to increased fuel sales with lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix. In contrast, by fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by effective price management aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, although this was partially offset by shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. The change reflects a reversal in trend from margin compression in 2022 to margin expansion by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased 51 basis points in fiscal 2022, driven primarily by price management, favorable merchandise mix (including lapping temporary Auto Care and Vision Center closures), growth in advertising revenue, and strategic sourcing initiatives, partially offset by increased supply chain costs. This improvement occurred alongside a 6.3% increase in Walmart U.S. net sales, while the International segment saw a 55 basis point gross profit rate decline due to shifts into lower-margin formats and divestitures. The U.S. segment's operating income rose $2.5 billion, supported by strong comparable sales growth (6.4%) and controlled operating expense growth (31 basis point increase), whereas international operating income grew modestly ($0.1 billion) amid currency headwinds and divestiture impacts.",

      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the approximate dollar value of shares available for repurchase under IBM's publicly announced program remained consistently at **$2,007,611,768** at the end of 2021 (as shown in the 2022 10-K table for December 31, 2021) and again at **$2,007,611,768** at the end of 2024 (as shown in the 2024 10-K table for December 31, 2024).

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS revenue was reported in a table format showing $10,653 million in 2021 and $10,653 million in 2022, indicating a flat performance. However, in 2023, the company provided a more detailed description of AWS revenue recognition, emphasizing that revenue is primarily recognized when customers use services based on the quantity rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Additionally, in 2023, Amazon disclosed that certain AWS services, including compute and database, are offered as fixed quantities over specified terms, with revenue recognized ratably. This shift reflects a more nuanced understanding of contractual arrangements and service delivery models, including the capitalization and amortization of sales commissions for contracts exceeding one year, which was not mentioned in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AWS revenue recognition evolved through changes in contractual arrangements and service delivery models. AWS revenue is primarily recognized when customers use services (e.g., compute/storage capacity delivered on-demand), with revenue allocated using stand-alone selling prices. For multi-year contracts exceeding one year, sales commissions are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. This model contrasts with earlier periods where AWS revenue growth was driven by expanding service adoption, but the core recognition principles (performance-based allocation, stand-alone pricing) remained consistent. The 2023 filing notes no material change in AWS revenue recognition methodology, though AWS segment assets grew significantly (from $47.6B in 2020 to $63.8B in 2021, reflecting infrastructure investment).",

      "question": "How did AMT's Africa property segment evolve between 2022 and 2023 in terms of total asset value, and what does this indicate about the company's strategic positioning in that region?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT's Africa property segment had total assets valued at $4,759.4 million. By 2023, this value decreased to $4,031.2 million, indicating a decline of $728.2 million. This reduction suggests a strategic shift or divestiture in the Africa region, as the company may have reallocated resources or exited certain markets, contrasting with the earlier emphasis in 2022 on expanding operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, AMT's Africa property segment total asset value increased from $4,759.4 million in 2022 to $4,031.2 million in 2023 (though this appears to be a reporting anomaly as the 2023 figure is lower than 2022; however, the Africa segment's revenue share remained stable at 11% of total revenue in both years, indicating consistent strategic focus). The company maintains a strong presence in Africa through key tenants like MTN and Airtel, but the asset value decline suggests potential portfolio optimization or currency translation effects rather than strategic divestment. This stability in revenue contribution, despite minor asset fluctuations, reflects AMT's deliberate positioning to sustain its core African market operations as part of its diversified global real estate strategy.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix highlighted the forward-looking nature of content amortization as part of a broader set of financial and strategic uncertainties, noting its dependence on estimated viewing patterns which could impact financial performance. By 2024, the company provided a more detailed and concrete description of the amortization process, emphasizing its complexity and subjectivity due to reliance on both historical and forecasted viewing data. The 2024 filing also outlined specific audit procedures conducted by Ernst & Young LLP to evaluate the amortization method, including sensitivity analyses and comparisons of prior estimates to actual results—indicating a more structured and scrutinized approach over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's content amortization process has become more complex and subjective over time, requiring significant judgment in estimating future viewing patterns to determine amortization schedules. The 2024 10-K (Note 1) explicitly identifies content amortization as a critical audit matter, highlighting that management's estimates of viewing hours—based on historical and forecasted data—are inherently subjective and subject to change if actual consumption differs from projections. This complexity increased notably between 2022 and 2024, as evidenced by the 2024 audit's detailed testing of assumptions and sensitivity analyses, whereas the 2022 filing (Item 1) only generally described amortization based on \"historical and estimated viewing patterns\" without emphasizing the critical audit implications. The 2024 disclosure also explicitly references the need for ongoing reassessment of viewing trends, reflecting a more sophisticated and risk-aware approach to the estimation process.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Enhanced Defined Contribution Plan was described as an option for employees who elected not to continue accruing benefits in the defined benefit pension plans, as well as for employees hired between November 1997 and December 31, 2003. It included a fixed employer contribution of 2% of annual eligible earnings plus a matching contribution of up to 4%. In 2023, the plan maintained this structure for those hired through December 31, 2003, but for employees hired after that date, the fixed 2% contribution was removed, leaving only the matching contribution of up to 4%. This represents a narrowing of benefits for newer hires.",
      "llm_answer": "The Enhanced Defined Contribution Plan’s employer contribution framework was revised between 2022 and 2023 such that employees hired after December 31, 2003 no longer receive the fixed 2 % employer contribution that was part of the plan for earlier hires; instead they now receive only the matching contribution (up to 4 % of eligible earnings). This change is documented in the 2023 filing where it notes that post‑2003 hires “do not receive the fixed employer contribution of 2 % of the employee’s annual eligible earnings,” whereas the 2022 filing described the same fixed contribution for that group. Consequently, the contribution structure for those employees has been reduced from a guaranteed 2 % plus matching to matching only.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MetLife described the performance factor as being applied to Performance Units, which were liability awards, and the factor was determined using the same methodology as for Performance Shares, though specific performance metrics or outcomes were not detailed. By 2024, MetLife provided a more detailed and structured approach for Performance Shares, which were classified as equity awards. The performance factor for the 2021–2023 period was explicitly set at 147.5%, based on return on equity relative to business plan goals, total shareholder return compared to a peer group, and a cap if shareholder return was zero or negative. Additionally, the 2024 filing clarified that the Compensation Committee could adjust for 'Significant Events' affecting performance. This indicates a shift from a general disclosure of performance factor usage to a more transparent and quantitatively defined mechanism with explicit outcomes.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024 MetLife’s Performance Share awards continued to be measured with a performance factor ranging from 0% to 175%, but the way the factor is calculated was refined. For the 2018‑2020 period the factor was set by the Compensation Committee based on adjusted return on equity, total shareholder return versus peers, and a cap if shareholder return was ≤0%. Starting with the 2019‑2021 period (and continuing through 2024), the factor is determined by (a) the company’s three‑year adjusted return on equity versus its business‑plan goal, (b) three‑year total shareholder return versus a peer group, and (c) a 100% cap if the three‑year shareholder return is zero or negative, with “Significant Events” excluded at the Committee’s discretion. The 2021‑2023 performance factor was 147.5%, and the 2022‑2024 factor had not yet been finalized as of the 2024 filing. Consequently, the final payout of Performance Shares can vary substantially—up to 175% of the target shares if performance exceeds expectations, or as low as 0% if performance falls short—reflecting the updated, multi‑criteria methodology.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth Group disclosed favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $1.7 billion in 2021, $880 million in 2020, and $580 million in 2019, indicating consistent downward revisions in prior estimates. In 2023, the company stated that a hypothetical 1% difference in its estimate of Medical Costs Payable at year-end would have impacted 2023 net earnings by approximately $245 million. This shift indicates that while the company still experiences estimation variance, the nature of the impact evolved from realized favorable developments in prior years to a forward-looking sensitivity analysis in 2023, reflecting a more predictive and quantified risk to earnings.",
      "llm_answer": "The sensitivity analysis for medical costs payable shows that a 0.25% decrease in completion factors would increase medical costs payable by $292 million, while a 0.25% increase would decrease it by $290 million; similarly, a 1% change in the medical cost PMPM trend factor would alter payable amounts by roughly $376 million. This indicates that while the company’s liability estimates are reasonably accurate, they remain highly sensitive to modest changes in actuarial assumptions, meaning small estimation errors can materially affect reported medical costs payable. Consequently, the evolution from 2022 to 2023 reflects a continued reliance on these actuarial factors, with the 2023 sensitivity tables showing larger impacts (e.g., a 0.75% change yielding an $880 million swing), suggesting that estimation accuracy has not markedly improved and remains a key driver of variability in the company’s liability position.",

      "question": "How did JNJ's international tax liability evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this imply about the tax risk disclosed in connection with the Kenvue separation?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported an international tax liability of $3,090 million, which decreased to $2,604 million in 2024. This reduction of $486 million suggests that the substantial tax liability risk disclosed in 2023 related to the Kenvue separation was partially realized and subsequently addressed. The decrease implies that JNJ may have resolved or mitigated a portion of the previously disclosed international tax exposure associated with the separation.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, JNJ's international tax liability increased significantly in 2024, with the effective tax rate rising from 11.5% in 2023 to 15.7% in 2024. This rise was driven by higher income in higher-tax jurisdictions (notably the U.S. where a $5.1 billion talc-related charge was recorded at a 21% effective rate) and the impact of new global tax rules like Pillar Two, which negatively affected the tax rate reconciliation. Consequently, the Company disclosed that the Kenvue separation could trigger \"substantial tax liability\" if the IRS or other jurisdictions determine the transaction does not qualify for tax-free treatment, particularly highlighting risks in international tax treatment that could materialize post-separation.",

In contrast, in 2023, the impact turned unfavorable, resulting in an after-tax negative impact of approximately $793 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PepsiCo described its allocation methodologies for operating expenses across segments, including share-based compensation, pension, and retiree medical expenses, but did not disclose any specific dollar amounts allocated to the AMESA segment. In contrast, the 2024 filing explicitly reported a $5 million allocation to the AMESA segment for these expenses. This change indicates a shift in the company's financial reporting approach, with increased transparency in 2024 regarding resource allocation to the AMESA region, suggesting a more detailed and accountable presentation of financial commitments across geographic segments.",
      "llm_answer": "PepsiCo's disclosure of operating expense allocations to its AMESA segment remained consistently at 5% of share-based compensation expense in both 2023 and 2024, as shown in the allocation table under \"Share-Based Compensation Expense\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and growth in higher-margin businesses globally, partially offset by mix shifts into lower-margin merchandise categories. The increase in fiscal 2024 also benefited from lapping higher markdowns incurred in the prior year. This indicates a transformation in the gross profit rate dynamics, with a significant increase in contribution by 2024 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points in fiscal 2022 (from 24.1% to 24.4%) and by 20 basis points in fiscal 2021 (from 24.1% to 24.3%), driven by price management in the Walmart U.S. segment and strategic sourcing initiatives respectively. The key factors for the 2022 increase were cost inflation management and merchandise mix, while the 2021 increase was primarily due to strategic sourcing initiatives and strong sales in higher-margin categories, partially offset by carryover price investments and temporary store closures.",

By 2024, these allowances had declined further to $2,516 million. This indicates a continued reduction in the company's valuation allowances, suggesting increased confidence in the realizability of deferred tax assets over time.",

This decline signals a modest improvement in the company’s tax position, as it reflects a reduced need for valuation reserves against future tax benefits. Consequently, the company appears to be in a slightly stronger tax footing heading into 2025, though significant unrecognized tax benefits still remain.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, MET disclosed that liabilities for future policy benefits were calculated using present value of expected benefits and premiums, with key assumptions including mortality, lapse rates, and investment returns. The company emphasized its regular review of these estimates and the potential need to increase liabilities if experience was less favorable than assumed. By 2024, MET highlighted that low interest rates could directly increase liabilities for future policy benefits, requiring higher reserves. Additionally, MET noted that asymmetrical accounting treatments between derivatives and hedged items could cause volatility in net income and equity due to changes in these liabilities. This indicates a shift from a primarily actuarial estimation approach in 2022 to a more risk-sensitive discussion of interest rate and accounting impacts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, MetLife’s liabilities for future policy benefits have remained largely insulated from interest‑rate volatility through a mix of floating‑rate short‑duration products, ALM duration‑matching, and the use of interest‑rate derivatives; only about 5 % of invested assets are subject to reinvestment risk each year. In a declining‑rate environment, gross‑margin compression is mitigated by adjusting crediting rates and using derivatives, while in a rising‑rate scenario higher reinvestment yields more than offset higher crediting rates and lower derivative income, preserving overall margin stability.",

By 2024, the company's disclosures shifted to emphasize that profit-share payments were now included directly in sales to customers, with the note that these payments represented less than 2.0% of total revenues in fiscal year 2024. This reflects a change in emphasis from long-term amortization to current revenue recognition, improving transparency around the contribution of collaborative arrangements to top-line performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, Johnson & Johnson’s treatment of profit-share payments in collaborative arrangements remained consistent in that these payments continued to be included in sales to customers, but their relative contribution to total revenue declined slightly—profit-share payments accounted for less than 2.0% of total revenue in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, compared with less than 3.0% in fiscal 2022 and 2021.

      "question": "How has Target's treatment and classification of vendor income evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of its relationship to Cost of Sales and advertising expenses?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Target disclosed that substantially all vendor income—arising from volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising activities—was recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales. Additionally, reimbursements from vendors for advertising were recognized as offsets within SG&A expenses, with net advertising costs reported at $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively. By 2024, Target's classification had evolved: vendor income that constitutes reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs was now explicitly offset against advertising expenses within Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, while vendor income not tied to such reimbursements continued to reduce Cost of Sales. This reflects a more nuanced and bifurcated treatment of vendor income depending on its nature and use.",
      "llm_answer": "Target's treatment of vendor income has evolved such that it is now consistently recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales rather than as a separate revenue line item, reflecting a more integrated presentation of vendor-sponsored programs (e.g., volume rebates, markdown allowances, advertising reimbursements) within the cost structure. This shift aligns with its classification of vendor income as \"consideration received from vendors\" that offsets cost of sales, while advertising costs are now recorded net of vendor reimbursements within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, rather than being offset against Cost of Sales as in prior years. Consequently, vendor income is no longer a distinct revenue component but is instead treated as a direct reduction of the cost of goods sold, with advertising expenses being net of vendor reimbursements in SG&A.",

      "question": "How did the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's performance on long-term contracts?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased slightly to $1.6 billion. This indicates that while the company continued to experience favorable profit adjustments from its long-term contracts in 2023, the magnitude of these adjustments was lower compared to the previous year, suggesting a moderate decline in the rate of improvement or risk retirement on those contracts.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 the company’s consolidated net‑profit‑booking‑rate adjustments rose from about $1.8 billion to $1.6 billion (a net decrease of roughly $0.2 billion), but the key point is that these adjustments are tied to changes in estimated total contract costs and variable consideration. When the estimated costs to complete a long‑term contract fall—i.e., when risk retirements occur—the profit booking rate increases, boosting recognized profit; conversely, higher estimated costs lower the rate and reduce profit. Thus, the evolution of these adjustments signals that the company’s performance on long‑term contracts improved in 2023 relative to 2022, as reflected by higher profit booking rates and the resulting increase in segment operating profit.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Corporation stated that the fair value of conditional legal obligations related to soil remediation could not be measured due to the impossibility of estimating future settlement dates. In 2024, the Corporation repeated the same language, indicating no change in its ability to estimate these settlement dates. Therefore, the Corporation continued to face challenges in quantifying soil remediation costs due to indeterminate site lives and lack of settlement date visibility.",
      "llm_answer": "The disclosure on soil remediation costs within asset retirement obligations shows a shift in how settlement timing is addressed between 2023 and 2024. In 2023, the Corporation noted that sites in the Product Solutions business generally have indeterminate lives due to plans for continued operations, making it impossible to estimate future settlement dates for conditional legal obligations. By 2024, this language was retained but refined: the Corporation still states these obligations cannot be measured due to indeterminate lives, but the updated financial tables (e.g., revised liability activity and long-term obligations of $10,886 million at year-end 2024) reflect more precise estimates of future cash outflows ($1,146 million in 2025 and $968 million in 2026), indicating improved ability to project settlement timelines despite ongoing indeterminacy. This evolution suggests greater operational clarity in forecasting remediation timelines, even as the fundamental uncertainty around settlement dates remains.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, HD received $6.9 billion in net proceeds from long-term debt, while in fiscal 2023, this amount decreased to $2.0 billion. This significant reduction indicates a shift in HD's financing strategy, moving away from issuing long-term debt as a primary source of liquidity, possibly reflecting a more conservative financial stance or a reduced need for external financing during fiscal 2023.",

This represents a decrease in net proceeds from $3.0 billion in fiscal 2022 to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2023.

      "llm_answer": "Tesla's relationship with Gigafactory Shanghai evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024, marked by expanded operational commitments and targeted government incentives. In 2023, the company emphasized meeting cumulative capital expenditure targets and annual tax revenue goals under its Shanghai agreement, while leveraging local incentives to reduce production costs and support growth. By 2024, Tesla continued to ramp production at the facility, with plans to increase capacity for new models like the Cybertruck and next-generation platforms, supported by ongoing investments in battery cell manufacturing and localized supply chains. The Shanghai factory remained central to Tesla’s global strategy, contributing to its ability to fund capital-intensive projects through sustained growth and operational efficiency.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022–2023 period, Total Otezla revenue declined by 4% from $2,288 million to $2,188 million. In the subsequent 2023–2024 period, the decline continued but at a slower pace, with a 3% decrease from $2,188 million to $2,126 million. This indicates a worsening revenue trend in 2022–2023 followed by a slight moderation in the rate of decline in 2023–2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NextEra Energy reported minimal gains on disposal of businesses or assets, amounting to only $4 million. In contrast, by 2023, the company recorded a significant net loss of $407 million from the disposal of businesses or assets. This sharp change indicates a notable shift in NextEra Energy's divestiture strategy, moving from limited asset sales with small gains to a more active divestiture approach involving larger transactions that resulted in a substantial net loss, possibly reflecting strategic portfolio realignment.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, gains on disposal of businesses/assets increased sharply from $4 million to $407 million. This surge reflects a more aggressive divestiture strategy, with NextEra Energy completing several large‑scale sales of wind, solar and battery assets in 2021 and 2022 that generated substantial cash proceeds and gains, and the 2023 figure includes the cumulative impact of those transactions as they were recognized in earnings. Consequently, the rising gains indicate that NextEra has been actively monetizing non‑core generating assets, leveraging these sales to fund growth and manage its portfolio composition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, fuel surcharge revenues were $3.0 billion, a decrease of $0.7 billion from $3.7 billion in 2022, primarily due to a 15% drop in fuel prices and lower shipment volumes, although fluctuating fuel prices had a delayed impact on recoveries. By 2024, fuel surcharge revenues further declined to $2.6 billion from $3.0 billion in 2023, again driven by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lagged effect of price changes, partially offset by higher shipment volumes. This indicates a continued downward trend in fuel surcharge revenues over the two-year period, influenced by both pricing and volume dynamics.",
      "llm_answer": "The freight revenue growth between 2023 and 2024 was driven by a 1% increase in freight revenues to $22.8 billion, fueled by a 3% rise in volume and core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge revenues ($2.6 billion in 2024 vs. $3.0 billion in 2023) due to a 15% decline in fuel prices and a two-month lag in surcharge adjustments. Volume growth was led by international intermodal and grain shipments, while coal and rock shipments declined, and Mexico-bound freight revenues rose 8% to $3.0 billion. Key factors included macroeconomic uncertainties affecting coal demand, fuel price volatility, and the timing impact of fuel surcharge programs on earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil stated that its Corporate Plan assumptions included greenhouse gas emissions pricing as part of its economic evaluation for investments, developed annually based on its Global Outlook. By 2024, the company maintained this approach but emphasized that current policy trends and lower-emission solutions were not yet aligned with a net-zero pathway by 2050, indicating a more cautious stance on the pace of emissions reduction. This evolution suggests that while emissions pricing remains a consistent factor in planning, ExxonMobil is signaling that external policy support and technological advancements need to accelerate for the company to meet more aggressive emissions targets.",
      "llm_answer": "ExxonMobil’s corporate plan assumptions for greenhouse‑gas emissions pricing have become more explicit and integrated into its forward‑looking planning documents between 2023 and 2024. In the 2023 10‑K, emissions‑pricing assumptions were embedded within the broader “price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs” that feed the Corporate Plan, but the discussion was largely generic and referenced only the Outlook as the basis for long‑term assumptions. By 2024, the filing explicitly ties actions needed to meet its 2030 emissions‑reduction targets to the medium‑term business plans that are updated annually, noting that the reference case for planning beyond 2030 is the Global Outlook which “assumes increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050.” This evolution shows a strategic shift toward embedding specific emissions‑pricing parameters and climate‑related milestones (e.g., net‑zero Scope 1/2 by 2050, zero routine flaring, near‑zero methane) directly into capital‑allocation and investment‑evaluation processes, indicating that lower‑emission investments are now a core, measurable component of ExxonMobil’s strategic planning rather than an after‑thought.",

      "llm_answer": "Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets increased significantly from $73 million in fiscal 2022 to $313 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a 46 % rise between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 and a continued upward trend through fiscal 2024. This growth indicates that the company has been acquiring more intangible assets—particularly through its 2024 purchase of Splunk—thereby expanding its portfolio of acquired technologies and related amortizable assets.",

This reduction indicates a reversal of the growth trend observed in previous years and suggests a potential challenge in maintaining or improving retail space efficiency during the 2023 fiscal year.",
      "llm_answer": "Home Depot's sales per retail square foot increased from $604.74 in fiscal 2022 to $604.55 in fiscal 2023, representing a slight decrease of 0.03% (or $0.19). This minimal change indicates that the company's retail efficiency remained largely stable year-over-year, with no significant improvement in sales productivity per square foot of store space. The slight decline suggests that while overall sales performance was maintained, the company did not achieve meaningful gains in optimizing its retail space utilization between these fiscal years.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde's long-term contracts enabled the company to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, positively impacting its business by ensuring stable cash flow. However, in 2024, cost pass-through had a negative impact of (1)% on sales, indicating a shift in how these cost adjustments affected the company's revenue. This change suggests that rising costs could not be fully offset by customer pricing adjustments, potentially signaling tighter pricing conditions or increased cost pressures in the market.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, cost pass-through – which bills energy cost variances to onsite customers – reduced sales by 1% in 2024 (compared with a 3% drag in 2023) while having minimal impact on operating profit. This shift signals that Linde’s pricing power and productivity initiatives have strengthened, allowing the company to offset cost inflation and maintain margin growth despite a modest decline in the pass-through effect.",

      "original_answer": "Microsoft's Windows revenue increased from $24,761 million in fiscal year 2022 to a level that reflected 8% growth in fiscal year 2024. Specifically, in 2024, Windows OEM revenue grew by 7%, while Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew by 11%. This indicates a steady increase in the Windows segment, with both OEM and Commercial components contributing to the overall growth trajectory.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, Microsoft's Windows revenue grew from $22,488 million in fiscal year 2022 to $24,761 million in fiscal year 2024, representing a growth of 10.1% over the two-year period. For fiscal year 2024 specifically, Windows OEM revenue grew 7% and Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 11%, while the overall Windows revenue increased 8% year-over-year. The document also states that Microsoft Cloud revenue (which includes Azure and other cloud services, Office 365 Commercial, and commercial LinkedIn) reached $91.2 billion in fiscal year 2022, $69.1 billion in 2021, and $51.7 billion in 2020, though this refers to the broader cloud segment rather than Windows specifically.",

This represents a steady rise in the recognition of content-related costs over time. The increase suggests that Netflix continued to invest heavily in content, with a growing portion of previously capitalized content assets being amortized as they were utilized over their expected viewing periods. This trend aligns with Netflix's strategy of expanding its content library to support global growth and member retention.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s amortization of content assets increased from $10,807 million to $12,230 million in 2022 and then to $15,301 million in 2024, reflecting a $1,423 million (13%) rise from 2020‑21 and a further $3,071 million (25%) jump by 2024. This accelerating amortization mirrors the company’s strategy of front‑loading cash outlays for original productions and licensing while spreading the expense over shorter periods to match viewing patterns. Consequently, the trend signals that Netflix is intensifying its content investment, prioritizing original programming that requires larger upfront spending and faster cost recovery through subscriber growth.",

In 2024, the allowance began at $658 million, decreased by $122 million, and ended at $577 million.

For 2024, the allowance rose further to $658 million at year-end (from $631 million at the start of 2023), with the 2024 additions showing a $201 million increase (including $9 million foreign currency impact) and $183 million in write-offs, indicating a continued rise in the company's estimated inventory risk and a more conservative approach to reserve for potential inventory obsolescence or market fluctuations. This upward trend suggests IBM is proactively managing inventory risk amid evolving market conditions, though the increasing allowance highlights growing uncertainty in inventory recoverability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company reviewed its network location intangible asset for impairment using a cash flow modeling approach that incorporated tower location, demographics, timing of new tenants, lease rates, and ongoing cash requirements. Tenant-related intangible assets were assessed on a tenant-by-tenant basis, focusing on turnover, contract non-renewals, or relationship terminations. By 2023, while the impairment review framework remained largely the same, the company added context around tenant risk by referencing a specific customer (VIL) in India that had made partial payments in 2022 and indicated it would not resume full contractual payments in 2023, signaling a shift in how tenant-specific risks were explicitly tied to impairment considerations.",
      "llm_answer": "The impairment analysis for the Network Location Intangible asset shifted from a general review of cash flow indicators (e.g., tenant turnover, lease renewals) in 2022 to a more granular, tenant‑specific focus in 2023, incorporating updated cash‑flow modeling that explicitly accounts for the risk of partial or delayed payments from key Indian customers such as VIL. This evolution reflects heightened awareness of tenant‑related risk, leading to revised assumptions about future cash inflows and a more conservative assessment of recoverability for the intangible asset.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, global Nplate sales increased by 13%, reaching $1,477 million, with U.S. government orders contributing $286 million. In 2024, global Nplate sales decreased by 1%, but when excluding U.S. government orders ($128 million in 2024), sales increased by 12% year-over-year, driven by volume growth of 8% and higher net selling prices of 6%. This indicates a shift where organic growth offset the decline caused by reduced government orders.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in global Nplate sales shows a steady increase from $1,027 million in 2021 to $1,307 million in 2022 (+27 %) and then to $1,477 million in 2023 (+13 %). This growth was primarily driven by volume growth, including U.S. government orders of $286 million in 2023 and $207 million in 2022. Consequently, U.S. government orders contributed a significant, though not quantified, boost to the overall sales increase observed between 2023 and 2024.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ excluded war-related costs associated with the conflict in Ukraine, including asset impairments, inventory losses, and allowances for uncollectible receivables, from non-GAAP operating results to facilitate comparisons of ongoing performance. By 2024, MDLZ disclosed a specific incremental cost of $4 million directly attributed to the war in Ukraine, which was included in operating results. This marks a shift from exclusion in 2023 to explicit recognition and quantification in 2024, indicating a change in how these costs were treated and communicated.",
      "llm_answer": "MDLZ’s disclosure of war‑related costs shifted from a general note on “incremental costs directly related to the war, including asset impairments, higher allowances for uncollectible accounts, committed compensation and subsequent recoveries” in the 2023 filing (2023 10‑K, page 56‑57) to a more detailed breakdown in the 2024 filing that quantifies these costs as part of operating results—showing a $0.09 million increase in Adjusted EPS from the war in Ukraine and specifying the incremental war‑related expense line item in the segment‑operating‑income table (2024 10‑K, pages 47‑51). Consequently, while the 2023 filing only mentioned the existence of such costs and their impact on operating results in the aggregate, the 2024 filing explicitly measures and discloses the war‑related expense impact on both operating income and Adjusted EPS, reflecting a more granular treatment of war‑related costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that pre-contract costs are capitalized in inventories if they relate directly to a specific contract or anticipated contract, with the determination that the contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources for performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable. Additionally, it specified that pre-contract costs were generally recognized as cost of sales upon receipt of the anticipated contract. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, emphasizing that these costs are incurred to enhance the ability to meet schedule and customer milestones, while maintaining the same core conditions for capitalization. The evolution reflects a more strategic framing of pre-contract cost incurrence without altering the financial treatment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin’s treatment of pre-contract costs remained consistent with its prior practice: costs incurred in advance of contract award that are directly related to a specific anticipated contract and for which award is probable are capitalized as work-in-process inventory (pre-contract costs), while all other pre-contract costs (including start-up costs) are expensed as incurred. The 2023 disclosure confirms this policy unchanged from prior years, noting that such capitalized pre-contract costs are recognized in cost of sales when the anticipated contract is awarded and revenue is recognized. No shift in accounting policy occurred, though the volume of capitalized pre-contract costs increased (e.g., $989 million in 2023 vs. $791 million in 2022), primarily driven by Aeronautics classified contracts.",

In 2024, this total decreased to 3,918 Flat Cars, with 1,966 owned and 1,952 leased units. This represents a reduction of 552 Flat Cars, or about 12.3%, over the year. The decline in both owned and leased Flat Cars suggests a reduced emphasis on this type of freight car in Union Pacific's fleet.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the total number of flat cars (both owned and leased) **increased from 4,470 in 2023 to 3,918 in 2024** (as shown in the \"Freight cars\" section of the \"Rail Equipment\" tables). This represents a **decrease of 552 flat cars** (from 4,470 to 3,918). This reduction indicates that Union Pacific is **decreasing its reliance on flat cars** as part of its fleet management strategy, likely to optimize equipment utilization and align with current and future operational needs, as noted in the document's discussion of maintaining a \"buffer\" for agility in equipment acquisition. The decline suggests a strategic shift away from flat cars, possibly due to changing freight demand or operational efficiency initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM identified 'Downturn in Economic Environment and Client Spending Budgets' as a key risk factor, indicating continued sensitivity to client budgets. However, in 2024, the company added a nuance by emphasizing a 'shift in client buying patterns' as a contributing factor to this risk, which was not explicitly mentioned in 2023. This evolution suggests that while the core risk remains stable, IBM is observing and highlighting changing dynamics in how clients allocate their budgets, potentially due to digital transformation trends or shifts toward cloud and AI investments.",
      "llm_answer": "IBM's 10‑K risk factors show that the company's exposure to client spending budgets has shifted from a general concern about a possible economic downturn affecting demand for its products and services (2023 filing) to a more specific warning that reduced client spending on technology—particularly in high‑value, competitive areas such as hybrid cloud and AI—could materially impact revenue and profit margins (2024 filing). In other words, while both years flag economic‑driven budget cuts as a risk, the 2024 filing emphasizes that weaker client spending budgets directly threaten IBM’s growth and profitability.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, LOW paid $13,012 million for share repurchases, whereas in 2024, the amount decreased significantly to $4,053 million. This indicates a substantial reduction in the company's share buyback activity over the two-year period, suggesting a shift in capital allocation strategy, possibly toward conserving cash or investing in other strategic priorities.",

This evolution reflects a strategic shift toward prioritizing capital allocation flexibility, as evidenced by the significant reduction in repurchase amounts ($13B → $4B) while maintaining a substantial remaining authorization ($10.8B as of Jan 2025). The company continues to balance shareholder returns through dividends and repurchases but has moderated repurchase scale to preserve liquidity and strategic flexibility amid evolving market conditions.",

In 2024, these figures increased to $1,615 million in current loans, $110 million in 30-89 days delinquent, and $45 million in 90+ days past due. This indicates a moderate increase in both delinquency categories, suggesting a slight rise in credit risk exposure over the year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the distribution of Card Member Loan balances between current and delinquent categories remained relatively stable from 2023 to 2024, with total loan balances increasing slightly to $2,863 million as of December 31, 2024 (compared to $2,785 million as of December 31, 2023). Delinquent balances (30-89 days past due and 90+ days past due) also rose marginally from $231 million in 2023 to $220 million in 2024, though the proportion of delinquent loans remained low relative to the total portfolio. This indicates that American Express's credit risk exposure remains generally stable, with only modest increases in delinquency rates observed despite the slight growth in overall loan balances. The company continues to monitor these trends closely, particularly within its Card Member Loans portfolio, which constitutes a significant portion of its credit risk profile.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the decline in ENBREL sales was attributed to three factors: lower net selling price, lower inventory, and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. By 2024, the decline was attributed solely to a lower net selling price, indicating that inventory and sales deductions were no longer significant contributors to the decline. Additionally, the company's expectations shifted from anticipating ENBREL to follow the historical quarterly sales pattern in 2024 with further price declines, to expecting relatively flat volumes with continued price erosion in 2025, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price set for 2026.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the decline in ENBREL sales deepened due to lower net selling prices, with the company now expecting continued price declines and a historically low first‑quarter pattern of sales driven by benefit‑plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co‑pay costs, while also anticipating relatively flat volumes and ongoing pressure from IRA‑related Medicare Part D pricing starting in 2026.",

The company also noted that start-up costs were expensed as incurred. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to include the strategic use of pre-contract costs in advanced procurement for a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at its Aeronautics segment, with explicit mention of recoverability risks tied to the customer's decisions on future program phases. This reflects a shift from a general accounting policy to a more risk-focused disclosure involving specific programs and financial exposure.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Lockheed Martin’s treatment of pre-contract costs shifted from capitalizing them in inventory when recoverable to expensing them as incurred if not directly tied to a specific anticipated contract, reflecting tighter risk assessment. Disclosures highlight increased exposure to reach-forward losses on fixed-price development programs (e.g., Aeronautics, RMS), where cost growth or scope changes could trigger material impairments of capitalized pre-contract costs and inventory, especially amid uncertain customer decisions on future phases.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, MDLZ did not exclude the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from its Organic Net Revenue calculations, and Organic Net Revenue stood at $35.6 billion, reflecting a 14.7% increase driven by net pricing and favorable volume/mix. However, in 2024, due to the significant devaluation of the Argentinean peso in late 2023 and the potential distortion on constant currency growth measures, MDLZ decided to exclude pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year (classified as 'extreme pricing') from Organic Net Revenue and related non-GAAP metrics. This change was implemented prospectively starting in Q1 2024, with the impact of extreme pricing now being separately disclosed as part of 'currency-related items.' In 2024, extreme pricing in Argentina contributed $1,167 million (3.2 percentage points) to Organic Net Revenue growth, offsetting some of the unfavorable currency translation impacts. This indicates a strategic shift in how MDLZ accounts for and reports financial performance in hyperinflationary environments.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of extreme pricing in Argentina shifted between 2023 and 2024 as the company began excluding pricing increases exceeding 26% year-over-year (\"extreme pricing\") from its Organic Net Revenue calculations starting in Q1 2024, a threshold reflecting hyperinflationary conditions under U.S. GAAP. This adjustment, driven by the Argentine peso's significant devaluation in December 2023, indicates MDLZ's proactive approach to isolating underlying volume and pricing trends in hyperinflationary markets, ensuring its non-GAAP metrics reflect sustainable growth rather than inflationary distortions. Consequently, the shift underscores a strategic pivot toward more stable, volume-driven growth frameworks in volatile economies.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed that it would incur advanced procurement costs (precontract costs) to enhance its ability to meet the revised schedule and certain milestones on the classified fixed-price incentive fee contract at the Aeronautics business segment. These costs were tied to the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program. By 2023, the company continued to incur these costs but shifted the terminology to 'pre-contract costs' and expanded the context to include ongoing monitoring of recoverability based on the customer's decisions about future phases. Additionally, while cumulative losses on the program increased from $225 million in 2022 to $270 million in 2023, the company maintained its focus on managing these advanced procurement costs in relation to program performance and future scope decisions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the treatment of advanced procurement (precontract) costs related to classified fixed-price incentive fee contracts evolved in two key ways: First, the company continued to capitalize precontract costs in inventory when they are directly tied to a specific anticipated contract and recovery is probable, but it began more explicitly monitoring the recoverability of these costs—especially on programs like the Aeronautics fixed-price incentive fee contract where advanced procurement costs are incurred to meet revised schedules and milestones, with potential impairments if the customer decides not to proceed with future phases. Second, while the basic accounting policy for precontract costs remained unchanged (capitalizing only those that meet the criteria and expense them when the related revenue is recognized), the 2023 disclosures highlighted that such costs could be impacted by customer decisions on future program phases, leading to possible reductions in backlog or additional loss recognition if recoverability is impaired. This represents a shift toward greater disclosure of the risk and potential write‑off of precontract costs tied to classified contracts.",

By 2024, the recognized portion of content liabilities had increased to $6.2 billion (comprising $4.4 billion current and $1.8 billion noncurrent), with an additional $17.0 billion in unrecognized obligations, bringing the total to $23.2 billion. This indicates a significant increase in both recognized and unrecognized content liabilities, suggesting an aggressive expansion in content investment and long-term commitments.",

This upward trajectory signals that the company is aggressively expanding its content spend, locking in multi‑year licensing and production deals that are largely fixed‑cost in nature, and underscores a strategic focus on building a deep, globally diverse catalog to drive subscriber growth and retention despite the resulting pressure on liquidity and operating flexibility.",

Regarding markdown reserves, in 2022, the reserve was not explicitly stated, but in 2024, it was reported at $222 million, reflecting a decrease of approximately $23 million from fiscal 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales and explicitly warned that any shift away from nucleoside-based therapeutics like TAF could adversely impact HIV product sales. In 2024, while the company maintained the same risk narrative around potential paradigm shifts affecting nucleoside-based therapies, it omitted the specific percentage of total product sales attributable to HIV products. This suggests that while the core risk remained, the level of quantitative transparency decreased in the 2024 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2023 and 2024 SEC 10-K filing excerpts, GILD's disclosure regarding HIV product risk from treatment paradigm shifts **remained consistent but did not indicate a new shift away from nucleoside-based therapeutics**. In both years, the filing explicitly states that many HIV products contain tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, a nucleoside analog), and warns that \"if there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV, and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted\" (2023: p.17; 2024: p.17). However, the 2024 filing adds no new details about evolving paradigms—it reiterates the same risk language without referencing emerging alternatives (e.g., long-acting injectables or integrase inhibitors) that might displace TAF-based regimens. The core risk remains unchanged: dependence on nucleoside-based therapies like TAF is a material vulnerability if clinical guidelines shift.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, mark-to-market unrealized gains or losses and realized gains or losses from marketable securities were excluded from non-GAAP financial measures because they were not considered indicative of underlying operations. In 2024, this exclusion was maintained and further clarified as part of the non-recurring adjustments to better facilitate comparisons of underlying operating performance across periods. The change reflects a more explicit justification for the exclusion in 2024, emphasizing the non-recurring nature of these items and their lack of relevance to ongoing operational performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of mark‑to‑market unrealized gains or losses on marketable securities was removed from non‑GAAP earnings measures in the first quarter of 2023 and remained excluded in the 2024 definitions, with the change being reflected prospectively (no revision of prior periods). This exclusion was reiterated in the 2024 non‑GAAP definitions (footnote 16) and continued to be applied to Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Operating Income.",

In 2023, Lockheed Martin continued to disclose these obligations but provided more detail on the accounting treatment, specifying that non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these plans were recorded as part of 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. This shift reflects a more detailed disclosure and classification refinement in 2023 compared to the primarily numerical disclosure in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the accounting classification and financial disclosure of Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans remained consistent as postretirement benefit obligations recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), with no change in their classification as liabilities on the balance sheet. The key evolution was in the treatment of future obligations: the 2023 disclosures reflected updated discount rate assumptions (5.00% vs. 5.25% in 2022), leading to revised actuarial loss estimates, while the 2022 disclosures showed a significant actuarial gain due to a prior discount rate increase (from 2.75% to 5.25%). Both years classified these plans as postretirement benefit plans under FAS 158, with assets and obligations tracked separately, and future payments projected to total $570 million beyond 2031, unchanged from 2022. The accounting treatment of settlements and amortization of prior service credits also remained consistent, with no reclassification of these obligations as long-term debt or equity.",

      "original_answer": "The tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income continued to benefit Lockheed Martin's effective tax rate in both 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the effective tax rate was 14.2%, and in 2023, it increased slightly to 14.5%. Both years cite the foreign derived intangible income deductions as a key factor in reducing the effective tax rate, alongside other credits such as research and development and employee equity awards. The consistent mention of this deduction across both years indicates that it remained a stable component of the company's tax planning strategy, even amid broader tax law changes like the research and development capitalization rules that introduced new cash tax liabilities. However, the slight increase in the effective tax rate suggests a minor reduction in the relative benefit from these deductions.",
      "llm_answer": "The effective tax rate declined from 16.4% in 2021 to 14.5% in 2023, reflecting a strategic shift toward leveraging tax deductions for foreign-derived intangible income and R&D credits amid evolving tax reforms. This trend indicates Lockheed Martin's proactive tax planning to optimize cash flow, particularly as it navigates the amortization of R&D expenditures under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and anticipates potential impacts from global tax initiatives like OECD Pillar 2.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil included refinery and chemical margins as part of its Corporate Plan assumptions, which were developed annually and based on the Global Outlook. By 2024, this practice remained consistent, but the language evolved to emphasize that these assumptions were part of a broader set of economic inputs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing and foreign currency exchange rates, reflecting a more integrated and dynamic planning process that adapts to emerging policy and market conditions.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2023 and 2024 Corporate Plan assumptions disclosed in the provided pages, ExxonMobil incorporated refinery margins into its planning framework as a key input for evaluating investment opportunities and setting capital objectives. The 2023 Corporate Plan (referenced in the 2023 10-K pages 43-47) used refinery margin assumptions as part of its price range inputs for crude oil, natural gas, and refined products, which were integral to projecting cash flows and evaluating major investments. By 2024, the Corporate Plan assumptions (2024 10-K pages 40-44) continued to rely on refinery margin assumptions but refined their application, particularly in the context of evolving market conditions and the company's strategic focus on integrated value chains. The 2024 plan explicitly tied refinery margin assumptions to its broader energy demand outlook and transition planning, emphasizing their role in assessing profitability across the Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products segments. This evolution reflects a more structured integration of margin assumptions into both short-term operational planning and long-term strategic objectives, including capital allocation decisions for lower-emission initiatives. The shift underscores a deliberate refinement in how margin assumptions support the Corporate Plan’s alignment with market fundamentals and sustainability goals.",

In 2023, EMEA product revenue increased slightly to $10,645 million but its percentage contribution to total product revenue declined to 27.1%.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Linde emphasized its ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers through long-term contracts, indicating a proactive approach to cost management. By 2024, this mechanism had a negative 1% impact on sales growth, suggesting that while cost pass-through remained a feature of its contracts, it may have led to downward pressure on sales due to customer resistance or market conditions. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely strategic advantage to a more complex dynamic affecting revenue performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms remained consistent between 2023 and 2024, with cost pass-through decreasing reported sales by 1% in 2024 (compared to a 3% decrease in 2023) while having minimal impact on operating profit. This stability indicates that Linde's pricing strategy effectively offset inflationary pressures through contractual cost pass-through, particularly in the Americas segment where higher pricing (3% contribution to sales) and productivity initiatives more than offset cost inflation. The company's ability to maintain pricing power and manage cost inflation through these mechanisms demonstrates a robust pricing strategy that supports margin expansion, as evidenced by the 7% increase in segment operating profit across key regions despite volume fluctuations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Operations and Support Expenses decreased due to automation in network operations, digitization of customer support, and reductions in personnel and network access costs, including a $75 benefit from a dispute settlement. By 2024, this trend continued as Business Wireline Operations and Support Expenses dropped to $14,217 million, down from the 2023 level, showing sustained progress toward efficiency goals. This reflects the company's ongoing transformation strategy to right-size operations in alignment with its strategic direction, indicating that the 2024 results are a continuation of the cost-saving initiatives launched in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the 2024 segment results in the T_10k_2024.pdf pages, the Business Wireline segment's Operations and Support Expenses totaled $13,352 million for 2024, reflecting continued efficiency gains from automation and digitization that drove a 4.8% year‑over‑year decline from $14,217 million in 2023. This reduction aligns with the company's stated strategy of further right‑sizing operations and leveraging automation to improve cost efficiency.",

Small business loans showed $45 million and $16 million in the same categories. By 2024, consumer delinquencies increased to $110 million (30-89 days) and $45 million (90+ days), while small business delinquencies rose to $56 million and $22 million respectively. This indicates a moderate increase in credit risk, suggesting potential deterioration in loan quality or economic pressures affecting repayment capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, delinquency trends for Card Member Loans show improved performance: as of December 31 2024, the “Current” balances rose to $2,863 million (up from $2,785 million in 2023) while the “30‑89 Days Past Due” amount fell to $220 million (down from $231 million) and “90+ Days Past Due” declined to $89 million (from $73 million). This reduction in past‑due balances across both consumer and small‑business loan portfolios indicates that credit risk management has been effective, with fewer accounts moving into delinquency and a stronger overall loan‑book quality.",

However, in 2024, the company disclosed a contingent consideration adjustment expense of $72 million related to acquisition integration costs.

The company’s “Adjusted Operating Income” definition still removes acquisition‑related costs, integration costs and contingent‑consideration adjustments, so the treatment of those items did not change between the two years.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin disclosed actions taken to reduce pension obligation volatility, including pension risk transfer transactions such as the August 2021 purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for $4.9 billion in pension obligations, and noted a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion. The company also reported a weighted average discount rate of 2.875% for its defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021. In 2023, the company shifted focus to how it records components of FAS pension income/expense across different financial statement accounts and provided a reconciliation table for the funded status of its qualified defined benefit pension plans, indicating a more structured financial presentation of benefit obligations and plan assets. This represents a shift from strategic pension risk management in 2022 to detailed financial disclosure and classification in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Lockheed Martin’s pension accounting disclosures show a clear evolution in how it presents and reconciles the funded status of its qualified defined benefit plans between 2022 and 2023. In 2023, the company reported a net unfunded status of $6.159 billion for its qualified pension plans (up from $5.470 billion in 2022), reflecting a $2.3 billion increase in benefit obligations driven by a lower discount rate (5.00% vs. 5.25% in 2022) and $731 million of actuarial losses, partially offset by $65 million of service cost and $348 million of amortized prior‑service credits. The 2023 Form 10‑K (page 81‑85) provides a detailed reconciliation of beginning balances, service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains/losses, settlements, plan amendments, benefits paid, and the final funded status, and it links these changes to the amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. This level of granularity—showing the components of the funded‑status calculation, the impact of discount‑rate changes, and the amortization of actuarial gains and losses—represents a more comprehensive presentation than the 2022 filing, which similarly disclosed the funded status but with less detailed breakdowns of the reconciliation items and the specific effect of discount‑rate shifts on the $2.3 billion obligation change. Consequently, the 2023 filing offers investors a clearer view of the plan’s funded position and the underlying drivers of any year‑over‑year movement.",

This represents a transformation in the adjustments' direction and magnitude, indicating a significant change in the company's foreign exchange exposure management related to net investment hedges.",
      "llm_answer": "The translation adjustments on net investment hedges shifted from a $175 million accumulated‑other‑comprehensive‑loss position at the end of 2020 to a $34 million gain by the end of 2021, reflecting a $209 million increase driven by the euro’s depreciation against the dollar. In 2022 this gain was partially offset, resulting in a net $147 million increase in the accumulated‑other‑comprehensive‑income related to net investment hedges (after tax), which translated into a smaller, net positive impact on comprehensive income compared with the earlier years.",

By 2023, The Home Depot provided a more nuanced perspective, explicitly stating that adverse conditions in the housing market, including foreclosure rates, had already 'in some cases adversely impacted' customer behavior. This indicates a shift from a general acknowledgment of potential impact in 2022 to a more concrete recognition of realized effects in 2023, suggesting the company observed tangible changes in customer purchasing behavior linked to housing market conditions.",

In FY23, these costs were reported as 30.9% of Total Net Revenues, amounting to $11,180.6 million.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GILD emphasized that inventory write-off charges were primarily linked to products failing specifications and quality standards, as well as changes in manufacturing strategy, with a focus on potential remediation efforts and costly alternatives. By 2024, the company shifted its emphasis, describing inventory write-offs as part of broader operational risks tied to single-entity dependencies in manufacturing and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), with a stronger focus on supply chain interruptions and their impact on clinical and commercial product availability. This evolution reveals a strategic shift from internal quality and strategy concerns to external manufacturing and supplier risks.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024 Gilead’s inventory‑write‑off discussion shifted from a general note about “changes in our manufacturing strategy” to explicit references to recent impairments tied to clinical‑trial failures (e.g., the EVOKE‑01 and magrolimab holds) and to the need for costly remediation of manufacturing deficiencies cited by the FDA. This evolution reveals a tighter linkage between manufacturing risk disclosures and adverse trial outcomes, signaling that the company is now highlighting how production setbacks and product‑quality issues can trigger material write‑offs and impair its financial results.",

This decline indicates reduced international tax exposure, likely driven by lower foreign earnings ($1,417 million in fiscal 2022 vs. $1,243 million in fiscal 2023) and the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act's 15% minimum tax, which did not materially affect the Company's effective tax rate.

By 2024, the streaming revenue growth rate had slowed to 17%, and the average monthly revenue per paying membership had decreased slightly to $10.96. This indicates a shift in Netflix's pricing strategy, potentially reflecting competitive pressures or changes in content value perception by consumers.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix's average monthly revenue per paying membership (ARM) remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $11.76 in 2022 to $11.70 in 2024 (a 1% decline from 2022 to 2024, but with minimal year-over-year growth). Meanwhile, streaming revenue grew significantly, rising 16% from $31.47 billion in 2022 to $39.00 billion in 2024, driven by both membership growth (16% increase in paid net additions from 2022 to 2024) and strategic price increases.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the total restructuring and related costs for Investor Services were $87 million, composed of $66 million in compensation and benefits, $18 million in occupancy and equipment, and minor amounts in professional services and other categories. In 2024, the total costs increased significantly to $365 million, driven primarily by a substantial rise in compensation and benefits to $214 million and a large increase in other costs to $134 million, with facility exit costs also contributing $13 million. This represents a major transformation in both the magnitude and structure of costs.",
      "llm_answer": "The total restructuring and related costs for Investor Services declined sharply from $365 million in 2023 to $8 million in 2024—a reduction of $357 million (≈ 98 %). This drop reflects a change in composition: 2023 costs were primarily driven by employee compensation and benefits ($214 million) and facility exit costs ($151 million), whereas 2024 expenses consisted almost entirely of a modest $25 million reduction in accrued liabilities and minimal remaining facility‑related outlays, indicating that the bulk of the integration‑related exit spending was completed by the end of 2023.",

In 2024, the company reported a sharp increase in these impairments to $4,180 million, representing a substantial year-over-year increase from the 2023 level. This indicates a reversal of the prior year's downward trend and a significant rise in impairment charges over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "From the 2023 and 2024 10‑K filings, in‑process R&D impairments fell dramatically – from a $2.7 billion charge in 2022 to $50 million in 2023, and then to $4.2 billion of impairment charges recorded in 2024 (with $2.4 billion recognized in Q1 2024 and $1.8 billion in Q3 2024).  Thus, the magnitude of the change from 2023 to 2024 was an increase of roughly $4.2 billion in impairment expense.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for qualified defined benefit pension plans were implicitly included within the company's broader disclosures on funded status, without a detailed breakdown of where these costs were recorded in the income statement. In 2023, LMT explicitly disclosed that the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for these pension plans were recorded in a separate line item titled 'non-service FAS pension income (expense) account.' This indicates a more granular and transparent presentation of pension-related expenses in the financial statements in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Lockheed Martin’s accounting for the non‑service components of its qualified defined‑benefit pension plans shifted markedly. In 2022 the non‑service FAS expense was a negative $1,292 million (i.e., a net expense), but in 2023 it turned positive to $443 million, reflecting a $1,735 million swing driven by lower interest‑cost assumptions, a smaller settlement charge (none in 2023 versus $1.665 billion in 2022), and the amortization of prior‑service credits. Consequently, the presentation of these non‑service amounts moved from being recorded in a “non‑service FAS pension expense (income)” line that showed a net expense in 2022 to a “non‑service FAS income (expense)” line that now reports a net income of $443 million in 2023. This evolution reflects both the impact of the 2021‑2022 group‑annuity settlements and the subsequent remeasurement of benefit obligations and plan assets in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the backlog at year-end was $34,949 million, and by 2023, it increased to $37,726 million, indicating a growth in the company's order book. This suggests that LMT experienced an increase in new orders or delays in fulfilling existing orders, which could signal stronger future revenue potential assuming the company can execute on the growing backlog.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the backlog at year-end **decreased from $147.1 billion in 2022 to $135.4 billion in 2021** (as stated in the 2021 document: \"Backlog was approximately $135.4 billion and $147.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020\"). This decline primarily resulted from \"prolonged negotiations for F-35 production contracts resulting in lower orders in 2021.\" The decrease in backlog indicates **reduced near-term order fulfillment volume**, which suggests **potential near-term revenue pressure** but does not necessarily reflect long-term revenue potential. The document notes that backlog \"does not include unexercised options or task orders\" and that future revenue depends on contract execution, but the 2021 decline specifically points to weaker new orders in key programs like F-35, which could constrain short-term revenue growth despite stable or increasing backlog in later years (e.g., 2023 backlog increased to $60,156 million in Aeronautics).",

By 2023, this revenue had decreased to $5,466 million, accounting for only 13.9% of total product revenue.

      "original_answer": "Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs increased from $2,357.7 million in 2022 to $11,180.6 million in 2023 in absolute terms. However, as a percentage of Total Net Revenues, these costs decreased from 34.0% in 2022 to 30.9% in 2023. This indicates that despite higher overall spending, the company became more efficient in managing these costs relative to revenue. The decline in the cost ratio suggests improved supply chain performance or cost containment strategies that allowed Starbucks to scale operations more efficiently year-over-year.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Starbucks' Product and Distribution Costs as a percentage of Total Net Revenues decreased from 28.6% in fiscal 2022 to 30.9% in fiscal 2024 (though the 2023 figure is not explicitly stated, the 2022 value is 28.6% and the 2024 value is 30.9%, indicating an increase). However, the document states that this percentage decreased by 80 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 due to pricing and supply chain cost reductions, suggesting improved supply chain efficiency in the most recent period. The key indicator of supply chain efficiency is the reduction in Product and Distribution Costs as a percentage of revenue (80 basis point decrease in fiscal 2024), which reflects better cost management despite inflationary pressures.",

By 2024, the growth pattern had changed significantly, with total Other Aesthetics Sales growing by only 3.7% year-over-year. Specifically, U.S. sales increased slightly to $1,118M from $1,060M (5.5% growth), while international sales declined to $161M from $174M (-7.1% change). This indicates a substantial slowdown in growth momentum for the segment, shifting from rapid expansion to near-stable performance.",

Net revenues for this segment grew from $760 million in 2022 to $1,466 million in 2023 and further to $1,279 million in 2024 (at constant currency), reflecting a 90.2% increase from 2022 to 2023 and 93.0% growth from 2022 to 2024.

By 2023, the category retained most of these items but showed subtle changes: 'electronics' was more specifically defined as 'small electronics,' 'garden and patio' was simplified to 'lawn and garden,' and 'automotive care' and 'postage' were shortened to 'automotive' and 'stamps,' respectively. These changes suggest a slight refinement in categorization and emphasis, though the overall scope of the Non-Foods segment remained largely consistent.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by approximately $1.8 billion. In 2023, this figure decreased to $1.6 billion. This represents a $200 million decline in the favorable impact of profit booking rate adjustments year-over-year, suggesting a moderation in the degree of positive revisions to contract cost estimates or an increase in unfavorable adjustments during 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of profit booking rate adjustments on segment operating profit shifted from a $1.8 billion increase in 2022 to a $1.6 billion increase in 2023, indicating that while favorable profit adjustments continued to boost earnings, their contribution was slightly lower in 2023. This modest decline reflects the cumulative effect of risk retirements and improved contract performance across segments, suggesting that Lockheed Martin’s contract execution remained strong but faced slightly less favorable profit adjustments compared with the prior year.",

      "question": "How has Walmart's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through its International Segment evolved between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, and what impact has this had on its consolidated financial performance?",
      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's International Segment had $19.2 billion in assets held for sale, primarily related to its operations in the U.K. and Japan, which were subsequently closed. This indicated a strategic shift in international operations, though the segment still played a significant role. By fiscal 2024, the International Segment generated approximately 18% of Walmart’s consolidated net sales, highlighting its continued importance. However, the 2024 report noted that unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations were adversely affecting the reported performance of the International Segment and, consequently, Walmart’s consolidated results. This evolution shows that while the segment remained a substantial contributor, its exposure to currency risk had become a more explicitly stated financial vulnerability, with a direct negative impact on consolidated performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through its International Segment has evolved significantly between fiscal 2022 and 2024. In fiscal 2022, the Company disclosed that approximately 50% of its cash and cash equivalents were held outside the U.S., with currency fluctuations adversely affecting reported results, particularly in international operations. By fiscal 2024, the Company continued to manage currency risk through hedging instruments, including cash flow hedges for non-U.S. debt, but the impact of exchange rate movements remained a material risk factor. This exposure contributed to volatility in consolidated financial performance, as unfavorable currency translations reduced the reported value of international assets and earnings, directly impacting the Company's consolidated net income and cash flow statements. The cumulative effect of these fluctuations was evident in the declining trend of international segment goodwill (from $28.167 billion in fiscal 2021 to $25.752 billion in fiscal 2022) and the reclassification of international operations to held-for-sale, which further amplified currency-related financial risks.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, content amortization increased by $1,423 million due to the expansion of existing and new content, including more exclusive and original programming. This increase was a major driver of the overall rise in cost of revenues. By 2024, the focus had shifted toward the complexity and subjectivity of the amortization methodology itself, with Netflix emphasizing the judgment involved in estimating future viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. The company also implemented more rigorous internal controls and audit procedures to validate the assumptions and data used in amortization modeling, indicating a more refined and risk-aware approach to managing content amortization.",
      "llm_answer": "Netflix's content amortization methodology—capitalizing content costs and amortizing them over estimated viewing periods based on historical and forecasted consumption patterns—remained consistent between 2022 and 2024, but its financial impact evolved significantly. In 2022 (as reflected in the 2022 10-K), content amortization grew at a slower rate than revenue growth (19% revenue increase vs. lower amortization growth), partly due to pandemic-related delays in content releases, which reduced amortization expense as a percentage of revenue (from 62% in 2019 to 58% in 2021). By 2024, as reflected in the 2024 10-K, the company reported $21.0B in cost of revenues (including content amortization), with amortization continuing to grow but at a pace that still lagged revenue growth, maintaining a lower cost-of-revenue percentage (58% in 2021 vs. 62% in 2019). The methodology for estimating amortization remains based on viewing patterns, but the pandemic's lingering effects and shifting content release schedules have refined the accuracy of these estimates, directly influencing the timing and magnitude of amortization expense.",

      "question": "How has Costco's approach to square footage growth in international markets evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about its global expansion strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Costco noted that square footage growth was 'generally higher in foreign markets due to the smaller base in those markets' and expected this trend to continue. In 2023, this observation remained consistent, with the company reiterating that 'certain operations in the Other International segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth.' However, the 2023 filing added more emphasis on the strategic importance of international expansion by highlighting that these markets have 'lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales' and 'less or no direct membership warehouse competition.' This indicates that while the company maintained its focus on international square footage growth, it increasingly framed this strategy in terms of cost advantages and market opportunity. The evolution suggests a more deliberate shift toward leveraging international markets not just for growth, but for operational efficiency and competitive positioning.",
      "llm_answer": "Costco’s international square‑footage growth slowed in 2023 relative to 2022, with only 2 new warehouses opened in Canada and 7 in other international markets versus 22 U.S. openings in 2022; the company noted that “our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue,” but the modest increase in comparable sales excluding currency and gasoline effects (11% total in 2022 versus 5% in 2023) indicates that expansion is becoming less of a primary growth driver and more reliant on comparable‑sales performance. This shift suggests Costco is moving toward a more balanced global strategy that emphasizes leveraging existing international footprints and e‑commerce rather than aggressive square‑footage expansion.",

However, by fiscal 2024, Membership and Other Income had declined to $1,408 million from $1,621 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a reversal in the earlier growth trend. This suggests a potential weakening in the performance or appeal of Walmart’s membership programs during this period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, XOM used observable quoted prices primarily for equity securities held in separate accounts and relied on observable inputs of comparable market transactions for corporate, government, and asset-backed debt securities. In 2024, the company expanded the scope of observable quoted prices to include non-U.S. equity securities and specifically added government debt securities traded on active exchanges. Additionally, in 2024, XOM introduced a new category for cash balances subject to withdrawal penalties, which are treated as level 2 inputs. This indicates a more detailed and nuanced approach in 2024, with increased specificity in the application of observable quoted prices across a broader set of assets.",
      "llm_answer": "XOM's reliance on observable quoted prices for fair value measurement of debt and equity securities remained consistent in scope and specificity from 2023 to 2024, with no material change in methodology. For non-U.S. equity securities held in separate accounts, fair value continued to be based solely on observable quoted prices on active exchanges (Level 1), while corporate, government, and asset-backed debt securities consistently relied on observable inputs of comparable market transactions (Level 2), as explicitly stated in both 2023 and 2024 disclosures. The documentation confirms this approach was unchanged, with no expansion or contraction in the use of observable market inputs across the reporting periods.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA was placing non-cancellable inventory orders at least twelve months in advance due to supply shortages, which increased product costs and the risk of excess inventory or charges if demand declined. By 2023, NVIDIA had increased supply and capacity purchases with existing suppliers, added new vendors, and entered into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements. While lead times for certain components were shortened, the company still faced risks related to inventory provisions or impairments if commitments exceeded actual demand. This indicates a shift from reactive long-term commitments to a more expansive and strategic investment in supply chain capacity, albeit with increased complexity and execution risk.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, NVIDIA’s approach to long-term supply commitments evolved to address extended lead times and heightened supply constraints. In 2022, the company typically placed orders with approximately six months’ lead time, but by 2023, it began placing orders at least twelve months in advance to secure capacity and mitigate shortages. This shift involved entering into non-cancellable inventory orders, paying premiums for supply, and making long-term capacity commitments—actions that increased product costs and financial risk exposure, including potential excess inventory or impairments if demand fell short. While this strategy aimed to ensure supply continuity, it also amplified vulnerability to demand volatility and macroeconomic shifts.",

On an adjusted basis, the increase was from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024.

However, when adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations, the metric increased by $149 million, or 2%, compared to 2023. This change was driven by higher premiums in Korea and Australia, along with increased fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, which were partially offset by declines in premiums from Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products.",

This reduction was driven by lower premiums in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products, partially offset by growth in Korea and Australia. In contrast, Latin America saw a 4% increase in adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues (from $5,727 million to $5,936 million), fueled by strong sales and persistency in Mexico and Chile, while EMEA revenues rose 9% (from $2,346 million to $2,548 million) due to growth in corporate solutions, credit life, and accident & health businesses across Turkey, Romania, the Gulf, the U.K., and Egypt.",

By 2024, the total revenue contribution from Venclexta increased to $2,583 million, representing a growth rate of 12.9% compared to 2023.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the non-service components of FAS income (expense) for qualified defined benefit pension plans were part of the accumulated other comprehensive loss, with actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recognized due to differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation. By 2023, these non-service components were explicitly recorded in a separate line item called 'non-service FAS pension income (expense)' within the consolidated statements of earnings, indicating a shift in how these expenses were categorized and reported financially.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the non‑service components of FAS income (expense) for Lockheed Martin’s qualified defined benefit pension plans shifted from a net expense of $1.058 billion in 2022 to a net income of $0.443 billion in 2023, reflecting lower interest‑cost outlays, a smaller settlement charge, and a modest gain from amortization of prior‑service credits.  This improvement was offset partially by a $168 million actuarial loss recognized in 2023, but overall the non‑service portion moved from a significant expense to a modest income over the two years.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart recorded impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the Walmart International segment, primarily due to the write-off of one of Flipkart's fashion trade names, Jabong.com, as part of a strategic shift toward focusing on Myntra.com. By fiscal 2024, the nature of financial risk for Walmart International had evolved from internal strategic asset impairments to a more external and ongoing exposure to adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations. Specifically, the 2024 filing highlights that unfavorable currency exchange rate movements would 'adversely affect the reported performance' of the international segment and notes that such fluctuations have already impacted results. This represents a shift from one-time strategic write-offs in 2022 to sustained financial risk from macroeconomic factors by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart International's exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related financial risks remained significant between fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2024, as evidenced by its ongoing operations in multiple countries where local currencies are subject to volatility. While the provided documents do not explicitly quantify the change in exposure over this period, they highlight that international operations generated approximately 18% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2025 (with fiscal 2024 likely similar), and unfavorable currency fluctuations have historically materially adversely affected reported results, particularly for the Walmart International segment. The company continues to manage this risk through hedging strategies and monitoring, but the inherent volatility in international markets persists as a key financial risk.",

In contrast, by fiscal year 2023, the company noted that additions to product warranty liabilities primarily related to the Compute & Networking segment, indicating a growing financial exposure tied to product warranties rather than acquisition-related goodwill.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements were described as a component of 'Other revenues' and were specifically tied to marketing and selling consumer packaged goods using the McDonald's brand. The 2023 filing also mentioned that the company provided an 'insignificant amount' of assistance, including royalty relief, to certain franchisees impacted by the war in the Middle East. By 2024, the description of brand licensing remained consistent as part of 'Other revenues,' but the company noted it provided only an 'immaterial amount' of assistance, including royalty relief or deferral of cash collection for certain franchisees. This indicates a slight evolution in the framing of financial assistance, suggesting a minor reduction in support or a shift in how the company assessed the materiality of such aid in the context of global events.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, McDonald's brand licensing arrangements continued to emphasize a heavily franchised model, with franchised restaurants representing approximately 95% of global locations in 2023 and 95% in 2024. The company generates revenue through royalties (based on a percentage of sales) and initial fees from these arrangements, with minimal direct capital investment under developmental licenses. Financially, this structure provides stable, predictable cash flow driven by franchisee sales performance. However, the 2023–2024 period saw negative impacts on Systemwide sales and revenue in International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segments due to the war in the Middle East, which began in October 2023 and continued into 2024, offsetting some growth in other segments.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Bristol-Myers Squibb's GTN sales adjustments were influenced by factors such as legal interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, historical experience, payer channel mix (e.g., Medicare or Medicaid), current contract prices, unbilled claims, processing time lags, and inventory levels in the distribution channel. The company also emphasized its compliance with the SEC Consent Order, which included procedures for limiting sales to direct customers and estimating inventory levels using internal and external data from U.S. wholesalers. By 2024, the GTN sales adjustments included additional details on external rebate programs in non-U.S. countries, such as cost caps, volume discounts, outcome-based pricing, and pricing claw-backs. The company also expanded its use of external information sources, including third-party market research data and written/oral inventory updates from wholesalers, and highlighted limitations in relying on such third-party estimates and timing lags. This indicates a broader and more detailed approach to GTN adjustments, especially in international markets and data integration.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Bristol‑Myers Squibb’s GTN sales‑adjustment methodology remained anchored in estimating inventory at U.S. wholesalers via weekly DSA data, but the approach grew more sophisticated.  In 2022 the company relied primarily on projected prescription demand, historical inventory experience and basic third‑party market‑research data; by 2024 it was integrating more granular sell‑through metrics, broader external market‑research inputs, and refined extrapolation techniques for non‑top‑three wholesalers, while still using the same underlying Consent‑order‑driven inventory‑estimation framework.  The core external data sources—wholesaler inventory reports, third‑party demand forecasts and internal prescription‑volume models—were unchanged, but the 2024 process applied them with greater granularity and a more robust analytical model to improve the precision of GTN adjustment estimates.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Coca-Cola did not mention labor unrest or risks associated with manufacturing facilities impacting net operating revenues. The 2022 filing primarily described how net operating revenues were generated through concentrate and finished product operations, with no explicit mention of labor-related risks. However, in 2023, the company explicitly stated that strikes, work stoppages, or labor unrest at major manufacturing facilities or bottling operations could impair the ability to supply concentrates and syrups, which could reduce net operating revenues and expose the company to customer claims. This represents a new risk factor introduced in 2023 related to labor disruptions affecting revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 filing expands the labor‑risk discussion to explicitly cite “strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest” as a material threat to the Company’s ability to supply concentrates and syrups to bottlers and to maintain net operating revenue, whereas the 2022 version only mentioned productivity initiatives and their potential negative impact on operations without directly referencing labor unrest.

In 2023, this accounting treatment remained unchanged, continuing to be reported under 'other non-operating income (expense), net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. Therefore, there was no change in the accounting treatment for these components between the two years.",

This indicates a slight increase in the company's estimated exposure to product liability and insurance losses over the period. The reserves are based on reported claims and actuarial estimates for incurred but not reported losses, suggesting that either the frequency or severity of claims may have increased compared to historical levels.",

By 2023, the company's outstanding inventory purchase and long-term supply and capacity obligations had significantly increased to $16.1 billion as of January 28, 2024.

Additionally, on an adjusted basis, income from equity investments rose from $239 million in 2023 to $242 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "HD's merchandise inventories increased significantly from $30 million in fiscal 2022 to $110 million in fiscal 2023, representing a $80 million increase. This indicates a strategic shift toward building higher inventory levels, likely in response to supply chain challenges and efforts to 'continue to meet the demand environment' as mentioned in the 2022 filing. The significant increase suggests HD prioritized inventory availability to ensure product supply to customers, even at the cost of higher short-term working capital commitments.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, HD's merchandise inventory levels increased significantly between fiscal years 2022 and 2023. In fiscal 2022 (ending January 28, 2023), inventory was $63.1 billion, rising to $69.7 billion in fiscal 2023 (ending January 27, 2024), representing an increase of approximately $6.6 billion. This growth occurred despite the company's stated strategy of investing approximately $3 billion in capital expenditures to support operations and meet demand, indicating that HD is intentionally building inventory levels to capitalize on sustained consumer demand and supply chain dynamics. The company explicitly cited \"higher merchandise inventories resulting from our efforts to continue to meet the demand environment\" as a key factor driving working capital changes in its cash flow analysis.",

However, in 2024, the company expanded its disclosure by formally integrating Systemwide Sales into its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A), providing a detailed definition and linking it directly to franchisee health, loyalty programs, and as a driver of franchised revenues. This evolution indicates a strategic shift from merely setting goals around Systemwide Sales (2023) to institutionalizing its measurement and transparency (2024), reflecting a more mature and data-driven approach to managing and leveraging system performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2024 filing shows a shift in how McDonald’s frames Systemwide Sales: the 2023 filing (pages 26‑30) emphasizes that Systemwide Sales are a key metric for gauging the health of the entire franchise system and for comparing performance across the global network, whereas the 2024 filing (pages 5‑9) presents Systemwide Sales as part of a broader set of constant‑currency performance measures (alongside comparable sales, operating income and free cash flow) and ties it directly to the company’s strategic growth pillars. This evolution signals a strategic emphasis on using Systemwide Sales not just as a reporting metric but as a concrete indicator of progress toward the Accelerating the Arches strategy—particularly in driving comparable sales growth, expanding the digital and delivery network, and expanding the global restaurant footprint.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022-2023 period, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia decreased by $377 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year, and when net of foreign currency fluctuations, the decrease was minimal at $5 million. This was driven by declines in annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products in Japan, partially offset by higher premiums in Korea. In contrast, for 2023-2024, Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues decreased by $212 million, or 3%, compared to 2023, but net of foreign currency fluctuations, there was an increase of $149 million, or 2%, driven by growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency life and annuity products, partially offset by declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products. Thus, while the reported revenue decline slowed from 5% to 3%, the underlying performance net of currency effects improved significantly, shifting from a slight $5 million decline to a $149 million increase.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in Adjusted Premiums, Fees and Other Revenues in Asia showed a 5% decline in 2023 versus 2022, driven by decreases in Japan (annuity, accident & health, and yen-denominated life products) partially offset by growth in Korea. In 2024, revenues fell 3% on a reported basis but rose 2% on a constant currency basis, with premium growth in Korea and Australia and fee income from Japan's foreign currency products offsetting declines in Japan's accident & health and yen-denominated life products. Foreign currency fluctuations had a muted impact in 2023 ($5 million net decrease), while in 2024, currency weakness in Japan and Korea reduced earnings by $34 million, though constant currency growth of 2% was observed.",

      "question": "How has the strategic positioning of Humira relative to newer immunology products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq evolved between the 2022 and 2024 annual filings, particularly in the context of biosimilar competition?",
      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, Humira's global sales increased by 4% in 2021, with U.S. sales rising 8% due to market growth across all indications, though international sales declined 13% due to biosimilar competition. Skyrizi and Rinvoq are highlighted as gaining market share and contributing to revenue growth, with Rinvoq benefiting from expanded regulatory approvals. By the 2024 filing, while no specific sales figures are provided, Humira is described in a broader product overview context without mention of growth metrics, and Skyrizi and Rinvoq are not explicitly referenced. This suggests a shift in strategic emphasis toward the broader immunology portfolio, likely in response to biosimilar pressures on Humira.",
      "llm_answer": "Between the 2022 and 2024 filings, Humira's strategic positioning shifted from being the dominant immunology product to facing intensified biosimilar competition, particularly internationally. While Humira revenues grew 8% in the U.S. in 2021 due to market growth, this was \"partially offset by slightly lower market share following corresponding market share gains of Skyrizi and Rinvoq.\" Internationally, Humira revenues declined 13% in 2021 \"primarily driven by direct biosimilar competition,\" signaling a clear strategic shift where newer products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq are gaining share in key markets despite Humira's continued growth in the U.S. This dynamic underscores the evolving competitive landscape as biosimilars challenge Humira's global dominance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, LLY disclosed that the retiree health benefit plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets, but did not provide specific asset composition details. By 2024, LLY provided a detailed breakdown of the asset classes for these plans, showing that public equity securities (U.S. and International) totaled $216.9 million and private alternative investments, including hedge funds ($281.2 million) and equity-like funds ($335.1 million), accounted for a combined total of $616.3 million. This evolution indicates a shift toward more granular and transparent disclosure about the asset composition of the retiree health benefit plans.",
      "llm_answer": "The retiree health benefit plan’s asset composition remained dominated by public equity securities and modest private alternative investments, with no material shift in the mix between these categories from 2022 to 2024. Both the 2022 and 2024 disclosures show a stable allocation of roughly 80 % growth assets (primarily public equities) and 20 % fixed‑income, with private alternative holdings (hedge funds, private‑equity‑like funds, and real estate) representing only a small, unchanged portion of the overall portfolio.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEER reported a net income less net loss of $3,558 million, indicating a significant increase from the previous year. By 2024, NEE's 10-K filing projected NEER's capital allocation to be $3,945 million in 2025, sharply declining to $815 million in 2026 and further decreasing in subsequent years. This reflects a substantial downward shift in financial expectations and investment focus for NEER, transitioning from a year of strong reported earnings to a projected multi-year decline in capital allocation.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, NEE's financial expectations for NEER evolved significantly from 2023 to 2024, with net income attributable to NEER increasing dramatically from $285 million in 2022 to $3,558 million in 2023 (as reported in the 2023 10-K), and further supported by the 2024 filing showing a total consolidated net income attributable to NEE of $6,946 million (with NEER contributing $2,299 million). The primary drivers of this growth included $714 million from new investments (particularly wind, solar, and battery storage), $334 million from customer supply and gas infrastructure, and $2,986 million from changes in non-qualifying hedge activity, though these were partially offset by $451 million in other expenses and $1,149 million in NEP investment gains. Capital allocation projections for 2024–2028 show NEER planning $11,045 million in 2025 capital expenditures (including $1,380 million for wind, $4,865 million for solar, and $2,810 million for other clean energy), reflecting a strategic shift toward expanding renewable generation assets while maintaining FPL's regulated infrastructure investments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX recognized revenue on a percentage-of-completion basis for substantially all defense contracts, primarily related to the Raytheon segment, using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. This approach was also applied to certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts. By 2024, the company continued to use the percentage-of-completion method for defense contracts within Raytheon but expanded the explanation to include more nuanced treatment of variable consideration and performance obligations spanning multiple phases of the product life-cycle, such as production, maintenance, and support. Additionally, in 2024, RTX emphasized the allocation of transaction price to distinct performance obligations based on standalone selling prices, which was not explicitly detailed in 2023. This indicates a more structured and granular approach to revenue recognition for long-term contracts in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K excerpts, the revenue recognition methodology for long-term aerospace contracts within the Raytheon segment has evolved in terms of performance obligations satisfied over time as follows:\n\n1.  **Over-time recognition for defense contracts:** Substantially all of Raytheon's defense business revenue (which primarily relates to the Raytheon segment) is recognized over time due to the continuous transfer of control to customers, using a percentage-of-completion basis based on costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion.\n2.  **Contract assets/liabilities impact:** This over-time recognition for U.S. government fixed-price contracts (subject to FAR) generally results in revenue recognized in excess of billings, leading to the presentation of Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, while advance payments in excess of revenue recognized are presented as Contract liabilities.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Lockheed Martin recognized CAS pension cost in each business segment's net sales and cost of sales, with the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment representing the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income and total CAS pension cost, indicating a shift from expense to income in the service cost component under FAS. This evolution suggests a favorable change in the company's pension adjustment dynamics, with CAS pension cost now exceeding the service cost component of FAS pension income to a greater extent than in the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "The net FAS/CAS pension adjustment declined sharply from $2.095 billion in 2021 to $738 million in 2022, reflecting the $1.7 billion non‑cash pension settlement charge recorded in 2021; in 2023 the adjustment further rose to $2.103 billion, driven by a $443 million non‑service FAS pension income and a $1.66 billion operating adjustment, while the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment itself fell from $1.96 billion in 2021 to $1.709 billion in 2022 and then to $1.66 billion in 2023.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 98 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. In contrast, fiscal 2024 saw an increase of 27 basis points in the gross profit rate, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through effective pricing strategies aligned with historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the previous year, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. This represents a significant turnaround from a substantial decline to a modest increase within one fiscal year.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 40 basis points in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024, rising from 23.7% to 24.1%. This improvement was primarily driven by the Walmart U.S. segment, which managed prices aligned with competitive historic gaps and benefited from growth in higher-margin businesses, partially offset by shifts toward lower-margin merchandise categories. The increase was also supported by lapping higher markdowns from the prior year.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that exclusivity assets had an estimated useful life ranging from 5 to 25 years, indicating a general framework for amortization based on contractual rights for new commercial aerospace platforms. By 2024, RTX provided more detailed financial disclosures, reporting that exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled approximately $3.3 billion at year-end, with remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, at approximately $5.5 billion. This evolution reflects a shift from a purely amortization-life-based disclosure to a more comprehensive valuation approach that includes forward-looking financial commitments and impairment assessments tied to the success of underlying aircraft platforms.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, RTX's treatment and valuation of exclusivity assets evolved between 2023 and 2024 as follows:  \n- In 2023, exclusivity assets (commercial aerospace payments for contractual rights on new aircraft platforms) were capitalized when distinct rights were obtained and supported by sufficient incremental cash flows, with amortization recorded as a reduction of sales.  \n- By 2024, the Company continued to capitalize such payments under the same criteria but expanded disclosures to include net exclusivity assets of $3.3 billion (net of accumulated amortization) and remaining commitments of $5.5 billion, emphasizing assessment of recoverability based on future aircraft platform success and aftermarket revenue streams.  \n- Amortization patterns remained non-straight-line, aligning with the economic benefit pattern (e.g., no amortization during development, beginning at full-rate production), though specific 2024 amortization amounts were not detailed in the provided excerpts.  \n- The Company explicitly assessed recoverability of exclusivity assets using assumptions about aircraft platform profitability and future cash flows, with no indication of a material change in amortization methodology between years.",

      "original_answer": "Linde's Total Operating Profit increased from $8,024 million in 2023 to $8,635 million in 2024. This growth was driven by an increase in Segment Operating Profit from $9,070 million to $9,720 million.

These gains were partially offset by reconciling items: cost‑reduction and other charges decreased by $105 million (from $(40) million to $(145) million), and purchase accounting impacts from the Linde AG merger were lower (a reduction of $66 million, from $(1,006) million to $(940) million), collectively contributing to the overall increase in reported operating profit.",

In 2023, these figures increased to $161 million for Series B and $20 million for Series C. This indicates that the recovery mechanism became more effective for both series, particularly for Series C where the increase was more pronounced (from $6 million to $20 million).

      "question": "How did RTX's strategic focus on the Collins segment evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of divestiture plans and transparency around long-term aerospace contract accounting practices?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX was actively pursuing the divestiture of a portion of the Collins segment, specifically the actuation and flight control business, with a proposed sale to Safran S.A. for $1.8 billion, although the transaction was denied regulatory approval by the Italian government. This signaled a strategic intent to reduce or restructure parts of the Collins segment. In contrast, by 2024, the focus shifted toward operational transparency and financial reporting detail, particularly around revenue recognition for long-term aerospace contracts within Collins. The 2024 filing elaborates on the use of percentage-of-completion accounting for these contracts, including the use of incurred costs relative to total estimated costs as a progress metric. This shift indicates a strategic pivot from restructuring through divestiture to enhancing financial disclosure and operational clarity around key performance metrics in the Collins segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX's strategic focus on the Collins segment shifted toward divestiture, exemplified by the planned sale of its Cybersecurity, Intelligence, and Services (CIS) business to Safran for approximately $1.3 billion, which is being accounted for as held‑for‑sale and includes about $700 million of goodwill and intangibles. Concurrently, RTX enhanced transparency around long‑term aerospace contract accounting by disclosing that roughly 45 % of its $196 billion remaining performance obligations (RPO) relate to long‑term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt & Whitney, expected to be recognized over up to 20 years, and by detailing the percentage‑of‑completion revenue recognition methodology for these over‑time contracts.",

In fiscal year 2023, the U.S. Consumer Debit Volume grew to $2,826 billion, reflecting a 6% increase compared to the previous year.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AbbVie had interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges with notional amounts totaling $750 million at December 31, 2021 (referencing 2021 data as the most recent in the 2022 filing), aimed at converting floating-rate interest obligations to fixed rates. By 2024, these contracts had matured in November 2022 and were not renewed, indicating a discontinuation of this specific strategy for managing floating-rate debt. This reflects a strategic shift away from hedging floating-rate obligations through cash flow hedges during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie’s use of interest rate swap contracts designated as cash flow hedges declined substantially from 2022 to 2024, falling from a notional amount of $2.3 billion in 2020 (and still referenced in 2021 filings) to $750 million at December 31 2021, and then to $3.5 billion in 2024 (down from $5.0 billion in 2023). This reduction reflects a strategic shift toward managing floating‑rate obligations through other mechanisms—such as the repayment of floating‑rate term loans, refinancing of term facilities, and the issuance of fixed‑rate senior notes—rather than relying primarily on cash‑flow swaps to convert floating rates to fixed. Consequently, the company’s floating‑rate interest‑obligation management now depends more on direct debt repayments and less on derivative hedging to stabilize cash‑flow exposure.",

By 2024, the segment experienced a 33% revenue decline, dropping from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $3.6 billion in 2024, attributed to customer inventory normalization. Additionally, while the 2023 report emphasized the segment’s strategic importance and product breadth, the 2024 report noted a shift in focus toward Data Center and Client segments as the primary growth drivers, indicating a relative de-emphasis of the Embedded segment in AMD’s strategic narrative.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company emphasized that the operating portion of the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment was the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension expense and total CAS pension cost, with a favorable adjustment occurring when CAS pension cost exceeded the service cost component. By 2023, the company refined its disclosure, describing the operating portion of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment as the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (rather than expense) and total CAS pension cost, signaling a shift from an expense to income position under FAS. This reflects a notable evolution in the financial impact of pension accounting differences over the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's treatment and disclosure of CAS pension cost relative to FAS pension income evolved such that in 2022, the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment decreased significantly to $668 million (from $2,095 million in 2020), primarily due to a $1.7 billion noncash pension settlement charge in 2021, while the FAS/CAS operating adjustment (reflecting the difference between FAS service cost and CAS pension cost) also declined from $1,960 million in 2021 to $1,660 million in 2022. This shift was explicitly characterized in the 2022 financial reporting as a result of the pension settlement and related adjustments, with the company noting that the decrease in the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021 was \"principally driven by a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge,\" and the 2022 figures reflect the ongoing impact of this event on the pension accounting reconciliation.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 50 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued growth in lower-margin formats and channels in China and category mix shifts into lower-margin categories. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 20 basis points, driven by supply chain efficiencies, although this was partially offset by ongoing format and channel shifts. This represents a significant turnaround from a decline in 2023 to an increase in 2024, indicating an evolution in gross margin performance.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, rising from 23.5% to 23.7%. The key factors driving this improvement were the Walmart U.S. segment's successful price management aligned with competitive historic gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by shifts in product mix toward lower-margin categories.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Netflix disclosed that obligations for unknown future titles under content agreements were not determinable as of the reporting date and did not provide any forward-looking estimate. However, by 2024, Netflix explicitly stated that while it does not include estimated obligations beyond the known minimum amount, these unknown obligations are 'expected to be significant.' This marks a shift from a neutral disclosure to a forward-looking qualitative warning about the potential magnitude of future liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Netflix’s disclosure of its future content‑acquisition obligations shifted from a broader presentation that included $19.2 billion of total obligations (with $4.4 billion shown as current and $2.6 billion as non‑current on the balance sheet and $12.2 billion off‑balance‑sheet) in the 2022 filing, to a more detailed breakdown in 2023 and 2024 that reports $23.2 billion and $23.25 billion of total obligations respectively, with $4.4 billion and $4.4 billion classified as current, $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion as non‑current, and $17.0 billion and $14.6 billion remaining off‑balance‑sheet. This evolution reflects a continued emphasis on quantifying both the on‑balance‑sheet and undisclosed future licensing/production commitments, while still noting that significant unknown obligations for future titles are expected to be material.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AWS was not significantly impacted by asset-related charges, as impairments and severance costs primarily affected the North America segment, with AWS assets described as consisting mainly of property and equipment and accounts receivable. By 2024, AWS became the primary beneficiary of a strategic change in the useful life assumptions for server and networking equipment, resulting in a $3.2 billion reduction in depreciation and amortization expense and a $2.5 billion benefit to net income. This indicates a shift toward optimizing capital efficiency in AWS infrastructure, moving from passive asset ownership to active lifecycle management to enhance financial performance in cloud operations.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in AWS financial impacts from 2022 to 2024 indicates Amazon is increasingly prioritizing capital efficiency and ROI discipline in its cloud business, as evidenced by strategic useful-life adjustments (e.g., shortening server lifespans from 6 to 5 years in 2025 and retiring hardware early) that directly reduce depreciation expenses and free up capital for reinvestment. This reflects a maturing approach to capex management—optimizing infrastructure longevity and cost structure to sustain AWS’s dominant growth while minimizing non-essential spending, rather than pursuing aggressive expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Visa provided detailed quantitative breakdowns of Total Nominal Volume, including specific dollar amounts for consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial categories across U.S. and international segments, along with percentage changes year-over-year (e.g., Total Nominal Volume was $12,530 billion in 2022, up 11% from $11,334 billion in 2021). In 2023, while Visa continued to define Total Nominal Volume, it did not disclose updated dollar figures or comparative data. Instead, the focus shifted to qualitative disclosures, such as the relationship between service revenue and prior-quarter nominal payments volume, and explanations of data sources and potential updates. This represents a shift from quantitative transparency to methodological explanation without updated volume figures.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Visa's disclosure of Total Nominal Volume (TNV) became more transparent through clearer methodology explanations and expanded reporting details. In the 2022 filing (V_10k_2022.pdf), TNV was defined as the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume, with explicit notes on calculation methods (e.g., U.S. dollar conversion using exchange rates) and components like consumer credit/debit and commercial volumes. The 2023 filing (V_10k_2023.pdf) retained this structure but added more granular growth metrics (e.g., constant-dollar basis adjustments) and clarified how nominal volume relates to service revenues. While TNV itself wasn't directly quantified in the provided pages, the evolution is evident in the increased detail around volume components, growth rates, and methodological consistency, reflecting improved transparency in disclosing how volume metrics drive revenue recognition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the company anticipated that its cash requirements related to ordinary course purchases of goods and services would be consistent with past levels relative to revenues. By 2024, the company disclosed that it had entered into agreements that could require payments of up to $14 billion if specified amounts of goods or services, primarily related to incretin medicines, are not purchased over the durations of the agreements, which are generally up to 8 years. This indicates a significant shift from a stable outlook to a much larger financial commitment tied to supply agreements, driven by expansion in manufacturing capacity and contract manufacturing arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's anticipated cash requirements related to purchases of goods and services have remained broadly consistent with historical levels relative to revenue, but are now being shaped by new strategic investments and contractual obligations. While past cash needs were primarily tied to ordinary purchases, capital equipment, and routine milestone payments, the company now anticipates significantly higher outlays for new manufacturing capacity (including over $1 billion for a U.S. injectable facility and >400 million € for an Irish biologics site) and for contractual commitments tied to its incretin medicines, which could require up to $14 billion in payments if minimum purchase thresholds are not met. These commitments, together with increased debt issuance and larger share‑repurchase programs, reflect a shift toward more aggressive capital deployment, even as the company continues to manage working‑capital needs tied to payroll, clinical trials, taxes and other operational expenses. The change is driven by the need to expand production capacity for high‑growth products, secure supply‑chain commitments, and fund the company's expanded pipeline and ESG‑focused projects.",

      "question": "How did Apple's net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days evolve between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about its short-term financing strategy?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Apple reported net repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days amounting to $2,645 million, while in 2024, the company no longer disclosed any activity in this category, indicating a strategic shift away from issuing longer-term commercial paper. This suggests Apple streamlined its short-term financing to focus exclusively on instruments with maturities of 90 days or less, such as the $3,960 million in net proceeds reported in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, Apple's net proceeds from commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days were negative $2,645 million in 2023 and negative $1,309 million in 2022, but the document does not provide a specific figure for 2024. The 2024 data shows only proceeds from maturities of 90 days or less ($3,960 million) and no separate line item for maturities greater than 90 days in the \"Total proceeds from/(repayments of) commercial paper, net\" column, indicating no significant net activity in that category during 2024. This suggests Apple's short-term financing strategy relies primarily on short-term commercial paper (maturities under 90 days) rather than longer-term paper, with the negative net proceeds in prior years reflecting repayments exceeding new issuances. The company maintains substantial liquidity through its $10.0 billion commercial paper outstanding as of September 2024, but the absence of a 2024 figure for >90-day maturities indicates minimal use of this specific financing channel.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's gross profit rate decreased by 98 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to markdowns and merchandise mix in the U.S., higher supply chain costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment. In contrast, in fiscal 2024, the gross profit rate increased by 27 basis points, driven by the Walmart U.S. segment through managing prices aligned with competitive historic price gaps and lapping higher markdowns from the prior year, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower-margin categories.",

      "question": "How has RTX's Raytheon segment evolved in terms of its financial disclosures and contract revenue recognition practices between 2023 and 2024?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, RTX disclosed that it was evaluating the impact of new segment reporting standards (ASU 2023-07), which required expanded segment disclosures including segment expenses and interim reporting of segment profit or loss and assets. Additionally, RTX announced the planned sale of its Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within the Raytheon segment for approximately $1.3 billion, with related assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. By 2024, RTX provided detailed revenue recognition practices for its Raytheon segment, emphasizing that substantially all defense business revenue is recognized over time using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This reflects a shift from preparatory disclosures about upcoming standards to concrete implementation of those standards and more transparent reporting of performance obligations and contract accounting practices.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, RTX's Raytheon segment saw a significant shift in financial disclosures and contract revenue recognition practices. The 2024 10-K (page 78) expands segment reporting requirements under ASU 2023-07, mandating detailed disclosures of segment expenses and composition of profit measures, while the 2023 filing (page 77) reflects the prior period's less granular reporting. Additionally, revenue recognition practices evolved: Raytheon recognized a $102 million net operating profit benefit in Q4 2024 from reserve and contract loss adjustments on Middle East contracts (page 80), and recorded a $575 million charge in Q2 2024 related to terminating a fixed-price development contract (page 81), demonstrating how contract modifications and terminations directly impact revenue timing and recognition.",

      "question": "How did Intel's competitive positioning and product strategy in DCAI evolve between 2023 and 2024 to reverse the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics into a growth trend?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by increasing hyperscaler purchasing power, internal semiconductor development by cloud providers, and abstraction of hardware in cloud services, which made it harder to differentiate products and led to order volatility. These factors eroded Intel's competitive position and adversely affected DCAI results. However, in 2024, Intel reversed this trend by focusing on high core count server products that increased average selling prices (ASPs), despite lower volume. This strategic shift in product mix, aimed at optimizing for performance and customization needs of cloud service providers, contributed to a 1% increase in DCAI revenue year-over-year. The internal foundry operating model also took effect in 2024, aiming to improve cost efficiency and product competitiveness, which likely supported this strategic pivot.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel reversed the negative revenue impact from hyperscaler dynamics by shifting its DCAI product strategy toward AI‑optimized, high‑core‑count server CPUs and expanding its AI accelerator portfolio (e.g., Gaudi 3), which drove a 1 % revenue increase in DCAI in 2024 despite a 60 % drop in Intel Foundry external revenue. This focus on customized, performance‑centric solutions for cloud and enterprise customers restored growth momentum in the DCAI segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, NFLX reported total content obligations of $23,161,360, with $10,019,306 due in the next 12 months and $13,142,054 beyond that period. By 2024, while no direct numerical update was provided, the company disclosed qualitative changes in how it accounts for content obligations, including more nuanced treatment of non-cancelable commitments, licensing of future titles, and obligations tied to creative talent agreements. This indicates a shift from purely quantitative disclosure to a more strategic and forward-looking explanation of content liabilities, suggesting increased complexity in content acquisition and production planning.",
      "llm_answer": "NFLX's content obligations rose sharply from $21.7 billion at the end of 2023 to $23.2 billion by the end of 2024, reflecting a $1.5 billion increase in current and non‑current liabilities and an estimated $1‑$4 billion of unrecorded future commitments. This expansion signals that the company is aggressively acquiring, licensing and producing more original and third‑party titles—especially originals that require upfront cash outlays—while continuing to front‑load spending before amortizing the assets over their shorter availability windows. Consequently, the strategy underscores a shift toward greater investment in proprietary content to drive subscriber growth and differentiate the service, even as it pressures near‑term cash flow.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Amazon highlighted the general uncertainty in tax accruals due to the complexity of tax laws, audits, and controversies across jurisdictions, but did not specify any particular high-profile dispute. By 2024, the company disclosed a specific ongoing tax dispute with the Indian tax authority over cloud services fees, where the authority asserts that such fees are subject to tax in India. Amazon is contesting this, but an adverse outcome could result in additional payments for both current and prior periods. This evolution shows a shift from a more general risk disclosure to a concrete example of a material tax controversy affecting accrual adequacy.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Amazon’s disclosures regarding tax accruals shifted from a general focus on the inherent uncertainty of tax positions to a more detailed articulation of specific controversies and risk factors. In the 2022 filing, the company emphasized that its effective tax rate could be affected by changes in business operations, acquisitions, investments, and the relative amount of foreign earnings, but it only broadly referenced “tax controversies” without naming jurisdictions or issues. By the 2024 filing, Amazon explicitly cited a concrete example—India’s assertion that tax applies to U.S.-based cloud‑service fees paid to Amazon—and noted that it is contesting this position, while also highlighting ongoing investigations in multiple jurisdictions and the potential for additional tax assessments or penalties. Consequently, the newer disclosure adds specificity about the factors driving uncertainty (e.g., evolving global tax frameworks, revenue‑based taxes on online marketplaces, and country‑specific disputes) and underscores that the final outcome of these tax controversies could materially affect its tax expense and cash flows.",

      "question": "How did the role and estimation methodology of patient assistance program costs in revenue recognition evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's financial exposure to these programs?",
      "original_answer": "In 2023, patient assistance program costs were a key component of sales rebate and discount accruals, with a 5% change in the consolidated sales return, rebate, and discount liability impacting revenue by approximately $615 million. By 2024, these costs remained a significant part of the accruals, but the company emphasized a more structured expected value approach to estimate these liabilities. This evolution suggests an increased focus on precision in financial exposure management related to patient assistance programs.",
      "llm_answer": "The company's patient assistance program costs were initially accrued as part of sales return, rebate, and discount liabilities, with adjustments made to the accrual estimates over time to reflect actual program costs and changes in sales trends. In 2024, the methodology for estimating these costs remained consistent but was refined to incorporate updated historical data and program-specific assumptions, ensuring more accurate matching of expenses to related revenues. This approach indicates that while the company maintains a structured estimation process, its financial exposure to patient assistance programs remains subject to variability due to evolving program participation and cost structures, though the impact on overall earnings is mitigated by the relatively small proportion of adjustments relative to total revenue.",

In 2024, this increased to $109.6 billion, representing a slight growth in dollar terms, while the Products Gross Margin percentage rose to 37.2%. The increase in gross margin was attributed to cost savings, although this was partially offset by a different product mix and weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Intel's DCAI revenue was negatively impacted by the competitive environment and a shift in customer spending toward GPUs, which affected platform ASPs and market share. By 2024, this trend reversed, with DCAI revenue increasing by 1%, driven by higher server revenue from high core count products, which increased ASPs despite lower volume. This indicates that Intel's product strategy, particularly around high-performance server CPUs, helped mitigate some competitive pressures and stabilize the DCAI business unit's performance.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in DCAI revenue performance between 2023 and 2024 reflects Intel's deteriorating competitive positioning in the data center market, as evidenced by a 1% year-over-year revenue increase that was outpaced by stronger growth in client computing (CCG) and driven by competitive pressures from AMD, NVIDIA, and ARM-based solutions. This modest growth occurred amid significant market share erosion from GPUs and ARM architectures, with DCAI's revenue growth being offset by lower ASPs and volume compared to 2023, while the company's strategic shift toward AI accelerators like Gaudi 3 and Jaguar Shores highlights its attempt to regain competitiveness in a rapidly evolving data center landscape dominated by GPU adoption.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed that cost pass-through contributed positively to sales growth, accounting for a 2% change in sales variance. By 2023, the company emphasized that its long-term contracts provided not only cash flow stability but also the ability to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, indicating a strategic reinforcement of this mechanism. This shows that cost pass-through evolved from being a minor contributing factor to a more integral and positively framed component of Linde’s contractual and pricing strategy.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Linde’s cost‑pass‑through mechanism shifted from modestly boosting sales (3% in 2021) to actually reducing reported sales by about 3% as energy‑cost variances were contractually billed to onsite customers, yet it had minimal effect on operating profit. This change reflects a more aggressive contractual strategy that leverages pass‑through provisions to protect margins while adjusting pricing and volume dynamics across the Americas, EMEA and APAC segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, vendor allowances—primarily volume rebates and co-op advertising allowances—were described as reducing the carrying cost of inventory and were recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory was sold. These allowances were accrued as earned, particularly those tied to purchase levels, over the incentive period. By 2023, the focus shifted to the net presentation of inventory cost, which included acquisition costs, freight, and import costs, but was stated to be net of certain vendor allowances. This indicates a more direct impact on inventory valuation in 2023, where vendor allowances were factored into the gross inventory value before applying the lower of cost or market (LCM) or net realizable value (NRV) tests. The change reflects a more integrated treatment of vendor allowances in inventory valuation in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of vendor allowances in inventory valuation remained consistent between fiscal 2022 and 2023, as both years explicitly state that vendor allowances not reimbursing specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are included in cost of sales and reduce the carrying cost of inventory when earned. However, the impact of these allowances on inventory valuation evolved in terms of scale and accounting nuance: while the 2022 10-K (page 52) describes vendor allowances as reducing inventory carrying costs upon attainment of purchase levels, the 2023 10-K (page 46) further clarifies that these allowances are accrued as earned over the incentive period based on purchase estimates and specifically identifies them as reducing inventory cost \"net of vendor allowances\" in the cost of sales definition. This evolution reflects a more precise articulation of how allowances are accrued and recognized in relation to inventory valuation, though the core accounting treatment remained unchanged.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, Taltz revenue in the U.S. increased by 6%, driven by higher demand, while revenue outside the U.S. rose by 23%, primarily due to increased volume, despite lower realized prices in both regions. By 2024, Taltz generated $2,152.3 million in U.S. revenue and $1,108.1 million from outside the U.S., totaling $3,260.4 million, which represents an 18% increase compared to 2023. This indicates sustained growth in both regions, with continued volume gains offsetting pricing pressures.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, Taltz revenue increased by 11% in 2023 (from $2,482.0 million in 2022 to $2,759.6 million in 2023), driven by increased demand in both the U.S. (up 6%) and outside the U.S. (up 23%), partially offset by lower realized prices in the U.S. In 2024, Taltz revenue grew an additional 18% (to $3,260.4 million), driven by higher realized prices in the U.S. and increased demand internationally.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, NEE disclosed that the non-qualifying hedge category could have a significant impact on NEER's results due to the lack of economic offset in the financial statements, as the related physical asset positions were not marked to market under GAAP. By 2024, the description remained consistent, emphasizing that the unrealized mark-to-market impact of non-qualifying hedges continued to cause earnings volatility, with the same mechanism of economic offset through unmarked physical assets. While the qualitative description remained stable, the continued emphasis on 'could be significant' in both years indicates that the financial impact of the non-qualifying hedge category remained material and volatile, with no explicit quantitative change provided.",
      "llm_answer": "The non‑qualifying hedge category’s effect on earnings volatility has narrowed from 2023 to 2024 as the economic offset mechanism involving physical asset positions has become more effective at dampening mark‑to‑market swings. Consequently, the volatility contributed by these hedges to NEE’s adjusted earnings has declined.",

      "original_answer": "The one-time income tax charge related to the State Aid Decision remained consistent at $10.2 billion net in both 2023 and 2024. However, while the 2023 disclosure framed this as a new charge impacting the 2024 tax rate compared to 2023, the 2024 disclosure reflects that this charge had fully materialized and remained a key factor in maintaining a higher effective tax rate compared to the statutory federal rate. Thus, the nature of the charge itself did not change, but its impact transitioned from being prospective in 2023 to realized in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of the one‑time income‑tax charge tied to the State Aid Decision was a $10.2 billion net charge recorded in 2024. This charge lifted Apple’s effective tax rate from 14.7 % in 2023 to 24.1 % in 2024, and the company explained that the higher rate was driven primarily by that one‑time charge, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share‑based compensation. Consequently, the effective tax rate increased sharply between 2023 and 2024 due to the State Aid Decision charge.",

In contrast, the operating income rate increased by 83 basis points in fiscal 2024, driven by lapping those prior-year charges and improvements in business performance. This represents a significant turnaround in the company's operating income trajectory.",

This growth was primarily driven by higher operating income ($27,012 million in 2024 vs. $20,428 million in 2023) and lapping prior-year charges related to opioid legal settlements ($3.3 billion) and international restructuring ($0.8 billion), which had previously inflated operating expenses as a percentage of sales.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron's disclosures around Properties, Plant and Equipment were primarily limited to listing the note reference in the financial statements without detailed discussion of impairment triggers or sensitivity. By 2024, the company significantly expanded its disclosure, providing a detailed explanation of the impairment assessment process, including specific triggering events such as downward revisions in reserves, changes in commodity price outlook, and regulatory shifts related to environmental laws. The 2024 filing also elaborated on the complexity of sensitivity analyses due to the large number of assumptions involved, such as carbon costs, production profiles, and the pace of the energy transition—factors not explicitly highlighted in 2022. This represents a transformation in the depth and specificity of impairment-related disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Chevron’s discussion of impairments for Properties, Plant and Equipment consistently emphasizes that impairment reviews are triggered by events such as significant reserve revisions, downward price outlooks, or regulatory changes, and that the impairment calculations rely on management’s estimates of future undiscounted cash flows, commodity prices, production profiles, and carbon‑related costs. The company’s 2024 disclosures note that these estimates involve “highly uncertain matters” and that sensitivity analyses are not practical due to the broad range of assumptions. Earlier 2022 disclosures similarly highlight the use of proved reserves and cash‑flow models but do not introduce new factors; the evolution is a greater focus on carbon‑intensity targets and the integration of climate‑related considerations into the impairment methodology rather than a change in the core calculation approach.",

      "llm_answer": "Netflix's streaming revenues grew from $29.5 billion in 2022 to $33.0 billion in 2024, reflecting an increase of roughly $3.5 billion over the two‑year period. In 2024, foreign‑exchange hedging contributed about $124 million of hedging gains that were recorded directly in streaming revenue, helping to offset adverse currency movements and modestly boosting reported streaming income.",

Correspondingly, the weighted-average exercise price increased from **$130.23 (2023)** to **$144.81 (2024)**, reflecting a rise of **$14.58 per share**.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax-related adjustment impacting EBIT-adjusted consisted of a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets due to Cruise tax reconsolidation. In 2023, the adjustment also included a tax benefit, but this time related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This shift indicates a geographic and contextual change in the nature of tax-related adjustments affecting EBIT-adjusted, moving from a Cruise-related U.S. tax event in 2022 to a Korea-focused tax event in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The EBIT-adjusted adjustments impacting GM's results evolved significantly from 2022 to 2023, with tax-related items playing a key role. In 2023, the company recorded $1,865 million in adjustments (including $563 million in income tax expense and $1,035 million for voluntary separation programs), while 2022 had $2,125 million in adjustments (including $1,888 million in income tax expense and $657 million related to the Russia exit). The tax impact of these adjustments was materially different, with 2023's tax expense ($563 million) being substantially lower than 2022's ($1,888 million), reflecting a lower effective tax rate (5.4% vs. 16.3%) and tax benefits from adjustments like the release of valuation allowances in Korea. This resulted in a significantly lower adjusted effective tax rate of 15.7% for 2023 compared to 2022's 20.2%.",

      "question": "How has the financial outlook for AMT's future growth and expansion initiatives evolved between 2022 and 2023, particularly in light of changing liquidity risks and impairment charges?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMT highlighted liquidity risks tied to capital markets volatility and the potential inability to raise capital, which could hinder funding for future growth and expansion initiatives. By 2023, these risks were compounded by a $322.0 million goodwill impairment charge related to the India reporting unit, signaling a material decline in the unit's fair value and directly negatively impacting the company's ability to pursue growth initiatives. This evolution reflects a worsening financial outlook for expansion efforts due to both external market pressures and internal asset devaluations.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, American Tower's financial outlook for growth and expansion initiatives became more constrained due to heightened liquidity risks and impairment charges. The company faced reduced flexibility in distributing excess cash flow under its securitization structures, particularly when DSCR ratios approached or fell below trigger thresholds (e.g., 1.30x), which could lead to cash traps and amortization periods that diverted excess cash to debt repayment rather than growth investments. Simultaneously, the company recorded a $322 million goodwill impairment charge in late 2023 related to its India reporting unit, reflecting deteriorating cash flow expectations from tenants amid regulatory changes in India. This impairment, coupled with rising interest rates and inflationary pressures that increased borrowing costs, significantly limited the company's ability to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, and expansion initiatives while maintaining REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations. The convergence of these factors forced a more cautious approach to growth, prioritizing debt reduction and liquidity preservation over aggressive expansion.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, variable rebates and incentives were described as being tied to customer performance metrics such as volume thresholds and were recorded as a reduction of gross revenue when volume- and transaction-based revenues were recognized. By 2024, these variable rebates and incentives had grown in importance, representing a portion of the $28.2 billion in total net revenue. Additionally, the 2024 filing highlights that the estimation of variable rebates involves significant management judgment based on forecasted transactions, card issuance, and conversion volumes, leading to increased auditor scrutiny and classification as a critical audit matter. This indicates a transformation in both the scale and complexity of how variable rebates and incentives are managed and reported.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of variable rebates and incentives has evolved such that they are now recognized as contra-revenue when variable, with the Company recording them as a reduction of gross revenue primarily when volume‑ and transaction‑based revenues are recognized over the contractual term. This contrasts with earlier periods where such incentives were more likely to be capitalized or treated differently, requiring a higher degree of management judgment to estimate customer performance and forecast volume thresholds. Consequently, the level of management judgment required to assess the impact of these variable rebates and incentives on net revenue has increased, particularly in evaluating forecasted transaction volumes and performance metrics.",

In 2023, this figure decreased by $64 million, or 12%, resulting in an operating profit of $409 million. This decline was primarily driven by lower sales, including the impact of terminated or suspended projects in Russia, which accounted for approximately $894 million in sales in 2022 and only $238 million in 2023.

      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Netflix's paid net membership additions increased from 8,903 (2022) to 41,350 (2024), representing a 363% growth. The percentage change from 2022 to 2024 was calculated as (41,350 - 8,903) / 8,903 × 100 ≈ 363%. This growth reflects a significant acceleration compared to the 2021-2022 period, where additions were 18,181 (2021) vs. 27,831 (2020), showing a 50% decline year-over-year. The 2024 figure marks the strongest net membership addition growth in recent years, driven by global expansion and pricing strategies.",

This indicates that IBM maintained a consistent audit timeline, completing the audit of the financial statement schedule just before the end of February in both years, with only a one-day shift in the exact date of the report.

      "question": "How did the geographic sources of tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about shifts in GM's international tax positioning?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders were driven by the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets resulting from Cruise tax reconsolidation. In 2023, the adjustment stemmed from a tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets considered realizable in Korea. This geographic shift—from an internal restructuring event in the U.S. (Cruise) to a regional tax realization in Korea—suggests GM strengthened its international tax position, particularly in Asia, while stabilizing its domestic tax asset base.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, the geographic composition of tax adjustments to Net income attributable to stockholders shifted markedly: the 2022 adjustments were heavily concentrated in the Americas (e.g., $1.057 bn for Cruise restructuring, $657 m for Russia exit, $100 m for patent royalties, $194 m for Brazil indirect‑tax matters, and $175 m for Cadillac dealer strategy), whereas the 2023 adjustments moved toward Asia and Europe (e.g., $1.035 bn voluntary separation program in the U.S., $569 m for Buick dealer strategy, $478 m for Cruise restructuring, $106 m negative impact from GM Korea wage litigation, and $111 m from India asset sales). This reallocation reflects GM’s strategic pivot away from its prior focus on Brazil, Korea and Russia toward cost‑reduction initiatives and divestitures in India and Europe, indicating a recalibration of its international tax positioning to emphasize North‑American operational efficiency and to mitigate exposure in emerging‑market jurisdictions.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PayPal disclosed that ROU lease assets were being measured at fair value due to impairment charges that occurred in 2020, with impairment losses calculated using estimated rental income per square foot derived from observable market data. By 2024, PayPal's ROU lease assets had increased significantly to $599 million for operating leases and $73 million for finance leases as of December 31, 2024, up from $390 million for operating leases in 2023 (no finance leases reported then). This indicates a notable expansion in PayPal's leasing activities, particularly in finance leases, suggesting a strategic shift toward longer-term commitments and potentially more capital-intensive operations.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's Right-of-Use (ROU) lease assets increased from $390 million at the end of 2022 to $599 million at the end of 2024, reflecting new lease additions ($343 million in 2024 and $131 million in 2022) and modest growth in operating lease liabilities, while the company continues to adopt short‑term lease exemptions and record finance‑lease assets separately. This upward trend indicates that PayPal is expanding its real‑estate and data‑center footprint—primarily through operating leases—while maintaining a relatively stable lease‑expense profile and a disciplined approach to lease accounting.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the company considered historical rebate payments, patient assistance program costs by product as a percentage of historical sales, and evaluated current contracts, sales trends, and product pricing when estimating rebate accruals. By 2024, while historical rebate payments remained a key input, the estimation methodology evolved to include an 'expected value approach' for accruals, and the company expanded its consideration to include government rebate budget forecasts in large European countries, reflecting a more nuanced and diversified evaluation process.",
      "llm_answer": "The role of historical rebate payments in estimating sales rebate accruals has expanded in 2024 to incorporate more granular, product‑specific data and forward‑looking trend analysis. While the 2023 estimation relied primarily on aggregate historical rebate payments and broad sales‑trend factors, the 2024 process adds detailed tracking of managed‑care, Medicare, Medicaid, and charge‑back rebates by product, and explicitly adjusts for significant changes such as patent expirations and new product launches. This more precise use of historical rebate experience, combined with updated contract evaluations, improves the accuracy of the accrual estimates and reduces the variability of revisions to prior‑period accruals.",

By 2024, the breakdown showed a significant shift, with $3,945 million allocated for 2025, followed by a sharp decline in subsequent years (e.g., $815 million in 2026, $250 million in 2027).

In contrast, in 2024, DCAI revenue increased by 1%, driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs but lowered volume compared to 2023. This shift indicates a stabilization and slight recovery in DCAI's performance, supported by a strategic focus on higher-value offerings despite ongoing volume challenges.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, DCAI revenue increased 1% (from the prior year’s decline), driven by higher server revenue from high‑core‑count products that boosted ASPs and offset lower volume. The prior‑year decline had been 20% in 2023 due to a softening CPU data‑center market, partially mitigated by higher ASPs from a lower‑mix of hyperscale‑related revenue and higher‑core products. Thus, the trajectory shifted from a 20% drop in 2023 to modest growth in 2024, reflecting improved demand in the data‑center segment and pricing gains.",

In fiscal 2024, the same metric increased by 46 basis points, driven by lower fuel sales and elevated technology spend. This represents a shift from cost efficiency linked to sales growth in 2023 to cost pressures from operational investments in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 9 basis points in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily driven by higher variable pay due to exceeding planned performance. Conversely, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 25 basis points in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, driven by strong sales growth and lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by increased wage costs.",

      "original_answer": "The 309% increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders from $3,231 million in 2022 to $13,219 million in 2023 was primarily driven by a significant non-recurring gain or adjustment not reflected in earnings from continuing operations. While earnings from continuing operations increased modestly by 21% (from $1,886 million to $2,286 million), the net earnings figure spiked due to an additional $9,988 million gain or adjustment, as evidenced by the large discrepancy between earnings from continuing operations and net earnings in 2023. This suggests a one-time event or accounting adjustment specific to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The 309% increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders from 2022 to 2023 ($3,231 million to $13,219 million) is primarily driven by a $10 billion pretax gain on the sale of a majority stake in the Climate Technologies business and a $2.8 billion pretax gain on the divestiture of InSinkErator, which are recorded in discontinued operations and thus excluded from earnings from continuing operations. Consequently, earnings from continuing operations actually declined by 30% in 2023, falling to $2,020 million from $2,903 million in 2022.",

This indicates a significant growth in the company's long-term tax liabilities over this period, suggesting either increased deferrals or changes in tax regulations or corporate activities affecting deferred tax obligations.",

This growth indicates that Chevron’s long‑term tax liabilities have expanded, driven by higher deferred tax assets and liabilities related to investments, foreign tax credits, and the company’s ongoing restructuring and asset‑sale activities.",

By fiscal 2023, the Treasury Stock Balance had significantly increased to $ (95,372) million, with the company repurchasing $ (8,074) million of its common stock during the year. This indicates a major shift in the company's stock repurchase strategy, moving from a relatively modest buyback in fiscal 2022 to a much more aggressive repurchase program in fiscal 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Home Depot's Treasury Stock Balance decreased from $87,298 million at the beginning of fiscal 2022 to $87,298 million at the end of fiscal 2022 (as shown in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity), but the key change occurred during fiscal 2022 when $6,504 million in share repurchases were made (compared to $3 million in fiscal 2021), reflecting the company's active stock repurchase strategy under its $20 billion authorization. This significant repurchase activity, which reduced the treasury stock balance from $80,794 million to $87,298 million (though the net effect shows an increase due to prior balances), indicates a deliberate and aggressive approach to returning capital to shareholders through buybacks, especially after resuming repurchases in fiscal 2021 following the pandemic-related suspension.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney projected a net benefit of $81 million for pension and postretirement medical costs in fiscal 2023, representing a $428 million decrease primarily due to lower amortization of previously deferred losses. By fiscal 2023, the company noted that the amortization of prior-year service credits was linked to changes in postretirement medical benefit options and projected these costs to be negligible by fiscal 2025. This indicates a significant shift from a short-term net benefit expectation to a long-term near-complete reduction in costs, driven by changes in benefit structure and amortization patterns.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Dermstore sale resulted in a gain of $335 million pretax, which reduced earnings per share by $0.55 for the 2021 fiscal year as disclosed in the 2022 filing. By 2023, there was no further impact from the Dermstore sale, as no gain was reported either pretax or on a per-share basis. This indicates that the financial effects of the Dermstore sale were fully recognized in 2022 and did not carry over into 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of the Dermstore sale on Target’s earnings per share shifted from a $0.55 per share gain in 2021 (reflected in the 2021 Form 10-K’s reconciliation, where the $335 million gain reduced adjusted diluted EPS from $14.10 to $13.56) to no impact in 2023, when the gain was no longer included and adjusted EPS remained essentially unchanged at $8.94. Consequently, the contribution of the Dermstore sale to EPS evolution declined from a noticeable boost in 2021 to a neutral effect in the 2023 reporting.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, CCG revenue decreased by 8% due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of the year. In 2024, CCG revenue increased by 4% driven primarily by higher notebook volume compared to 2023, although this was partially offset by lower desktop revenue due to weaker demand and a decline in other CCG revenue from the exit of legacy businesses. The turnaround from a decline in 2023 to growth in 2024 indicates a recovery in notebook demand and strategic adjustments in the product portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "The trend in CCG revenue shows a decline from $54.2 billion in 2023 to $53.1 billion in 2024, a 2% decrease. The primary drivers of this change were lower notebook volume due to reduced demand across market segments, partially offset by higher desktop ASPs and increased notebook volume in the second half of 2024 as inventory levels normalized. Additionally, the exit of legacy businesses and weaker desktop demand contributed to the overall dip in CCG revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the backlog at year-end was $56,630 million, and by 2023, it increased to $60,156 million. This indicates that the company is receiving more orders than it is fulfilling within the same period, suggesting strong demand and potential for higher future revenue as the backlog is realized.",
      "llm_answer": "The backlog at year-end declined from $147.1 billion in 2022 to $135.4 billion in 2023, with funded backlog falling from $102.3 billion to $88.5 billion. This reduction reflects fewer new firm orders—particularly on F‑35 production contracts—indicating a modest slowdown in order fulfillment, but the company still maintains a substantial pipeline of work. Consequently, while near‑term revenue growth may moderate, the remaining backlog, especially in classified and high‑margin programs, suggests that future revenue potential remains robust, albeit with a shift toward later‑stage deliveries.",

In 2024, the company's total repayment of matured debt increased to $3,373 million, with specific repayments including $1,500 million in April 2024 and $630 million in December 2024. This indicates a significant increase in the volume of debt repayments in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's total repayment of matured debt increased significantly from $4.0 billion in fiscal 2023 to $3.4 billion in fiscal 2024 (as shown in the \"Maturities and Extinguishments\" tables), indicating a more favorable debt maturity profile with less near-term principal obligations coming due. This reduction in near-term maturities (from $4.1 billion due within one year in 2023 to $3.4 billion in 2024) suggests the company is managing its debt profile to reduce near-term refinancing risks, though the absolute repayment amount remained substantial.",

      "original_answer": "The interest rate for weighted-average short-term borrowings decreased from 2.8% in 2022 to 0.4% in 2023. However, this decrease occurred alongside a dramatic reduction in the amount of short-term borrowings, which dropped from $1,599 million in 2022 to just $1 million in 2023. Therefore, while the interest rate itself declined significantly, the company's overall exposure to short-term borrowing costs was drastically reduced in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "The weighted-average interest rate for short-term borrowings increased from 0.1% at the end of 2022 to 2.8% at the end of 2023, indicating a significant shift toward higher-cost short-term financing.

In 2024, this same one-time tax charge of $10.2 billion continued to negatively impact the effective tax rate, which remained higher than the statutory rate due to this charge, along with a higher effective tax rate on foreign earnings and reduced tax benefits from share-based compensation. The magnitude of the tax charge remained unchanged, but its ongoing effect indicates a sustained financial impact from the State Aid Decision.",
      "llm_answer": "The one‑time income‑tax charge of $10.2 billion related to the State Aid Decision raised Apple’s effective tax rate from 14.7 % in 2023 to 24.1 % in 2024, and the company notes that this charge is the primary reason the 2024 effective rate exceeds the statutory 21 % rate and is higher than the 2023 rate.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Linde leveraged its long-term contracts to pass through changes in energy and feedstock costs to customers, contributing to cash flow stability. By 2023, the company explicitly quantified the impact of cost pass-through in its financial reporting, showing a negative 6% variance in sales growth due to this factor. This indicates that while cost pass-through remained a contractual mechanism, it had a dampening effect on reported sales growth in 2023 compared to the more neutral or supportive role implied in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Linde's utilization of cost pass-through mechanisms evolved in response to persistent inflationary pressures, particularly in energy and feedstock costs. While cost pass-through contributed negatively to sales growth (e.g., a 6% drag in the Americas segment), it had minimal impact on operating profit due to offsetting productivity initiatives and pricing gains. This dynamic allowed Linde to maintain strong margin expansion—evidenced by a 15% increase in segment operating profit to $9.07 billion in 2023—while navigating volatile cost environments through proactive pricing and contract adjustments.",

By 2023, the financial disclosures indicate a shift: while the Asia Theme Parks were still included in the consolidated borrowing figures, the presentation separates borrowings 'Before Asia Theme Parks Consolidation' and shows specific Asia Theme Parks borrowings as distinct. For example, total borrowings including the Asia Theme Parks amounted to $45,101 million in 2023, compared to $43,809 million before including them, indicating a $1,292 million contribution from the Asia Theme Parks. This structured separation suggests a more transparent or modified reporting approach compared to 2022, where the Asia Theme Parks were fully consolidated without such a detailed breakout.",
      "llm_answer": "Disney's financial relationship with the Asia Theme Parks has shifted from consolidation to deconsolidation between 2022 and 2023. In 2022, the Company consolidated the Asia Theme Parks (Hong Kong and Shanghai Resorts) as variable interest entities under its management agreements, but by 2023, these entities were no longer consolidated, as reflected in the reduced interest expense and borrowings related to the Asia Theme Parks ($1,292 million in 2022 vs. $1,164 million in 2023 for interest payments, and $45,815 million total borrowings vs. $46,431 million in 2022). This deconsolidation is further evidenced by the absence of Asia Theme Parks borrowings in the 2023 long-term debt schedule and the removal of their segment operating income contributions, marking a strategic shift away from consolidating these investments.",

      "original_answer": "The growth rate of Room Nights booked on BKNG's platform decreased from 66.4% in 2020 to 2021 to 51.6% in 2021 to 2022, indicating a moderation in the pace of recovery or expansion of bookings during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The growth rate of Room Nights booked on BKNG's platform slowed from 66.4% in 2021 (compared to 2020) to 51.6% in 2022 (compared to 2021), indicating a deceleration in booking growth as the post-pandemic recovery progressed. This suggests that while travel demand remained strong in 2022, the pace of increase in reservations was significantly lower than the surge observed in 2021, reflecting a potential market saturation or diminishing momentum in the rebound of travel activity.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, PayPal disclosed that TPV growth was directly impacted by the number of payment transactions enabled on its platform, and that transaction revenues were typically correlated with TPV growth. By 2024, PayPal reported TPV increasing from $1.53 trillion in 2023 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, a 10% increase. This TPV growth trajectory indicates a positive trend in transaction revenue potential, as TPV is a key driver of transaction fees from merchants. The sustained increase in TPV across the filings suggests that PayPal's platform usage and merchant transaction volume were expanding, which would directly support revenue growth in line with the correlation described in the 2022 filing.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's TPV grew from $1.25 trillion in 2021 to $1.68 trillion in 2024, reflecting a 33% increase from 2021 to 2022 and a 10% rise from 2023 to 2024. This upward trajectory in TPV, coupled with steady growth in payment transactions and active accounts, signals that the company’s transaction revenue is expanding in line with broader platform activity, supporting a positive growth trajectory for transaction‑related revenue.",

      "question": "How did the contribution of average transaction amount to comparable sales change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about Target's pricing strategy and consumer response during these periods?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, the average transaction amount contributed positively to comparable sales growth with a 0.4% increase, indicating that consumers were spending slightly more per transaction. However, in 2023, the average transaction amount decreased by 1.4%, becoming a drag on comparable sales performance. This shift reveals a change in consumer behavior where shoppers were spending less per visit, potentially due to economic pressures or changes in purchasing habits. Target responded with strategies such as offering 'attractive everyday price points on key items' and 'compelling promotions' to drive traffic, suggesting a shift toward value-oriented pricing to counteract declining transaction sizes.",
      "llm_answer": "The contribution of average transaction amount to comparable sales growth shifted dramatically between 2022 and 2023, revealing a fundamental change in Target's pricing strategy and consumer response. In 2022, average transaction amount contributed +15.0 percentage points to the 12.7% comparable sales growth (driving 12.3% traffic growth), but in 2023 it contributed only +1.4 percentage points to the -3.7% comparable sales decline (amid a 2.4% traffic decline), indicating Target shifted from relying on price increases to aggressive discounting and value-driven promotions to stimulate demand. This pivot reflects a strategic response to weakening consumer spending, as evidenced by the 1.4% decrease in average transaction amount in 2023 – the first negative contribution since the metric's inception – signaling consumers prioritized essential categories (like Beauty & Household Essentials and Food & Beverage) over discretionary spending, forcing Target to adjust its pricing and promotional approach to maintain sales momentum.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Chevron attributed effective tax rate volatility primarily to 'mix effects' influenced by the absolute level of earnings or losses and their geographic distribution across tax jurisdictions. The company emphasized that a decline or increase in the effective tax rate might not indicate future results. By 2024, the explanation remained centered on 'mix effects' but placed additional emphasis on the impact of earnings volatility without reiterating the geographic component as explicitly. Instead, the 2024 disclosure focused more broadly on the non-indicative nature of tax rate changes and linked the discussion to broader financial reporting in Note 17 Taxes, signaling a subtle shift in framing from geographic mix to general earnings volatility.",
      "llm_answer": "Chevron’s explanation of the drivers behind its effective‑tax‑rate volatility shifted markedly between 2022 and 2024. In the 2022 filing (pages 33‑37), the company highlighted “mix effects” tied to absolute earnings levels and the tax‑rate environment of the jurisdictions where earnings arise, noting that “a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods.” By the 2024 filing (pages 36‑40), the language broadened to stress that the effective tax rate can change “substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility” and that such volatility stems from both the magnitude of earnings and the mix of earnings across high‑ versus low‑tax jurisdictions, while also adding explicit references to new tax‑related risks—e.g., the OECD’s 15 % global minimum tax (Pillar Two) and evolving ESG‑related disclosure rules. Thus, the 2024 disclosure places greater emphasis on external regulatory developments and the uncertainty they create, whereas the 2022 version focused more narrowly on earnings‑mix effects and historical tax‑rate behavior.",

By 2024, the company continued to face similar risks but emphasized a more pronounced focus on the complexity of complying with inconsistent international regulations, suggesting that the regulatory environment had become more challenging.

      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, Linde's estimated revenue from minimum purchase requirements decreased from approximately $57 billion to $48 billion, reflecting a reduction in the projected consideration tied to future minimum purchase obligations (excluding Russian projects subject to sanctions). The 2022 disclosure highlighted that this $57 billion estimate excluded sales above minimum requirements and was subject to factors like contract timing, inflation, currency rates, and energy pass‑through costs, while the 2023 update similarly notes the $48 billion figure excludes Russian projects impacted by sanctions and cites comparable external factors affecting future revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One's adjusted operating efficiency ratio was 44.53%, while in 2024 it improved to 42.35%. This indicates a meaningful shift in the company's cost management, as adjusted operating expenses rose more slowly than adjusted net revenue—growing from $15,251 million in 2022 to $16,574 million in 2024, while adjusted net revenue increased from $34,250 million to $39,139 million over the same period. This trend suggests improved operational efficiency and better alignment of expenses with revenue generation.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One's operating efficiency ratio improved from 43.27% in 2022 to 42.35% in 2024, indicating enhanced cost management relative to revenue growth.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Humira generated worldwide net revenues of $21.237 billion, reflecting its dominant position in the immunology market. By 2024, total worldwide sales of Humira had declined to $8.993 billion, representing a decrease of 36.9% at constant currency rates compared to 2022. This significant drop in sales follows the expiration of Humira's key patents, which began in 2016 in the U.S. and 2018 in the EU, leading to increased competition from biosimilars and eroding its market exclusivity.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Humira's global net revenues declined sharply—down 37% in 2024 (with a 41% drop in the U.S. and 13% internationally)—driven by the loss of patent exclusivity and direct biosimilar competition after its key patents expired (U.S. composition-of-matter patent expired Dec 2016; EU patent expired Oct 2018). This steep decline signals a major erosion of Humira's market position, as it had previously accounted for ~37% of AbbVie's total net revenue in 2021, forcing the company to rely more heavily on newer products like Skyrizi and Rinvoq to offset the loss.",

In 2023, the company maintained the same general disclosure but added that these transactions could also result in the company making additional contributions to the pension trust, indicating a more detailed articulation of the financial risks involved. While the core risk remained consistent, the 2023 disclosure expanded on the potential dual impact of additional contributions and noncash charges.",
      "llm_answer": "The 2023 10‑K disclosure shows that Lockheed Martin continues to hold pension risk‑transfer transactions that can generate noncash settlement charges, but it no longer presents the detailed quantitative discussion of those charges that appeared in the 2022 filing.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2023, Walmart's operating expenses rate increased by 23 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to opioid-related legal settlement charges and restructuring costs in the Walmart International segment. In contrast, for fiscal 2024, the operating expenses rate decreased by 60 basis points, driven by the absence of those prior-year charges, particularly the $3.3 billion opioid-related settlements and $0.8 billion restructuring expenses. This represents a significant turnaround in the trend of operating expenses relative to net sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Walmart's operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased from 21.0% in fiscal 2023 to 20.4% in fiscal 2024, a 60-basis-point improvement.

By 2024, the cumulative 'Day 2' ongoing impact was being calculated using the same 25% scaling factor, but the phase-in had progressed to 75% phased in by 2024, with full phase-in expected by 2025. This indicates that the capital impact evolved from an initial delayed implementation in 2022 to a more advanced phase-in stage by 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 the CECL transition spreads the regulatory‑capital impact of the new credit‑loss standard over a five‑year phase‑in.  The “day‑2” ongoing effect is scaled by a uniform 25 % factor, with 25 % of that impact added back in 2022, 50 % in 2023, 75 % in 2024 and 100 % (fully phased‑in) thereafter.  Consequently, the capital‑impact delay was fully in place for 2022, and each subsequent year sees an additional 25 % of the cumulative CECL adjustment counted toward regulatory capital until it is completely phased in by the end of 2024.",

      "question": "How has Intel's strategic approach to its NAND memory business evolved between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about its broader capital allocation priorities?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel referenced the divestiture of its NAND memory business as part of its capital allocation strategy, indicating a shift toward investing in its IDM 2.0 strategy and away from non-core businesses. By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as an active segment, and instead, Intel emphasized its focus on new business areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and external foundry services through IFS. This evolution indicates a continued strategic realignment toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing capabilities, while exiting businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's strategic approach to its NAND memory business shifted decisively between 2022 and 2023, marked by the **completion of the divestiture of its NAND memory business** (announced in October 2020 and finalized by 2021, with cash impacts reflected in 2023 financials). This move was part of a broader capital allocation strategy prioritizing **investment in core growth areas** (e.g., foundry services, AI, and process technology) over legacy non-core businesses. The company explicitly stated that capital allocation would shift \"more heavily toward investing in the business\" (e.g., IDM 2.0 capacity expansion) and away from share repurchases, while **divesting non-core assets like NAND memory** to streamline focus. This reflects a clear prioritization of **high-growth, strategic investments** (e.g., foundry services, advanced packaging, and AI accelerators) over maintaining a presence in commoditized memory markets, signaling a decisive reallocation of capital toward Intel's future competitive advantages.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Capital One converted $223 million of revolving loans to term loans in the domestic credit card portfolio. By 2024, the company reported a total domestic credit card loan portfolio of $155.618 billion, with $7.053 billion in total delinquent loans. This indicates a shift from proactive loan conversion strategies in 2022 to a focus on delinquency management in 2024, suggesting evolving credit risk dynamics in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "Capital One’s treatment of revolving loans in the Domestic Credit Card Portfolio shifted from net balance reductions in 2022 to net increases in 2023 and 2024, reflecting a change in how modifications were structured. In 2022, the portfolio showed $0 gross balance reduction from TDR modifications, but by 2024, $1.1 billion in balance reductions were recorded, indicating growing use of balance reductions as a delinquency mitigation tool. Additionally, $223 million in revolving loans were converted to term loans in 2021 and $602 million in 2020, primarily in domestic credit card and commercial portfolios, showing a strategic move toward term loan structures to improve repayment predictability and reduce risk. Delinquency trends show rising 30–89 day delinquencies in credit cards ($1.575 billion in 2024 vs. $1.547 billion in 2023) and increasing >90-day delinquencies ($3.711 billion in 2024 vs. $3.499 billion in 2023), suggesting that while modifications and conversions are being used, credit quality pressures are intensifying, particularly in the domestic credit card segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Grooming segment accounted for 8% of net sales, indicating its relatively smaller contribution to the company's overall revenue. In 2023, the segment saw high single-digit organic sales growth, which was notably stronger than the company's overall organic sales growth of 4%. This suggests that the Grooming segment outperformed the company average in terms of growth during fiscal 2023, showing an upward trend in its relative importance or market traction.",
      "llm_answer": "The Grooming segment's net sales grew 4% in fiscal 2024 (to $6.654 billion), driven by 8% pricing increases and 1% volume growth, outpacing the company's overall organic sales growth of 4% and the 2% consolidated net sales growth. This indicates Grooming outperformed the broader company trend, as its organic growth (9% when excluding currency) was significantly stronger than the total company's 4% organic growth, reflecting robust performance in key markets like Latin America and Europe.",

      "original_answer": "In FY2023, revenue from customers outside the United States accounted for 69% of total revenue, while in FY2024, this dropped to 56%. This indicates a significant increase in U.S.-based demand for Compute & Networking segment products, which is attributed to higher U.S.-based Compute & Networking segment demand. The shift suggests a growing adoption of NVIDIA's compute and networking solutions within the domestic market, potentially driven by data center expansion and enterprise AI initiatives.",
      "llm_answer": "From FY2023 to FY2024, revenue from NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment grew from $15,068 million to $47,405 million—a 215 % increase—driven primarily by higher Data Center sales, especially of the Hopper GPU platform for AI workloads. This surge indicates a shift in demand toward U.S. markets, as revenue from customers outside the United States fell from 69 % of total revenue in FY2023 to 56 % in FY2024, while U.S.‑based Compute & Networking sales represented 13 % of total revenue and were a key driver of the overall growth. Consequently, demand appears to be concentrating more heavily in the United States, especially within the Data Center/AI segment.",

By 2023, the Personal Safety segment's sales further decreased to $3.487 billion, representing a continued downward trend. This indicates a sustained reduction in the segment's contribution to MMM's overall revenue, suggesting a potential strategic shift or reduced emphasis on this business line.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the Personal Safety segment’s sales declined from $3.916 billion to $3.487 billion (a 10.9% drop), and its business‑segment operating income fell from $2,784 million to $2,692 million (a 3.3% decline), pushing its operating‑income margin down from 23.7% to 20.9%. This reduction in both revenue and profitability signals that 3M is losing ground in the personal‑safety market, likely prompting the company to reassess its strategic focus and possibly reallocate resources away from this segment.",

In contrast, CCG revenue decreased by 8% in 2023 to $54.2 billion due to lower notebook and desktop volume from reduced demand across market segments, although there was some recovery in the second half of the year. The decline in 2023 was also influenced by a higher mix of small core and older generation products, which lowered ASPs, despite some offset from higher desktop ASPs in commercial and gaming segments.",

This performance contrasted with CCG's 1% growth in 2022, which was supported by notebook demand strength and desktop recovery amid industrywide supply constraints.

By 2024, the fair value had declined to $690 million, with $89 million in gross unrealized gains and $5 million in gross unrealized losses. The decline in fair value, coupled with the emergence of unrealized losses, suggests a strategic reduction and potential de-risking from this segment of the portfolio.",

      "question": "How did Intel's relationship with its NAND memory business evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what impact did this have on its financial performance?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel still owned and operated its NAND memory business, which was generating losses of $4,306 million in net revenue and contributing a negative $1,369 million to operating income. By 2023, Intel had completed the sale of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, as acknowledged in the 2023 10-K filing. This strategic exit removed the financial drag of the NAND segment from Intel's operations, allowing the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 strategy and reduce restructuring and operational costs.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel completed the first closing of its NAND memory sale to SK hynix in December 2021 and plans to fully de‑consolidate the NAND OpCo Business in Q1 2022, removing that business from its core operations and long‑term strategy. Consequently, the NAND segment’s contribution to revenue and margin declined (e.g., NAND memory business fell from –$4.3 B in 2021 to –$1.4 B in 2022), and Intel’s non‑GAAP operating margin dropped from 33.4 % in 2020 to 29.7 % in 2021, reflecting the loss of NAND revenue and the associated cost adjustments. This divestiture helped reshape Intel’s financial profile, contributing to a lower GAAP operating margin (24.6 % in 2021) but also enabling the company to focus on its core IDM 2.0 initiatives and improve cash‑flow metrics such as free cash flow, which fell from $21.1 B in 2020 to $11.3 B in 2021.",

This represents a modest growth of $86 million, primarily driven by acquisitions during the year, which added $31 million to the segment's value. Currency translation also positively contributed $55 million. Therefore, the segment remained relatively stable with a minor upward trend.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided document pages, the financial position of the Analytical Instruments segment evolved as follows between 2022 and 2023:  \n- **Revenue growth**: The segment's revenue increased from **$16,067 million (2022)** to **$16,882 million (2023)**, reflecting a **$815 million increase** (approximately 5.1% growth).  \n- **Operating performance**: This growth was driven by expansion in core businesses like Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry, supported by strategic acquisitions (e.g., $31 million in acquisitions for the segment in 2023) and favorable currency translation adjustments ($55 million).  \n- **Net worth impact**: The segment's goodwill balance rose slightly from **$4,965 million (2022)** to **$5,051 million (2023)**, indicating ongoing investment in the segment's strategic value, though the core revenue trajectory remained stable with modest growth.  \n\nThus, the Analytical Instruments segment experienced **measured but positive financial evolution**, with revenue growth of **$815 million** over the period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Reported OCI increased by $409 million (4.1%), primarily driven by higher pricing of $1,688 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,158 million. In 2024, Reported OCI increased by $151 million (1.4%), mainly due to higher pricing that included higher promotional investments, and lower marketing, administration, and research costs by $56 million, partially offset by lower shipment volume of $1,648 million. The magnitude of the OCI increase was significantly higher in 2022 compared to 2024, indicating a decline in the growth rate of OCI over time.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Reported Operating Company Income (OCI) showed a steady upward trend, rising from $10,394 million in 2022 to $10,821 million in 2024. The primary drivers of this growth were higher pricing (including multiple list‑price increases across cigarette and cigar brands) and lower marketing, administration and research costs, which more than offset the decline in shipment volume. While shipment volume fell—total smokeable product shipments dropping from 95,596 million sticks in 2022 to 70,336 million sticks in 2024—the impact on OCI was mitigated by the pricing actions and cost reductions, resulting in modest increases in both reported and adjusted OCI margins over the period.",

However, in fiscal year 2024, Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue and was specifically attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Additionally, an indirect customer estimated to have represented approximately 19% of total revenue in 2024 was also tied to the Compute & Networking segment. This indicates a significant shift toward greater customer concentration in the Compute & Networking segment in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting a more pronounced dependency on major customers for this segment.",
      "llm_answer": "The Compute & Networking segment's strategic positioning shifted from being heavily reliant on a few large customers (e.g., Customer A accounted for 13% of total revenue in fiscal 2024) to maintaining concentrated demand while expanding its market share through growth in Data Center revenue (up 215% YoY), indicating reduced relative customer dependency but continued concentration in key end markets like AI infrastructure.",

By 2023, the company continued to self-insure these benefits but provided more detailed insight into the actuarial estimation process, noting that the estimates incorporated judgment around claim severity, frequency, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. This indicates a more nuanced and detailed approach to estimating liabilities related to employee disability benefits in 2023 compared to 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "The treatment of employee disability benefits remained consistent in both years, with self‑insurance accruals recorded for incurred‑but‑not‑reported claims and no change in the underlying actuarial estimation method. However, the disclosed amounts increased from $5,069 million in 2023 to $5,632 million in 2024, reflecting higher reserves for workers’ compensation, vehicle accidents, property/cargo loss, general liability and short‑term/long‑term disability benefits.

By 2024, Adjusted OCI increased by $212 million (2.0%), again supported by higher pricing and, notably, lower marketing, administration, and research costs ($86 million). However, both years experienced headwinds from declining shipment volumes—$1,931 million in 2022 and $2,528 million in 2024.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx disclosed that it self-insured for property and cargo loss, with accruals based on actuarially estimated costs of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported claims. The company also indicated that it periodically evaluates insurance coverage levels and adjusts them based on risk tolerance and premium expense. By 2023, FedEx provided more detailed insight into its self-insurance reserves, emphasizing that its estimates for property and cargo loss incorporated actuarial assumptions about claim severity, frequency, volume, healthcare inflation, seasonality, and plan designs. The 2023 filing also highlighted sensitivity to changes in accident frequency and severity, healthcare costs, and insurance retention levels, indicating a more refined and dynamic risk exposure management approach compared to the prior year.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, FedEx’s self‑insurance accruals for property and cargo loss remained based on actuarial estimates of incurred‑but‑not‑reported claims, with reserves adjusted for changes in claim severity, frequency, and healthcare inflation; the company continued to self‑insure up to varying limits by operating unit and periodically evaluated coverage levels to manage risk exposure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, General Motors reported indefinitely reinvested basis differences in non-consolidated China joint ventures of $3.4 billion. By 2024, this amount decreased to $1.4 billion. This significant reduction indicates a shift in GM's reinvestment strategy, suggesting that a portion of these previously indefinitely reinvested earnings may no longer be considered permanently reinvested, potentially signaling a strategic move to repatriate or reallocate capital from these ventures.",
      "llm_answer": "The basis differences in GM’s non‑consolidated China joint‑venture investments remained at roughly $3.4 billion in both 2023 and 2024, indicating that GM continues to treat those interests as indefinitely reinvested and therefore does not record deferred tax liabilities on the underlying basis gaps. This stability suggests GM’s reinvestment strategy in China remains focused on maintaining long‑term control of the ventures rather than repatriating earnings.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, FedEx explicitly stated that healthcare inflation was one of the key judgmental factors in estimating self-insurance reserves, indicating its importance in liability projections. In 2023, while the company continued to include healthcare inflation as part of its estimation methodology, it added language emphasizing that it believes its recorded obligations are 'consistently measured and appropriate,' suggesting a more confident stance in its risk assessment. This evolution indicates a shift from a cautious acknowledgment of uncertainty in 2022 to a more assured posture in 2023 regarding the impact of healthcare inflation on self-insurance liabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, FedEx’s self‑insurance accruals grew from $4,535 million to $5,632 million, reflecting a $1,097 million increase. The company explicitly attributes this rise to higher claim severity and other factors, noting that a 5 % change in assumed claim severity would alter reserves by roughly $230 million. This demonstrates that FedEx’s risk‑assessment approach for self‑insurance is highly sensitive to healthcare‑cost inflation and actively adjusts reserves in response to evolving cost pressures.",

      "original_answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, IBM disclosed that pension insolvency insurance premiums outside the United States could negatively impact its financial results. In 2023, the company noted that premium increases could be significant due to the level of insolvencies of unrelated companies in the respective countries. In 2024, IBM repeated the same language, indicating that the risk remained consistent and no material change occurred in the exposure or the underlying factors affecting the premiums. Therefore, the potential financial impact of these premiums remained stable between the two years.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures in IBM's 2023 and 2024 10-K filings, the potential financial impact of pension insolvency insurance premiums on results of operations has evolved as follows: In 2023, IBM highlighted that premium increases for mandatory pension insolvency insurance outside the U.S. could be significant due to rising insolvencies of unrelated companies, potentially negatively impacting financial results. By 2024, the company reiterated this risk in its pension-related disclosures (Item 1A), emphasizing that premium increases remain a concern tied to market conditions affecting unrelated insurers, though no specific 2024 premium changes or financial impact were quantified. The risk persists as a forward-looking exposure, with the company continuing to monitor insolvency trends in the insurance market that could drive future premium hikes. (298 characters)",

The increase in the percentage was primarily due to changes in product mix, including decreases in Veklury product sales globally, which were offset by increased sales in HIV and oncology products, along with shifts in payer mix. Specifically, rebates and chargebacks rose from $12.6 billion (30% of gross sales) in 2022 to $14.3 billion (33% of gross sales) in 2023, contributing to the overall increase in deductions.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, gross-to-net deductions as a percentage of gross product sales increased from 35% to 38%. This rise was driven by changes in product mix, particularly the decline in Veklury sales (which carry lower gross-to-net deduction rates) and the growth in higher-deduction-rate HIV and oncology products. Additionally, payer mix shifts toward more discounted segments and increased use of patient assistance programs contributed to the higher overall gross-to-net deduction rate.",

      "question": "How did RTX's financial relationship with Pratt & Whitney evolve between 2022 and 2024, particularly in terms of asset valuation and credit risk exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX held a direct stake in Pratt & Whitney valued at $1,563 million as of December 31, 2021, with no significant credit loss allowance directly tied to the segment. By 2024, the relationship had shifted from a direct stake to a dependency relationship, with a notable increase in credit risk exposure as evidenced by the $491 million allowance for expected credit losses, driven by a customer bankruptcy at Pratt & Whitney in the fourth quarter of 2024. This marks a significant transformation from a stable asset holding to a risk-influenced dependency.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, RTX's financial relationship with Pratt & Whitney evolved through strategic realignment and asset revaluation following the Raytheon merger. The company recorded significant goodwill adjustments related to Pratt & Whitney's reporting units, including a $3.2 billion goodwill impairment in 2020 tied to pandemic-driven market declines affecting commercial aerospace demand. While Pratt & Whitney's goodwill balance remained relatively stable ($1,563 million in 2021 and $1,563 million in 2024), the company continuously reassessed its fair value using discounted cash flow models, with impairment testing triggering due to deteriorating market conditions. Concurrently, RTX divested non-core assets like its Cybersecurity business (sold in March 2024 for $1.3 billion), reflecting a strategic shift that indirectly impacted Pratt & Whitney's operational context through segment restructuring. Credit risk exposure remained managed through allowance for credit losses ($289 million as of 2024), but the core evolution centered on goodwill valuation adjustments and asset divestitures rather than direct changes in the Pratt & Whitney partnership itself.",

In 2023, Gross Dollar Volume growth slowed to 12% on a local currency basis, yet still supported a 13% increase in net revenue on a currency-neutral basis. This indicates that while the contribution from Gross Dollar Volume weakened year-over-year, other factors likely played a stronger role in sustaining net revenue growth in 2023.",

This GDV growth contributed **approximately 21 % of the 23 % GAAP net‑revenue increase in 2021** (and similarly accounted for the bulk of the 13 % net‑revenue rise in 2023), making it the primary driver of revenue growth in each year.",

This change directly contributed to the deterioration in credit loss reserves during the period.

      "original_answer": "The sales per retail square foot increased from $604.74 in fiscal 2021 to $627.17 in fiscal 2022, representing a 3.7% growth. However, in fiscal 2023, this metric declined by 3.6% to $604.55. This reversal indicates that while the company was able to improve its in-store sales productivity in fiscal 2022, that momentum did not carry into fiscal 2023, suggesting a potential challenge in sustaining productivity gains.",
      "llm_answer": "The 3.6% decline in sales per retail square foot from fiscal 2022 to 2023—following a 3.7% increase in fiscal 2021—indicates a reversal in the upward trend of in-store sales productivity, signaling weakening efficiency in retail space utilization after two years of growth. This decline suggests that Home Depot's in-store sales performance is deteriorating, likely due to softer comparable sales and reduced customer traffic or ticket sizes, despite stable or modestly increasing square footage.",

This growth, driven by strong performance in markets like Italy and Poland, contributed to PMI's regional market share rising to 40.0% (from 38.6% in 2021), indicating a strengthening competitive position in the EU's smoke-free products market despite challenges like the German HTP tax surcharge.",

This higher amortization expense, together with incremental restructuring and other charges, contributed to a decline in operating income and operating‑income margin despite a modest improvement in product gross‑margin percentage. The increase signals that Cisco is investing heavily in acquired intangible assets, but the associated amortization is weighing on profitability.",

      "original_answer": "The carrying value of Cisco's long-term loan receivables decreased from $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2023 to $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2024. This indicates a reduction in the book value of these receivables, suggesting either collections exceeded new loan originations or increased write-downs or impairments during the period.",
      "llm_answer": "The carrying value of Cisco's long‑term loan receivables fell from $2.9 billion as of July 29 2023 to $2.7 billion as of July 27 2024, indicating a modest decline in the company's long‑term financing assets. This reduction suggests that the company's asset valuation in this category has been trimmed, reflecting either repayments, disposals, or a reassessment of the receivables' recoverability.",

By 2024, the company had integrated safety more broadly into its sustainability-oriented solutions, highlighting improvements in 'health, safety, security, environmental impact, and resiliency' as part of its sustainability strategy.

According to the 2023 filing, this represents the company's 'estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs' as of December 31, 2023. The 2023 report also explains that the company uses an actuarial process to estimate these liabilities, considering factors like time from service date to claim processing, seasonal variances, and healthcare cost trends. This indicates that the company's obligation for unpaid medical costs grew year-over-year, and the estimation methodology remained consistent and centrally controlled.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, KO reported net operating revenues of $45.754 billion, reflecting steady growth from $43.004 billion in 2022 and $38.655 billion in 2021. However, the 2024 filing highlights several operational and integration-related risks that could threaten this growth trajectory. Specifically, KO notes that challenges in integrating acquired businesses—such as delays in realizing cost synergies, difficulties in extending internal controls, and potential increases in costs due to integration issues—could negatively affect financial results. Additionally, risks related to third-party service providers failing to meet commitments, labor unrest affecting manufacturing and bottling operations, and the inability to offset cost increases through pricing or productivity initiatives all pose direct threats to maintaining revenue momentum. These risks, if realized, could materially reduce or even reverse the upward trend in net operating revenues observed in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 2024 10-K disclosures, the primary operational and integration-related risks threatening the sustainability of KO's 2023 revenue growth include: (1) The North America restructuring program (completed as of Dec 31, 2023) incurred $65M in pretax expenses recorded in \"other operating charges,\" with $18M specifically impacting North America operating income due to manufacturing restructuring, potentially disrupting operations and affecting future revenue streams; (2) The productivity and reinvestment program, which has generated $4,293M in cumulative pretax expenses since inception, continues to impact operating income (e.g., $165M reduction in 2023 operating income for Corporate), and if not successfully managed could lead to operational disruptions, talent attrition, and reduced efficiency, ultimately threatening future net operating revenue growth. These initiatives, while aimed at streamlining operations, carry significant execution risks that could undermine the company's ability to sustain revenue growth.",

However, by fiscal 2024, the Core Routing portfolio was part of an overall revenue decline in the Networking product category, which fell by 15% ($5.3 billion), including a specific decline in enterprise routing. This shift indicates a deterioration in the Core Routing portfolio's ability to support revenue growth in the Networking category, despite pockets of strength like SD-WAN.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, Cisco’s core networking portfolio—encompassing switching, routing, wireless and servers—saw a **15% revenue decline**, driven by weaker demand in campus and data‑center switching (especially Catalyst 9000 and Nexus 9000) and enterprise routing, despite growth in SD‑WAN. This downturn contributed to a **9% overall product revenue drop**, yet networking still represented **~74% of total product revenue**, underscoring its continued centrality to Cisco’s overall revenue mix even as the category contracts.",

By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had shifted to a positive contribution of 1.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, and 1.0% in 2023 compared to 2022. This indicates a significant reversal in the company's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations, turning a prior headwind into a modest tailwind over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided financial data, the impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth has shifted from a positive contributor in 2021–2022 to a negative drag in 2024. In 2021, currency translation *increased* reported sales by 1.5% due to a weakening U.S. dollar, but by 2024, a strengthening U.S. dollar *decreased* reported sales by 0.5%, directly contributing to the flat year-over-year total sales growth (0% in 2024 vs. 32% in 2021). This indicates the company has become increasingly exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations, with currency headwinds now materially offsetting growth from acquisitions and core sales, particularly in 2024 when it helped suppress total sales despite other positive drivers.",

      "original_answer": "Danaher's core sales growth declined significantly from 23.0% in 2022 to 3.0% in 2024, indicating a substantial slowdown in organic growth performance. In 2022, the company demonstrated strong non-GAAP core sales growth of 23.0%, reflecting robust performance across its business units. By 2024, this growth had slowed to just 3.0%, suggesting a marked decrease in the company's ability to generate organic revenue growth. This shift highlights a notable change in the company's market dynamics or operational performance over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Danaher's core sales growth accelerated from 23% in 2021 (vs. 2020) to 25% in 2024 (vs. 2023), indicating a strengthening trend in organic growth performance. This acceleration reflects improved underlying demand across its segments, particularly in Life Sciences and Diagnostics, despite macroeconomic headwinds, demonstrating that the company's core growth initiatives and market positioning are delivering increasingly robust results over time.",

      "original_answer": "Honeywell's total net repositioning and other charges decreased significantly from $1,266 million in 2022 to $244 million in 2024. This indicates a substantial reduction in restructuring activities over the two-year period. In 2022, the company was actively engaged in repositioning efforts, including workforce reductions, site transitions, and asset impairments across multiple segments. By 2024, these charges had dropped sharply, suggesting that the major restructuring initiatives had either been completed or scaled back.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Honeywell's total net repositioning and other charges declined sharply—from $546 million in 2019 to $575 million in 2020, then to $569 million in 2021, and finally to $244 million in 2024 (as shown in the “Total net repositioning and other charges” rows of the tables). This reduction indicates that the company’s restructuring activities have been scaled back, with fewer severance, asset‑impairment and exit costs recognized, and a greater proportion of prior reserves being reversed to income. Consequently, the company is moving away from large‑scale repositioning initiatives and is focusing more on core operations.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal 2022, Oracle's Cloud Services and License Support Expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses and infrastructure investments made to support the growth in its cloud and license business. By fiscal 2024, these expenses had risen to $8,783 million, reflecting a 21% increase in constant currency compared to fiscal 2023. This indicates a continued and accelerating investment in cloud infrastructure and support functions, aligning with the company's strategic focus on expanding its cloud offerings.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 Oracle’s Cloud Services and License Support expenses rose sharply—from roughly $7.2 billion in FY22 to about $8.8 billion in FY24 (a ~22 % increase). This growth reflects the company’s aggressive investment in expanding cloud infrastructure, adding data‑center capacity and hiring staff to support the surge in cloud‑based license and support contracts. Consequently, the expense trend signals that Oracle is prioritizing scaling its cloud and license business to drive future revenue growth, even as it absorbs higher operating costs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG's cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016 through 2021 totaled $1,439 million. In 2023, the cumulative paid losses for the same accident years increased to $2,055 million. This significant rise indicates a lengthening of the claims settlement timeline, suggesting that AIG is taking longer to settle claims, which could imply either more complex claims or a more conservative approach to claims resolution. This also points to potential reserving implications, as the company may have initially underestimated the ultimate payout for these accident years.",
      "llm_answer": "The cumulative paid losses for accident years 2016‑2021 rose modestly from $1,763 million in 2022 to $1,805 million in 2023, reflecting a slight acceleration in claim payments. This upward trend, together with the noted increase in high‑deductible and risk‑sharing business, suggests that AIG’s claims settlement timeline is extending—losses are emerging more slowly—and that its reserving practices have become more conservative, especially for excess‑of‑deductible and long‑tail lines.",

By 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates had decreased reported sales by 0.5% year-over-year. This indicates that DHR's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations had lessened by 2024 compared to 2022, although the U.S. dollar's strengthening against other major currencies still had a modest negative impact on sales.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, DHR's exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations shifted from a favorable tailwind to a headwind. In 2022, currency translation had a neutral impact (0% effect), but by 2024, the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced reported sales by 0.5%, indicating increased vulnerability to currency movements. This contrasts with 2021, when a weakening dollar boosted sales by 1.5%, demonstrating that DHR's reported revenue growth became increasingly sensitive to adverse currency shifts over the period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Intel had already completed the divestiture of its NAND memory business to SK hynix, indicating a strategic exit from this segment as part of its capital allocation strategy that prioritized investment in core IDM 2.0 initiatives and away from non-strategic assets. By 2023, the NAND memory business was no longer referenced as part of Intel's active operations, and instead, the company emphasized winding down other non-core businesses like Intel Optane, further signaling a sharpened focus on strategic areas such as discrete GPUs, AI accelerators, and its internal foundry model. This evolution reflects a broader strategic shift toward core competencies and advanced manufacturing, while divesting or discontinuing businesses that no longer aligned with long-term objectives.",
      "llm_answer": "Intel's strategic involvement in its NAND memory business concluded with the sale of its NAND memory business to SK Hynix in 2020, as explicitly stated in the \"Acquire and Integrate\" section of the 2023 10-K (p. 52: \"subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end, we completed the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND memory business\"). This divestiture was part of a broader portfolio simplification effort, reflecting Intel's shift away from non-core memory manufacturing toward its IDM 2.0 strategy, which prioritizes foundry services, advanced process technology, and growth in areas like AI, networking, and edge computing. Consequently, Intel's capital allocation now focuses intensely on investing in R&D, manufacturing capacity for its core logic and foundry businesses, and returning cash to shareholders, rather than sustaining unprofitable memory operations, signaling a decisive pivot to high-growth, high-margin segments aligned with its long-term technological leadership.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE reported deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses of $1.0 billion, of which $0.6 billion was associated with losses from discontinued operations, including GE Vernova. By 2024, this figure had decreased to $0.5 billion, with only an insignificant amount tied to GE Vernova. This reduction reflects the tax implications of the spin-off, as GE no longer retained the associated tax benefits from the spun-off entity. The change indicates a significant shift in GE’s deferred tax position following the separation of GE Vernova, reducing the company’s future tax obligations tied to those non-U.S. losses.",
      "llm_answer": "The spin‑off of GE Vernova did not materially change the amount of non‑U.S. net operating loss carryforwards that remain on GE’s balance sheet; the company’s deferred tax assets related to those non‑U.S. NOLs stayed essentially unchanged between 2023 and 2024.  (The 2024 filing shows only a modest decline in the valuation allowance for non‑U.S. NOLs, indicating that the spin‑off did not generate a significant new source of taxable income to offset those losses.)",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 disclosure, cumulative paid losses for accident year 2014 were $466 million and for accident year 2015 were $593 million. In the 2023 disclosure, cumulative paid losses for accident year 2014 decreased to $439 million and for accident year 2015 decreased to $495 million. This indicates a reduction in the claims payout for these older accident years in the 2023 reporting period.",
      "llm_answer": "The cumulative paid losses for accident years 2014 and 2015 increased from $28,412 million in the 2022 disclosure to $28,260 million in the 2023 disclosure—a decrease of $152 million. This reduction reflects that, after accounting for the adverse‑development‑reinsurance (ADC) recoveries, the net amount of paid losses for those older accident years has been trending downward, indicating that AIG’s claims payout for these older years is gradually diminishing.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, currency exchange rates had a negative impact of 1.5% on total sales growth, whereas in 2024, the impact of currency exchange rates shifted to a positive contribution of 1.5% in one period and remained positive at 1.0% in the subsequent period. This indicates a reversal in how exchange rate movements affected the company's reported sales, suggesting a change in the company's geographic revenue mix or hedging strategies.",
      "llm_answer": "The impact of currency exchange rates on total sales growth shifted from a positive 2% contribution in 2021 (driving 2% growth in Life Sciences and Diagnostics) to a negative 0.5% drag in 2024, reflecting the U.S. dollar's strengthening against major currencies. This indicates the company has become increasingly exposed to foreign exchange volatility, with currency movements now acting as a headwind to sales growth rather than a tailwind.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE completed the separation of GE HealthCare through a spin-off on January 3, 2023, and its historical results were reported as discontinued operations. By 2024, GE continued to disclose financial impacts related to GE HealthCare, specifically noting that $0.6 billion of non-U.S. net operating losses associated with discontinued operations at the end of 2023 were reduced to an insignificant amount by the end of 2024. This reflects a significant decrease in the financial exposure or tax implications tied to the previously spun-off GE HealthCare business within GE's consolidated disclosures.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided SEC 10-K filings, the treatment and financial impact of GE HealthCare have evolved significantly between 2023 and 2024. In 2023, GE HealthCare was spun off as a separate entity (completed January 3, 2023), with its results reported as discontinued operations in GE's consolidated financial statements, including a $5.7 billion gain from the sale of retained ownership interests. By 2024, GE HealthCare no longer appears as a reporting segment; its former operations are fully reflected in discontinued operations, with cash flows from discontinued operations now primarily driven by residual activities like down payments on equipment orders from its former business (e.g., GE Vernova). The financial impact shifted from active revenue generation to passive cash flow management, with no material revenue or profit contribution in 2024, as evidenced by the $1.1 billion cash used for operating activities of discontinued operations (up from $0.6 billion in 2023) and the absence of HealthCare-related gains or adjustments in the 2024 consolidated results.",

      "question": "How has the risk profile of American Express's Discount Revenue evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly in relation to merchant surcharging practices and airline merchant exposure?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Discount Revenue was described as American Express’s largest revenue source, primarily earned from transactions at merchants accepting American Express cards, with no specific emphasis on surcharging or airline-related risks. By 2024, the company explicitly noted that surcharging and differential acceptance practices in regions like Australia, Canada, and the EU were materially impacting merchant discount rates and card usage. Additionally, in 2024, the company highlighted a 7% exposure of worldwide billed business to airline merchants, introducing credit risk if airlines fail to deliver services after payments are made. This indicates a shift from viewing Discount Revenue as a stable core income stream to recognizing it as increasingly vulnerable to external pressures such as regulatory changes, competitive dynamics, and sector-specific credit risks.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, American Express's Discount Revenue growth was driven by expanding merchant acceptance and higher transaction volumes, but faced pressure from surcharging and differential acceptance practices that could erode rates. The company specifically highlighted increased exposure to airline merchants (accounting for ~7% of billed business) as a risk, noting that surcharging in certain markets and competitive pressures from Visa/Mastercard could materially impact discount revenue if merchants reduce acceptance or shift to lower-cost alternatives. While 2021 saw 26% year-over-year discount revenue growth due to volume growth, the 2024 risk profile emphasizes that such growth is vulnerable to merchant pricing pressures and regulatory changes affecting surcharging.",

During this period, the gross margin contribution from Products slightly increased from $114,728 million in 2022 to $108,803 million in 2023, while the gross margin from Services grew significantly from $56,054 million in 2022 to $60,345 million in 2023.

      "llm_thought": "Apple's total gross margin percentage increased from 41.8% in 2022 to 43.3% in 2023, driven by improvements in both Products (35.3% to 36.3%) and Services (69.7% to 71.7%) gross margin percentages. The Services segment's contribution to gross margin grew significantly, with its gross margin percentage rising from 69.7% to 71.7% and its absolute gross margin increasing from $56.1 billion to $56.1 billion (though the document shows Services gross margin as $56,054M in 2022 and $56,054M in 2023? Wait, the data shows Services gross margin as $56,054M in 2022 and $56,054M in 2023? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the provided data, the gross margin percentages are:\n- 2022: Products 36.3%, Services 71.7%, Total 41.8%\n- 2023: Products 36.3% (same as 2022?), Services 71.7% (same as 2022?), Total 43.3%\n\nWait, the document shows for 2022: \"Gross margin percentage: Products 36.3%, Services 71.7%, Total 41.8%\"\nAnd for 2023: \"Gross margin percentage: Products 36.3%, Services 71.7%, Total 43.3%\"\n\nBut the question asks about evolution from 2022 to 2023. The data shows:\n- Total gross margin percentage: 41.8% (2022) → 43.3% (2023) → increase of 1.5 percentage points\n- Products gross margin percentage: 36.3% (2022) → 36.3% (2023) → no change\n- Services gross margin percentage: 71.7% (2022) → 71.7% (2023) → no change\n\nBut the document also states: \"Products gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to a different Products mix...\" and \"Services gross margin percentage increased during 2022 compared to 2021 due primarily to improved leverage...\"\n\nFor the 2022-2023 period, the document shows the percentages as unchanged from 2022 to 2023 in the table, but the total gross margin percentage increased from 41.8% to 43.3%. The key is that the Services segment's contribution to the total gross margin increased.\n\nThe document shows:\n- 2022: Products gross margin $114,728M, Services $56,054M, Total $170,782M\n- 2023: Products gross margin $108,803M, Services $60,345M, Total $180,683M\n\nWait, the 2023 numbers are different. The document shows for 2023 (in the \"Gross Margin\" section for 2022, 2021, 2020) it's showing 2022 data. Then later in the \"Gross Margin\" section for 2024, 2023, 2022, it shows 2024, 2023, 2022 data.\n\nFor the 2022-2023 period, we need to look at the first \"Gross Margin\" table which covers 2022, 2021, 2020. But the question is about 2022 to 2023, so we need to look at the 2023 data.\n\nActually, the document has two sections about gross margin:\n1. One showing 2022, 2021, 2020 data (with 2022 as the most recent in that table)\n2. Another showing 2024, 2023, 2022 data (with 2024 as the most recent)\n\nFor the question about 2022 to 2023, we should be looking at the first table that shows 2022, 2021, 2020, but that's not directly comparable. Wait, the question says \"from 2022 to 2023\", so we need the 2022 and 2023 data.\n\nLooking at the document, the first \"Gross Margin\" table shows:\n|                               | 2022      | 2021      | 2020      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross margin percentage:      |           |           |           |\n| Products                      | 36.3%     | 35.3%     | 31.5%     |\n| Services                      | 71.7%     | 69.7%     | 66.0%     |\n| Total gross margin percentage | 41.8%     | 41.8%     | 38.2%     |\n\nBut this is for 2022, 2021, 2020. The question is about 2022 to 2023, so we need to look at the next section which shows 2024, 2023, 2022.\n\nIn the second \"Gross Margin\" table (which shows 2024, 2023, 2022), it shows:\n|                               | 2024      | 2023      | 2022      |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross margin percentage:      |           |           |           |\n| Products                      | 37.2 %    | 36.5 %    | 36.3 %    |\n| Services                      | 73.9 %    | 70.8 %    | 71.7 %    |\n| Total gross margin percentage | 46.2 %    | 44.1 %    | 43.3 %    |\n\nSo for 2022 to 2023:\n- Total gross margin percentage: 43.3% (2022) → 44.1% (2023) → increase of 0.8 percentage points\n- Products gross margin percentage: 36.3% (2022) → 36.5% (2023) → increase of 0.2 percentage points\n- Services gross margin percentage: 71.7% (2022) → 70.8% (2023) → decrease of 0.9 percentage points\n\nBut the question asks about the composition of gross margin contributions from Products and Services. The contribution of each segment to the total gross margin can be seen by looking at their absolute gross margin amounts.\n\nIn the 2022-2023 table (the second one), it shows:\n- 2022: Products $114,728M, Services $56,054M, Total $170,782M\n- 2023: Products $108,803M, Services $60,345M, Total $180,683M\n\nWait, no, the second table shows for 2022: Products $114,728M, Services $56,054M, Total $170,782M\nFor 2023: Products $108,803M, Services $60,345M, Total $180,683M\n\nBut the question is about 2022 to 2023, so we need to compare the 2022 values to the 2023 values.\n\nThe composition change:\n- In 2022, Products contributed $114,728M to $170,782M total gross margin (67.2% of total)\n- In 2023, Products contributed $108,803M to $180,683M total gross margin (60.2% of total)\n- In 2022, Services contributed $56,054M to $170,782M total gross margin (32.8% of total)\n- In 2023, Services contributed $60,345M to $180,683M total gross margin (33.4% of total)\n\nSo the composition shifted slightly from Products (67.2% to 60.2%) to Services (32.8% to 33.4%), meaning Services' share increased slightly.\n\nBut the question asks for the evolution of the total gross margin percentage and the change in composition. The total gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% (2022) to 44.1% (2023), and the composition shifted with Services' share increasing from 32.8% to 33.4% of the total gross margin.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks for \"the change in the composition of gross margin contributions from Products and Services\". The composition change is that Services' contribution increased slightly as a percentage of total gross margin.\n\nBut let's confirm with the data provided. The document shows for the 2022-2023 period (in the second gross margin table) that the total gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% to 44.1%, and the Services gross margin percentage increased from 71.7% to 73.9%, while Products increased from 36.3% to 37.2%.\n\nThe composition change in terms of contribution: in 2022, Products gross margin was $114,728M and Services was $56,054M, so Products were about twice as large as Services in absolute terms. In 2023, Products were $108,803M and Services were $60,345M, so the gap narrowed (Services became a larger absolute amount and a larger percentage of the total).\n\nBut the question is about the composition of gross margin contributions, which likely refers to the percentage of total gross margin coming from each segment.\n\nIn 2022: \n- Products: $114,728M / $170,782M = 67.2%\n- Services: $56,054M / $170,782M = 32.8%\n\nIn 2023:\n- Products: $108,803M / $180,683M = 60.2%\n- Services: $60,345M / $180,683M = 33.4%\n\nSo the composition shifted from 67.2% Products / 32.8% Services to 60.2% Products / 33.4% Services, meaning Services' share increased by about 0.6 percentage points.\n\nNow, to answer the question concisely: The total gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% in 2022 to 44.1% in 2023. The composition shifted with Services' contribution to gross margin increasing from 32.8% to 33.4% of the total, while Products' share decreased from 67.2% to 60.2%.\n\nBut the question asks for \"the change in the composition of gross margin contributions from Products and Services during this period.\" So the key point is that Services' share increased.\n\nHowever, the document also shows that Services gross margin percentage increased from 71.7% to 73.9%, which contributed to the overall improvement.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the composition of contributions, meaning the share of total gross margin from each segment.\n\nSo the answer should be: Apple's total gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% in 2022 to 44.1% in 2023. The composition shifted with Services' contribution to gross margin increasing from 32.8% to 33.4% of the total, while Products' share decreased from 67.2% to 60.2%.\n\nBut let's make sure we're using the correct data. The document shows for 2022 (in the first table) the total gross margin percentage as 41.8%, but that's for 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. The second table shows 2022 as 43.3%, 2023 as 44.1%, 2024 as 46.2%. So for the period 2022 to 2023, we're looking at the second table where 2022 is 43.3% and 2023 is 44.1%.\n\nYes, the second table is labeled \"Gross Margin\" and shows 2024, 2023, 2022. So 2022 is the third column, 2023 is the second column, 2024 is the first column.\n\nSo for 2022: total gross margin percentage = 43.3%\nFor 2023: total gross margin percentage = 44.1%\n\nAnd the composition:\n- 2022: Products 36.3%, Services 71.7%, Total 43.3%\n- 2023: Products 36.5%, Services 70.8%, Total 44.1%\n\nBut the composition of contributions (the share of total gross margin) is different from the gross margin percentages of each segment.\n\nThe gross margin percentage for Products is 36.3% in 2022 and 36.5% in 2023, but that's the margin on the Products segment, not the share of total gross margin.\n\nThe share of total gross margin from Products is calculated as (Products gross margin) / (Total gross margin).\n\nFrom the data:\n- 2022: Products gross margin = $114,728M, Total gross margin = $170,782M, so share = 114,728 / 170,782 = 67.2%\n- 2023: Products gross margin = $108,803M, Total gross margin = $180,683M, so share = 108,803 / 180,683 = 60.2%\n\nSimilarly for Services:\n- 2022: Services gross margin = $56,054M, share = 56,054 / 170,782 = 32.8%\n- 2023: Services gross margin = $60,345M, share = 60,345 / 180,683 = 33.4%\n\nSo the composition changed from 67.2% Products / 32.8% Services to 60.2% Products / 33.4% Services.\n\nTherefore, the change in composition is that Services' share increased by 0.6 percentage points, while Products' share decreased by 7.0 percentage points.\n\nNow, to answer the question in 2-3 sentences as required.\n\nThe question asks: \"How has Apple's total gross margin percentage evolved from 2022 to 2023, and what was the change in the composition of gross margin contributions from Products and Services during this period?\"\n\nAnswer: Apple's total gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% in 2022 to 44.1% in 2023. The composition of gross margin contributions shifted, with Services' share of total gross margin increasing from 32.8% to 33.4% while Products' share decreased from 67.2% to 60.2%.\n\nBut let's check if the document provides the exact numbers for the shares. The document doesn't explicitly state the shares, but we can calculate them from the provided gross margin amounts.\n\nThe document shows for 2022: Products $114,728M, Services $56,054M, Total $170,782M\nFor 2023: Products $108,803M, Services $60,345M, Total $180,683M\n\nSo the shares are as calculated.\n\nNow, to write the answer concisely in 2-3 sentences.\n\nFinal answer: Apple's total gross margin percentage increased from 43.3% in 2022 to 44.1% in 2023. The composition of gross margin contributions shifted, with Services' share rising from 32.8% to 33.4% of total gross margin while Products' share declined from 67.2% to 60.2%.\n\nBut the question says \"the change in the composition\", so we should state the change in the shares.\n\nAlso, note that the document shows for 2022 (in the first table) the total gross margin percentage as 41.8%, but that's for 2022 compared to 2021 and 2020. The second table shows 2022 as 43.3%, which is the figure we should use for the 2022 baseline when comparing to 2023.\n\nYes, the second table is the one that shows 2022, 2023, 2024 data, so 2022 is 43.3%, 2023 is 44.1%.\n\nSo the answer is correct.\n",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Medtronic emphasized leveraging its pipeline to 'win market share' by bringing 'inventive and disruptive technology' to large healthcare opportunities, with a focus on increasing global product adoption through local presence and scale. By 2024, the company's language shifted to leveraging its pipeline to 'accelerate revenue growth,' maintaining a focus on innovation and patient-centric solutions but with a more explicit emphasis on financial outcomes. While the Medical Surgical Portfolio remained a reportable segment in both years, the change in phrasing indicates a strategic evolution from market share acquisition to revenue generation through innovation.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Medtronic’s Medical Surgical Portfolio has maintained its strategic focus on innovation and market expansion through three key shifts: (1) accelerating pipeline development with disruptive technologies like AI-driven remote monitoring and real-time therapy tailoring to capture new patient populations; (2) expanding global reach by prioritizing market penetration in emerging regions beyond the U.S., leveraging its operating model simplification to enhance commercial agility; and (3) embedding innovation into core growth strategy as emphasized in its 2024 forward-looking statements, which highlight \"creating and disrupting markets with our technology\" as a central pillar for long-term shareholder value. This evolution reflects a sustained commitment to leveraging advanced R&D and strategic market positioning to drive growth in its Medical Surgical segment.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PEP reported $5 million in amortization of intangible assets related to the AMESA segment, indicating an ongoing operational presence. However, in 2023, PEP disclosed a $5 million charge related to the AMESA segment under 'COVID-19 charges,' suggesting that the company's exposure had shifted from long-term asset amortization to short-term costs associated with the pandemic. This reflects a change in the nature of PEP’s involvement or financial impact from the AMESA segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided disclosures, PEP's financial exposure to the AMESA segment evolved as follows between 2022 and 2023:  \n- **Net revenue** in AMESA increased from **$4,573 million (2022)** to **$6,078 million (2023)**, reflecting growth in both beverage (30% to 29%) and convenient food (70% to 71%) revenue streams.  \n- **Operating profit** rose from **$600 million (2022)** to **$858 million (2023)**, driven by improved profitability despite macroeconomic challenges.  \n- The segment also recorded **pre-tax impairment charges of $31 million (2023)** related to brands and investments (e.g., Pioneer Foods acquisition), but these were offset by a **$13 million pre-tax credit** from adjustments to prior estimates, resulting in a net positive impact on operating profit.  \n\nThis growth and improved profitability indicate a strengthened financial exposure to AMESA in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, GE disclosed that upon spin-off, GE Vernova would be obligated to indemnify GE for credit support-related payments, with an expectation that the fair value of this obligation would not be significant due to the low probability of loss. GE's exposure under these credit support arrangements could not be reasonably estimated, but contractual maturities of $15 billion each for Power and Renewable Energy segments within five years were highlighted. By 2024, the deferred tax assets associated with losses in discontinued operations, which include GE Vernova, decreased from $0.6 billion in 2023 to an insignificant amount, suggesting a reduction in the tax basis liability linked to these indemnifications. This indicates that the spin-off led to a material shift in how these obligations were accounted for, with GE no longer carrying the same level of tax-related exposure tied to GE Vernova's past credit support arrangements.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple noted the risk of a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs' due to noncompliance with payment card industry data security standards, which could 'materially adversely affect the Company's business.' By 2023, the language evolved to emphasize not only the risk of increased costs but also the growing regulatory and compliance burden Apple faces globally, including 'an increasing number of federal, state and international laws' that heighten the potential for penalties. This indicates a shift from a general risk acknowledgment in 2022 to a more pronounced concern over the expanding regulatory environment in 2023, which likely exacerbates the financial exposure related to transaction costs.",

      "original_answer": "In the years reported as 2021 and 2022, PepsiCo disclosed that the AMESA segment incurred $7 million in charges related to the pandemic in 2021, which decreased slightly to $5 million in 2022. This represents a reduction in the financial impact of the pandemic on the AMESA region over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The COVID-19 charges in the AMESA segment declined from $5 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022 (a modest decrease), but the document does not provide a detailed breakdown of the charges by year for AMESA, so the exact evolution cannot be fully quantified from the provided information.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, iPhone net sales showed an increase compared to 2021, primarily driven by the launch of new iPhone models since the fourth quarter of 2021. However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth in 2022 to stagnation in 2024 suggests a decline in the momentum of iPhone sales performance over time, potentially indicating market saturation or reduced consumer demand for new model releases during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, iPhone net sales grew from $191,973 million in 2021 to $205,489 million in 2022 (a 7% increase), driven by new iPhone models released in late 2021 and throughout 2022. However, by 2024, iPhone net sales had plateaued at $201,183 million—essentially flat compared to 2023 ($200,583 million) and significantly below the 2022 peak—indicating a shift from growth to stagnation in the product line's performance over time. This deceleration suggests the iPhone market may be maturing, with limited upside from new model cycles despite continued innovation.",

In the 2023 filing, Apple maintained that potential penalties include 'significant fees or fines,' but added that the company could also experience a 'significant increase in payment card transaction costs or lose the ability to process payment cards.'

      "llm_answer": "The Company's description of the consequences for failing to comply with payment card industry data security standards remained consistent between the 2022 and 2023 filings. In both years, it stated that failure to follow these standards could result in significant fines, fees, increased transaction costs, loss of the ability to process payment cards, and material adverse effects on its business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition.

By 2024, the same URR increase would result in a $197 million impact, and a WAC increase would lead to a $220 million impact.

By 2024, the full-year sales for the Energy & Transportation segment were $28.854 billion, showing a 3% increase compared to the prior year, 2023. This indicates a significant slowdown in growth rate from 19% annually in the earlier year to a more modest 3% growth two years later.",
      "llm_answer": "\nThe source material only provides Energy & Transportation sales for 2021 ( $5.728 billion in the fourth quarter ) and for the full‑year 2024 ( $28.854 billion, a 3 % increase over 2023). It does not contain any sales or growth figures for the segment in 2022, so a year‑over‑year evolution from 2022 to 2024 cannot be determined from the supplied pages. Consequently, dollar‑value and growth‑percentage data for the 2022‑2024 period are not available in the excerpts provided.",
      "llm_thought": "Based on the provided 10-K pages, Caterpillar's Energy & Transportation segment sales increased from $5.728 billion in Q4 2021 to $5.728 billion in Q4 2024? Actually the document shows Energy & Transportation sales were $5.728 billion in Q4 2021 and $5.728 billion in 2024? Wait: The 2024 consolidated sales table shows Energy & Transportation sales $28.854 billion in 2024 vs $28.001 billion in 2023, representing a 3% increase. However the question asks evolution from 2022 to 2024, particularly dollar value and growth percentage. The only data we have for Energy & Transportation is in 2021 (Q4) and 2024 (full year). The 2021 figure is $5.728 billion (quarter) but the 2024 figure is $28.854 billion (annual). That's not directly comparable. The document does not provide a direct year‑over‑year comparison of the Energy & Transportation segment between 2022 and 2024; it only gives 2021 and 2024 numbers. Therefore we cannot accurately answer the question about evolution from 2022 to 2024 based solely on the provided pages. We need to note that the data is insufficient. But the instruction says answer based on provided pages. So we can say that the Energy & Transportation segment's profit was $675 million in Q4 2021, down 2% from $687 million in Q4 2020, and in 2024 the segment profit was $5.736 billion, up 16% from $4.936 billion in 2023. However the question asks 2022 to 2024, we have no 2022 data. So answer: insufficient data. Probably they expect to note lack of 2022 figures. Provide concise answer.\n",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the filing explicitly stated that 'our ability to return capital to shareholders [...] may be limited [...] by our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' In 2023, this language was expanded to include the phrase 'our ability to return capital to shareholders is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and regulations [...] and our failure to pay full and timely dividends on our preferred stock.' This evolution indicates a more nuanced disclosure that retains the prior year's emphasis on preferred stock dividends as a limiting factor but adds a broader regulatory and governance context. This suggests the company is reinforcing the conditional nature of capital returns, particularly tied to preferred stock obligations, while emphasizing board discretion and regulatory constraints.",
      "llm_answer": "The disclosure regarding the impact of preferred stock dividends on capital return decisions shifted from a 2022 focus on the discretionary nature of capital returns and the need to maintain sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, to a 2023 emphasis on the Board’s deliberate assessment of capital returns alongside preferred stock dividend obligations, explicitly linking the ability to return capital to shareholders to the payment of preferred dividends. This evolution suggests a more structured and risk-aware approach to capital distribution, where preferred stock dividend coverage and regulatory capital adequacy are now central considerations in determining shareholder return strategies.",

      "question": "How did Altria's treatment and disclosure of NPM Adjustment Items evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in terms of their impact on adjusted operating results?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, Altria excluded NPM Adjustment Items from its adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective tax rate forecasts, noting that these items could be significant, unusual, or infrequent, and difficult to predict. The company did not provide a GAAP reconciliation for these exclusions. By 2023, Altria explicitly disclosed the financial impact of NPM Adjustment Items in its operating results, reporting a $29 million impact in Smokeable Products, which was factored into the reconciliation between reported OCI and adjusted OCI. This represents a shift from exclusion to explicit quantification within operating performance metrics.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Altria's treatment of NPM Adjustment Items shifted from a $63 million reduction in reported OCI (as shown in the 2022 reconciliation) to a $29 million reduction in 2023, reflecting a smaller impact on adjusted OCI. This adjustment, along with other special items like the $4.9 billion ABI-related special item in 2021, was excluded from adjusted net earnings and diluted EPS to provide a clearer view of underlying operational performance. Consequently, while reported OCI declined slightly ($18 million decrease), adjusted OCI remained relatively stable ($16 million decrease), and the company's adjusted diluted EPS guidance for 2022 reflected this focus on underlying trends rather than special items.",

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom allocated $110 million to intangible assets primarily within its infrastructure software segment through acquisitions. By fiscal year 2024, Broadcom significantly enhanced this segment through the acquisition of VMware, a leading provider of multi-cloud services, in a transaction valued at approximately $84.2 billion (including both cash and stock). This represents a major strategic shift from smaller-scale asset acquisitions to a transformative acquisition aimed at strengthening Broadcom’s infrastructure software capabilities.",
      "llm_answer": "From fiscal year 2022 through fiscal 2024, Broadcom’s infrastructure‑software segment shifted from organic growth to a strategy built around large‑scale acquisitions that broaden its portfolio and deepen market penetration.  In 2022 the company completed the $10.7 billion purchase of Symantec’s enterprise‑security business, adding a broad suite of cybersecurity products and related intangible assets to its infrastructure‑software segment.  This acquisition was followed by the announced $61 billion merger with VMware, which was consummated in November 2023 and added VMware’s multi‑cloud platform, software‑defined networking and virtualization technologies to Broadcom’s infrastructure‑software offering.  The combined effect of the Symantec and VMware deals—bolstered by smaller 2022 acquisitions of four additional businesses—marked a clear evolution from a primarily hardware‑centric model to a diversified, software‑driven growth engine, with the company actively using acquisitions to enhance its infrastructure‑software segment and expand recurring‑revenue streams.",

However, by 2024, the trend reversed, with a 7% decrease in sales, primarily due to a significant decline in sales volume. This indicates a notable shift from growth to contraction in this segment over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The Construction Industries segment experienced a 27 % increase in sales from $4.508 billion in Q4 2020 to $5.736 billion in Q4 2021, driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization, and its profit rose 25 % to $788 million, indicating stronger performance in that quarter. However, in the full‑year 2024 compared with 2023, sales fell 7 % to $25.455 billion and profit declined 12 % to $6.165 billion, showing that the segment’s growth was not sustained and that operating conditions deteriorated over the longer period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AIG reported an unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development of $47 million, while in 2024, this figure changed to a negative value of $28 million. This indicates a significant shift in the company's claims management or reserving practices, moving from a net positive development in prior years to a negative adjustment in 2024, suggesting either overestimation of prior loss reserves or a change in claims settlement patterns.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided pages from AIG's 2022 and 2024 10-K filings, the unallocated loss adjustment expense (ULAE) prior year development was **$5.559 billion in 2022** and **$5.385 billion in 2024** (as shown in the \"Liabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year loss development, net of reinsurance\" row under \"Unallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development\" in the 2022 and 2024 tables). This represents a **decrease of $174 million** between 2022 and 2024. This decline indicates improved claims management and reserving practices, as the company is now holding less reserves for prior year development (specifically for unallocated loss adjustment expenses) compared to 2022, suggesting more accurate initial reserving or favorable development in subsequent periods.",

      "original_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue significantly declined from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, Paxlovid was part of a broader set of risks related to the company's efforts to develop and commercialize COVID-19 products, including Comirnaty, with specific concerns about reduced demand, inventory write-offs, and challenges transitioning to a commercial market. By 2024, Paxlovid's global revenue dropped by 57% year-over-year, primarily due to lower demand globally, especially in China, where there was a non-recurrent surge in COVID-19 infections in early 2023, and a transition to an out-of-pocket market in the second quarter of that year. Additionally, the global market for COVID-19 treatments had become more endemic and seasonal, leading to reduced demand and lower contractual deliveries in most international markets.",
      "llm_answer": "Pfizer's Paxlovid revenue declined sharply from 2023 to 2024, with operational growth of $4,452 million worldwide (including $5,905 million in the U.S. and a $1,453 million decline internationally), driven primarily by the transition to commercial markets, reduced contractual deliveries, and lower demand—especially in international markets like China. This decline occurred alongside a $5,907 million worldwide drop in Comirnaty revenue and other competitive pressures, contributing to an overall 7% increase in total revenues (to $63,627 million) but a significant international revenue decline of $6,472 million. The revenue reduction was partially offset by growth from legacy Seagen products ($3,223 million) and other portfolio items.",

However, the segment was not yet a central strategic focus, as evidenced by the pending $61 billion acquisition of VMware, which was expected to close in fiscal year 2023. By fiscal year 2024, the relationship had transformed significantly: Broadcom had completed the VMware acquisition on November 22, 2023, and integrated VMware's infrastructure software capabilities into its portfolio.

By 2024, this figure had significantly shifted to just $ (28) million, indicating a substantial reduction in the tax benefit. This change suggests a major improvement in the company's tax position or a shift in taxable income between these years.",

This evolution reflects a move toward a near‑break‑even tax position, driven by tax law changes, non‑cash inventory write‑downs and other discrete tax adjustments that reduced the effective tax rate from double‑digit percentages to near zero. Consequently, the company’s tax stance transitioned from a significant expense to a modest benefit over the two‑year period.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, global Humira sales increased by 4%, driven by market growth across therapeutic categories, although partially offset by biosimilar competition internationally. By 2024, global Humira sales had decreased by 37%, primarily due to direct biosimilar competition following the loss of exclusivity in the U.S. in early 2023. This marks a significant shift from growth to decline, reflecting the impact of market exclusivity expiration and intensified biosimilar pressure.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K filings, global Humira sales declined significantly from 2021 to 2024, with a 4% increase in 2021 followed by a 37% decrease in 2024. The primary drivers were direct biosimilar competition: in the U.S., Humira sales dropped 41% in 2024 after losing exclusivity on January 31, 2023, while international revenues fell 13% in 2024 due to ongoing biosimilar competition.",

      "original_answer": "In the 2022 filing, AMD disclosed 'anticipated ongoing and increased costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls' as a standalone risk factor without explicit linkage to strategic initiatives. By 2023, the disclosure expanded to frame these same information security costs within the context of broader strategic efforts, specifically mentioning the 'expected implications from the development of the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI.' This indicates a shift from viewing information security costs purely as an operational expense to positioning them as part of a strategic response to technological and regulatory trends.",
      "llm_answer": "AMD's disclosures on information security costs show a clear evolution in framing between 2022 and 2023. In the 2022 filing (covering fiscal 2021), costs related to enhancing and implementing information security controls were mentioned as an anticipated ongoing expense, but were not explicitly tied to strategic initiatives. By contrast, the 2023 filing (covering fiscal 2022) integrates these costs within a broader narrative of strategic adaptation, explicitly linking them to the company's response to emerging regulatory requirements and its expanded AI ambitions—particularly following acquisitions like Mipsology and Nod, Inc. This shift reflects a more sophisticated framing where information security investments are positioned as foundational to supporting AI development, regulatory compliance, and the company's evolving technological strategy, rather than being treated as a standalone operational cost. The language also emphasizes proactive adaptation to \"the development of the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI,\" signaling that security costs are now viewed as integral to managing risks associated with AMD's strategic pivot toward AI and advanced computing platforms.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion, driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and a positive mix of traffic, including a relative increase in industrial shipments. By 2023, freight revenues decreased 3% to $22.6 billion, primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenues and a negative mix of traffic, such as decreased lumber shipments and increased short-haul rock shipments, despite core pricing gains. Fuel surcharge revenues declined from $3.7 billion in 2022 to $3.0 billion in 2023, reflecting a 15% decrease in fuel prices and lower volume. These changes indicate a shift from growth driven by broad-based volume and pricing in 2022 to a contraction influenced by fuel and mix effects in 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, Freight Revenues declined 3% year-over-year to $22.571 billion, driven by lower fuel surcharge revenue ($3.0 billion in 2023 vs. $3.7 billion in 2022), negative traffic mix (including declines in lumber and intermodal volumes), and a 1% decrease in volume, partially offset by core pricing gains. Fuel surcharge revenue was directly impacted by a 15% decrease in fuel prices and lower volume, with changes in fuel prices affecting recoveries with approximately a two-month lag. The decline in freight revenue was most pronounced in Intermodal (-12%) and Coal & Renewables (-10), while Premium (automotive and intermodal) also contributed to the overall reduction.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AbbVie spent $1.4 billion on Other Acquisitions and Investments, while in 2024, this amount increased significantly to $3.0 billion. This indicates a strategic shift toward more aggressive investment and acquisition activity, aligning with AbbVie's broader efforts to expand its portfolio through external innovation and partnerships. The increase also coincides with major acquisitions like ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics in 2024, which required significant financing and suggest a more active approach to portfolio transformation.",
      "llm_answer": "AbbVie's spending on Other Acquisitions and Investments declined sharply from 2022 to 2024, falling from $535 million in 2021 (when it acquired Soliton, Inc.) to $18.5 billion in 2024 for the ImmunoGen and Cerevel Therapeutics deals, while earlier 2022‑2023 filings show the company spent $39.7 billion to acquire Allergan in 2020 and then largely shifted to debt‑financed growth rather than large‑scale acquisitions. This pivot indicates a strategic focus on expanding its pipeline through targeted biotech purchases and collaborations rather than broad, cash‑intensive mergers, emphasizing internal R&D investment and leveraging debt to fund growth initiatives.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, AMD reported a net inventory balance of $1,955 million as of December 25, 2021, and described its process of adjusting inventory carrying value based on historical and forecasted demand, with a focus on recent historical activity. By 2023, the net inventory balance had increased significantly to $4,351 million as of December 30, 2022. Additionally, AMD's language shifted from 'inventory carrying value adjustments' to 'inventory excess and obsolescence reserves,' indicating a more refined and possibly more conservative approach to inventory valuation. This evolution suggests a growing complexity in inventory management, likely due to increased inventory holdings and forward-looking risk assessment.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2023, AMD's inventory carrying value increased from $1,955 million to $4,351 million, reflecting a substantial rise in net inventory. The company continues to adjust inventory to the lower of actual cost or estimated net realizable value after reviewing on‑hand quantities against forecasted demand, using assumptions about future sales volumes, prices, and product life cycles that are subject to market and competitive conditions. This evolution highlights the growing scale and complexity of AMD's inventory management, as it must now make more extensive and forward‑looking judgments to assess excess and obsolescence reserves.",

In contrast, in 2023, the licensing gain from royalty income was significantly lower at $34 million, with no mention of milestone-related gains.

This indicates that while milestone-based gains were realized in both years, the 2023 period included additional royalty income, demonstrating progress toward sustained royalty streams from the THATIC JV's commercialization of AMD's licensed IP.

      "original_answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Broadcom's Infrastructure Software segment was described as contributing to a portion of net revenue, though semiconductor solutions remained the dominant segment. The company was in the process of acquiring VMware for approximately $61 billion, signaling a strategic intent to strengthen its infrastructure software capabilities. By fiscal year 2024, the acquisition of VMware was completed on November 22, 2023, and the company explicitly stated that VMware was integrated into its infrastructure software segment to enhance its capabilities. Financially, VMware's acquisition involved $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock valued at $53,398 million, indicating a significant increase in financial commitment to the segment.",
      "llm_answer": "Broadcom's relationship with its Infrastructure Software segment has evolved from a strategic focus on organic growth and targeted acquisitions to a decisive, high‑value acquisition strategy culminating in the $61 billion purchase of VMware.  The 2022 fiscal year highlighted a strong financial commitment to this segment through the VMware merger, which was financed with a $32 billion bridge facility and anticipated to be completed in fiscal 2023, while earlier years showed steady investment in infrastructure software to broaden its portfolio and enhance revenue diversification.  This acquisition underscores a clear strategic positioning of infrastructure software as a core growth driver and reflects Broadcom’s willingness to allocate substantial capital to accelerate its presence in the high‑margin software market.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the Canadian segment gross margin percentage increased, primarily due to improvements in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses, partially offset by increased 2% rewards. In 2024, the same factors were cited—increases in core merchandise categories and warehouse ancillary and other businesses—again contributing positively, with the same offsetting effect from increased 2% rewards. The specific contribution magnitudes were consistent across both years, indicating a sustained trend in margin performance drivers within the Canadian segment.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2023 to 2024, the Canadian segment’s gross‑margin percentage rose primarily because core merchandise sales grew and ancillary businesses (especially e‑commerce and gasoline) contributed positively, while the impact of higher 2% rewards partially offset the gain. In 2023, the increase was driven by higher core‑merchandise margins and the absence of charter‑shipping charges, whereas in 2024 the improvement stemmed from stronger ancillary‑business performance and a modest rise in core‑category margins, resulting in a net uplift in the segment’s margin.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer indemnified GSK for 32% of any amount payable under GSK's guarantee of $8.75 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes issued by the Consumer Healthcare JV. Simultaneously, Pfizer received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) from the JV, which it repaid in July 2022 after receiving £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion. By 2024, this indemnification had been terminated in conjunction with the demerger, and there was no indication of ongoing loan obligations or new financing arrangements with the JV. This marks a full resolution of the indemnification and loan relationship that existed in 2022.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Pfizer’s indemnification obligations related to the Consumer Healthcare JV were terminated after the JV’s debt issuance and subsequent dividend and loan repayments. Specifically, following the JV’s $8.75 billion note offering in March 2022, Pfizer received a £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) loan from the JV and later received £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, which were used to repay the loan. This sequence of transactions, detailed in Note 2C of the 2022 10-K and further referenced in the 2024 10-K, resulted in the termination of Pfizer’s indemnification of the JV’s guarantee obligations. Additionally, the 2024 10-K confirms that Pfizer’s indemnification of the JV’s guarantee \"was terminated\" in connection with these transactions, eliminating any further obligations. Regarding loan transactions, Pfizer received a £2.9 billion loan from the Consumer Healthcare JV in 2022 (repayable with interest at 1.365% annually), which was fully repaid alongside a corresponding repayment by GSK, as part of the JV’s restructuring following the demerger.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, aircraft manufacturing revenue was $7 million, as disclosed in the financial breakdown. In 2024, this revenue stream increased, driven by additional aircraft deliveries, particularly the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. However, this growth came with added costs due to supplier quality escapes and late deliveries of components, which impacted operational efficiency.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue from aircraft manufacturing increased by $213 million in 2024, driven by higher deliveries of the new G700 aircraft, but operating earnings rose only modestly to $282 million because of added costs from supplier quality issues and delayed component deliveries that raised production expenses. These supply‑chain challenges and the initial delivery phase of the G700 caused margins to fall 70 basis points despite the revenue growth.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal disclosed that retail e-commerce sales were among several macroeconomic factors influencing transaction and credit losses, specifically affecting the funding mix and consumer spending behavior. By 2024, the company placed a more structured and explicit emphasis on retail e-commerce sales as part of the macroeconomic forecasts used in its consumer loss models, particularly for the revolving credit portfolio. This shift indicates a more direct integration of retail e-commerce trends into the credit risk modeling process. The 2024 allowance for consumer loans receivable was $341 million, with models now explicitly incorporating forecasted retail e-commerce sales sourced externally using a single economic scenario for each period.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal's reliance on retail e-commerce sales as a macroeconomic factor in forecasting consumer credit losses shifted from a qualitative mention in 2023 (where it was noted as part of broader macroeconomic conditions affecting credit loss estimates) to a more specific, quantitative inclusion in 2024. In the 2024 document, retail e-commerce sales are explicitly cited as a key macroeconomic driver in the allowance for consumer loans receivable model, alongside household disposable income, to project credit losses—highlighting its growing importance in their loss forecasting methodology. This evolution reflects a deeper integration of retail e-commerce trends into their credit risk assessment, moving beyond general references to active use in model inputs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PFE reported Other (income)/deductions-net as a $4,878 million expense, largely driven by significant losses on equity securities ($1,344 million) and a $2,547 million expense related to net periodic benefit costs. By 2024, this line item reversed to a $4,388 million income, indicating major improvements or one-time gains not present in earlier filings. This transformation highlights a strategic or market-driven shift that significantly boosted non-operational income over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "The reversal was driven by the $4.8 billion expense recorded in 2022 for the Pfizer‑BioNTech COVID‑19 vaccine collaboration (largely due to inventory write‑downs and royalty accruals) and the subsequent $4.3 billion income in 2024 from the same arrangement, reflecting the shift from pandemic‑era inventory charges to royalty and milestone income as vaccine sales declined and the partnership matured.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, PFE had a pro rata indemnification obligation of 32% for GSK's guarantee of $8.75 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes issued by the Consumer Healthcare JV. Simultaneously, PFE received a loan of £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) from the JV, which it repaid in July 2022 after receiving £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion. By 2024, the indemnification obligation had been terminated following the demerger, and there is no mention of ongoing loan arrangements or new obligations related to the JV. This indicates a significant reduction in PFE’s financial exposure and liability tied to the JV.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Pfizer’s relationship with the Consumer Healthcare JV shifted from a financing and indemnification focus to a more strategic divestiture and partnership evolution. In 2022, the JV issued $8.75 bn of senior notes, and Pfizer indemnified GSK for 32 % of any guarantee obligations, while also receiving a £2.9 bn (≈$3.7 bn) loan from the JV that it repaid after a one‑time dividend. By 2024, after selling most of its stake in Haleon (the consumer‑healthcare spin‑off) and terminating the indemnity, Pfizer’s exposure to the JV’s financing was effectively ended, and its indemnification obligations were resolved. The only remaining financial link was the repayment of the loan and the termination of the guarantee‑indemnity arrangement.",

This indicates that Costco's membership growth strategy has increasingly targeted household-level penetration, as Household cards grew faster than Business memberships during this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The number of Household cards increased from 60,600 in 2023 to 63,700 in 2024, reflecting a 5% rise in paid memberships and a 6.7% increase in total cardholders. This growth in household cards indicates Costco's strategy of expanding its member base through increased household penetration, likely driven by higher membership fees and Executive membership adoption, which represented 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024. The rise in paid members (76,200 in 2024 vs. 71,000 in 2023) further supports a focus on scaling membership revenue rather than solely increasing warehouse count.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the Graphics segment generated $15,868 million in revenue with an operating income of $8,492 million, indicating strong performance primarily driven by gaming and professional visualization. By 2024, the Graphics segment's strategic positioning had expanded beyond traditional gaming and workstation GPUs to include broader applications such as AI-driven PC computing, game streaming via GeForce NOW, and Omniverse Enterprise for industrial AI and digital twin applications. While the exact revenue figures for 2024 are not provided, the segment's scope now includes emerging technologies like AI-enhanced content creation and automotive infotainment systems, suggesting a transformation and deepening integration into AI and enterprise workflows.",
      "llm_answer": "The Graphics segment's revenue contribution and strategic positioning have evolved significantly between 2022 and 2024, transitioning from a standalone gaming-focused business to an integrated component of NVIDIA's broader data center and AI platform strategy. While the Graphics segment (encompassing gaming GPUs, RTX technology, and Omniverse) remains a key revenue driver, its strategic role has shifted to support the company's expanded focus on data center-scale AI and computing infrastructure, as evidenced by the Mellanox acquisition (which allocated goodwill to Compute and Networking) and the launch of new data center architectures like Blackwell in 2024. Revenue contribution from Graphics has stabilized and matured, with the segment now serving as a foundational platform for AI-driven growth rather than a standalone growth engine, as reflected in its integration into NVIDIA's full-stack data center offerings and the emphasis on AI Enterprise software and DGX Cloud services.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, subscription revenue accounted for 92% of Adobe's total revenue, reflecting a dominant reliance on subscription-based income. However, by 2024, subscription revenue had declined significantly as a percentage of total revenue to just 8%. This dramatic decrease indicates a major shift in Adobe's revenue mix, suggesting a growing proportion of revenue coming from non-subscription sources such as services and other revenue streams.",
      "llm_answer": "Adobe's subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased from 90% in fiscal 2020 to 92% in fiscal 2021, and continued rising to 95% in fiscal 2024. This shift indicates a decisive move toward a subscription-based business model, where recurring revenue now dominates the company's financial structure. The growth in subscription revenue—particularly in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud—reflects Adobe's successful transition from perpetual licenses to cloud services, driving higher revenue predictability and customer retention.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, PayPal's Transaction Expense Rate was 0.94%, which decreased slightly to 0.93% in 2024. This minor decrease followed an increase in 2023 compared to 2022, which was driven by unfavorable changes in product mix, particularly a higher proportion of TPV from unbranded card processing, partially offset by favorable regional mix changes. In 2024, the slight decline in the rate suggests that the company may have experienced more favorable funding mix dynamics or operational efficiencies, although the overall rate remained relatively stable.",
      "llm_answer": "PayPal’s transaction expense rate stayed essentially flat at about 0.93‑0.94% from 2023 to 2024.  The slight increase was driven by higher TPV and a larger share of Braintree volume, which carries a higher expense rate, but this was offset by more favorable regional and product mix and certain third‑party pricing incentives.  At the same time, transaction losses fell to 0.07% of TPV (down from 0.08% in 2023) as improved risk‑mitigation reduced Venmo‑related losses, while credit losses also declined, reflecting better loan‑portfolio credit quality and lower charge‑offs.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Pfizer indemnified GSK for 32% of any amount payable under GSK's guarantee of $8.75 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes issued by the Consumer Healthcare JV. At the same time, the JV loaned Pfizer £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) at an interest rate of 1.365% per annum. In July 2022, Pfizer received £3.5 billion ($4.2 billion) in dividends from the JV, including a one-time pre-separation dividend of $4.0 billion, which was used to repay the £2.9 billion loan. Following the demerger, Pfizer's indemnification obligation was terminated. By 2024, there was no mention of ongoing indemnification or loan obligations related to the Consumer Healthcare JV, indicating a full resolution of these financial arrangements.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, Pfizer's indemnification obligations related to the Consumer Healthcare JV were terminated after the JV's debt issuance and subsequent loan repayments, which occurred following the spin-off and dividend transactions in 2022. Specifically, Pfizer had previously agreed to indemnify GSK for 32% of any guarantee obligations related to the JV's $8.75 billion senior notes, but this obligation was terminated when the JV's loan was repaid and dividends were received, eliminating the need for indemnification. Additionally, Pfizer engaged in significant loan transactions with the JV, including receiving a £2.9 billion ($3.7 billion) loan from the JV in 2022, which was later repaid alongside dividends from the JV. These financial interactions marked the conclusion of Pfizer's direct financial relationship with the Consumer Healthcare JV, shifting focus to other strategic initiatives like the acquisition of Biohaven and Arena.",

By 2024, the total paid membership grew to 76,200, with 63,700 Gold Star members (83.6%) and 12,500 Business members (16.4%). This reflects a slight increase in the dominance of Gold Star members in the overall membership base, while the Business segment saw a smaller proportional growth.

By fiscal 2024, the year-over-year growth rate had slowed to 18%, with revenue increasing from $2.70 billion in fiscal 2023 to $3.18 billion in fiscal 2024. This suggests that while Document Cloud remains a growing contributor, its pace of expansion has moderated as it matures within the Digital Media segment.",

By 2024, the company's total Transformation Strategy Costs had significantly increased to $322 million for 2024 from $435 million in 2023. This indicates a substantial shift in strategic investment focus, with UPS accelerating its transformation initiatives under Transformation 2.0, including efforts like 'Spans and Layers,' 'Business Portfolio Review,' and 'Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined.' The earlier phase of transformation was smaller in scale compared to the expanded and more diversified transformation initiatives undertaken in 2024.",
      "llm_answer": "UPS's Transformation Strategy Costs declined from $435 million in 2022 to $322 million in 2023, reflecting the completion of earlier phases (Transformation 1.0) and progress toward concluding Transformation 2.0, while still incurring ongoing expenses for technology upgrades, business‑portfolio reviews and workforce reductions. This downward trend shows that the company is shifting from aggressive restructuring toward more targeted, efficiency‑focused investments, signaling a strategic focus on consolidating gains and funding growth initiatives rather than large‑scale cost cuts.",

By 2023, Schwab continued to update Estimated Current LTV ratios monthly using the same methodology, but expanded its disclosure to include detailed credit quality indicators that incorporated this metric, indicating a more comprehensive integration into credit reporting processes. This represents a transformation in how Estimated Current LTV is utilized, moving from a monitored metric to a disclosed and detailed credit quality component.",
      "llm_answer": "Schwab’s Estimated Current LTV disclosures evolved from annual updates in 2022 to monthly updates in 2023, now integrated into the credit quality reporting framework that stratifies First Mortgages and HELOCs by origination year, FICO scores, and LTV metrics. This change enhances the timeliness and granularity of credit risk monitoring, allowing Schwab to better assess and report on loan portfolio quality through more frequent LTV updates and inclusion in allowance for credit losses calculations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Apple highlighted the risk of incurring significant fees or fines if it failed to follow payment card industry data security standards, with potential consequences including a significant increase in payment card transaction costs or loss of the ability to process payment cards. By 2024, the language evolved to emphasize not only the continuation of these risks but also the broader financial implications, such as materially adverse effects on business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. While the core risk remained consistent, the framing in 2024 suggests a heightened awareness and potential escalation in the severity of consequences, indicating an increased exposure or at least a more explicitly communicated risk posture.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Apple’s exposure to fees or fines tied to payment‑card data security has remained consistent in nature but has been amplified by expanding payment‑card transaction volumes and heightened regulatory scrutiny. The company continues to face potential liability for failing to meet PCI‑DSS standards, which could result in significant fines, increased transaction costs, or loss of the ability to process card payments—risk factors that are highlighted in both the 2022 and 2024 Form 10‑K filings. Consequently, payment‑card compliance represents a persistent financial risk that can materially affect Apple’s results of operations and overall financial condition.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX disclosed that foreign exchange contract activity impacted financial statements through its effect on Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and the Consolidated Statement of Operations, with gains or losses primarily recorded as part of Products sales. By 2023, RTX not only reiterated this impact but also specified the use of the critical terms match method for assessing hedge effectiveness and introduced a €500 million euro-denominated long-term debt instrument designated as a net investment hedge against European business investments, which was deemed effective. This indicates a more detailed and structured approach to managing foreign exchange risk through specific debt instruments.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, RTX’s foreign exchange contract activity continued to be managed through highly effective cash‑flow hedges that lock in fixed foreign‑currency rates for underlying transactions. The notional amount of outstanding foreign‑currency hedges declined slightly from $11.6 billion in 2021 to $8.5 billion in 2021 (and further to $15.8 billion in 2023 per the later note), with the related gains or losses recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and reclassified into product sales as the hedges mature. A $28 million pre‑tax loss is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into sales over the next 12 months, reflecting the fixed rates obtained from these hedges. The Company’s hedging effectiveness is assessed using the critical‑terms‑match method, and the €500 million of euro‑denominated long‑term debt serves as a net‑investment hedge, further supporting the overall hedge program.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, iPhone net sales increased compared to 2021, driven by the launch of new iPhone models since the fourth quarter of 2021. However, by 2024, iPhone net sales were described as 'relatively flat' compared to 2023. This shift from growth to stagnation suggests a notable change in the iPhone's sales momentum, potentially indicating market saturation, longer upgrade cycles, or weaker demand despite ongoing product releases.",
      "llm_answer": "Based on the provided 10-K excerpts, iPhone net sales grew 7% year-over-year in 2022 (reaching $205.5 billion) due to new iPhone models launched in late 2021, but remained relatively flat in 2024 ($201.2 billion), indicating a plateau in growth. This shift suggests the iPhone product line transitioned from rapid expansion to a mature, stable phase with limited organic growth, relying more on incremental updates and services to drive revenue.",

      "original_answer": "In 2021, Johnson & Johnson's European sales grew by 24.3%, driven by operational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. However, by 2023, European sales had declined by 1.2%, with an operational decline of 2.2% partially offset by a smaller positive currency impact of 1.0%. The decline in 2023 was significantly influenced by the net negative impact of 9.8% from the performance of the Covid-19 Vaccine and the loss of exclusivity of Zytiga. This marks a dramatic shift from the robust growth seen in 2021, indicating both operational challenges and changing market dynamics in Europe over this period.",
      "llm_answer": "The shift in Johnson & Johnson's European sales performance from strong growth in 2021 to a decline in 2023 was driven by a combination of factors. In 2021, Europe saw 20.7% operational growth and a 3.6% positive currency impact, but by 2023, operational sales declined by 2.2% with only a 1.0% currency benefit, resulting in an overall 1.2% sales drop. This deterioration was significantly influenced by the loss of exclusivity for Zytiga in Europe, which negatively impacted operational sales by 9.8%, and broader challenges such as the lingering effects of the pandemic and competitive pressures in the region. Additionally, currency fluctuations and product-specific events like the divestiture of certain portfolios further exacerbated the decline in European performance.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, RTX disclosed loss contingency accruals related to a DOJ grand jury investigation and civil antitrust lawsuits concerning alleged hiring restrictions, with the company stating that the amounts accrued were not material. By 2023, RTX shifted focus to new legal exposures stemming from the Powder Metal Disclosure Litigation and an SEC investigation, again noting that any related loss contingency accruals were not material. The evolution reflects a transition from antitrust-related employment issues to securities disclosure and manufacturing-related litigation, while maintaining a consistent stance on materiality.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023 RTX’s approach to loss contingencies for legal matters remained consistent in its overall methodology—accruing probable and reasonably estimable liabilities and, where no single amount is more likely than another, recording the minimum estimate. However, the nature of the exposures shifted: in 2022 the primary concerns were government contract pricing disputes (e.g., the $1.73 billion CAS claim and related ASBCA appeals) and the Thales‑Raytheon SEC/DOJ investigations, while in 2023 the focus expanded to include the high‑profile “powder‑metal” issue affecting Pratt & Whitney engine parts, which generated new subpoenas and potential customer compensation costs. Materiality assessments also evolved; the 2022 disclosures characterized those matters as not expected to have a material adverse effect, whereas the 2023 discussion highlighted that the powder‑metal matter, while still deemed non‑material, introduced additional uncertainty and required a reassessment of potential financial impact. Consequently, while the accrual policy did not change, the composition of legal exposures and the company’s judgment about their materiality were updated between the two years.",

This indicates a notable shift in the geographic concentration of the Compute & Networking segment's demand, with a relative increase in U.S.-based demand driving the segment's revenue. The decrease in international revenue share suggests a strategic or market-driven shift toward stronger domestic growth in Compute & Networking.",
      "llm_answer": "The geographic revenue concentration for the Compute & Networking segment shifted markedly between fiscal 2023 and 2024, with revenue from outside the United States falling from 69% of total revenue in 2023 to 56% in 2024, indicating a growing share of sales to U.S. customers and a relative de‑emphasis on overseas markets.

      "llm_answer": "The aerospace manufacturing revenue grew from $8,135 million in 2022 to $8,400 million in 2023—a $265 million increase (≈3.3 %). Operating earnings rose from $1,031 million to $1,083 million, a $52 million gain, reflecting higher aircraft services revenue and improved margins despite supply‑chain cost pressures. This corresponds to an operating‑margin improvement of about 50 basis points, from 12.7 % in 2022 to 13.7 % in 2023.",

By 2023, Aircraft Manufacturing contributed only $7 billion to a total increase of $52 billion in company revenue. This indicates a significant decline in the segment's contribution, suggesting a reduced strategic emphasis or operational scale in this business area compared to other divisions like Aircraft Services, which contributed $36 billion in the same year.",
      "llm_answer": "General Dynamics' Aircraft Manufacturing revenue declined from $22,188 million in 2022 to $23,022 million in 2023 (a $834 million increase in total product revenue, but aircraft manufacturing specifically decreased by $251 million due to fewer deliveries and supply chain constraints), contributing to a slight decrease in overall operating margin (from 10.7% in 2022 to 10.0% in 2023). This decline reflects the segment's reduced contribution to the company's overall performance, as the Aerospace segment's revenue growth was offset by margin pressure from supply chain costs and lower-margin aircraft production, despite strong order activity in other defense segments.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, the operating profit as a percentage of revenue was 52.6%, indicating strong profitability relative to revenue. By 2024, this metric had decreased significantly to 13.9%, reflecting a major decline in the company's ability to maintain profitability in relation to revenue. This drop from 52.6% to 13.9% suggests a substantial weakening in cost management or a shift in business dynamics affecting margins.",
      "llm_answer": "The operating profit margin declined from 48.8% in 2022 to 34.9% in 2024, reflecting weakening cost management and profitability trends as revenue fell and fixed manufacturing costs were spread over lower output, despite stable operating expense levels. This shift indicates deteriorating operational efficiency and margin pressure from reduced demand and planned capacity expansions.",

By 2024, the company decreased its projected U.S. Defined Benefit obligations, showing $80 million for 2025 and a reduced long-term liability estimate of $193 million for 2030–2034.

      "question": "How did the funding strategy for U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in terms of investment allocation and projected payment obligations?",
      "original_answer": "In 2022, TXN maintained a conservative investment strategy for U.S. Retiree Health Care obligations, with 65%-80% allocated to fixed income securities and cash equivalents and 20%-35% to equity securities. By 2023, the company showed a decrease in its projected payment obligations, with U.S. Retiree Health Care payments declining from $27 million in 2024 to $22 million in 2028. This indicates a shift toward reduced liability exposure, consistent with the earlier conservative investment approach that may have helped stabilize the funding position over time.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 to 2023, the company’s funding strategy for U.S. retiree health care obligations shifted toward higher fixed‑income allocations and lower equity exposure, with plan assets moving from roughly 65% fixed income / 35% equity in 2022 to about 80% fixed income / 20% equity in 2023.  This rebalancing reflects a more liability‑driven investment approach aimed at matching the interest‑rate sensitivity of the retiree health liabilities.  Consequently, the projected benefit payments for the U.S. retiree health care plan are expected to decline modestly over the next decade—from $28 million in 2024 to $22 million by 2028—while the accumulated benefit obligation remains substantial, totaling $480 million as of December 31 2023.  The change in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) also shows a reduction in net actuarial loss and prior service credit, underscoring the impact of the revised funding and investment strategy on the company’s retiree health‑care liabilities.",

By 2024, the company projected increasing annual benefit payments starting at $85 million in 2025 and rising to $92 million by 2029, with a cumulative payout of $476 million from 2030 to 2034. This indicates a growing long-term financial obligation and suggests the company anticipates sustained liability in its Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan.",
      "llm_answer": "The funding outlook for the Non-U.S. Defined Benefit plan shows a significant improvement in its financial position between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, the accumulated benefit obligations were $2.47 billion (2021) and $2.72 billion (2020), but by 2024, the accumulated benefit obligations had decreased to $1.47 billion (2024) and $1.67 billion (2023), indicating a reduction in liabilities. Additionally, the AOCI balance for Non-U.S. plans improved from $149 million (net of taxes) in 2021 to $113 million (net of taxes) in 2024, reflecting lower net actuarial losses. This trend suggests that the company's long-term obligations for non-U.S. pension plans are becoming more manageable, as liabilities are declining and funding requirements are stabilizing, reducing the long-term financial burden.

      "original_answer": "In 2022, aircraft manufacturing reported a loss of $251 million. By 2024, this segment experienced an increase in revenue due to additional aircraft deliveries, particularly the initial deliveries of G700 aircraft. However, the segment also faced cost overruns linked to supplier quality escapes and late deliveries of components, which impacted profitability.",
      "llm_answer": "The revenue performance in aircraft manufacturing evolved significantly from 2022 to 2024, with a notable shift in trajectory. In 2022, the Aerospace segment (which includes aircraft manufacturing) reported revenue of $12,457 million, which declined slightly to $12,648 million in 2021 but then grew to $28,635 million in 2024, reflecting strong demand for new aircraft orders and deliveries. However, operating margin declined by 70 basis points in 2024 due to increased costs from supplier quality issues and supply chain delays affecting initial deliveries of the G700 aircraft, as well as higher G&A expenses. These challenges were offset by robust order growth, with the segment's book-to-bill ratio reaching 1.6-to-1 in 2021 and remaining strong through 2024, driven by demand for Gulfstream aircraft across domestic and international markets. The 2025 outlook anticipates revenue of approximately $12.7 billion with a 13.7% operating margin, indicating a recovery in profitability as supply chain issues resolve and production stabilizes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Abbott was actively streamlining operations within its Diagnostic Products segment as part of broader cost-reduction initiatives, incurring approximately $16 million in severance charges recorded under 'Cost of products sold' and an additional $4 million under 'Research and development.' This reflects a direct financial commitment to restructuring the segment for improved efficiency. By 2024, the Diagnostic Products segment was formally redefined and categorized under four distinct business units—Core Laboratory Diagnostics, Rapid Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics, and Point of Care Diagnostics—indicating a more structured and strategic classification within Abbott’s internal management reporting framework. This evolution from operational restructuring in 2022 to a clearly delineated, standardized segment in 2024 suggests a long-term strategic shift toward formalizing and stabilizing the diagnostic business as a core component of Abbott’s global health care portfolio.",
      "llm_answer": "From 2022 through 2024 Abbott’s Diagnostic Products segment underwent a clear shift in strategic focus and classification.  In 2022 the segment was still largely driven by COVID‑19 testing revenues, but by 2023‑2024 the company began restructuring its manufacturing network (e.g., the May 2021 plan to align COVID‑19 test production with declining demand) and moved certain businesses—most notably the Acelis Connected Health unit—out of Diagnostics and into the Medical Devices segment.  This realignment, together with the scaling back of COVID‑19‑related sales and the associated cost‑reduction and restructuring actions, reflects a strategic evolution from a pandemic‑focused, high‑growth diagnostic business to a more balanced, efficiency‑driven segment that now shares resources with medical‑device operations.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Merck estimated that a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would result in a $648 million decline in the market value of its hedge instruments. By 2024, this estimated decline was $569 million at year-end. This indicates a reduction in the company's foreign exchange risk exposure over time, as the potential market value loss decreased by $79 million over the two-year period.",
      "llm_answer": "Merck's estimated market value of its foreign exchange hedges declined from $648 million in 2021 to $569 million in 2024 for a uniform 10 % weakening of the U.S. dollar, reflecting a modest reduction in hedge value over the period. This trend shows that while the company remains highly exposed to foreign‑exchange movements—particularly a weakening dollar—its hedging program continues to offset a substantial portion of that risk, though the protective buffer has slightly eroded.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, QTL's licensing revenues were primarily derived from per-unit royalties and lump sum payments, with the majority coming from sales of OFDMA-based products, including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices. Royalties were calculated based on a percentage of the wholesale selling price, net of permissible deductions, with some products subject to minimums or caps. By 2024, the structure remained largely consistent, with QTL continuing to generate the 'vast majority' of its revenues from similar multimode devices. However, the 2024 filing emphasized ongoing investments in 5G and the expansion of its patent portfolio in LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro, and 5G NR, indicating a strategic shift toward reinforcing its leadership in next-generation technologies. While the royalty structure remained similar, the 2024 report placed greater emphasis on the foundational role of Qualcomm's inventions in both 3G/4G and 5G, suggesting a deepening alignment of QTL's licensing strategy with 5G innovation.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, QTL’s licensing framework continued to focus on multimode CDMA/OFDMA devices, with royalty structures remaining anchored in per-unit payments based on wholesale selling price—often subject to minimums, caps, or fixed per-unit rates—while expanding coverage to include emerging 5G NR and LTE-Advanced Pro standards; the core evolution lies in the increased integration of AI-driven modem-RF platforms (e.g., Snapdragon 5G modem-RF) that enhance data speeds and efficiency, though the fundamental royalty model and scope of essential patent licensing for multimode devices remained consistent.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, the QTL segment reported revenues of $5,306 million and earnings before taxes (EBT) of $3,628 million. By 2024, QTL revenues increased to $5,572 million, with EBT rising to $4,027 million, indicating both revenue and profitability growth. Additionally, in 2024, QTL expanded its focus on licensing patents for 3G/4G/5G technologies, emphasizing its leadership in the 5G patent space and its ongoing investments in next-generation wireless technologies. The 2024 filing also highlights QTL’s commitments to standards bodies regarding essential patents and the competitive landscape for future wireless IP development, reflecting a more strategic and forward-looking posture compared to 2023.",
      "llm_answer": "Between 2023 and 2024, QTL revenue increased modestly from $5.306 billion to $5.572 billion, while its EBT rose from $3.628 billion to $4.027 billion, reflecting continued royalty collections from 3G/4G/5G licensed products. However, the segment’s role has shifted: the ongoing litigation with Arm over the Nuvia acquisition and alleged Qualcomm ALA breaches has heightened scrutiny of QTL’s licensing practices, and Arm’s recent notice of alleged breach seeks to terminate the Qualcomm ALA, potentially curtailing QTL’s ability to license its cellular standard‑essential patents. Consequently, while QTL remains a key source of licensing income, its future growth and stability are now closely tied to the outcome of these legal disputes.",

      "original_answer": "In 2023, CVS highlighted its sensitivity to the accuracy of forecasting health care costs, especially in the Medicare segment where revenue is based on bids submitted in June of the prior year. Premiums were fixed for 12-month periods, making the Health Care Benefits segment vulnerable to unanticipated cost increases, such as those caused by the lingering uncertainty of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and influenza seasons. In 2024, the company projected continued elevated utilization levels into 2025, which could pressure the Health Care Benefits segment and lead to premium deficiency reserves. Additionally, the company expected medical membership declines in Medicare and individual exchange products, contributing to financial volatility. These developments indicate an increased exposure to forecasting inaccuracies and a continuation of challenges in predicting utilization trends.",
      "llm_answer": "The financial risk exposure related to medical cost forecasting in the Health Care Benefits segment has intensified from 2023 to 2024 due to elevated Medicare utilization and increased volatility in health care cost trends. The 2024 10-K highlights that \"elevated utilization persisted through the fourth quarter of 2024\" and \"continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment,\" with the segment experiencing a 33.5% year-over-year increase in health care costs (vs. 21.3% in 2023). This volatility—driven by factors like Medicare member behavior, pandemic-related utilization patterns, and ACA-related cost pressures—has made accurate forecasting more challenging, increasing the risk of premium deficiency reserves and adverse financial impacts. The document specifically notes that \"accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricing for our medical cost trends... is more challenging\" during periods of significant volatility, directly linking elevated utilization to heightened financial risk exposure.",

      "original_answer": "In 2022, Emerson used internal judgment and historical information from Aspen Technology, Inc. to determine the obsolescence rate for developed technology intangible assets. By 2024, the company had evolved its approach by involving valuation professionals to evaluate obsolescence rates through comparisons with industry peers and historical transactions. This indicates a shift toward more externally validated and benchmarked methodologies for asset valuation.",
      "llm_answer": "Emerson's approach to determining the obsolescence rate for intangible assets remained consistent between 2022 and 2024, relying on projected revenue and historical experience to estimate useful lives and obsolescence. However, the 2022 acquisition of AspenTech introduced a new intangible asset (developed technology) requiring a formal obsolescence rate assessment, which was conducted with the help of an independent valuation specialist. This methodology, while consistent in principle, involved more rigorous assumptions for the newly acquired intangible assets, reflecting a shift toward more structured valuation practices post-acquisition. The company's valuation methodology for intangible assets thus evolved from a less formalized internal process to a more data-driven, third-party-assisted approach, particularly for significant acquisitions, though the core principles of using projected revenue and historical benchmarks remained unchanged.
