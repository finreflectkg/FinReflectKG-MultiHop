      "question": "How did the growth in Merck's Pharmaceutical segment profits compare to Bristol-Myers Squibb's profit-sharing obligations in 2024, given the differing structures of their respective revenue models?",
      "answer": "Merck's Pharmaceutical segment profits grew by 15% in 2024, driven by higher sales despite increased administrative and promotional costs and foreign exchange headwinds. In contrast, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) manages a portion of its profits through alliance arrangements that include profit-sharing obligations, which reduce the profitability of marketed products. While Merck directly captures segment profits from its pharmaceutical business, BMY's profit-sharing arrangements indicate a more distributed profit model, suggesting differing financial exposures and strategic risk allocations in their revenue generation frameworks.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense.

A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.

The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

          "chunk_text": "## Alliances\n\nWe enter into alliance arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of specific products or drug candidates in our therapeutic areas of focus. Alliances may be structured as co-development, co-commercialization, licensing or joint venture arrangements.  These arrangements may include upfront payments;  option  payments  to  develop  or  commercialize  a  specific  asset  or  technology;  payments  for  various  developmental,  regulatory  and  sales-based performance milestones; royalties; cost reimbursements; profit sharing; and equity investments. Provisions in our alliance arrangements lessen our investment risk for compounds not leading to revenue generating products but reduce the profitability of marketed products due to profit sharing or royalty payments. We actively pursue such arrangements and view alliances as an important complement to our own discovery, development and commercialization activities.\n\nOur alliance arrangements contain customary early termination provisions following material breaches, bankruptcy or product safety concerns. Such arrangements also typically provide for termination by BMS without cause. The amount of notice required for early termination generally ranges from immediately upon notice to 180 days after receipt of notice. Termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or if a material safety issue arises with a product such that the medical risk/benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patients to continue to develop or commercialize the product. Termination with a notice period is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed and has not been dismissed, a material breach by a party has occurred and not been cured or where BMS terminates without cause. Sometimes, BMS's right to terminate without cause may only be exercisable after a specified period of time has elapsed after the alliance agreement is signed. Our alliances typically do not otherwise contain provisions that provide the other party the right to terminate the alliance.\n\nWe typically do not retain any rights to another party's product or intellectual property after an alliance terminates. The loss of rights to one or more products that are marketed and sold by us pursuant to an alliance could be material to our results of operations and the loss of cash flows caused by such loss of rights could be material to our financial condition and liquidity. Alliance agreements may be structured to terminate on specific dates, upon the product's patent expiration date or without an expiry date. Profit sharing payments typically have no expiration date while royalty payments typically cease upon loss of market exclusivity, including patent expiration.\n\nRefer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Alliances' for further information on our most significant alliance agreements as well as other alliance agreements.\n\n## Marketing, Distribution and Customers\n\nWe promote the appropriate use of our products directly to healthcare professionals and organizations such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, technologists, hospitals, PBMs and MCOs. We also provide information about the appropriate use of our products to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer  print,  radio,  television  and  digital  advertising  and  promotion.  In  addition,  we  sponsor  general  advertising  to  educate  the  public  about  our innovative medical research and corporate mission.  For a discussion of the regulation of promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, refer to '-G overnment Regulation' below.\n\nThrough our field sales and medical organizations, we explain the risks and benefits of the approved uses of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain access for our products on formularies and reimbursement plans (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans, by providing information about the clinical profiles of our products. Our marketing and sales of prescription pharmaceuticals is limited to the approved uses of the particular product, but we continue to develop scientific data and other information about potential additional uses of our products and provide such information as scientific ex change at scientific congresses or we share information about our products in other appropriate ways, including the development of publications, or in response to unsolicited inquiries from doctors, other medical professionals and MCOs.\n\nOur operations include several marketing and sales organizations. Each product marketing organization is supported by a sales force, which is responsible for selling one or more products. We also have marketing organizations that focus on certain classes of customers such as managed care entities or certain types of marketing tools, such as digital or consumer communications. Our sales forces focus on communicating information about new approved products or uses, as well as approved uses of established products, and promotion to physicians is increasingly targeted at physician specialists who treat the patients in need of our medicines.",

      "answer": "J&J's Innovative Medicine segment incurred a one-time $1.25 billion in-process R&D expense in 2024 to secure rights to the NM 26 bispecific antibody, reflecting a targeted investment in a specific high-potential asset. Meanwhile, Bristol Myers Squibb reported a $1.9 billion (20%) overall increase in R&D expense, driven by broader drug development costs, recent acquisitions, and $900 million in IPRD impairment charges. This suggests that while both companies are increasing investment in R&D, J&J is making focused, high-value bets on specific compounds, whereas BMY is expanding across a broader portfolio, including through acquisitions and pipeline development.",

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&amp;D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV  development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2024 was recorded in Restructuring on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs, asset impairments and asset divestments. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments.

CVS's intersegment eliminations represented 4.1% of its consolidated revenues of $17,312 million, whereas Thermo Fisher's eliminations represented 7.7% of its consolidated revenues of $39,211 million.

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "How did the trend in Thermo Fisher's adjusted operating income exclusions for acquisition-related costs in 2022 impact the comparison of its core operating performance to CVS's Corporate & Other segment, which reported a $1,471 million adjusted operating loss in 2021?",
      "answer": "Thermo Fisher excluded significant acquisition-related costs from its adjusted operating income in 2022, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at acquisition and transaction costs, which management does not consider indicative of normal operating costs. This exclusion allows investors to assess the company's core performance without these one-time expenses. In contrast, CVS's Corporate & Other segment reported a $1,471 million adjusted operating loss in 2021, which reflects ongoing corporate-level costs not allocated to operating segments. Comparing Thermo Fisher\u2019s adjusted operating income\u2014stripped of acquisition costs\u2014to CVS\u2019s Corporate & Other segment highlights how each company defines and reports its core operational efficiency, with Thermo Fisher emphasizing normalized performance and CVS reflecting structural corporate costs in its adjusted metric.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\n\nDuring 2021, issuance of senior notes provided $18.14 billion of cash. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "question": "How did the growth in CVS's Consumer Health segment in 2021, driven by OTC test kits and front store sales, compare to Johnson & Johnson's investment levels in its Consumer Health division in terms of capital expenditures, and what might this indicate about their strategic focus in the sector?",
      "answer": "CVS's Consumer Health segment saw strong growth in 2021, with front store same-store sales increasing 7.6%, primarily driven by the sale of OTC test kits and increased beauty and personal care sales. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson reported $331 million in additions to Property, Plant & Equipment for its Consumer Health segment in 2021, down from $328 million in 2019 but up from $248 million in 2020. This suggests that while CVS was capitalizing on consumer demand through existing retail infrastructure and product mix, J&J maintained a more stable but modest capital investment approach in its Consumer Health business.",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

      "question": "How does the 75% increase in ABBV's Botox Therapeutic revenues from neuroscience applications compare to AMGN's strategic focus on neuroscience, considering the impact of neuroscience-focused product portfolios on each company's growth?",
      "answer": "ABBV's Botox Therapeutic revenues increased by 75% in 2021, largely due to recovery from the pandemic and the inclusion of Allergan results for a full period. This growth highlights the importance of neuroscience applications in ABBV's therapeutic portfolio. AMGN, on the other hand, explicitly lists neuroscience as one of its six core commercial areas, indicating a strategic emphasis on this therapeutic segment. Given that neuroscience plays a key role in both companies' portfolios, the difference lies in ABBV's revenue surge being driven by external factors like the pandemic recovery, while AMGN's approach is more about deliberate pipeline development and market positioning. This suggests that while both companies are significantly involved in neuroscience, their growth dynamics in this segment are shaped by different strategic and operational levers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Overview\n\nAmgen is a biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential.\n\nOur  principal  products  are  ENBREL,  Prolia,  Otezla,  XGEVA,  Neulasta, Aranesp,  Repatha,  KYPROLIS  and  Nplate.  We  also market  a  number  of  other  products,  including  MVASI,  Vectibix,  KANJINTI,  EVENITY,  EPOGEN,  BLINCYTO,  AMGEVITA, Aimovig, Parsabiv, NEUPOGEN, LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, Sensipar/Mimpara and TEZSPIRE. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.\n\nOur strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, CV disease, nephrology and neuroscience. And we conduct discovery  research  primarily  in  three  therapeutic  areas:  inflammation,  oncology/hematology  and  general  medicine.  In  2021,  we advanced our innovative pipeline, launched new products, completed several strategic transactions to augment our pipeline and research capabilities,  and  continued  providing  uninterrupted  supplies  of  our  medicines  globally  through  the  second  year  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation and while advancing our ESG efforts.\n\nIn 2021, we continued to advance our pipeline, including achieving key regulatory approvals for LUMAKRAS and TEZSPIRE. Our  external  business  development  activities  for  2021  included:  (i)  acquiring  Five  Prime,  including  a  later-stage  gastric  cancer bemarituzumab program; (ii) entering into a license agreement with KKC to develop a later-stage molecule for atopic dermatitis and other diseases; and (iii) acquiring Teneobio for its proprietary technologies and oncology programs in development. We also continued to  advance  our  biosimilar  program  with  the  launch  of  RIABNI  in  the  United  States  and  introduced  our  other  biosimilars  into  new markets. Our biosimilars are expected to continue launching in new markets throughout 2022.\n\nDuring 2021, while meeting the challenges of a global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars and generics, total  product  sales  were  relatively  flat  as  volume  growth  was  offset  by  lower  net  selling  prices.  Product  sales  decreased  4%  in  the United  States,  driven  by  lower  net  selling  prices,  partially  offset  by  volume  growth,  and  increased  12%  ROW,  driven  by  volume growth, partially offset by lower net selling prices. Total operating expenses increased 13%, driven by IPR&amp;D expense from the Five Prime acquisition and the upfront payment associated with the KKC licensing agreement.\n\nCash flows from operating activities totaled $9.3 billion, which supported investment in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2021, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.76 per share of common stock. In December 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $1.94 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2022, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2022. We also repurchased 21.7 million shares of our common stock during 2021 at an aggregate cost of $5.0 billion. In 2021, we issued $4.9 billion and repaid $4.2 billion of debt that was coming due in 2022.\n\nAmgen's approach to, and investment in, human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating, developing and retaining  talent  to  tackle  the  challenges  of  running  an  enterprise  focused  on  the  discovery,  development  and  commercialization  of innovative  medicines.  Our  compensation,  benefits  and  development  programs  are  designed  to  encourage  performance,  promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and align with the interests of the Company's shareholders. Further, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. We are engaging in activities and setting goals to improve our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1. Business-Human Capital Resources.\n\nWe have a long-standing ambition to be environmentally responsible, and we regularly set targets to challenge ourselves to deliver further improvements. In 2020, we met or exceeded our environmental sustainability targets set out in 2013 that called for reducing fleet carbon output by up to 20%, facility carbon output by 10%, water consumption by 10% and waste disposal by 35%.  We achieved our 2020 targets while growing revenues, increasing production capacity and expanding to approximately 100 countries over the same 2013-20 period. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%. 2 2, 3\n\nRepresents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects, and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the Company. 2\n\nCarbon neutrality goal refers to Scope 1 and 2. 3",

For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration.

The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "answer": "AMGN's reliance on third-party suppliers for critical medical devices such as the SureClick autoinjector introduces significant supply chain risk, as these components are often sourced from sole providers and are not easily replaceable without regulatory delays. This dependency amplifies AMGN's vulnerability to disruptions, such as those caused by natural disasters or pandemics, which could materially affect product supply and sales. In contrast, JNJ\u2019s Medical Devices segment reported an income before tax of $4,373 million in 2021, indicating a robust and diversified operational structure that likely mitigates such risks more effectively. Therefore, while AMGN faces higher operational risk due to supplier concentration, JNJ's financial performance in the same domain suggests a more resilient supply chain posture.",

          "chunk_text": "to date, been significantly affected by these natural disasters, the unreliability of the electric service, the ILA strike or the COVID-19 pandemic, a combination of these challenges or other issues that could give rise to any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\nHurricane Maria, the earthquakes of early 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have placed greater stress on the island's already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the PROMESA, which established the FOMBPR to provide fiscal oversight. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including  a  stay  of  debtholder  litigation.  In  2017,  the  FOMBPR  approved  and  certified  the  filing  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the District  of  Puerto  Rico  of  a  voluntary  petition  under  Title  III  of  PROMESA  for  the  government  of  Puerto  Rico  and  certain  of  its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which recently privatized its transmission and distribution infrastructure. After years of negotiations with bondholders and other creditors, the FOMBPR reached an agreement with the same and presented a Plan of Adjustment to the Title III Court. The Plan of Adjustment requires the Puerto Rico government to enact legislation authorizing the issuance of new bonds in exchange for older bonds and a reduction of the U.S. territory's debt. On October 26, 2021, Act 53-2021, known as the 'Law to End the Bankruptcy of Puerto Rico,' was enacted. From November to December 2021, the Court held several hearings regarding the approval of the Plan of Adjustment, and the Modified Eighth Plan of Adjustment was confirmed by the Court on January 18, 2022, to be effective on March 15, 2022.\n\nEach year since 2017, the FOMBPR has updated Puerto Rico's fiscal plans implementing various measures intended to achieve fiscal responsibility and to restore Puerto Rico's access to the capital markets, including significant expense reductions and suggested measures for economic growth. Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Rico's challenging economic and demographic trends. However, the government has not made significant progress during 2021 on the implementation of the fiscal and structural reforms required in the fiscal plan, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile  the  government  and  the  FOMBPR  have  authorized  emergency  relief  packages  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  it  is uncertain  how,  or  the  degree  to  which,  the  pandemic  will  impact  Puerto  Rico's  fiscal  and  structural  reforms  and  its  economy.  In addition, the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced rate. Given Puerto Rico's challenged economy, disaster recovery needs and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to Puerto Rico's economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation.\n\nWhile PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, Puerto Rico's ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters, the unreliability of its  electric  system, the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government's provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales.\n\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\n\nWe  rely  on  unaffiliated  third-party  suppliers  for  certain  raw  materials,  medical  devices  and  components  necessary  for  the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, we rely on a single source for the SureClick autoinjectors used in the drug delivery of Repatha, ENBREL, Aimovig, AMGEVITA and Aranesp. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.\n\nAmong the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:\n\n- regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;\n- adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;\n- unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;",

Accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. All the sites  have  and  will  continue  to  operate  up  through  the  respective  closure  dates  and,  since  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  are sufficient to recover the respective book values, Merck is recording accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life of the site assets. Anticipated site closure dates, particularly related to manufacturing locations, have been and may continue to be adjusted to reflect changes resulting from regulatory or other factors.\n\nOther activity in 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes asset abandonment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as pretax  gains  and  losses  resulting  from  the  sales  of  facilities  and  related  assets.

      "answer": "UNH's acquired finite-lived intangible assets have a weighted-average useful life of 9 years (down from 13 years in 2022), which directly affects the pace of amortization and associated expense recognition. Meanwhile, GILD applies a maximum useful life of 35 years for buildings and improvements - a much longer duration than UNH's intangible assets. This difference suggests GILD may recognize depreciation expenses over longer periods for physical assets compared to UNH's amortization schedule for acquired intangibles, potentially resulting in different patterns of expense recognition and asset turnover metrics between the two companies.",

      "answer": "Merck's 5.9-year expected life of stock options suggests that employees are anticipated to exercise their options relatively sooner, potentially indicating a shorter-term incentive structure or higher employee turnover during the vesting period. In contrast, Bristol-Myers Squibb's 8-year average employee tenure reflects a more stable workforce with longer-term employment, which could support a more extended realization period for equity compensation. The difference may indicate that Merck's equity incentives are structured with a near-to-medium-term focus, while BMY's longer employee tenure could align better with multi-year stock option holding periods. This distinction, connected through the conceptual link that expected life depends on how long employees are anticipated to hold their options, suggests differing philosophies in how each company uses equity compensation to support talent retention strategies.",

Pollution controls and permits are required for many of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal or revocation by the issuing authorities.\n\nOur environment, occupational health, safety and sustainability group monitors our operations around the world, providing us with an  overview  of  regulatory  requirements  and  overseeing  the  implementation  of  our  standards  for  compliance.  We  also  incur operating and capital costs for such matters on an ongoing basis, which were not material for 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, we invested in projects that reduce resource use of energy and water. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the permits required for our operations, we nevertheless could incur additional costs, including civil or criminal fines or penalties, clean-up costs or third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, for violations or liabilities under these laws.\n\nMany of our current and former facilities have been in operation for many years, and over time, we and other operators of those facilities have generated, used, stored or disposed of substances or wastes that are considered hazardous under Federal, state and/or foreign environmental laws, including CERCLA. As a result, the soil and groundwater at or under certain of these facilities is or may  be  contaminated,  and  we  may  be  required  to  make  significant  expenditures  to  investigate,  control  and  remediate  such contamination, and in some cases to provide compensation and/or restoration for damages to natural resources. Currently, we are involved in investigation and remediation at 16 current or former facilities. We have also been identified as a PRP under applicable laws for environmental conditions at approximately 19 former waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties at which investigation and/or remediation activities are ongoing.\n\nWe may face liability under CERCLA and other Federal, state and foreign laws for the entire cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated  sites,  or  for  natural  resource  damages,  regardless  of  fault  or  ownership  at  the  time  of  the  disposal  or  release.  In addition, at certain sites we bear remediation responsibility pursuant to contractual obligations. Generally, at third-party operator sites  involving multiple PRPs, liability has been or is expected to be apportioned based on the nature and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable PRPs. For additional information about these matters, refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.'\n\n## Human Capital Management and Resources\n\nWe believe that our employees around the world embody our mission to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. Together, their unyielding focus on patients defines our culture.\n\nDemographics : As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 32,200 employees in 45 countries. Approximately 58% of our employees are located in the U.S. (excluding Puerto Rico) and 42% are located outside of the U.S. We supplement our employee population with independent contractors, contingent workers and temporary workforce support as needed. The average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years.\n\nPeople  Strategy :  Our  people  are  the  heart  and  soul  of  our  globally  unified  culture.  Our  People  Strategy  is  designed  to  inspire individuals and encourage teams to work together for our patients and our communities. We invest in our workforce through the extensive programs, policies and initiatives described below to accelerate personal development and collaboration in service to our patients  and  we  believe  that  these  investments  are  a  competitive  advantage  in  recruiting  our  future  workforce.  To  accelerate innovation, we strive to match the diverse knowledge, skills and capabilities of our talented employee community to our business needs. The following programs, policies and initiatives encompass some of the objectives and measures that we continue to focus on as part of our People Strategy\n\n- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion : Through a culture of inclusion, we foster a diverse mosaic of people that seek to mirror our  patients  and  communities  worldwide  and  create  an  agile  and  responsive  work  environment.  The  diversity  of  our people and their unique perspectives and experiences help us achieve our patient-focused mission and business objectives. We believe that our inclusive culture encourages all to pursue innovative ideas, develop leadership capabilities and gain valuable experiences to shape exciting careers. We have implemented measures that provide accountability for continually increasing our diversity. Our commitment to attracting diverse talent includes training our workforce in diversity sourcing strategies and partnering with external local and national organizations that develop and supply diverse talent, such as the United Negro College Fund, Inc., Prospanica, Ascend, Inc. and Women of Color in Pharma.",

In contrast, AMGN does not bear direct regulatory costs for medical devices but faces indirect risks through its reliance on third-party suppliers, such as the single-source provider of SureClick autoinjectors used in multiple drug delivery systems. These suppliers must meet stringent regulatory standards, and any disruption\u2014whether due to supplier financial instability, regulatory action, or supply shortages\u2014could materially affect AMGN\u2019s product supply and sales. While JNJ absorbs regulatory costs internally, AMGN\u2019s exposure is channeled through its supply chain dependencies, making the nature and risk profile of regulatory compliance fundamentally different between the two companies.",

          "chunk_text": "to date, been significantly affected by these natural disasters, the unreliability of the electric service, the ILA strike or the COVID-19 pandemic, a combination of these challenges or other issues that could give rise to any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales.\n\nHurricane Maria, the earthquakes of early 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have placed greater stress on the island's already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the PROMESA, which established the FOMBPR to provide fiscal oversight. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including  a  stay  of  debtholder  litigation.  In  2017,  the  FOMBPR  approved  and  certified  the  filing  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the District  of  Puerto  Rico  of  a  voluntary  petition  under  Title  III  of  PROMESA  for  the  government  of  Puerto  Rico  and  certain  of  its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which recently privatized its transmission and distribution infrastructure. After years of negotiations with bondholders and other creditors, the FOMBPR reached an agreement with the same and presented a Plan of Adjustment to the Title III Court. The Plan of Adjustment requires the Puerto Rico government to enact legislation authorizing the issuance of new bonds in exchange for older bonds and a reduction of the U.S. territory's debt. On October 26, 2021, Act 53-2021, known as the 'Law to End the Bankruptcy of Puerto Rico,' was enacted. From November to December 2021, the Court held several hearings regarding the approval of the Plan of Adjustment, and the Modified Eighth Plan of Adjustment was confirmed by the Court on January 18, 2022, to be effective on March 15, 2022.\n\nEach year since 2017, the FOMBPR has updated Puerto Rico's fiscal plans implementing various measures intended to achieve fiscal responsibility and to restore Puerto Rico's access to the capital markets, including significant expense reductions and suggested measures for economic growth. Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Rico's challenging economic and demographic trends. However, the government has not made significant progress during 2021 on the implementation of the fiscal and structural reforms required in the fiscal plan, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile  the  government  and  the  FOMBPR  have  authorized  emergency  relief  packages  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  it  is uncertain  how,  or  the  degree  to  which,  the  pandemic  will  impact  Puerto  Rico's  fiscal  and  structural  reforms  and  its  economy.  In addition, the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced rate. Given Puerto Rico's challenged economy, disaster recovery needs and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to Puerto Rico's economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation.\n\nWhile PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, Puerto Rico's ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters, the unreliability of its  electric  system, the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government's provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales.\n\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\n\nWe  rely  on  unaffiliated  third-party  suppliers  for  certain  raw  materials,  medical  devices  and  components  necessary  for  the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, we rely on a single source for the SureClick autoinjectors used in the drug delivery of Repatha, ENBREL, Aimovig, AMGEVITA and Aranesp. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.\n\nAmong the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:\n\n- regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;\n- adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;\n- unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;",

      "question": "How did the $1.1 billion contingent consideration reversal tied to Auris Health's developmental milestones impact JNJ's Medical Devices segment financial flexibility, and what specific CVS offerings in the same space could constrain or complement JNJ's strategic positioning in that market?",
      "answer": "The $1.1 billion contingent consideration reversal in JNJ's Medical Devices segment, related to the timing of developmental milestones from the Auris Health acquisition, improved the segment\u2019s near-term financial flexibility by reducing previously accrued liabilities. This allowed JNJ to potentially reallocate capital toward innovation or market expansion. Meanwhile, CVS offers a range of health services, including virtual primary care and in-person care at MinuteClinic and CVS HealthHUB locations, which integrate with broader health plans and may incorporate medical devices in care delivery. These offerings could either constrain JNJ\u2019s market access if CVS favors competing suppliers or complement JNJ\u2019s product portfolio if JNJ\u2019s devices are integrated into CVS\u2019s care models.",

The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, governmentsponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Products and Services\n\nThe Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' Health Care Benefits products and services consist of the following:\n\n- Commercial Medical : The Health Care Benefits segment offers point-of-service ('POS'), preferred provider organization ('PPO'), health maintenance organization ('HMO') and indemnity benefit ('Indemnity') plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts ('HSAs') and consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). With the launch of Aetna Virtual Primary Care in 2021, eligible members now have access to health services remotely, paired with access to in-person visits with providers in the Company's network, including at MinuteClinic and CVS HealthHUB  locations. Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to self-insure their health benefits. Under medical stop loss insurance products, the Company assumes risk for costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within an employer's plan above a pre-set annual threshold. The segment also has a portfolio of additional health products and services that complement its medical products such as dental plans, behavioral health and employee assistance products, provider network access and vision products. TM \u00ae \u00ae\n- Government Medical : In select geographies, the Health Care Benefits segment offers Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Supplement plans and prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries; participates in Medicaid and subsidized Children's Health Insurance Programs ('CHIP'); and participates in demonstration projects for members who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid ('Duals'). These Government Medical products are further described below:\n- Medicare Advantage: Through annual contracts with the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ('CMS'), the Company offers HMO and PPO products for eligible individuals in certain geographic areas through the Medicare Advantage program. Members typically receive enhanced benefits over traditional fee-for-service Medicare coverage ('Original Medicare'), including reduced cost-sharing for preventive care, vision and other services. The Company offered network-based HMO and/or PPO plans in 46 states and Washington, D.C. in 2021. For certain qualifying employer groups, the Company offers Medicare PPO products nationally. When combined with the Company's PDP product, these national PPO plans form an integrated national Insured Medicare product for employers that provides medical and pharmacy benefits.\n- Medicare PDP: The Company is a national provider of drug benefits under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. All Medicare eligible individuals are eligible to participate in this voluntary prescription drug plan. Members typically receive coverage for certain prescription drugs, usually subject to a deductible, co-insurance and/or co-payment. The Company offered PDP plans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. in 2021. On November 30, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the standalone PDPs of Aetna, Inc. ('Aetna') to WellCare Health Plans, Inc. effective December 31, 2018. The Company provided administrative services to, and retained the financial results of, the divested plans through 2019. Subsequent to 2019, the Company no longer retains the financial results of the divested plans.\n- Medicare Supplement: For certain Medicare eligible members, the Company offers supplemental coverage for certain health care costs not covered by Original Medicare. The products included in the Medicare Supplement portfolio help to cover some of the gaps in Original Medicare, and include coverage for Medicare deductibles and coinsurance amounts. The Company offered a wide selection of Medicare Supplement products in 49 states and Washington, D.C. in 2021.\n- Medicaid and CHIP: The Company offers health care management services to individuals eligible for Medicaid and CHIP under multi-year contracts with government agencies in various states that are subject to annual appropriations. CHIP are state-subsidized insurance programs that provide benefits for families with uninsured children. The Company offered these services on an Insured or ASC basis in 16 states in 2021.\n- Duals: The Company provides health coverage to beneficiaries who are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. These members must meet certain income and resource requirements in order to qualify for",

      "question": "How does the change in Pfizer's International Segment goodwill balance from 2021 to 2022 compare to UnitedHealth's overall goodwill balance in 2021, considering the scale and strategic importance of their respective international operations?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's International Segment goodwill balance decreased from $3,148.3 million in 2021 to $2,756.7 million in 2022, a decline of $391.6 million. In contrast, UnitedHealth reported a goodwill balance of $76 billion as of December 31, 2021. While Pfizer's international goodwill saw a significant reduction, it remains a much smaller component of its overall asset base compared to UnitedHealth, where goodwill is a dominant balance sheet item, reflecting the differing strategic roles of international operations in each company's broader portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PFE \u2192 International Segment: Pfizer's International Segment goodwill was $3,148.3 million in 2021 and dropped to $2,756.7 million in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: International Segment \u2192 Goodwill Balance: The International Segment's goodwill balance is a key financial metric that reflects Pfizer's investment in international markets.",
        "Hop 3: Goodwill Balance \u2190 UNH: UnitedHealth's goodwill balance was $76 billion as of December 31, 2021, indicating a much larger scale of intangible assets tied to acquisitions and market positioning."

As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company performs an annual impairment test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate group of peer companies whose securities are traded on an active market. The annual impairment test indicated that the fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date; therefore, no impairment was recognized.\n\nWe identified a critical audit matter related to the quantitative analysis performed for such reporting units because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to peer company selection and financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation, business, and market assumptions including the discount rate, financial forecasts, and peer group used by management to estimate the fair value of reporting units where a quantitative analysis was performed, included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's annual goodwill impairment assessment, including those over the determination of the fair value such as controls related to management's financial forecasts, as well as controls over the selection of discount rates, company specific risks, peer companies, and market multiples.\n- We evaluated management's ability to forecast and meet future revenue, medical cost trend, and operating costs by comparing:\n- Actual results to historical forecasts.\n- Forecasted information to: internal communications to management and the Board of Directors, industry and economic trends, and analyst reports of revenue and earnings expectations for the Company and its peers.\n- We evaluated the impact of changes in management's forecasts from the October 1, 2021 annual measurement date to December 31, 2021.\n- We evaluated management's selection of peer companies and market multiples.\n- With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of (1) the valuation methodologies, including testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculation, (2) the weighting of such valuation methodologies, and (3) discount rate and company specific risks by:\n- Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n- Developing a range of independent discount rate estimates and comparing to those selected by management.\n\n## /S/ DELOITTE &amp; TOUCHE LLP\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

      "answer": "The $1.4 million increase in DHR's Life Sciences segment goodwill from the Aldevron Acquisition contrasts with the $391.6 million decrease in international goodwill reported by SBUX, highlighting divergent trends in international segment valuations. Meanwhile, Amgen\u2019s foreign operations remain subject to U.S. repatriation tax, indicating ongoing financial exposure tied to international goodwill balances. This suggests that while some firms are adding to goodwill via acquisitions, others are experiencing write-downs or revaluations in their international segments, which may be influenced by global economic conditions and tax policies.",

      "question": "How do the impacts of curtailments and settlements on net periodic benefit credits differ between LLY and MDT, given LLY's retirement plan tax benefits and MDT's pension settlements activity in 2024?",
      "answer": "LLY experienced a $2 million charge from curtailments and settlements in 2024, contributing to its overall $222 million net periodic benefit credit. In contrast, MDT reported no curtailments or settlements in 2024, but had $7 million in plan settlements in non-U.S. pension benefits, which contributed to a more stable funded status compared to previous years. This shows that while both companies manage pension liabilities, LLY had a minor cost impact from restructuring activities, whereas MDT focused on settling existing liabilities without major restructuring charges.",

        "Hop 1: LLY \u2192 Retirement Plans: LLY reported a $133.2 million tax expense related to retirement benefit plans in 2024, indicating significant liability exposure.",

        "Hop 3: Curtailments & Settlements \u2190 MDT: MDT disclosed $7 million in plan settlements under non-U.S. pension benefits in 2024, with no curtailment charges, indicating a different approach to managing pension liabilities."

      "answer": "Merck shares development costs and profits equally with Moderna for mRNA-4157, which resulted in a $250 million payment and $198 million in capitalized facility costs in 2024 (Hop 1). This collaboration structure directly affects Merck's pharmaceutical segment profitability, which grew 15% in 2024 despite higher administrative costs and foreign exchange headwinds (Hop 2). In contrast, Gilead maintains full ownership of its pharmaceutical segment, suggesting a different risk and reward profile compared to Merck\u2019s shared approach, which could influence long-term profitability stability and investment flexibility (Hop 3).",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in 'Non-segment activity' in the above table. A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "question": "How did the increases in discount rates in 2021 affect Danaher's pension obligations compared to Johnson & Johnson's retirement plan actuarial gains, and what does this reveal about their respective pension liability sensitivities to interest rate changes?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Danaher reported that increases in discount rates were the largest contributor to net actuarial gains affecting its U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, directly reducing its projected benefit obligations. Similarly, Johnson & Johnson noted that the actuarial gain for its retirement plans in 2021 was primarily driven by increases in discount rates. Both companies demonstrated sensitivity in pension liabilities to interest rate fluctuations, with actuarial gains reducing the present value of liabilities, though neither company quantified the exact dollar impact. This reveals a shared exposure to discount rate volatility in pension accounting.",

      "answer": "The comparability of core operational performance between CVS and TMO could be significantly affected due to differing levels of transparency in reporting Intersegment Eliminations. CVS explicitly discloses that in 2019, its Adjusted Operating Income included a $697 million reduction from Intersegment Eliminations, which allows analysts to isolate and assess the true profitability of its business segments. In contrast, TMO reports Adjusted Operating Income as a non-GAAP measure but does not specify whether or how much Intersegment Eliminations are factored into the metric. This lack of granularity in TMO\u2019s reporting makes it more difficult to compare the underlying operational efficiency of its business segments directly with those of CVS.

At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

      "answer": "In 2024, Merck's pharmaceutical segment profits grew by 15%, with the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange mentioned as a partial offset. This growth figure is calculated as segment sales less standard costs and directly incurred SG&A expenses. Johnson & Johnson, while also reporting under standard cost structures in its pharmaceutical segment, does not quantify the FX impact in its disclosed segment performance metrics. Therefore, while both companies apply standard cost frameworks to measure pharmaceutical segment profitability, only Merck explicitly quantifies the FX impact on its 15% profit growth, leaving JNJ's FX sensitivity within its pharmaceutical segment unspecified.",

The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "question": "How might the difference in the 2023 rate of compensation increase between Medtronic (3.90%) and Eli Lilly (4.3%) impact their respective pension liabilities, given that both companies use this metric in calculating benefit obligations?",
      "answer": "Medtronic disclosed a 2023 rate of compensation increase at 3.90%, while Eli Lilly reported a higher rate of 4.3% for the same period. Since both companies use the rate of compensation increase as a critical assumption in calculating their pension benefit obligations, the higher rate at Eli Lilly could lead to higher projected pension liabilities compared to Medtronic, assuming other assumptions remain constant. This is because a higher compensation growth rate increases the projected future benefit payouts, which are then discounted to present value in liability calculations.",

        "Hop 1: MDT \u2192 Compensation Increase Rate: Medtronic disclosed a 3.90% rate of compensation increase for 2023 in its pension benefit obligations calculation.",

      "answer": "JNJ reports a weighted average amortization period of 11 years for patents and trademarks, and 19 years for customer relationships, with $4.5 billion in amortization expense in 2023. In contrast, AMGN allocated $991 million specifically to IPR&D as part of an acquisition, which is not subject to amortization as indicated in the AVGO evidence where IPR&D has an 'N/A' amortization period. This suggests that while JNJ emphasizes amortization timelines in its asset expense planning, AMGN places significant value on non-amortizable IPR&D, reflecting different strategic approaches to intangible asset allocation.",

      "answer": "LLY experienced a $753 million loss from equity investments in 2024, which directly impacted its post-employment benefits liability, suggesting potential funding shortfalls tied to investment performance. In contrast, ABBV accrues post-employment costs over employees' service lives and separately incurred $425 million in defined contribution plan expenses in 2024, reflecting a more predictable, cash-funded model.

Any change in recorded v alue is recorded in other-net, (income) expense.\n- Our public equity inv estments are measured and carried at fair v alue. Any change in fair v alue is recognized in other-net, (income) expense.\n\nWe adjust our equity inv estments without readily determinable fair v alues based upon changes in the equity instruments' v alues resulting from observ able price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar inv estment of the same issuer. Downward adjustments resulting from an impairment are recorded based upon impairment considerations, including the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, general market conditions, and industry specific factors. Adjustments recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were not material.\n\nThe net losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for equity securities were $49.5 million, $20.2 million, and $410.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectiv ely. The net gains (losses) recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 on equity securities sold during the respectiv e periods were not material.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $899 million of unfunded commitments to inv est in v enture capital funds, which we anticipate will be paid ov er a period of up to 10 years.\n\nWe record our av ailable-for-sale debt securities at fair v alue, with changes in fair v alue reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensiv e income (loss). We periodically assess our inv estment in av ailable-for-sale securities for impairment losses and credit losses. The amount of credit losses is determined by comparing the difference between the present v alue of future cash flows expected to be collected on these securities and the amortized cost. Factors considered in assessing credit losses include the position in the capital structure, v intage and amount of collateral, delinquency rates, current credit support, and geographic concentration. Impairment and credit losses related to av ailable-for-sale securities were not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n\nThe table below summarizes the contractual maturities of our inv estments in debt securities measured at fair v alue as of December 31, 2024:\n\n",

The expense recognized for these plans was $425 million in 2024, $398 million in 2023 and $474 million in 2022. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees.\n\n## Note 13 Equity\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nIn May 2021, stockholders of the company approved the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program (the Amended Plan), which amends and restates the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP). AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the Amended Plan, which provides for several different forms of benefits, including non-qualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the Amended Plan, a total of 144 million shares of AbbVie common stock have been reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees.\n\nAbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

      "question": "How does the proportion of Medtronic's cost of products sold relative to total operating costs compare to UnitedHealth's implied product cost structure, considering both companies disclose different components under operating costs?",
      "answer": "Medtronic's cost of products sold in 2024 was $11,216 million, which represents approximately 45% of its total operating costs of $24,913 million (sum of cost of products sold, R&D, SG&A, amortization, restructuring, litigation, and other operating expenses). UnitedHealth does not explicitly disclose its cost of products sold, but it reports total operating costs of $4,652 million for 2024, which includes medical costs, operating costs, cost of products sold, and depreciation and amortization. Given UnitedHealth's broader healthcare services model, its cost of products sold is likely a smaller proportion compared to Medtronic's, which is a medical device manufacturer with higher direct production costs.",

        "Hop 1: MDT \u2192 Cost of Products Sold: Medtronic discloses its 2024 cost of products sold as $11,216 million, a significant component of its operating expenses.",

MRK's 2024 pharmaceutical segment profits were $44,533 million, a figure that does not include these excluded costs, which are managed separately. Since JNJ does not provide similar detailed exclusions or profitability metrics for its pharmaceutical segment, a direct comparison of segment profitability between JNJ and MRK is limited, making it difficult to assess how their respective cost allocation methodologies affect the true financial performance of their pharmaceutical divisions.",

For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

As a result, Tmunity became our wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nWe accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded a $244 million charge to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2023. The remaining purchase price related to various other assets acquired and liabilities assumed, consisting primarily of deferred tax assets. Under the agreement, the former shareholders of Tmunity and the University of Pennsylvania are eligible to receive a mix of up to approximately $1.0 billion in potential future payments upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales-based milestones, as well as royalty payments on sales, with the first $25 million of milestones charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses in 2023 and paid in January 2024. In 2024, we paid an additional $47 million for development milestones met, which was charged to Acquired in-process research and development expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n## MiroBio\n\nIn September 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of MiroBio Ltd.

          "chunk_text": "our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. For 2022, those forecasts include adjustments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing, vaccines, direct COVID-19 treatment and deferred care. Risk-adjusted revenue has been adjusted for deferred care, and forecasted enrollment considers assumptions about the economic environment, though COVID-19 related impacts remain uncertain. During periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19, accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricing for our (and our self-insured customers') medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging. There can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and our health care and other benefit costs (including COVID-19 related testing and vaccination and post-acute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs) are affected by COVID-19 and other external events over which we have no control. Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment's operating results.\n\nA number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs, including COVID-19, previously uninsured members entering the health care system, changes in members' behavior and health care utilization patterns, turnover in our membership, additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes (including under the Families First Act, the CARES Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act), changes in the health status of our members, the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology, increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies), direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers, the increasing influence of social media on our members' health care utilization and other behaviors, changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employment levels). In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this problem. Other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include epidemics or other pandemics, changes as a result of the ACA, changes to the ACA and other changes in the regulatory environment, the evolution toward a consumer driven business model, new technologies, influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we expected), clusters of high-cost cases, health care provider and member fraud, and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season had an earlier than average start and had a higher incidence of influenza than the 20182019 influenza season.\n\nOur Health Care Benefits segment's operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results.\n\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks are particularly acute during periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19. Such risks are further magnified by the ACA and other existing and future legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.\n\nThere can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.\n\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad can materially and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition, and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.\n\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including those caused by COVID-19, can materially and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition, including:",

Since CVS uses a combination of completion factors and assumed health care cost trend rates to estimate its health care costs payable\u2014especially for claims incurred within three months of the financial statement date\u2014this increase could lead to a material upward adjustment in CVS's estimate of claims remaining to be paid.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Business Trends\n\nOur businesses participate in the United States and certain other international health markets. In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\n\nPricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of ex pected future costs, including medical care patterns, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\n\nThe commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.\n\nMedicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in 'Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties' and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in 'Medical Cost Trends.' Our 2025 benefit design approach contemplates these trends.\n\nIn Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.\n\nMedical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. As ex pected and contemplated in our benefits design, we have continued to observe increased care patterns, which may continue in future periods. We also observed an upshift in hospital coding intensity and an acceleration in the prescribing of certain high-cost medications in early response to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). We expect these additional factors to continue into future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.\n\nAs a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack, we incurred medical costs related to the impact of the temporary suspension of some care management activities, impacting our UnitedHealthcare and Optum Health businesses, to help care providers with their workflow processes. Early in the second quarter we resumed these activities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, medical costs related to the temporary suspension of some care management activities were approximately $640 million.\n\nMedicaid Redeterminations. Medicaid redeterminations have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to care. The Medicaid redetermination process has also caused a timing mismatch between the current health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates, which remained well short of current care activity. We expect this gap between people's health status and rates will narrow in 2025.\n\nDelivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration.\n\nThis trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. A key focus of our future growth is to accelerate the transition from fee-for-service care delivery and payment models to fully accountable value-based care. This transition requires initial costs such as system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement. Enhanced clinical engagement is a critical step to improving the ex perience and health outcomes of the people we serve and should result in lower costs to the overall health system over time.",

      "answer": "Merck's Pharmaceutical segment profits grew by 15% in 2024 due to higher sales, which are calculated after subtracting standard costs and directly incurred SG&A expenses. In contrast, Abbott's Established Pharmaceutical Products segment focuses on geographic expansion and continuous improvement of existing products rather than primary research, indicating a strategy more centered on leveraging current assets than on innovation through R&D.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $443 million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $440 million cash tax benefit would be available in a different tax able year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax  law . Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax  Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.\n\nAbbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the  IRS, the  IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax  positions are appropriate.\n\nThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which Abbott expects to be individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate tax ing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules. The enactment of current Pillar 2 model rules did not and is not projected to have a material impact to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n\nSee Note 15 - Taxes on Earnings to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax  rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\n\n## Research and Development Programs\n\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical device, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.\n\n## Research and Development Process\n\nIn  the  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment,  the  development  process  focuses  on  the  geographic  ex pansion  and  continuous  improvement  of  the segment's existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceutical Products does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the completion of an acquisition or licensing agreement.\n\nDepending upon the product, the phases of development may include:\n\n- Drug product development.\n- Phase  I  bioequivalence  studies  to  compare  a  future  Established  Pharmaceutical's  brand  with  an  already  marketed  compound  with  the  same  active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).\n- Phase II studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients.\n- Phase III studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use.\n- Phase IV and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications.\n\nThe specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to six or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries.\n\nIn the Diagnostic Products segment, the phases of the research and development process include:\n\n- Discovery, which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need.\n- Concept/Feasibility, during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated; testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility.\n- Development,  during  which  extensive  testing  is  performed  to  demonstrate  that  the  product  meets  specified  design  requirements  and  that  the  design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses.",

      "question": "How does the contribution of CVS's Pharmacy Services segment to its Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income compare with DHR's long-term financial obligations related to health care benefits, and what does this reveal about their respective business models?",
      "answer": "CVS's Health Care Benefits segment reported $5,012 million in adjusted operating income in 2021, which was significantly supported by the performance of its Pharmacy Services segment, where adjusted operating income increased by $1.2 billion (20.6%) compared to 2020. This growth was driven by improved purchasing economics, including contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy services. In contrast, DHR's health care benefits are primarily related to postretirement employee benefit plans, including health care and life insurance benefits for retired U.S. employees, which represent long-term liabilities rather than profit centers. This reveals that CVS monetizes health care benefits through active service delivery and pharmacy economics, while DHR incurs health care benefits as part of legacy employee obligations, highlighting fundamentally different approaches to health care in their business models.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "Pfizer experienced a favorable channel mix impact on its gross profit margin in 2023, contributing to an increase from 58.1% to 59.5%, partly driven by strong U.S. performance of products like Eliquis and Vyndaqel family, despite steep declines in Comirnaty revenue (-70% globally). In contrast, Danaher's gross profit margin decreased year-over-year, with product mix shifts contributing negatively, including a $87 million charge in Q2 2023 related to excess inventory in its Biotechnology segment due to reduced demand.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PFE \u2192 Channel Mix: Pfizer's Eliquis and Vyndaqel family showed strong U.S. growth (11% and 50% respectively), contributing to a favorable channel mix that increased gross profit margin from 58.1% to 59.5% in 2023, despite significant declines in Comirnaty revenue (-70% globally).",
        "Hop 2: Channel Mix \u2192 Gross Profit Margin: Favorable channel and package mix was explicitly cited as a primary driver of the gross profit margin increase, alongside pricing initiatives, partially offsetting foreign exchange headwinds and higher commodity costs.",
        "Hop 3: DHR \u2190 Gross Profit Margin: Danaher's gross profit margin decreased year-over-year, with product mix shifts identified as a negative factor, including a $87 million charge in Q2 2023 related to excess inventory in the Biotechnology segment due to reduced demand."

      "answer": "CVS's Retail LTC segment contributed $7,623 million in adjusted operating income in 2021, representing a key component of its non-GAAP performance. In contrast, Thermo Fisher's early 2022 share repurchases totaled $2.00 billion, reflecting capital allocation decisions made under its non-GAAP reporting framework that emphasizes adjusted metrics for operational evaluation. While CVS directly ties Retail LTC's profitability to adjusted operating income, Thermo Fisher's repurchase activity indicates confidence in its core earnings strength, as measured by metrics like adjusted operating income.",

On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

      "answer": "BMY's average employee tenure of eight years suggests a relatively stable workforce, which could support a longer expected life assumption for equity grants. This contrasts with UNH's reported expected life of 4.8 years in 2021, which may reflect shorter employee tenure or different industry dynamics.

Pollution controls and permits are required for many of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal or revocation by the issuing authorities.\n\nOur environment, occupational health, safety and sustainability group monitors our operations around the world, providing us with an  overview  of  regulatory  requirements  and  overseeing  the  implementation  of  our  standards  for  compliance.  We  also  incur operating and capital costs for such matters on an ongoing basis, which were not material for 2021, 2020 and 2019. In addition, we invested in projects that reduce resource use of energy and water. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and the permits required for our operations, we nevertheless could incur additional costs, including civil or criminal fines or penalties, clean-up costs or third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, for violations or liabilities under these laws.\n\nMany of our current and former facilities have been in operation for many years, and over time, we and other operators of those facilities have generated, used, stored or disposed of substances or wastes that are considered hazardous under Federal, state and/or foreign environmental laws, including CERCLA. As a result, the soil and groundwater at or under certain of these facilities is or may  be  contaminated,  and  we  may  be  required  to  make  significant  expenditures  to  investigate,  control  and  remediate  such contamination, and in some cases to provide compensation and/or restoration for damages to natural resources. Currently, we are involved in investigation and remediation at 16 current or former facilities. We have also been identified as a PRP under applicable laws for environmental conditions at approximately 19 former waste disposal or reprocessing facilities operated by third parties at which investigation and/or remediation activities are ongoing.\n\nWe may face liability under CERCLA and other Federal, state and foreign laws for the entire cost of investigation or remediation of contaminated  sites,  or  for  natural  resource  damages,  regardless  of  fault  or  ownership  at  the  time  of  the  disposal  or  release.  In addition, at certain sites we bear remediation responsibility pursuant to contractual obligations. Generally, at third-party operator sites  involving multiple PRPs, liability has been or is expected to be apportioned based on the nature and amount of hazardous substances disposed of by each party at the site and the number of financially viable PRPs. For additional information about these matters, refer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 19. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies.'\n\n## Human Capital Management and Resources\n\nWe believe that our employees around the world embody our mission to discover, develop and deliver innovative medicines that help patients prevail over serious diseases. Together, their unyielding focus on patients defines our culture.\n\nDemographics : As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 32,200 employees in 45 countries. Approximately 58% of our employees are located in the U.S. (excluding Puerto Rico) and 42% are located outside of the U.S. We supplement our employee population with independent contractors, contingent workers and temporary workforce support as needed. The average tenure of our employees is approximately eight years.\n\nPeople  Strategy :  Our  people  are  the  heart  and  soul  of  our  globally  unified  culture.  Our  People  Strategy  is  designed  to  inspire individuals and encourage teams to work together for our patients and our communities. We invest in our workforce through the extensive programs, policies and initiatives described below to accelerate personal development and collaboration in service to our patients  and  we  believe  that  these  investments  are  a  competitive  advantage  in  recruiting  our  future  workforce.  To  accelerate innovation, we strive to match the diverse knowledge, skills and capabilities of our talented employee community to our business needs. The following programs, policies and initiatives encompass some of the objectives and measures that we continue to focus on as part of our People Strategy\n\n- Diversity, Equity and Inclusion : Through a culture of inclusion, we foster a diverse mosaic of people that seek to mirror our  patients  and  communities  worldwide  and  create  an  agile  and  responsive  work  environment.  The  diversity  of  our people and their unique perspectives and experiences help us achieve our patient-focused mission and business objectives. We believe that our inclusive culture encourages all to pursue innovative ideas, develop leadership capabilities and gain valuable experiences to shape exciting careers. We have implemented measures that provide accountability for continually increasing our diversity. Our commitment to attracting diverse talent includes training our workforce in diversity sourcing strategies and partnering with external local and national organizations that develop and supply diverse talent, such as the United Negro College Fund, Inc., Prospanica, Ascend, Inc. and Women of Color in Pharma.",

          "chunk_text": "## Alliances\n\nWe enter into alliance arrangements with third parties for the development and commercialization of specific products or drug candidates in our therapeutic areas of focus. Alliances may be structured as co-development, co-commercialization, licensing or joint venture arrangements.  These arrangements may include upfront payments;  option  payments  to  develop  or  commercialize  a  specific  asset  or  technology;  payments  for  various  developmental,  regulatory  and  sales-based performance milestones; royalties; cost reimbursements; profit sharing; and equity investments. Provisions in our alliance arrangements lessen our investment risk for compounds not leading to revenue generating products but reduce the profitability of marketed products due to profit sharing or royalty payments. We actively pursue such arrangements and view alliances as an important complement to our own discovery, development and commercialization activities.\n\nOur alliance arrangements contain customary early termination provisions following material breaches, bankruptcy or product safety concerns. Such arrangements also typically provide for termination by BMS without cause. The amount of notice required for early termination generally ranges from immediately upon notice to 180 days after receipt of notice. Termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or if a material safety issue arises with a product such that the medical risk/benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patients to continue to develop or commercialize the product. Termination with a notice period is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed and has not been dismissed, a material breach by a party has occurred and not been cured or where BMS terminates without cause. Sometimes, BMS's right to terminate without cause may only be exercisable after a specified period of time has elapsed after the alliance agreement is signed. Our alliances typically do not otherwise contain provisions that provide the other party the right to terminate the alliance.\n\nWe typically do not retain any rights to another party's product or intellectual property after an alliance terminates. The loss of rights to one or more products that are marketed and sold by us pursuant to an alliance could be material to our results of operations and the loss of cash flows caused by such loss of rights could be material to our financial condition and liquidity. Alliance agreements may be structured to terminate on specific dates, upon the product's patent expiration date or without an expiry date. Profit sharing payments typically have no expiration date while royalty payments typically cease upon loss of market exclusivity, including patent expiration.\n\nRefer to 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 3. Alliances' for further information on our most significant alliance agreements as well as other alliance agreements.\n\n## Marketing, Distribution and Customers\n\nWe promote the appropriate use of our products directly to healthcare professionals and organizations such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, technologists, hospitals, PBMs and MCOs. We also provide information about the appropriate use of our products to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer  print,  radio,  television  and  digital  advertising  and  promotion.  In  addition,  we  sponsor  general  advertising  to  educate  the  public  about  our innovative medical research and corporate mission.  For a discussion of the regulation of promotion and marketing of pharmaceuticals, refer to '-G overnment Regulation' below.\n\nThrough our field sales and medical organizations, we explain the risks and benefits of the approved uses of our products to medical professionals. We work to gain access for our products on formularies and reimbursement plans (lists of recommended or approved medicines and other products), including Medicare Part D plans, by providing information about the clinical profiles of our products. Our marketing and sales of prescription pharmaceuticals is limited to the approved uses of the particular product, but we continue to develop scientific data and other information about potential additional uses of our products and provide such information as scientific ex change at scientific congresses or we share information about our products in other appropriate ways, including the development of publications, or in response to unsolicited inquiries from doctors, other medical professionals and MCOs.\n\nOur operations include several marketing and sales organizations. Each product marketing organization is supported by a sales force, which is responsible for selling one or more products. We also have marketing organizations that focus on certain classes of customers such as managed care entities or certain types of marketing tools, such as digital or consumer communications. Our sales forces focus on communicating information about new approved products or uses, as well as approved uses of established products, and promotion to physicians is increasingly targeted at physician specialists who treat the patients in need of our medicines.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration.

The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

      "answer": "In 2021, TMO reported intersegment eliminations of $3,010 million, which reduced its consolidated revenues from $42,221 million (sum of all segments) to $39,211 million, indicating significant internal transaction activity between its Life Sciences Solutions, Analytical Instruments, Specialty Diagnostics, and Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segments. At CVS, intersegment eliminations of $711 million were explicitly subtracted from segment-level operating income to arrive at consolidated GAAP operating income of $13,193 million, and were also factored into the calculation of adjusted operating income of $17,312 million. While TMO's eliminations primarily reflect internal revenue offsets in a diversified scientific products and services business, CVS's smaller eliminations suggest less internal cross-segment activity, with adjusted operating income being more directly influenced by external market pressures such as rebate sharing with clients and regulatory changes affecting pharmacy benefit management (PBM) pricing models. This reveals that TMO's internal segment interactions had a larger revenue impact, while CVS's adjusted operating income was more sensitive to external competitive and regulatory forces.",

        "Hop 1: TMO \u2192 Intersegment Eliminations: TMO's 2021 consolidated revenues were reduced by $3,010 million due to intersegment eliminations, showing substantial internal transactions between its four major business segments.",

        "Hop 3: Adjusted Operating Income \u2190 CVS: CVS's adjusted operating income was significantly influenced not just by eliminations but more notably by external factors like rebate sharing, price compression, and regulatory changes in the PBM industry, which impacted how much of rebates and discounts were retained versus passed to clients."

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2023, DHR reported a PBO of $499 million for its Non-U.S. Pension Plans, while PFE reported a PBO of $7.0 billion for its international pension plans. This significant difference suggests that PFE has a much larger long-term liability for non-U.S. pension benefits compared to DHR, indicating a more substantial ongoing financial commitment to international retirees.",

          "chunk_text": "## Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements\n\nIn addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, nonrefundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements-Other Licensing &amp; Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n## Third Party Agreements\n\nAbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption.\n\nAbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements-Other Licensing &amp; Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n## Sources and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nAbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact, except for the previously-disclosed near-term supply issues impacting Lupron. Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand.\n\n## Research and Development Activities\n\nAbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie's existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions.\n\nThe research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:\n\n- Phase 1- involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later phases.\n- Phase 2- tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy.\n- Phase 3- tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval.\n\nPreclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar",

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher excludes acquisition-related costs such as charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, transaction costs, and changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration from its Adjusted Operating Income, whereas CVS records prescription drug costs in its Retail/LTC Segment net of retail co-payments, which directly reduce cost of products sold. This difference in financial reporting practices\u2014where Thermo Fisher adjusts for acquisition impacts and CVS nets co-payments\u2014means that a direct comparison of operating income between the two segments requires reconciliation to understand the true economic performance, as each company applies distinct adjustments that reflect different operational and strategic realities.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\n\nDuring 2021, issuance of senior notes provided $18.14 billion of cash. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

      "question": "How does Amgen's minimum interest coverage ratio requirement under its credit agreements compare to Medtronic's effective interest coverage ratio, considering the impact of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests on both companies' financial profiles?",
      "answer": "Amgen's credit agreements require a minimum interest coverage ratio based on Consolidated EBITDA divided by Consolidated Interest Expense, and Amgen was in compliance as of December 31, 2024. Interest coverage ratios are calculated as income before tax plus interest and debt expense minus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by interest costs. For Medtronic, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $28 million in fiscal year 2024, which would reduce the numerator of its interest coverage ratio. Given that Amgen's compliance with its covenant implies a sufficient buffer above the minimum threshold and Medtronic's $28 million in noncontrolling interest impacts its income before tax, Amgen likely maintains a stronger interest coverage position relative to Medtronic, assuming similar interest costs.",

      "question": "How does Merck's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2024 impact its interest coverage ratio, and how does this compare to Amgen's minimum required interest coverage ratio under its credit agreements?",
      "answer": "Merck's 2024 net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $16 million, which reduces the numerator in the interest coverage ratio calculation. Amgen's credit agreements require maintaining a minimum interest coverage ratio based on Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, though the exact numerical threshold is not disclosed. The relationship between noncontrolling interest and the interest coverage ratio is critical for understanding how minority stake profits affect debt servicing capacity.",

        "Hop 1: MRK \u2192 Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests: Merck reported $16 million in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2024, as shown in the equity section of its 10-K filing.",
        "Hop 2: Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests \u2192 Interest Coverage Ratio: This metric is subtracted in the interest coverage ratio formula, as defined by Chevron's 10-K, which calculates income before tax but adjusts for noncontrolling interest to assess debt servicing ability.",
        "Hop 3: Interest Coverage Ratio \u2190 AMGN: Amgen disclosed that its credit agreements require compliance with a minimum interest coverage ratio based on Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense, though the specific ratio value is not provided."

      "answer": "Abbott's remaining performance obligations of $4.4 billion in the Diagnostic Products segment and $478 million in the Medical Devices segment are expected to be recognized as revenue over a multi-year timeline, with approximately 58% recognized within 24 months, 17% in the subsequent 12 months, and the remainder thereafter. UnitedHealthcare's backlog, which also reflects future revenue commitments, totaled $32.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, with $18.7 billion expected to be realized within the next 12 months. Both metrics represent firm orders or anticipated renewals, indicating a similar approach to tracking future revenue, though the time horizons and industry-specific compositions differ significantly.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $9.6 billion in 2021, an increase of 8% compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including compensation and benefits, higher promotional expenses in support of the Company's key growth pillars, and higher acquisition-related costs, including costs related to the acquisition of Acceleron. The COVID-19 pandemic drove lower spending in 2020 which contributed to the increase in SG&amp;A expenses in 2021. These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  favorable  effects  of  foreign  exchange  and  a  contribution  in  2020  to  the  Merck Foundation. SG&amp;A expenses were $9.0 billion in 2020, a decline of 5% compared with 2019. The decline was driven primarily by lower administrative, selling and promotional costs, including lower travel and meeting expenses, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the favorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by a contribution to the Merck Foundation.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $12.2 billion in 2021, a decline of 9% compared with 2020 primarily due  to  lower  upfront  payments  related  to  acquisitions  and  collaborations.  The  decline  was  partially  offset  by  higher  clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development, net of the reimbursement of a portion of molnupiravir development costs through the partnership with Ridgeback. Higher compensation and benefit costs, higher in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) impairment charges, as well as costs related to the acquisition of Acceleron also partially offset the decline in R&amp;D expenses in 2021. R&amp;D expenses were $13.4 billion in 2020, an increase of 38% compared with 2019.  The  increase  was  driven  largely  by  higher  upfront  payments  related  to  acquisitions  and  collaborations,  higher  clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Higher restructuring costs also contributed to the increase in R&amp;D expenses in 2020. The increase in R&amp;D expenses in 2020 was partially offset by lower IPR&amp;D impairment charges and lower costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, net of spending on COVID-19-related vaccine and antiviral research programs.\n\nR&amp;D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (MRL), the Company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $7.1 billion in 2021, $6.5 billion in 2020 and $6.0 billion in 2019. Also included in R&amp;D expenses are Animal Health research costs, licensing costs and costs incurred by other divisions in support of R&amp;D activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $3.0 billion in 2021, $2.6 billion in 2020 and $2.6 billion in 2019. Additionally, R&amp;D expenses in 2021 include a $1.7  billion  charge  for  the  acquisition  of  Pandion.  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2020  include  a  $2.7  billion  charge  for  the  acquisition  of VelosBio Inc., a $462 million charge for the acquisition of OncoImmune and charges of $826 million related to transactions with Seagen.  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2019  include  a  $993  million  charge  for  the  acquisition  of  Peloton.  See  Note  4  to  the  consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions. R&amp;D expenses also include IPR&amp;D impairment charges of $275 million, $90 million and $172 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to  the  cancellation  or  delay  of  other  pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material. In addition, R&amp;D expenses in 2021 and 2020 include $28 million and $83 million, respectively, of costs associated with restructuring  activities,  primarily  relating  to  accelerated  depreciation.  R&amp;D  expenses  also  include  expense  or  income  related  to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration recorded in connection with business combinations. The Company recorded $35 million of expenses in 2021 compared with a net reduction in expenses of $95 million and $39 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to changes in these estimates.\n\n## Restructuring Costs\n\nIn  2019,  Merck  approved  a  global  restructuring  program  (Restructuring  Program)  as  part  of  a  worldwide  initiative focused  on  further  optimizing  the  Company's  manufacturing  and  supply  network,  as  well  as  reducing  its  global  real  estate footprint. This program is a continuation of the Company's plant rationalization and builds on prior restructuring programs. The actions currently contemplated under the Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion.

      "answer": "CVS's consumer health segment, including OTC test kit sales, contributed approximately 30% of the Retail/LTC segment's adjusted operating income in 2021, driven by the pandemic-related demand for diagnostic testing and consumer health products. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson's Consumer Health segment reported $2,061 million in income before tax in 2019, which predates the pandemic and reflects pre-crisis baseline performance. This comparison indicates that while JNJ's consumer health business was already profitable before the pandemic, CVS's consumer health offerings\u2014particularly OTC test kits\u2014became a significant growth driver during the pandemic, contributing meaningfully to operating income in 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

      "answer": "JNJ's 2023 net actuarial loss increased to $4,962 million from $3,948 million in 2022, significantly affecting its pension funded status, which stood at $1,863 million by year-end. This loss is part of JNJ\u2019s broader pension obligations and impacts its consolidated balance sheet and accumulated other comprehensive income. In contrast, GILD reports a total estimated fair value of $2,426 million in investment securities as of December 31, 2023, which includes $1,451 million in corporate debt and $367 million in mortgage-backed securities\u2014assets that are directly sensitive to market-driven valuation changes. While JNJ\u2019s financial metrics are heavily influenced by pension-related actuarial assumptions, GILD\u2019s financial position is more directly exposed to market fluctuations through its investment portfolio, indicating different risk profiles and sensitivities to external valuation changes.",

      "answer": "BMY faces extensive regulatory hurdles and cost-containment measures in international markets, which can delay product launches and reduce pricing flexibility. These challenges are particularly pronounced in the EU and Japan, where governments impose price controls, value assessments, and extended approval timelines. Abbott's Diagnostics segment, which saw $750 million in additions to property and equipment in 2023, operates in a similarly complex regulatory environment, particularly in the U.S. where FDA classifications and approval processes (like 510(k) submissions and Premarket Approvals) vary by product class. Given this high level of capital investment and the regulatory intensity, Abbott may need to align its development and commercialization strategies to mitigate risks similar to those faced by BMY, especially in markets with strong government control and pricing pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BMY \u2192 Development: BMY faces regulatory and pricing pressures in international markets that delay market access and constrain revenue potential.",
        "Hop 2: Development \u2192 Diagnostics: Abbott's diagnostics development is also subject to extensive regulatory processes, including FDA classifications and clinical validation requirements, which mirror the complexity of pharmaceutical development.",
        "Hop 3: Diagnostics \u2190 ABT: In 2023, Abbott invested $750 million in property and equipment for its Diagnostics segment, signaling a major strategic commitment that must account for regulatory and market access risks."

      "question": "How does AbbVie's $1,353 million expense for licensing rights in 2024 compare to Amgen's royalty income model, and what does this reveal about their contrasting financial strategies in pharmaceutical collaborations?",
      "answer": "AbbVie's $1,353 million expense for licensing rights in 2024 reflects a model where upfront and milestone payments are expensed early in the collaboration lifecycle, particularly before regulatory approval, as seen in their treatment of acquired IPR&D and milestone expenses. In contrast, Amgen's royalty income model defers revenue recognition until after third-party product sales occur, aligning with their use of the sales- and usage-based royalty exception. This indicates that AbbVie assumes more upfront financial risk in partnerships, while Amgen benefits from a more predictable, sales-linked revenue stream. The difference highlights AbbVie's strategy of accelerating development through early payments versus Amgen's focus on long-term revenue tied to commercial success.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV \u2192 Licensing Rights: AbbVie expensed $1,353 million in 2024 for licensing rights, including upfront and milestone payments made to partners before regulatory approval, which are recorded as acquired IPR&D and milestones expense.",
        "Hop 2: Licensing Rights \u2192 Royalty Payments: Licensing rights often include future royalty obligations, which are expensed to cost of products sold when incurred at AbbVie, while at Amgen, these same royalty rights are capitalized and recognized as royalty income upon third-party sales.",
        "Hop 3: Royalty Payments \u2190 AMGN: Amgen recognizes royalty income based on third-party sales of licensed products and applies the sales- and usage-based royalty exception, deferring revenue recognition until the underlying sales occur, generating a more stable and sales-linked income stream."

For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## Other revenues\n\nOther revenues consist primarily of royalty income and corporate partner revenues. Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are  composed  mainly  of  license  fees  and  milestones  earned  and  our  share  of  commercial  profits  generated  from  collaborations.  See Arrangements  with  multipleperformance obligations, discussed below.\n\n## Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations\n\nFrom time to time, we enter into arrangements for the R&amp;D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or goods, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&amp;D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to Amgen in the form of nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial-performance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing.\n\nIn arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand-alone basis or by using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.\n\nThe  consideration  allocated  to  each  distinct  performance  obligation  is  recognized  as  revenue  when  control  of  the  related  goods  or  services  is  transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will  not  occur.  We  utilize  the  sales-  and  usage-based  royalty  ex ception  in  arrangements  that  resulted  from  the  license  of  intellectual  property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.\n\n## Research and development costs\n\nR&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical  manufacturing  costs;  contract  services  and  other  outside  costs;  information  systems'  costs;  and  amortization  of  acquired  technology  used  in  R&amp;D  with alternative future uses. R&amp;D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with third-party R&amp;D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&amp;D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative costs\n\nSG&amp;A costs are primarily composed of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel;  facilities  and  overhead  costs;  outside  marketing,  advertising  and  legal  ex penses;  the  U.S.  healthcare  reform  federal  ex cise  fee  on  Branded  Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $987 million, $647 million and $841  million  during  the  years  ended  December  31,  2024,  2023  and  2022,  respectively.  SG &amp;A  ex penses  also  include  costs  and  cost  recoveries  associated  with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG &amp;A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 9, Collaborations.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract,  we  determine  whether  an  arrangement  is  or  contains  a  lease.  For  all  leases,  we  determine  the  classification  as  either  operating  or financing. Operating leases are included in Other noncurrent assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of",

      "question": "How did Abbott's 2023 Medical Devices segment performance reflect the January 1, 2023, internal transfer of Acelis Connected Health, and how does this compare to Danaher's 2023 Medical Devices segment challenges driven by declining demand for diagnostic products?",
      "answer": "Abbott's Medical Devices segment in 2023 incorporated $115 million in sales from the Acelis Connected Health business, which was internally transferred from Diagnostic Products on January 1, 2023. This reorganization was intended to align the business under a more strategic segment structure and likely contributed to a boost in reported Medical Devices sales for 2023. In contrast, Danaher's Medical Devices segment faced a 10.5% decrease in consolidated revenues for 2023, driven primarily by declining demand for COVID-19-related products and other diagnostics offerings. While Abbott's segment benefited from an internal realignment that added a defined revenue stream, Danaher's segment was negatively impacted by external market demand shifts, highlighting divergent performance drivers between the two companies in the same industry segment.",

        "Hop 1: ABT \u2192 Acelis Connected Health: Abbott internally transferred the Acelis Connected Health business from Diagnostic Products to Medical Devices on January 1, 2023, adding $115 million in sales to the Medical Devices segment for 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Acelis Connected Health \u2192 Medical Devices: This transfer redefined the composition of the Medical Devices segment starting in 2023, directly impacting its reported performance and strategic alignment.",
        "Hop 3: Medical Devices \u2190 DHR: Danaher's Medical Devices segment experienced a 10.5% decline in consolidated revenues for 2023, primarily due to reduced demand for COVID-19-related products and other diagnostics, indicating external market pressures affecting performance."

      "answer": "CVS's Latin America segment revenue growth included a $4.0 million positive impact from Chilean Peso fluctuations, indicating a relatively minor sensitivity to currency movements in the region. In contrast, UnitedHealth Group specifically identified the Chilean Peso as one of only two currencies (alongside the Brazilian Real) for its foreign exchange market risk exposure as of December 31, 2023, suggesting a more significant operational or financial exposure to Chilean Peso volatility. This comparison indicates that while both companies have Latin American operations affected by the currency, UnitedHealth appears to have a more substantial exposure requiring specific risk management attention, whereas for CVS the impact was relatively small in scale.",

      "answer": "JNJ reports a weighted average amortization period of 11 years for patents and trademarks, and 19 years for customer relationships and other intangible assets. In contrast, AbbVie treats acquired IPR&D as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until regulatory approval, at which point it becomes a definite-lived asset subject to amortization. This distinction is significant because, as seen in AVGO's data, IPR&D is listed at $70 million with no amortization period (N/A), aligning with AbbVie's indefinite-life classification. This reflects differing valuation approaches: JNJ amortizes its established intangibles over defined periods, while AbbVie delays amortization for IPR&D until approval, impacting long-term asset valuation and impairment risk.",

      "question": "How does JNJ's amortization approach for acquired intangible assets compare with MDT's treatment of IPR&D, and what does this reveal about their respective strategies for managing the financial impact of innovation investments?",
      "answer": "JNJ reports a weighted average amortization period of 11 years for patents and trademarks, and 19 years for customer relationships and other intangible assets, with amortization expenses exceeding $4 billion annually. This indicates a strategy of systematically recognizing the cost of acquired intangibles over defined periods. In contrast, MDT reports $150 million of IPR&D in fiscal 2024 and $300 million in fiscal 2023, which are capitalized into intangible assets once technological feasibility is achieved, rather than being immediately expensed. The AVGO evidence shows that IPR&D is typically not assigned an amortization period initially (N/A), suggesting that companies like MDT may delay recognizing amortization until projects reach commercial viability. This implies MDT adopts a more conservative and milestone-driven approach to recognizing innovation-related costs, aligning with a strategy that emphasizes risk mitigation and contingent investment outcomes, whereas JNJ reflects a more standardized amortization model.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: JNJ \u2192 Amortization Period: JNJ discloses weighted average amortization periods of 11 years for patents/trademarks and 19 years for customer relationships, with annual amortization expenses exceeding $4 billion.",
        "Hop 2: Amortization Period \u2192 IPR&D: AVGO's evidence shows IPR&D is listed separately with no defined amortization period, indicating it is treated differently from other intangible assets and only amortized after reaching technological feasibility.",
        "Hop 3: IPR&D \u2190 MDT: MDT reports $150 million of IPR&D in fiscal 2024 and $300 million in fiscal 2023, which are capitalized into intangible assets upon achieving feasibility, showing a delayed recognition of amortization costs."

      "question": "How does Eli Lilly's competitive positioning in the global pharmaceuticals market, particularly with diabetes products like Jardiance and Trajenta, influence the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) strategies of CVS Health's Health Services segment, especially in terms of formulary management and rebate negotiations?",
      "answer": "Eli Lilly's competitive positioning in the global pharmaceuticals market, particularly with diabetes products like Jardiance and Trajenta, influences CVS Health's Health Services segment by shaping its formulary management and rebate negotiation strategies. As a major pharmaceutical player, Lilly's products are subject to intense competition, requiring CVS's PBM solutions to strategically manage which medications are included in formularies based on cost-effectiveness and clinical outcomes. CVS negotiates pricing and rebates on behalf of its clients, and the presence of Lilly's branded products in a competitive landscape\u2014especially against biosimilars and generics\u2014creates pressure to secure favorable terms. This dynamic is further amplified by CVS\u2019s group purchasing organization, which leverages volume to obtain better pricing, especially in light of Lilly\u2019s global collaborations and the potential for market exclusivity erosion.",

These losses are part of broader post-employment liabilities and reflect the financial impact of unfunded retiree healthcare obligations. In contrast, Eli Lilly's $49.5 million in net losses for 2024 were primarily tied to equity investments, indicating a different source of financial exposure. While J&J's losses are linked to long-term employee benefit commitments, LLY's losses reflect market-related investment risks, showing distinct financial pressures between the two companies.",

Pensions and other benefit plans\n\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement benefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\n\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not significant.\n\nIn the U.S., non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the employee's compensation during the last five years before retirement and the number of years of service (the Final A verage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different formula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement V alue formula).\n\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees, regardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the benefits accrued under the Final A verage Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026.\n\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under group contracts, or reserves are provided.\n\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the future.\n\nIn 2024 and 2023 the Company used December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as the measurement date for all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\n\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company's defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2024, 2023 and 2022 include the following components:\n\n",

Any change in recorded v alue is recorded in other-net, (income) expense.\n- Our public equity inv estments are measured and carried at fair v alue. Any change in fair v alue is recognized in other-net, (income) expense.\n\nWe adjust our equity inv estments without readily determinable fair v alues based upon changes in the equity instruments' v alues resulting from observ able price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar inv estment of the same issuer. Downward adjustments resulting from an impairment are recorded based upon impairment considerations, including the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, general market conditions, and industry specific factors. Adjustments recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 were not material.\n\nThe net losses recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for equity securities were $49.5 million, $20.2 million, and $410.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectiv ely.

      "answer": "Medtronic (MDT) projects a 3.90% rate of compensation increase for its U.S. pension benefits in 2024, which remains consistent with 2023 levels. This is notably higher than the broader trend seen in another peer\u2019s data, where the rate of compensation increase was reported at 1.98% in 2023, suggesting a more conservative outlook in that company\u2019s pension planning.

      "answer": "JNJ's significant capital investment of $1,198 million in 2021 for additions to property, plant, and equipment in its pharmaceutical segment suggests a strategic emphasis on expanding or upgrading its pharmaceutical manufacturing and R&D infrastructure. This investment trend indicates a long-term commitment to strengthening its pharmaceutical capabilities. Meanwhile, TMO operates extensively in the pharmaceutical space, particularly through its Specialty Diagnostics segment, which offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, and immunodiagnostic tools used in pharmaceutical research and development. TMO's offerings, such as ImmunoCAP for allergy tests and EliA for autoimmunity tests, are critical for drug development and clinical trials. Therefore, JNJ\u2019s growing capital expenditure in pharmaceuticals may support its internal R&D and production capabilities, potentially reducing reliance on external diagnostic tools, while TMO's specialized diagnostics serve as enabling technologies for broader pharmaceutical innovation across the industry.",

      "answer": "Both JNJ and ABBV experienced actuarial losses due to changes in discount rate assumptions, though the magnitude differed significantly. JNJ disclosed that its 2020 actuarial loss for retirement plans was primarily driven by decreases in discount rates, prompting a pension plan amendment effective 2026. While the specific dollar impact for JNJ is not quantified in the evidence, ABBV explicitly reported a $1.1 billion actuarial loss for qualified pension plans in 2020 due to a decrease in the assumed discount rate. Given that both companies are exposed to pension volatility from discount rate movements, their pension expense forecasts would likely require upward adjustments or increased liability recognition under lower rate environments, with ABBV facing a more substantial near-term impact due to the scale of its loss.",

      "answer": "JNJ's Consumer Health segment reported capital expenditures (Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment) of $328 million in 2019, $248 million in 2020, and $331 million in 2021, showing a fluctuating but sustained investment pattern. In contrast, Pfizer's Consumer Healthcare segment reported no revenue or capital investment activity in 2021, down from $2,082 million in 2019, indicating a strategic withdrawal or divestiture. This suggests that while JNJ continued to invest in its Consumer Health business, Pfizer was effectively exiting the segment during the same period.",

      "answer": "ABT reported actuarial losses of $772 million in 2024, which were attributed to lower discount rates used to value benefit obligations, as seen in similar disclosures from other companies like CVX. ABBV, on the other hand, noted that lower discount rates in 2023 increased the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities from the DJS acquisition, particularly impacting estimates tied to Skyrizi sales. Thus, while lower discount rates contributed to ABT's pension-related losses, they also had the opposite effect on ABBV by increasing its contingent liabilities linked to future product sales.",

        "Hop 1: ABT \u2192 Actuarial Losses: ABT disclosed $772 million in actuarial losses for 2024, primarily due to changes in discount rates affecting pension obligations.",
        "Hop 2: Actuarial Losses \u2192 Lower Discount Rates: Lower discount rates were explicitly cited as a cause of increased benefit obligations and actuarial losses, as seen in CVX's disclosures.",
        "Hop 3: Lower Discount Rates \u2190 ABBV: ABBV noted that lower discount rates in 2023 increased the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities related to the DJS acquisition and Skyrizi sales projections."

      "answer": "BMY's milestone payments are primarily tied to collaboration arrangements and are either deferred and amortized or expensed based on the stage of development and BMS's obligations. In contrast, JNJ reported higher milestone payments in 2023 as part of its Innovative Medicine segment, which contributed to a decline in pre-tax income margin improvement despite other cost-saving measures like R&D portfolio prioritization and lower impairments. JNJ incurred $479 million in restructuring expenses related to exiting partnered and non-partnered development programs, highlighting the financial impact of strategic shifts on milestone obligations.",

        "Hop 1: BMY \u2192 Milestone Payments: BMY discloses milestone payments to alliance partners are either expensed as incurred (pre-approval), capitalized and amortized (post-approval), or deferred and amortized over expected obligation periods, depending on the nature of the arrangement.",
        "Hop 2: Milestone Payments \u2192 Innovative Medicine Segment: JNJ notes that higher milestone payments in 2023 were a headwind to its Innovative Medicine segment\u2019s income before tax margin improvement, despite other favorable factors like reduced litigation costs and R&D prioritization.",

      "answer": "CVS's Corporate & Other segment contributed a negative $1,471 million to adjusted operating income in 2021, indicating that this segment incurs costs not directly tied to its core operating segments and may support broader corporate functions or strategic initiatives. This contrasts with Thermo Fisher\u2019s (TMO) use of adjusted operating income as a non-GAAP metric to strip out non-operational items\u2014such as acquisition-related costs, restructuring expenses, and gains or losses on asset sales\u2014to highlight the performance of its core scientific and laboratory services business. While CVS's negative contribution suggests a centralized overhead function, TMO's approach emphasizes transparency in operational efficiency, aligning management incentives and investor communication around sustained business performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

      "question": "How does UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual's assumption of administrative costs in risk-based products compare to AbbVie's strategy to optimize administrative expenses, particularly in light of UNH's service fee model for self-funded arrangements and AbbVie's $2 billion integration cost objective?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual assumes both medical and administrative costs in its risk-based product offerings, receiving a fixed monthly premium per individual served, while offering self-funded arrangements where it earns a service fee without assuming medical risk. This dual model allows UNH to manage administrative costs differently depending on the product structure. Meanwhile, AbbVie explicitly aims to optimize administrative costs as part of broader expense synergy efforts, targeting approximately $2 billion in cumulative integration-related charges through 2022, which includes severance and other cost-reduction measures. The contrast reveals that UNH's administrative costs are directly tied to its insurance product structure and customer risk appetite, whereas AbbVie's approach is part of a strategic cost-cutting initiative to improve operating margins following major acquisitions.",

        "Hop 1: UNH \u2192 UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual: UNH offers both risk-based and self-funded health plans, with the former assuming both medical and administrative costs in exchange for a fixed monthly premium per individual, while the latter earns a service fee without assuming medical risk.",

These costs consist of severance and employee benefit costs (cash severance, non-cash severance, including accelerated equity award compensation expense, retention and other termination benefits) and other integration expenses.\n\n## Impact of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nIn response to the ongoing public health crisis posed by COVID-19, AbbVie continues to focus on ensuring the safety of employees. Throughout the pandemic, AbbVie has followed health and safety guidance from state and local health authorities and implemented safety measures for those employees who are returning to the workplace.\n\nAbbVie also continues to closely manage manufacturing and supply chain resources around the world to help ensure that patients continue to receive an uninterrupted supply of their medicines. Clinical trial sites are being monitored locally to protect the safety of study participants, staff and employees. While the impact of COVID-19 on AbbVie's operations to date has not been material, AbbVie continues to experience lower new patient starts in certain products and markets. AbbVie expects this matter could continue to negatively impact its results of operations throughout the duration of the pandemic.\n\nThe extent to which COVID-19 may impact AbbVie's financial condition and results of operations remains uncertain and is dependent on numerous evolving factors, including the measures being taken by authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19, the emergence of new variants and the availability and successful administration of effective vaccines.\n\n## 2022 Strategic Objectives\n\nAbbVie's mission is to discover and develop innovative medicines and products that solve serious health issues today and address the medical challenges of tomorrow while achieving top-tier financial performance through outstanding execution. AbbVie intends to continue to advance its mission in a number of ways, including: (i) maximizing the benefits of a diversified revenue base with multiple long-term growth drivers; (ii) growing revenues by leveraging AbbVie's commercial strength and international infrastructure across therapeutic areas and ensuring strong commercial execution of new product launches; (iii) continuing to invest in and expand its pipeline in support of opportunities in immunology, oncology, aesthetics, neuroscience and eye care as well as continued investment in key on-market products; (iv) expanding operating margins; and (v) returning cash to shareholders via a strong and growing dividend while also reducing debt. In addition, AbbVie anticipates several regulatory submissions and data readouts from key clinical trials in the next 12 months.\n\nAbbVie expects to achieve its strategic objectives through:\n\n- Immunology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Skyrizi and Rinvoq, as well as Humira U.S. sales growth.\n- Hematologic oncology revenue growth driven by increasing market share and indication expansion of Venclexta, as well as maintaining the strong leadership position of Imbruvica.\n- Aesthetics revenue growth driven by global expansion and increasing market penetration of Botox and Juvederm Collection.\n- Neuroscience revenue growth driven by Vraylar, Botox Therapeutic, Ubrelvy and recently launched Qulipta.\n- Sustaining eye care leadership by maximizing AbbVie's current eye care portfolio.\n- The favorable impact of pipeline products and indications recently approved or currently under regulatory review where approval is expected in 2022. These products are described in greater detail in the section labeled \"Research and Development\" included as part of this Item 7.\n\nAbbVie remains committed to driving continued expansion of operating margins and expects to achieve this objective through continued realization of expense synergies from the Allergan acquisition, leverage from revenue growth, productivity initiatives in supply chain and ongoing efficiency programs to optimize manufacturing, commercial infrastructure, administrative costs and general corporate expenses.",

      "question": "How did the contingent consideration reversal of $1.1 billion related to the Auris Health acquisition in J&J's Medical Devices segment impact its cash flows from operating activities, and how does this compare to CVS's exposure to medical technology through its Health Care Benefits offerings?",
      "answer": "The contingent consideration reversal of $1.1 billion in J&J's Medical Devices segment, tied to the Auris Health acquisition, directly reduced the company's cash flows from operating activities by that amount in 2022. This reversal reflects a downward adjustment in expected future payments tied to developmental milestones not being met. Meanwhile, CVS's Health Care Benefits segment includes offerings related to medical technology (such as Aetna Virtual Primary Care and access to health technology products), which expose the company to the broader medical devices ecosystem. While J&J directly develops and acquires medical device technologies, CVS integrates medical tech into its health insurance and service offerings, creating an indirect but significant linkage between the two companies through the medical devices domain.",

The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, governmentsponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Products and Services\n\nThe Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk of medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' Health Care Benefits products and services consist of the following:\n\n- Commercial Medical : The Health Care Benefits segment offers point-of-service ('POS'), preferred provider organization ('PPO'), health maintenance organization ('HMO') and indemnity benefit ('Indemnity') plans. Commercial medical products also include health savings accounts ('HSAs') and consumer-directed health plans that combine traditional POS or PPO and/or dental coverage, subject to a deductible, with an accumulating benefit account (which may be funded by the plan sponsor and/or the member in the case of HSAs). With the launch of Aetna Virtual Primary Care in 2021, eligible members now have access to health services remotely, paired with access to in-person visits with providers in the Company's network, including at MinuteClinic and CVS HealthHUB  locations. Principal products and services are targeted specifically to large multi-site national, mid-sized and small employers, individual insureds and expatriates. The Company offers medical stop loss insurance coverage for certain employers who elect to self-insure their health benefits. Under medical stop loss insurance products, the Company assumes risk for costs associated with large individual claims and/or aggregate loss experience within an employer's plan above a pre-set annual threshold. The segment also has a portfolio of additional health products and services that complement its medical products such as dental plans, behavioral health and employee assistance products, provider network access and vision products. TM \u00ae \u00ae\n- Government Medical : In select geographies, the Health Care Benefits segment offers Medicare Advantage plans, Medicare Supplement plans and prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries; participates in Medicaid and subsidized Children's Health Insurance Programs ('CHIP'); and participates in demonstration projects for members who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid ('Duals'). These Government Medical products are further described below:\n- Medicare Advantage: Through annual contracts with the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ('CMS'), the Company offers HMO and PPO products for eligible individuals in certain geographic areas through the Medicare Advantage program. Members typically receive enhanced benefits over traditional fee-for-service Medicare coverage ('Original Medicare'), including reduced cost-sharing for preventive care, vision and other services. The Company offered network-based HMO and/or PPO plans in 46 states and Washington, D.C. in 2021. For certain qualifying employer groups, the Company offers Medicare PPO products nationally. When combined with the Company's PDP product, these national PPO plans form an integrated national Insured Medicare product for employers that provides medical and pharmacy benefits.\n- Medicare PDP: The Company is a national provider of drug benefits under the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. All Medicare eligible individuals are eligible to participate in this voluntary prescription drug plan. Members typically receive coverage for certain prescription drugs, usually subject to a deductible, co-insurance and/or co-payment. The Company offered PDP plans in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. in 2021. On November 30, 2018, the Company completed the sale of the standalone PDPs of Aetna, Inc. ('Aetna') to WellCare Health Plans, Inc. effective December 31, 2018. The Company provided administrative services to, and retained the financial results of, the divested plans through 2019. Subsequent to 2019, the Company no longer retains the financial results of the divested plans.\n- Medicare Supplement: For certain Medicare eligible members, the Company offers supplemental coverage for certain health care costs not covered by Original Medicare. The products included in the Medicare Supplement portfolio help to cover some of the gaps in Original Medicare, and include coverage for Medicare deductibles and coinsurance amounts. The Company offered a wide selection of Medicare Supplement products in 49 states and Washington, D.C. in 2021.\n- Medicaid and CHIP: The Company offers health care management services to individuals eligible for Medicaid and CHIP under multi-year contracts with government agencies in various states that are subject to annual appropriations. CHIP are state-subsidized insurance programs that provide benefits for families with uninsured children. The Company offered these services on an Insured or ASC basis in 16 states in 2021.\n- Duals: The Company provides health coverage to beneficiaries who are dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid coverage. These members must meet certain income and resource requirements in order to qualify for",

      "answer": "The reclassification of Puerto Rico into BMY's International Segment in 2024 likely increases its foreign-derived income pool, which could affect the calculation and exposure to GILTI taxes under TCJA. This structural change alters the geographic mix of BMY's foreign earnings, potentially influencing the allocation of U.S. expenses and the resulting GILTI inclusion. In contrast, Eli Lilly explicitly recognizes deferred taxes related to GILTI for the future tax effects of temporary differences, indicating a structured approach to accounting for these tax liabilities. To fully assess the impact, one would need to analyze how BMY's revised international footprint interacts with U.S. tax allocation rules under GILTI, and compare it to LLY's disclosed deferred tax recognition methodology.",

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\n\nDepreciation expense was $651 million in 2024, $611 million in 2023 and $587 million in 2022.\n\n## Note 14. LE ASES\n\nLeased facilities for office, research and development, storage and distribution purposes comprise approximately 95% of the total lease obligation. Lease terms vary based on the nature of operations and the market dynamics in each country; however, all leased facilities are classified as operating leases with remaining lease terms between one year and 15 years. Most leases contain specific renewal options for periods ranging between one year and 10 years where notice to renew must be provided in advance of lease expiration or automatic renewals where no advance notice is required. Periods covered by an option to extend the lease were included in the non-cancellable lease term when exercise of the option was determined to be reasonably certain. Certain leases also contain termination options that provide the flex ibility to terminate the lease ahead of its ex piration with sufficient advance notice. Periods covered by an option to terminate the lease were included in the noncancellable lease term when exercise of the option was determined not to be reasonably certain. Judgment is required in assessing whether renewal and termination options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Factors are considered such as contractual terms compared to current market rates, leasehold improvements expected to have significant value, costs to terminate a lease and the importance of the facility to operations. Costs determined to be variable and not based on an index or rate were not included in the measurement of real estate lease liabilities. These variable costs include real estate tax es, insurance, utilities, common area maintenance and other operating costs. BMS elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes. As the implicit rate on most leases is not readily determinable, an incremental borrowing rate was applied on a portfolio approach to discount its real estate lease liabilities.\n\nThe remaining lease obligations are comprised of vehicles and a research and development facility operated by a third party under management's direction. V ehicle lease terms vary by country with terms generally between one year and four years.\n\nThe following table summarizes the components of lease expense:\n\n",

      "answer": "The GILTI provision introduced by TCJA 2017 taxes U.S. allocated expenses and certain income from foreign operations, which could increase the effective tax rates for companies like Pfizer and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) that operate internationally. Pfizer explicitly organizes its business around its International Segment, indicating a significant portion of its revenue is exposed to this tax mechanism. Similarly, BMY is subject to GILTI, which could constrain its ability to optimize its global tax rate. Since both companies derive revenue from international markets, the GILTI provision may reduce the tax benefits they could otherwise realize from shifting income to lower-tax jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "LLY reported $122.5 million in actuarial losses for 2024, a 5.4% increase from the $116.2 million in 2023. These losses were influenced by changes in discount rates, as seen in GM's 2024 disclosures where a decrease in discount rates in 2023 led to significant actuarial losses. Similarly, TMO experienced 2023 pension-related actuarial losses driven by decreases in weighted average discount rates, mirroring the pattern observed in GM\u2019s filings. This suggests that both LLY and TMO faced similar pension liability pressures in 2023 due to falling discount rates, with LLY continuing to experience elevated losses in 2024.",

      "answer": "TMO experienced a slight decrease in Adjusted Operating Income from $9,810 million in 2023 to $9,707 million in 2024, a decline of $103 million or about 1%. In contrast, CVS's Health Care Benefits segment saw a significant drop in Adjusted Operating Income from $5,577 million in 2023 to $307 million in 2024, a decrease of $5,270 million or about 94.5%.

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's Innovative Medicine segment reported a restructuring-related charge of $0.1 billion in 2024, which was part of broader segment expenses including litigation, asset impairments, and exit costs. This indicates a targeted restructuring effort within the Innovative Medicine division, likely aimed at optimizing operations or integrating acquisitions. Pfizer, on the other hand, disclosed restructuring charges in the context of both acquisition integration and broader cost-reduction initiatives, including workforce reductions, site closings, and facility rationalization. These charges are part of a more comprehensive productivity strategy across multiple business units, suggesting a larger-scale operational transformation. While both companies use restructuring charges to drive efficiency, JNJ's $0.1 billion charge reflects a more focused initiative within a single segment, whereas PFE's approach spans multiple functions and divisions.",

W e perform  im pairm ent testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever im pairm ent indicators are present. W hen necessary, we record im pairm ents of long-lived assets for the am ount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets.\n\n## Specifically:\n\n- For finite-lived intangible assets, such as developed technology rights, and for other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipm ent, whenever im pairm ent indicators are present, we calculate the undiscounted value of the projected cash flows for the asset, or asset group, and com pare this estim ated am ount to the carrying am ount. If the carrying amount is greater, we record an im pairm ent loss for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, we reevaluate the rem aining useful lives of the assets and m odify them , as appropriate.\n- For indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as brands and IP R &amp;D  assets, when necessary, we determ ine the fair value of the asset and record an im pairm ent loss, if any, for the excess of book value over fair value. In addition, in all cases of an im pairm ent review other than for IP R &amp;D  assets, we re-evaluate whether continuing to characterize the asset as indefinite-lived is appropriate.\n- For goodwill, when necessary, we determ ine the fair value of each reporting unit and record an im pairm ent loss, if any, for the excess of the book value of the reporting unit over the im plied fair value.\n\n## N. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated w ith Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\n\nWe incur restructuring charges in connection with acquisitions when we im plem ent plans to restructure and integrate the acquired operations or in connection with our cost-reduction and productivity initiatives.\n\n- I n connection with acquisition activity, we typically incur costs associated with executing the transactions, integrating the acquired operations (which m ay include expenditures for consulting and the integration of system s and processes), and restructuring the com bined com pany (which m ay include charges related to em ployees, assets and activities that will not continue in the com bined com pany); and\n- I n connection with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives, we typically incur costs and charges for site closings and other facility rationalization actions, workforce reductions and the expansion of shared services, including the developm ent of global system s.\n\nI ncluded in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs are all restructuring charges, as well as certain other costs associated with acquiring and integrating an acquired com pany. If the restructuring action results in a change in the estim ated useful life of an asset, that increm ental im pact is classified in Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses and/or Research and development expenses , as appropriate. E m ployee term ination costs are generally recorded when the actions are probable and estim able and include accrued severance benefits, pension and postretirem ent benefits, m any of which m ay be paid out during periods after term ination. T ransaction costs, such as banking, legal, accounting and other sim ilar costs incurred in connection with a business acquisition are expensed as incurred .\n\nOur business m ay be im pacted by these actions, including sales and m arketing, m anufacturing and R &amp;D , as well as our corporate enabling functions.\n\n## O. Cash Equivalents and Statement of Cash Flow s\n\nCash equivalents include item s alm ost as liquid as cash, such as certificates of deposit and tim e deposits with m aturity periods of three m onths or less when purchased. If item s meeting this definition are part of a larger investm ent pool, we classify them  as Short-term investments .\n\nCash flows for financial instrum ents designated as fair value or cash flow hedges m ay be included in operating, investing or financing activities, depending on the classification of the item s being hedged. C ash flows for financial instrum ents designated as net investm ent hedges are classified according to the nature of the hedging instrum ent. C ash flows for financial instrum ents that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatm ent are classified according to their purpose and accounting nature.\n\n## P. Investments and Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe classification of an investm ent depends on the nature of the investm ent, our intent and ability to hold the investm ent, and the degree to which we m ay exercise influence. O ur investm ents are prim arily com prised of the following:\n\n- Public equity securities with readily determ inable fair values, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other (income)/deductions-net.\n- Available-for-sale debt securities, which are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in Other comprehensive income/(loss) until realized.\n- Held-to-m aturity debt securities, which are carried at am ortized cost.\n- Private equity securities without readily determ inable fair values and where we have no significant influence are m easured at cost m inus any im pairm ent and plus or m inus adjustm ents resulting from  observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a sim ilar investm ent of the sam e issuer.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n61",

      "answer": "AbbVie's reliance on proprietary medical devices for key products like Imbruvica and Rinvoq suggests a strategic emphasis on integrated therapies where device differentiation can extend market exclusivity beyond patent expiration timelines (e.g., Imbruvica's expected generic entry in 2032 despite patent expiration in 2027). Meanwhile, Abbott's significant 2023 capital investment of $604 million in medical device infrastructure\u2014up from $335 million in 2022\u2014signals capacity expansion in this segment. This creates a dual pressure point: AbbVie benefits from device-enabled product differentiation that could insulate revenue streams, while Abbott is scaling manufacturing and R&D capabilities that may support broader market penetration. The interplay between AbbVie\u2019s device-driven therapy model and Abbott\u2019s infrastructure spending could shape competitive dynamics in therapeutic areas where both companies have overlapping interests.",

      "answer": "ABBV's discount rate for determining interest cost increased from 2.2% in 2021 to 4.9% in 2023, while JNJ's interest cost discount rate rose from 2.34% in 2021 to 5.25% in 2023. Both companies show a significant upward trend in their discount rates for interest cost calculations, reflecting a broader increase in interest rates during this period. This likely resulted in lower pension obligations due to the inverse relationship between discount rates and pension liabilities. However, JNJ's rate increase was slightly steeper, suggesting a potentially greater reduction in pension liabilities for JNJ compared to ABBV.",

        "Hop 1: ABBV \u2192 Discount Rate Interest Cost: ABBV's discount rate for determining interest cost increased from 2.2% in 2021 to 4.9% in 2023",
        "Hop 2: Discount Rate Interest Cost \u2192 Interest Cost Discount Rate: The increase in ABBV's discount rate aligns with a general trend of rising interest rates, which impacts how pension liabilities are calculated",

      "answer": "DHR's outstanding debt has increased significantly due to acquisitions, which may limit its operations and negatively impact its credit ratings. This increase in debt affects the interest coverage ratio, which measures a company's ability to pay interest on its debt. AMGN, in contrast, is required to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio under its credit agreements, which is calculated using consolidated EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense. While DHR's rising debt could strain its interest coverage, AMGN's compliance with its covenant as of December 31, 2023, indicates it maintains sufficient financial flexibility to meet its obligations.",

        "Hop 1: DHR \u2192 Outstanding Debt: DHR's debt has increased significantly due to acquisitions, which may limit operations and negatively impact credit ratings.",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of retail co-payments in the Pharmacy Services segment's revenue at CVS impact its adjusted operating income, and how does this compare to Thermo Fisher's approach to adjusting operating income for acquisition-related costs?",
      "answer": "CVS's Pharmacy Services segment includes approximately $11.6 billion of retail co-payments in its total revenues for 2021, which directly contributes to its adjusted operating income. This inclusion reflects revenue generated from prescriptions dispensed under client benefit plans. In contrast, Thermo Fisher (TMO) adjusts its operating income by excluding certain acquisition-related costs, such as charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the acquisition date and transaction costs, to reflect its core operating performance. This highlights a key difference in how the two companies define and report adjusted operating income, with CVS incorporating client-related revenue streams like co-payments, while TMO focuses on removing non-operational, acquisition-driven distortions.",

A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

      "answer": "AbbVie assumed a 6.5% health care cost trend rate in 2021 for its postretirement health care plans, as disclosed in the second evidence chunk. This rate reflects the company's projection of future health care cost increases, which directly affects the calculation of net periodic benefit costs. In contrast, CVS disclosed in 2022 that as of December 31, 2021, its amortized cost basis for obligations originating prior to 2021 totaled $383 million. This indicates CVS's ongoing financial exposure to legacy health care liabilities. The combination suggests that while AbbVie is projecting a 6.5% annual increase in health care costs, CVS is actively managing a substantial existing liability base, potentially reflecting different stages of liability maturity or strategic approaches to health care cost management.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe expected long-term rate of return is based on the asset allocation, historical performance and the current view of expected future returns. AbbVie considers these inputs with a long-term focus to avoid short-term market influences. The current long-term rate of return on plan assets for each plan is supported by the historical performance of the trust's actual and target asset allocation. AbbVie's assumed expected long-term rate of return has a significant effect on the amounts reported for defined benefit pension plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022. A one percentage point change in assumed expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would increase or decrease the net period benefit cost of these plans in 2022 by $101 million.\n\nThe health care cost trend rate is selected by reviewing historical trends and current views on projected future health care cost increases. The current health care cost trend rate is supported by the historical trend experience of each plan. Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans as of December 31, 2021 and will be used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in 2022.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nAbbVie accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Provisions for federal, state and foreign income taxes are calculated on reported pretax earnings based on current tax laws. Deferred taxes are provided using enacted tax rates on the future tax consequences of temporary differences, which are the differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and the tax benefits of carryforwards. A valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe company is subject to contingencies, such as various claims, legal proceedings and investigations regarding product liability, intellectual property, commercial, securities and other matters that arise in the normal course of business. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount within a probable range is recorded. Accordingly, AbbVie is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss and therefore, the minimum amount, which could be zero, is recorded. As information becomes known, either the minimum loss amount is increased, resulting in additional loss provisions, or a best estimate can be made, also resulting in additional loss provisions. Occasionally, a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected.\n\n## Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nAbbVie has acquired and may continue to acquire significant intangible assets in connection with business combinations that AbbVie records at fair value.

      "question": "How does the $40 million pretax net unrealized loss estimate disclosed by MRK for derivatives hedging foreign currency sales relate to the reclassification from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL), and how does this mechanism compare to PFE's treatment of AOCL items associated with indefinite foreign investments?",
      "answer": "MRK estimates that $40 million of pretax net unrealized losses on foreign exchange derivatives will be reclassified from AOCL to Sales within the next 12 months, reflecting the economic hedge of foreign currency denominated sales. This reclassification highlights how AOCL serves as a holding account for derivative gains and losses before they impact the income statement. In contrast, PFE notes that taxes are not provided for foreign currency translation adjustments related to indefinite investments in international subsidiaries, which are instead recorded directly into AOCL. This indicates a difference in financial strategy: MRK actively uses derivatives to hedge foreign exchange exposure with planned reclassifications from AOCL, while PFE defers tax implications and retains foreign currency impacts in AOCL for long-term holdings.",

        "Hop 1: PFE \u2192 AOCL: PFE discloses that foreign currency translation adjustments for indefinite international investments are recorded into Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss (AOCL) without tax provision.",

      "question": "How does the $17.1 billion IBNR liability reported by UNH for 2021 relate to the health care cost trend rate of 6.5% used by CVS in its actuarial estimates?",
      "answer": "The $17.1 billion IBNR liability reported by UNH at the end of 2021 reflects the company's estimate of unpaid medical costs for services already rendered but not yet reported or processed. This estimate is calculated using actuarial methods similar to those used by CVS, which explicitly incorporates a health care cost trend rate of 6.5% in its IBNR estimation process. The 6.5% trend rate, held constant from prior years, directly influences the projected cost of future claims based on historical patterns and expected increases in per member per month health care costs. For both companies, this trend rate is a critical assumption that affects the actuarial modeling of claim completion factors and the ultimate cost of claims incurred, particularly for more recent months where claims are still immature and heavily reliant on trend assumptions.",

Management fees charged to contract holders are included in services revenue and recognized over the period earned.\n\n## Health Care Costs Payable\n\nHealth care costs payable consist principally of unpaid fee-for-service medical, dental and pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing arrangements related to the Health Care Benefits segment's Insured Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products and accruals for state assessments. Unpaid health care claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company's Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, 'IBNR'). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and historical medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company reflects changes in these estimates in benefit costs in the Company's consolidated operating results in the period they are determined. Capitation costs represent contractual monthly fees paid to participating physicians and other medical providers for providing medical care, regardless of the volume of medical services provided to the Insured member. Amounts due under risksharing arrangements are based on the terms of the underlying contracts with the providers and consider claims experience under the contracts through the financial statement date.\n\nThe Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. Of those factors, the Company considers the analysis of historical and projected claim payment patterns (including claims submission and processing patterns) and the assumed health care cost trend rate (the year-over-year change in per member per month health care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. In developing its IBNR estimate, the Company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company's estimate of IBNR in 2021.\n\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to estimate 'completion factors.' The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a given month's incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents the Company's estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company's health care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company's completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\n\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\n\nThe Company's health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services. Many factors influence the health care cost trend rate, including the Company's ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company's business. The health status of the Company's Insured members, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit costs.

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group operates across multiple healthcare segments, indicating a strong and diversified position in the broader healthcare ecosystem which 3M's 2021 results show grew 8.4% in U.S. dollars, with oral care being a key growth driver due to increased dental procedures. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson's oral care sales only grew 0.2% in 2021, from $1,641 million to $1,645 million, suggesting its position in this category may be stagnating despite a rising market demand.

This recognition indicates LLY's compliance with the new tax regime and its effect on financial reporting. The TCJA\u2019s GILTI provision directly impacts how multinational firms structure and report their international segments. In 2024, BMY realigned its International Segment to include Puerto Rico, a change in geographic reporting that reflects strategic or compliance-driven adjustments in response to evolving tax policies like GILTI. This reclassification suggests BMY is adapting its segment reporting to align with operational or tax planning considerations under the TCJA. Together, these actions illustrate how both LLY and BMY are responding to the same regulatory framework\u2014LLY through financial tax recognition and BMY through structural segment changes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY \u2192 GILTI: LLY explicitly recognizes deferred taxes related to GILTI, indicating the company is accounting for the long-term tax effects of global intangible income under the TCJA.",
        "Hop 2: GILTI \u2192 International Segment: The TCJA\u2019s GILTI provision directly affects how companies structure and report their international operations, incentivizing changes in geographic or financial reporting.",
        "Hop 3: International Segment \u2190 BMY: BMY included Puerto Rico in its International Segment starting in 2024, showing a material change in how it organizes and reports its international business, likely in response to tax reforms like GILTI."

Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\n\nDepreciation expense was $651 million in 2024, $611 million in 2023 and $587 million in 2022.\n\n## Note 14. LE ASES\n\nLeased facilities for office, research and development, storage and distribution purposes comprise approximately 95% of the total lease obligation. Lease terms vary based on the nature of operations and the market dynamics in each country; however, all leased facilities are classified as operating leases with remaining lease terms between one year and 15 years. Most leases contain specific renewal options for periods ranging between one year and 10 years where notice to renew must be provided in advance of lease expiration or automatic renewals where no advance notice is required. Periods covered by an option to extend the lease were included in the non-cancellable lease term when exercise of the option was determined to be reasonably certain. Certain leases also contain termination options that provide the flex ibility to terminate the lease ahead of its ex piration with sufficient advance notice. Periods covered by an option to terminate the lease were included in the noncancellable lease term when exercise of the option was determined not to be reasonably certain. Judgment is required in assessing whether renewal and termination options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Factors are considered such as contractual terms compared to current market rates, leasehold improvements expected to have significant value, costs to terminate a lease and the importance of the facility to operations. Costs determined to be variable and not based on an index or rate were not included in the measurement of real estate lease liabilities. These variable costs include real estate tax es, insurance, utilities, common area maintenance and other operating costs. BMS elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components in calculating the amounts of ROU assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes. As the implicit rate on most leases is not readily determinable, an incremental borrowing rate was applied on a portfolio approach to discount its real estate lease liabilities.\n\nThe remaining lease obligations are comprised of vehicles and a research and development facility operated by a third party under management's direction. V ehicle lease terms vary by country with terms generally between one year and four years.\n\nThe following table summarizes the components of lease expense:\n\n",

According to LLY's 10-K, these arrangements often give LLY the discretion to terminate development, which could avoid contingent payments, though they are unlikely to do so if milestones are achieved. Meanwhile, AMGN's licensing rights include capitalized upfront payments associated with royalty obligations for marketed products, as noted in their 2024 10-K. These licensing rights are tied to future milestone and royalty payments and are subject to fair value adjustments based on estimated probabilities and timing of achieving regulatory and commercial milestones.

We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations, and they are reviewed quarterly by management in our R&amp;D and commercial sales organizations. The inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related development, regulatory and commercial events or that shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events or that increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the obligations, as applicable.

      "question": "How does Thermo Fisher's operational involvement in pharmaceuticals through its Specialty Diagnostics segment compare to Merck's financial exposure in the same sector as indicated by its $11 million equity loss from affiliates in 2021, and what does this reveal about their respective risk profiles in pharmaceutical-related activities?",
      "answer": "Thermo Fisher operates in the pharmaceutical sector through its Specialty Diagnostics segment, which provides diagnostic test kits, reagents, and instruments used in drug development, therapeutic drug monitoring, and clinical testing\u2014supporting pharmaceutical companies in areas such as clinical trials and biomarker analysis. In contrast, Merck's exposure in this space includes equity investments in affiliates, which resulted in a $11 million equity loss in 2021, indicating a financial stake in external pharmaceutical ventures. This contrast reveals differing risk profiles: Thermo Fisher maintains operational control and recurring revenue through product and service offerings, while Merck assumes equity-related financial risk tied to the performance of its affiliates. The absence of equity losses for Thermo Fisher highlights a more insulated position relative to Merck\u2019s exposure through its investment strategy.",

The Company preliminarily recorded approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill related to the Aldevron Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, the Company acquired 13 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company's ('GE') Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the 'Cytiva Acquisition'). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company's Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's current biologics workflow solutions. To fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company divested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ('MCPS Series A'), approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the 2019 issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, and approximately $6.9 billion from the aggregate of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the Company's Five-Year Facility (as defined below) and cash on hand. The Company recorded approximately $10.2 billion of goodwill related to the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company acquired four businesses for total consideration of $256 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segments. The Company recorded an aggregate of $231 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the five businesses acquired in 2020 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $3.3 billion.\n\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five business for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these businesses at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million.

      "answer": "AbbVie capitalizes and amortizes royalty obligations related to marketed products that are part of licensing rights acquired in collaborations or asset acquisitions, as seen in their treatment of regulatory and commercial milestone payments. These royalty obligations are explicitly expensed to cost of products sold when incurred. Licensing rights, as defined in related disclosures, include future royalty, milestone, and profit-sharing payments. In contrast, Pfizer identifies royalty payments as a risk factor due to potential third-party intellectual property claims, particularly in high-profile cases involving products like Comirnaty and Paxlovid, where adverse rulings could result in significant royalty payments. Therefore, while AbbVie proactively accounts for royalty obligations within its licensing rights framework, Pfizer faces royalty exposure as a contingent liability stemming from unresolved patent disputes, highlighting different financial and strategic exposures to royalty payments despite both companies being significantly impacted by licensing rights structures.",

For each type of rebate, factors used in the calculation of the accrual include the identification of the products subject to the rebate, the applicable price terms and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of the rebate, which can be significant.\n\nIn addition to revenue from contracts with customers, the company also recognizes certain collaboration revenues. See Note 6 for additional information related to the collaborations with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. Additionally, see Note 16 for disaggregation of revenue by product and geography.\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nInternal R&amp;D costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

          "chunk_text": "## RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, TECHNOLOG Y AND SECURITY:\n\n## INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY PR OTE CTION\n\nOur success largely depends on our ability to m arket technologically com petitive products. W e rely and expect to continue to rely on a com bination of intellectual property, including patent, tradem ark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and dom ain nam e protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreem ents, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. I f we fail to obtain and m aintain adequate intellectual property protection, we m ay not be able to prevent third parties from  launching generic or biosim ilar versions of our branded products, from  using our proprietary technologies or from  m arketing products that are very sim ilar or identical to ours. O ur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a tim ely basis. Sim ilarly, any term  extensions that we seek m ay not be granted on a tim ely basis, if at all, and any term  adjustm ents related to patent office delays in obtaining a patent m ay be reduced or elim inated entirely due to risks associated with changes in law relating to patent term s. In addition, our issued patents m ay not contain claim s sufficiently broad to protect us against claim s regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term  m ade by parties with sim ilar technologies or products or provide us with any com petitive advantage, including patent-based exclusivity in a particular technology or product area.\n\nFurther, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governm ents could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from  enforcing intellectual property related to our products. F or exam ple, the W T O 's June 2022 M inisterial D ecision on the Agreem ent on T rade-R elated Aspects of I ntellectual P roperty R ights seeks to m ake it easier for certain W T O  m em bers to issue a com pulsory license on C O VID -19 vaccines.\n\nThe scope of our patent claim s also m ay vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcem ent practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property fram ework (e.g., laws or regulations that prom ote or provide broad discretion to issue a com pulsory license). In countries that provide som e form  of regulatory exclusivity, m echanism s exist perm itting som e form  of challenge to our patents by com petitors or generic drug m arketers prior to or im m ediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic com panies are employing aggressive strategies, such as 'at-risk' launches that challenge our patent rights. M ost of the suits involve claim s by generic drug m anufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage form s are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosim ilar drug m anufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attem pts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair com petition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claim s m ay also be brought as counterclaim s to actions we bring to enforce our patents. W e are also party to other patent dam ages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governm ents or other parties are seeking dam ages from  us for alleged delay of generic entry. W e also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-exam ination or opposition proceedings, before the U .S. P atent and T radem ark O ffice, the E uropean P atent O ffice, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a com petitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosim ilar products could be introduced into the m arket resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. F or additional inform ation, including inform ation regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . F urther, if we are unable to m aintain our existing license agreem ents or other agreem ents pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold tradem ark registrations and have tradem ark applications pending in m any jurisdictions, any of which m ay be the subject of a governm ental or third-party objection, which could prevent the m aintenance or issuance of the tradem ark. As our products m ature, our reliance on our tradem arks and trade dress to differentiate us from  our com petitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from  adopting, registering or using tradem arks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. W e seek to protect our proprietary inform ation, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our em ployees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary inform ation and confidentiality agreem ents upon the com m encem ent of their relationship with us. D espite these efforts and precautions, we m ay be unable to prevent a third-party from  copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal rem edies m ay not adequately com pensate us for the dam ages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others m ay independently and lawfully develop substantially sim ilar or identical products that circum vent our intellectual property by m eans of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY CLAIMS\n\nA properly functioning intellectual property regim e is essential to our business m odel. W e are com m itted to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other com panies, but the patent granting process is im perfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities m ay require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were im properly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges m ay not always be successful.\n\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosim ilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which m ay involve litigation, associated costs and tim e delays, and m ay ultim ately not be successful. T hese opportunities m ay arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In som e circum stances we m ay take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a 'first-to-m arket' or early m arket position for our products.\n\nThird parties m ay claim  that our products infringe one or m ore patents owned or controlled by them . C laim s of intellectual property infringem ent can be costly and tim e-consum ing to resolve, m ay delay or prevent product launches, and m ay result in significant royalty paym ents or dam ages or potential licensing agreem ents. F or exam ple, our R &amp;D  in a therapeutic area m ay not be first and another com pany or entity m ay have obtained relevant patents before us. W e are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attem pts to market pharm aceutical products, including related to Abrysvo, C om irnaty and P axlovid. As we expand our m R N A portfolio, patent-related disputes m ay increase. O nce we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we m ay decide to com m ercially m arket these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 'at-risk' launch). I f one of our m arketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-prom otion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party m ay be awarded significant dam ages or royalty paym ents, or we m ay be prevented from  further sales of that product. Such dam ages m ay be enhanced as m uch as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n21",

      "answer": "JNJ's $93 million in curtailments and settlements in 2023 represents a direct financial adjustment to its Retirement Plans, indicating a strategic move to reduce future liabilities. This figure contributes to JNJ's overall net periodic benefit credit of $(676) million for 2023, showing a significant reduction in pension costs. MDT, on the other hand, engages with retirement plans through a broader sponsorship framework, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many international employees, though without specific curtailment figures disclosed. MDT's involvement reflects a structural commitment rather than a transactional adjustment, suggesting a more sustained long-term liability exposure compared to JNJ's targeted reduction.",

        "Hop 2: Curtailments & Settlements \u2192 Retirement Plans: Curtailments and settlements are direct financial actions taken by a company to reduce or settle portions of its pension liabilities, reflected in the overall net periodic benefit cost (or credit).",

      "question": "How does the increase in Pfizer's trade accounts payable in 2021 compare to the trade accounts payable of Cytiva as reported in Danaher's financial statements, and what does this imply about their respective working capital strategies following Danaher's acquisition of Cytiva?",
      "answer": "Pfizer reported a trade accounts payable of $5,578 million in 2021, up from $4,283 million in 2020, indicating a significant increase in short-term liabilities. In contrast, Cytiva, as a segment within Danaher, had a trade accounts payable of $247 million in 2021. Given that Danaher acquired Cytiva for $20.7 billion in 2020, the relatively small trade accounts payable of Cytiva suggests that it operates with a leaner working capital structure compared to Pfizer, which may reflect differences in their supply chain and operational financing strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PFE \u2192 Trade Accounts Payable: Pfizer's trade accounts payable increased from $4,283 million in 2020 to $5,578 million in 2021, indicating a growing reliance on short-term liabilities to manage working capital.",
        "Hop 2: Trade Accounts Payable \u2192 Cytiva: Cytiva, as a segment of Danaher, reported trade accounts payable of $247 million in 2021, significantly lower than Pfizer\u2019s, suggesting a different approach to managing short-term obligations.",
        "Hop 3: Cytiva \u2190 DHR: Danaher acquired Cytiva for $20.7 billion in 2020, integrating it into its Life Sciences segment, which provides context for how Cytiva's financial structure fits within a larger corporate entity."

The Company preliminarily recorded approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill related to the Aldevron Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, the Company acquired 13 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company's ('GE') Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the 'Cytiva Acquisition'). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company's Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's current biologics workflow solutions. To fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company divested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ('MCPS Series A'), approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the 2019 issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, and approximately $6.9 billion from the aggregate of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the Company's Five-Year Facility (as defined below) and cash on hand. The Company recorded approximately $10.2 billion of goodwill related to the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company acquired four businesses for total consideration of $256 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segments. The Company recorded an aggregate of $231 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the five businesses acquired in 2020 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $3.3 billion.\n\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five business for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these businesses at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million. The Company recorded an aggregate of $217 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions.",

      "question": "How did AbbVie's $3.5 billion intangible asset impairment in 2023 impact its operating profit relative to Danaher's quarterly operating profit performance during the same period?",
      "answer": "AbbVie's 2023 operating profit was reduced by a $3.5 billion intangible asset impairment, which significantly impacted its financial results. Meanwhile, Danaher's operating profit showed a downward trend throughout 2023, declining from $1,931 million in Q1 to $1,997 million in Q4, with a noticeable dip in Q2 and Q3. This comparison highlights that while AbbVie's operating profit was heavily affected by one-time impairment charges, Danaher experienced a more gradual decline in operating profit across the year, suggesting differing financial pressures and strategic challenges between the two companies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV \u2192 Intangible Asset Impairment: AbbVie reported a $3.5 billion charge related to intangible asset impairment in 2023, which directly reduced its operating profit.",
        "Hop 2: Intangible Asset Impairment \u2192 Operating Profit: The impairment charge had a negative impact on operating profit, as seen in the financial results section of AbbVie's 10-K filing.",
        "Hop 3: Operating Profit \u2190 DHR: Danaher's 2023 quarterly operating profit declined from $1,931 million in Q1 to $1,185 million in Q3 before rebounding slightly to $1,337 million in Q4, indicating a downward trend for most of the year."

      "answer": "LLY's pension benefit obligation (PBO) increased by $2.13 billion in 2020 due to a decline in discount rates. According to the evidence, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate can increase PBO by $500 million. In contrast, CVS reported a decline in its PBO from $6,462 million in 2020 to $6,009 million in 2021. This suggests that either discount rates increased during that period or other offsetting actuarial gains occurred, despite potential downward pressure from demographic or other factors. The sensitivity of PBO to discount rate changes highlights that shifts in interest rates could have significantly influenced CVS\u2019s year-over-year obligation changes, and understanding the actuarial assumptions behind these figures is key to assessing pension-related financial risk.",

Instead, DHR highlights that benefit accruals under most U.S. pension plans have ceased, with health care and life insurance benefits being among the remaining postretirement obligations.

      "question": "How might the expiration of AbbVie's key medical device-related patents between 2027 and 2033 intersect with Abbott's $604 million 2023 investment in medical device property and equipment to shape long-term competitive dynamics in the diabetes care device market?",
      "answer": "AbbVie's significant patents covering products like Imbruvica (ibrutinib), Skyrizi (risankizumab), and Rinvoq (upadacitinib) - with key U.S. composition of matter patents expiring between 2027 and 2033 - suggest a timeframe during which the company may face increased competition that could impact its medical device portfolio. Meanwhile, Abbott's $604 million investment in 2023 for medical device property and equipment indicates a strategic commitment to strengthening its manufacturing and development capabilities in this space. This combination of AbbVie's impending patent expirations and Abbott's infrastructure investment could create a window of opportunity for Abbott to gain market share in diabetes care devices as AbbVie faces potential erosion of exclusivity protections on its products, assuming Abbott successfully leverages its enhanced production capabilities.",

      "answer": "In 2021, both CVS and Merck maintained their expected rates of return on pension assets from the prior year, with CVS reporting a 6.6% expected return and Merck reporting a slightly higher rate of 6.70%. CVS's decision to keep its expected return unchanged from 2020 (also 6.6%) suggests a stable view on its pension asset portfolio, which totaled $902 million as of December 31, 2021. Merck, by contrast, had lowered its expected return from 7.30% in 2020 to 6.70% in 2021, indicating a potential shift in asset allocation or risk outlook. This comparison suggests that while both companies maintained consistent assumptions in 2021, their underlying pension investment strategies may differ in terms of risk tolerance and expected performance.",

      "answer": "CVS's 12% year-over-year decline in net investment income in 2023 could increase its sensitivity to CMS risk adjustment data validation (RADV) assessments, as net investment income is included in universal life and investment-type product policy fees and assessments. Given that UNH has faced retrospective payment adjustments from CMS RADV audits, which validate coding practices for Medicare plans, CVS may also face similar regulatory scrutiny. This is particularly relevant as both companies operate in the Medicare Advantage space, where payment adjustments are made based on enrollee health status data submitted to CMS. With declining net investment income, any additional financial exposure from CMS assessments or audit outcomes could further strain CVS's financial performance.",

      "answer": "JNJ's Innovative Medicine segment restructuring charges rose to $500 million in 2023, which contributed to an increase in milestone payments as part of its R&D portfolio prioritization and program exits. This contrasts with GILD's situation, where milestone payments received in 2023 were significantly lower compared to 2022, contributing to a 39% decline in its royalty, contract, and other revenues. While JNJ's strategic restructuring led to higher milestone-related expenses, GILD faced a reduction in milestone-driven income, highlighting divergent trends in how the two companies are impacted by milestone payment dynamics.",

Remaining performance obligations are closely related to backlog, as evidenced by RTX's 10-K which explicitly equates backlog to RPO.

      "answer": "TMO experienced a slight decrease in Adjusted Operating Income from $9,810 million in 2023 to $9,707 million in 2024, a decline of $103 million. In contrast, CVS's Health Care Benefits segment saw a significant drop in Adjusted Operating Income, falling from $5,577 million in 2023 to $307 million in 2024, a decrease of $5,270 million.

      "question": "How do UnitedHealth's (UNH) liquidity strategies for meeting long-term obligations compare to Thermo Fisher's (TMO) use of hedging mechanisms like cumulative basis adjustments, and what does this reveal about their contrasting approaches to maintaining financial flexibility?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth (UNH) emphasizes liquidity management through a combination of operating cash flows, dividends from regulated subsidiaries ($8.0 billion in 2021), and access to long-term debt and credit facilities to meet long-term obligations and maintain financial flexibility. In contrast, Thermo Fisher (TMO) discloses that it uses cumulative basis adjustments related to fair value hedges, which are classified under long-term obligations, indicating a more derivative-driven strategy to manage financial exposure. This reveals that UNH relies heavily on operational cash generation and structured capital distributions, while TMO employs financial hedging instruments to adjust and stabilize the valuation of long-term liabilities, reflecting different philosophies in managing balance sheet risks.",

        "Hop 1: UNH \u2192 Long-Term Obligations: UNH discloses reliance on dividends from regulated subsidiaries ($8.0 billion in 2021), operating cash flows, and debt issuance to meet long-term obligations and maintain liquidity.",

We continually forecast and manage our cash, investments, working capital balances and capital structure to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our businesses while seeking to maintain liquidity and financial flexibility. Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses.\n\nOur regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.\n\nOur U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion and $8.3 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.\n\nOur nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\n\n## Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\n",

      "answer": "ABT reported a $1.141 billion net actuarial gain in 2021, which was primarily attributed to actual asset returns exceeding expected returns and an increase in discount rates. This indicates that favorable investment performance significantly improved ABT's pension and medical plan valuations. In contrast, LLY takes a forward-looking approach to evaluating expected asset returns, factoring in current and projected market conditions, historical performance, and external financial advice. While ABT's gain reflects a realized outcome from market performance, LLY's process emphasizes predictive modeling and benchmarking against similar plans to set assumptions for future returns.",

      "answer": "BMY increased its rate of compensation from 1.2% in 2022 to 1.4% in 2023, which could increase its pension obligations as future benefit payouts are tied to this metric. The industry-wide trend, as seen in the intermediary pension assumptions, shows a higher rate of compensation increase (1.98% in 2023), suggesting upward pressure on pension liabilities across the sector. However, PFE notes that the compensation increase rate is not used in determining benefit costs or obligations for its U.S. pension plans since they are frozen, indicating a different risk exposure despite the shared trend in compensation increases. This divergence in plan structure means BMY faces more direct pension liability sensitivity to compensation trends than PFE.",

Amgen, on the other hand, values contingent consideration obligations using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, with inputs such as milestone probabilities, timing, and estimated annual sales tied directly to licensing rights from product candidates. While Pfizer spreads risk and recognition over time through a structured funding model, Amgen\u2019s approach is more event-driven and contingent on achieving development, regulatory, or commercial milestones, creating different financial exposure profiles and revenue (or expense) recognition dynamics.",

(a)\n\n## Note 15. Leases\n\nWe lease real estate, fleet, and equipm ent for use in our operations. O ur leases generally have lease term s of 1 to 30 years, som e of which include options to term inate or extend leases for up to 5 to 10 years or on a m onth-to-m onth basis. W e include options that are reasonably certain to be exercised as part of the determ ination of lease term s. W e m ay negotiate term ination clauses in anticipation of any changes in m arket conditions, but generally these term ination options have not been exercised. R esidual value guarantees are generally not included within our operating leases with the exception of som e fleet leases. In addition to base rent paym ents, the leases m ay require us to pay directly for taxes and other non-lease com ponents, such as insurance, m aintenance and other operating expenses, which m ay be dependent on usage or vary m onth-to-m onth. Variable lease paym ents amounted to $517 m illion in 2024, $444 m illion in 2023 and $536 m illion in 2022. W e elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease com ponents from  lease com ponents in calculating the am ounts of R O U  assets and lease liabilities for all underlying asset classes.\n\nWe determ ine if an arrangem ent is a lease at inception of the contract and we perform  the lease classification test as of the lease com m encem ent date. R O U  assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term  and lease liabilities represent our obligation to m ake lease paym ents arising from  the lease. O perating lease R O U  assets and liabilities are recognized at com m encem ent date based on the present value of lease paym ents over the lease term . As m ost of our leases do not provide an im plicit rate, we use our estim ated increm ental borrowing rate based on the inform ation available at com m encem ent date in determ ining the present value of future paym ents.\n\nFor operating leases, the R O U  assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets follows:\n\n",

In contrast, CVS disclosed that acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in 2023 were incurred in connection with the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health, although the specific margin impact was not quantified.

      "answer": "LLY discloses that it makes contingent royalty and milestone payments to third parties based on the success of pharmaceutical products in development, with potential aggregate material impact if multiple milestones are achieved in the same period. These payments are viewed positively as they indicate successful development progress. AMGN, on the other hand, records contingent consideration obligations tied to licensing rights at fair value using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, which are revalued each reporting period. These obligations are based on unobservable inputs such as estimated probabilities and timing of achieving development, regulatory, and commercial milestones, and changes in their valuation are recognized in operating expenses. The key distinction lies in LLY's discretion to terminate development and avoid payments, versus AMGN's formalized fair-value accounting tied to specific licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations.",

          "chunk_text": "We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that hav e a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to hav e a material future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, rev enues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. We acquire and collaborate on potential products still in dev elopment and enter into research and dev elopment arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third-party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future ev ents linked to the success of the asset in development. Milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achiev ement of an important point in the dev elopment life cycle of the pharmaceutical product (e.g., approv al for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achiev ement of certain sales lev els). If required by the arrangement, we may make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the product in the ev ent that regulatory approv al for marketing is obtained.\n\nIndiv idually, these arrangements are generally not material in any one annual reporting period. Howev er, if milestones for multiple products cov ered by these arrangements were reached in the same reporting period, the aggregate expense or aggregate milestone payments made could be material to our results of operations or cash flows, respectiv ely, in that period. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These arrangements often giv e us the discretion to unilaterally terminate dev elopment of the product, which would allow us to av oid making the contingent payments; however, we are unlikely to cease dev elopment if the compound successfully achiev es milestone objectiv es. We v iew these payments as positiv e because they signify that the product is successfully mov ing through dev elopment and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products.\n\n## APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, rev enues, expenses, and related disclosures. Some of those judgments can be subjectiv e and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates. For any giv en indiv idual estimate or assumption we make, it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could dev elop different estimates. We believ e that, giv en current facts and circumstances, it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adv erse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or liquidity for the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our most critical accounting estimates hav e been discussed with our audit committee and are described below.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Sales Return, Rebate, and Discount Accruals\n\n## Background and Uncertainties\n\nWe recognize revenue primarily from two different types of contracts, product sales to customers (net product rev enue) and collaborations and other arrangements. For product sales to customers, prov isions for returns, rebates and discounts are established in the same period the related product sales are recognized. To determine the appropriate transaction price for our product sales at the time we recognize a sale to a direct customer, we estimate any rebates or discounts that ultimately will be due to the direct customer and other customers in the distribution chain under the terms of our contracts. Significant judgments are required in making these estimates. The largest of our sales rebate and discount amounts include rebates associated with sales cov ered by managed care, Medicare, Medicaid, and chargeback programs, as well as reductions in rev enue related to our patient assistance programs, in the U.S. In determining the appropriate accrual amount, we consider our historical rebate payments for these programs, as well as patient assistance program costs, by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends (e.g., patent expiries and product launches), an ev aluation of the current contracts for these programs, the percentage of our products that are sold v ia these programs, and our product pricing. Although we accrue a liability for rev enue reductions related to these programs at the time we record the sale, the reduction related to that sale is typically paid up to six months later. Because of this time lag, in any particular period our net product rev enue may incorporate rev isions of accruals for sev eral periods.\n\nRefer to Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on rev enue recognition and sales return, rebate, and discount accruals.\n\nRevenue recognized from collaborations and other arrangements includes our share of profits from the collaborations, as well as royalties, upfront and milestone payments we receiv e under these types of contracts.",

We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs, as applicable, include foreign currency exchange rates, SOFR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. Certain inputs, when applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 19, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Contingent consideration obligations\n\nAs a result of our business acquisitions, we have incurred contingent consideration obligations as discussed below. The contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their fair values by using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, and we revalue these obligations each reporting period until the related contingencies have been resolved. The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations, and they are reviewed quarterly by management in our R&amp;D and commercial sales organizations. The inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related development, regulatory and commercial events or that shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events or that increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the obligations, as applicable.

These licensing rights include future royalty payments tied to the commercial success of acquired products (Hop 2). Pfizer, which faces risks related to third-party intellectual property claims and potential royalty payments\u2014particularly in therapeutic areas like oncology and vaccines\u2014could see its exposure to such payments increase if Amgen\u2019s adjustments to licensing rights valuations signal stronger market performance or regulatory success of similar product categories (Hop 3).

The fair values of our money market mutual funds and equity investments in publicly traded securities, including our equity investments in BeiG ene and Neumora, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, are based on quoted market prices in active markets, with no valuation adjustment .\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll of our foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P, Moody's or Fitch. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs, as applicable, include foreign currency exchange rates, SOFR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. Certain inputs, when applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 19, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Contingent consideration obligations\n\nAs a result of our business acquisitions, we have incurred contingent consideration obligations as discussed below. The contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their fair values by using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, and we revalue these obligations each reporting period until the related contingencies have been resolved. The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations, and they are reviewed quarterly by management in our R&amp;D and commercial sales organizations. The inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related development, regulatory and commercial events or that shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events or that increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the obligations, as applicable. Changes in the fair values of contingent consideration obligations are recognized in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.",

W e rely and expect to continue to rely on a com bination of intellectual property, including patent, tradem ark, trade dress, copyright, trade secret and dom ain nam e protection laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreem ents, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. I f we fail to obtain and m aintain adequate intellectual property protection, we m ay not be able to prevent third parties from  launching generic or biosim ilar versions of our branded products, from  using our proprietary technologies or from  m arketing products that are very sim ilar or identical to ours. O ur currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents or be granted on a tim ely basis. Sim ilarly, any term  extensions that we seek m ay not be granted on a tim ely basis, if at all, and any term  adjustm ents related to patent office delays in obtaining a patent m ay be reduced or elim inated entirely due to risks associated with changes in law relating to patent term s. In addition, our issued patents m ay not contain claim s sufficiently broad to protect us against claim s regarding validity, enforceability, scope and effective term  m ade by parties with sim ilar technologies or products or provide us with any com petitive advantage, including patent-based exclusivity in a particular technology or product area.\n\nFurther, legal or regulatory action by various stakeholders or governm ents could potentially result in us not seeking intellectual property protection for or agreeing not to enforce or being restricted from  enforcing intellectual property related to our products. F or exam ple, the W T O 's June 2022 M inisterial D ecision on the Agreem ent on T rade-R elated Aspects of I ntellectual P roperty R ights seeks to m ake it easier for certain W T O  m em bers to issue a com pulsory license on C O VID -19 vaccines.\n\nThe scope of our patent claim s also m ay vary between countries, as individual countries have distinct patent laws, and our ability to enforce our patents depends on the laws of each country, its enforcem ent practices, and the extent to which certain countries engage in policies or practices that weaken a country's intellectual property fram ework (e.g., laws or regulations that prom ote or provide broad discretion to issue a com pulsory license). In countries that provide som e form  of regulatory exclusivity, m echanism s exist perm itting som e form  of challenge to our patents by com petitors or generic drug m arketers prior to or im m ediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity, and generic com panies are employing aggressive strategies, such as 'at-risk' launches that challenge our patent rights. M ost of the suits involve claim s by generic drug m anufacturers that patents covering our products, uses, processes or dosage form s are invalid and/or do not cover the product of the generic or biosim ilar drug m anufacturer. Independent actions have been filed alleging that our assertions of, or attem pts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair com petition and/or violations of antitrust laws. Such claim s m ay also be brought as counterclaim s to actions we bring to enforce our patents. W e are also party to other patent dam ages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payors, governm ents or other parties are seeking dam ages from  us for alleged delay of generic entry. W e also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-exam ination or opposition proceedings, before the U .S. P atent and T radem ark O ffice, the E uropean P atent O ffice, or other foreign counterparts relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property rights of others. Also, if one of our patents or a com petitors' patents is found to be invalid in such proceedings, generic or biosim ilar products could be introduced into the m arket resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. F or additional inform ation, including inform ation regarding certain legal proceedings in which we are involved, see Note 16A1 . F urther, if we are unable to m aintain our existing license agreem ents or other agreem ents pursuant to which third parties grant us rights to intellectual property, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nWe currently hold tradem ark registrations and have tradem ark applications pending in m any jurisdictions, any of which m ay be the subject of a governm ental or third-party objection, which could prevent the m aintenance or issuance of the tradem ark. As our products m ature, our reliance on our tradem arks and trade dress to differentiate us from  our com petitors increases and, as a result, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third parties from  adopting, registering or using tradem arks and trade dress that infringe, dilute or otherwise violate our rights. W e seek to protect our proprietary inform ation, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by requiring our em ployees, consultants, other advisors and other third parties to execute proprietary inform ation and confidentiality agreem ents upon the com m encem ent of their relationship with us. D espite these efforts and precautions, we m ay be unable to prevent a third-party from  copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secrets or our other intellectual property without authorization, and legal rem edies m ay not adequately com pensate us for the dam ages caused by such unauthorized use. Further, others m ay independently and lawfully develop substantially sim ilar or identical products that circum vent our intellectual property by m eans of alternative designs or processes or otherwise.\n\n## THIRD-PARTY INTE LLE CTU AL PR OPE R TY CLAIMS\n\nA properly functioning intellectual property regim e is essential to our business m odel. W e are com m itted to respecting the valid intellectual property rights of other com panies, but the patent granting process is im perfect. Accordingly, the pursuit of valid business opportunities m ay require us to challenge intellectual property rights held by others that we believe were im properly granted, including challenges through negotiation and litigation, and such challenges m ay not always be successful.\n\nPart of our business depends upon identifying biosim ilar opportunities and launching products to take advantage of those opportunities, which m ay involve litigation, associated costs and tim e delays, and m ay ultim ately not be successful. T hese opportunities m ay arise in situations where patent protection of equivalent branded products has expired or been declared invalid, or where products do not infringe the patents of others. In som e circum stances we m ay take action, such as litigation, asserting that our products do not infringe patents of existing products or that those patents are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve a 'first-to-m arket' or early m arket position for our products.\n\nThird parties m ay claim  that our products infringe one or m ore patents owned or controlled by them . C laim s of intellectual property infringem ent can be costly and tim e-consum ing to resolve, m ay delay or prevent product launches, and m ay result in significant royalty paym ents or dam ages or potential licensing agreem ents. F or exam ple, our R &amp;D  in a therapeutic area m ay not be first and another com pany or entity m ay have obtained relevant patents before us. W e are involved in patent-related disputes with third parties over our attem pts to market pharm aceutical products, including related to Abrysvo, C om irnaty and P axlovid. As we expand our m R N A portfolio, patent-related disputes m ay increase. O nce we have final regulatory approval of the related products, we m ay decide to com m ercially m arket these products even though associated legal proceedings (including any appeals) have not been resolved (i.e., 'at-risk' launch). I f one of our m arketed products (or a product of our collaboration/licensing partners to which we have licenses or co-prom otion rights) is found to infringe valid patent rights of a third party, such third party m ay be awarded significant dam ages or royalty paym ents, or we m ay be prevented from  further sales of that product. Such dam ages m ay be enhanced as m uch as three-fold if we or one of our subsidiaries is found to have willfully infringed valid patent rights of a third party.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n21",

      "answer": "CVS's Retail/LTC segment records adjusted operating income that includes intersegment revenue, such as the $11.6 billion of retail co-payments in 2021, which arises when Pharmacy Services Segment clients pick up prescriptions at retail pharmacies instead of through mail service. This intersegment revenue is not eliminated in the stand-alone reporting of segment adjusted operating income, thereby inflating the metric. In contrast, Thermo Fisher explicitly excludes acquisition-related costs\u2014such as charges for the sale of inventories revalued at acquisition and transaction costs\u2014from its adjusted operating income, treating them as non-recurring and non-operational. This means that while CVS retains intersegment revenue in its adjusted operating income, TMO strips out certain acquisition-related expenses, leading to fundamentally different methodologies in how each company presents its core operational performance through adjusted operating income.",

A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

In contrast, TMO reported a backlog value of $46 million for CorEvitas, which is part of the net assets acquired in the acquisition.

      "question": "How does the exclusion of acquisition-related costs in Thermo Fisher's adjusted operating income potentially impact the comparability of their financial performance against CVS's Pharmacy Services segment, which includes prescription drug costs and retail co-payments of $11.6 billion in 2021 within its adjusted operating income calculations?",
      "answer": "Thermo Fisher's adjusted operating income excludes acquisition-related costs such as charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition and transaction costs, which they argue are not indicative of normal operating costs. Meanwhile, CVS's Pharmacy Services segment includes $11.6 billion in 2021 of retail co-payments in its adjusted operating income, which directly affects its revenue and cost of products sold. This difference in treatment means that comparing the two companies' adjusted operating income figures could be misleading, as Thermo Fisher removes certain non-recurring costs while CVS incorporates client-facing co-payment revenues, both under the banner of adjusted operating income but with materially different components.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TMO \u2192 Adjusted Operating Income: Thermo Fisher excludes acquisition-related costs from adjusted operating income, such as inventory revaluation charges and transaction costs, to reflect what management views as core operating performance.",
        "Hop 2: Adjusted Operating Income \u2192 Pharmacy Services Segment: CVS includes retail co-payments totaling $11.6 billion in 2021 in its Pharmacy Services segment adjusted operating income, indicating a different scope of what is considered core to segment performance.",
        "Hop 3: Pharmacy Services Segment \u2190 CVS: CVS's Pharmacy Services segment explicitly incorporates prescription drug costs, retail co-payments, and client service operations into its cost of products sold and adjusted operating income, showing how client-facing financial flows shape segment-level profitability."

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)\n\nDuring 2021, issuance of senior notes provided $18.14 billion of cash. A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

Intersegment adjusted operating income eliminations occur when members of Pharmacy Services Segment clients ('PSS members') enrolled in Maintenance Choice elect to pick up maintenance prescriptions at one of the Company's retail pharmacies instead of receiving them through the mail. When this occurs, both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments record the adjusted operating income on a stand-alone basis. \u00ae",

      "question": "How does BMY's exclusion of R&D charges related to third-party IP acquisitions in non-GAAP reporting affect its ability to invest in innovation compared to MRK's Animal Health segment, which directly allocates R&D costs to segment profits?",
      "answer": "BMY excludes R&D charges from non-GAAP earnings, which may present a more favorable baseline performance and potentially increase flexibility for reinvestment in innovation. In contrast, MRK directly allocates R&D costs to its Animal Health segment profits, indicating a more transparent and segmented accountability for innovation spending. This structural difference suggests that BMY may have more discretion in how R&D investments are portrayed in financial reporting, while MRK ties R&D spending explicitly to the performance of its Animal Health business unit, which reported segment profits based on sales net of all directly incurred costs including R&D.",

These  items  are  adjusted  after considering their quantitative and qualitative aspects and typically have one or more of the following characteristics, such as being highly variable, difficult to project, unusual in nature, significant to the results of a particular period or not indicative of future operating results. Similar charges or gains were recognized in prior periods and will likely reoccur in future periods including (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, including product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue and will recur until the intangible assets are fully amortized, (ii) unwind of inventory purchase price adjustments, (iii) acquisition and integration  expenses,  (iv)  restructuring  costs,  (v)  accelerated  depreciation  and  impairment  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  and intangible assets, (vi) R&amp;D charges or other income resulting from up-front or contingent milestone payments in connection with the  acquisition  or  licensing  of  third-party  intellectual  property  rights,  (vii)  divestiture  gains  or  losses,  (viii)  stock  compensation resulting from accelerated vesting of Celgene awards and certain retention-related employee compensation charges related to the Celgene transaction, (ix) pension, legal and other contractual settlement charges, (x) equity investment and contingent value rights fair value adjustments, including adjustments attributed to limited partnership equity method investments and (xi) amortization of fair value adjustments of debt acquired from Celgene in our 2019 exchange offer, among other items. Deferred and current income taxes attributed to these items are also adjusted for considering their individual impact to the overall tax expense, deductibility and jurisdictional tax rates. Certain other significant tax items are also excluded such as the impact resulting from internal transfers of intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the Celgene acquisition and the GILTI tax charge upon finalization of the Otezla* divestiture in 2020. We also provide international revenues for our priority products excluding the impact  of  foreign  exchange.  We  calculate  foreign  exchange  impacts  by  converting  our  current-period  local  currency  financial results  using  the  prior  period  average  currency  rates  and  comparing  these  adjusted  amounts  to  our  current-period  results.

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

      "answer": "Optum's 12% revenue growth, driven by increased earnings from operations at Optum Health and Optum Rx, strengthens its market position as a leading PBM, which in turn increases its leverage over pharmaceutical manufacturers like Bristol-Myers Squibb. Given that Optum, as part of UnitedHealth Group, controls a significant portion of the formulary decision-making for nearly 80% of the U.S. prescription market, BMY must tailor its pricing and rebate strategies to secure formulary placement.

For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 'Business - G overnment Regulation' and Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nMedicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 and 2025 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, both of which are well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend. The Advance Notice for 2026 rates proposes an industry base rate increase also well short of forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient's health status and care resource needs, will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\n\nAs a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n## SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS\n\nThe following summarizes select 2024 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2023 and other financial results.\n\n- Consolidated revenues grew 8%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 6% and Optum revenues grew 12%.\n- UnitedHealthcare served 2.1 million more people domestically, driven by growth in commercial offerings, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations.\n- Earnings from operations of $32.3 billion compared to $32.4 billion last year.\n- Diluted earnings per common share was $15.51, impacted by the loss on sale of subsidiary and subsidiaries held for sale.\n- Cash flows from operations were $24.2 billion.",

In addition, generic pharmaceutical companies may introduce a generic product before exclusivity has expired, and before the resolution of any related patent litigation. For more information about market exclusivity, refer to '-Products, Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity.'\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\n\n## Pricing, Price Constraints and Market Access\n\nOur medicines are priced based on a number of factors, including the value of scientific innovation for patients and society in the context of overall health care spend, economic factors impacting health care systems' ability to provide appropriate and sustainable access and the necessity to sustain our investment in innovation platforms to address unmet medical needs. Central to price is the clinical value that this innovation brings to the market, the current landscape of alternative treatment options and the goals of ensuring appropriate patient access to this innovation and sustaining investment in creative platforms. We continue to explore new pricing approaches to ensure that patients have access to our medicines. Enhancing patient access to medicines is a priority for us. We are focused on: offering creative tiered  pricing  and  patient  support  programs  to  optimize  access  while  protecting  innovation;  advocating  for  sustainable  healthcare  policies  and  infrastructure, leveraging advocacy/payer's input and utilizing collaborations as appropriate; and improving access to care and supportive services for vulnerable patients through collaborations and demonstration projects.\n\nAn important factor on which the pricing of our medicines depends is government regulation. We have been subject to increasing international and domestic efforts by various governments to implement or strengthen measures to regulate pharmaceutical market access and product pricing and payment. In the U.S., we are required to provide discounts on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs. Federal government officials and legislators continue to face intense pressure from the public to manage the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals and have responded by pursuing legislation, such as the IRA and other rules that claim to potentially further reduce the cost of drugs for the federal government and other stakeholders. For further discussion on the IRA, refer to 'Item 1. Business-Government Regulation.' We are also required to comply with state laws that seek additional transparency into the cost of prescription drugs. We are monitoring efforts by states to seek additional rebates and limit state spending on drugs in light of budget pressures. These international, federal and state legislative  and  regulatory  developments  could  create  new  constraints  on  our  ability  to  set  prices  and/or  impact  our  market  access  in  certain  areas.  For  further discussion on the pricing pressure and its risk, refer to 'Item 1. Business-G overnment Regulation' and 'Item 1A. Risk Factors-Product, Industry and Operational Risks-Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.'\n\nThe growth and consolidation of MCOs and PBMs in the U.S., such as Optum (UHC), CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESI), has also been a major factor in the healthcare marketplace. These PBMs control nearly 80% of the prescription market and are owned by payers UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Cigna, respectively. As MCOs and PBMs have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, they have also been enhancing their purchasing strength and share of voice within the market. Over half of the U.S. population now participates in some version of managed care. MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations. PBMs are third parties that support formulary management and contracting for MCOs.\n\nTo successfully compete for formulary position with MCOs and PBMs, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in patient populations due to higher out-of-pocket costs to patients. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included on these formularies. Most new products that we introduce compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Where possible, companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy, usually provided as a rebate to the PBM, is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO and PBM formularies.",

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

Actual results may differ from the company's estimates.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development\n\nIn an asset acquisition, the initial costs to acquire rights to IPR&amp;D projects are expensed as IPR&amp;D in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include initial payments incurred prior to regulatory approval in connection with research and development collaboration agreements that provide rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or sell pharmaceutical products. In a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definitelived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Foreign Currency Translation\n\nForeign subsidiary earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net assets of subsidiaries in highly inflationary economies are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency. The remeasurement is recognized in net foreign exchange loss in the consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument.\n\nFor derivatives formally designated as hedges, the company assesses at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in AOCI and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from AOCI to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings.\n\nThe company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from these hedges are included in AOCI.\n\nDerivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in the investing section of the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\n## Recent Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\n\n## ASU No. 2019-12\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) . The standard includes simplifications related to accounting for income taxes including removing certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The standard also clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. AbbVie adopted the standard in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.",

Estimating the impact of restructuring plans, including future termination benefits, integration expenses and other exit costs, requires judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Restructuring charges are recognized upon meeting certain criteria, including finalization of committed plans, reliable estimates and discussions with local works councils in certain markets.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nLoss  contingencies  from  legal  proceedings  and  claims  may  occur  from  government  investigations,  shareholder  lawsuits,  product  and  environmental  liability, contractual claims, tax and other matters. Accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies (including contingent proceeds related to the divestitures) are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are ex pensed as incurred.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRefer to '-Note 2. Revenue' for a detailed discussion of accounting policies related to revenue recognition, including deferred revenue and royalties. Refer to 'Note 3. Alliances' for further details regarding alliances.\n\n## Research and Development and Acquired IPRD\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study and certain research costs are recognized over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Research and development costs are presented net of reimbursements from alliance partners.\n\nAcquired IPRD expenses include upfront payments, contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or in-license arrangements of third-party intellectual property rights, as well as any upfront and contingent milestones payable by BMS to alliance partners prior to regulatory approval.\n\nThe Company's Acquired IPRD by type of transaction was as follows:\n\n",

The fair values of our money market mutual funds and equity investments in publicly traded securities, including our equity investments in BeiG ene and Neumora, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, are based on quoted market prices in active markets, with no valuation adjustment .\n\n## Derivatives\n\nAll of our foreign currency forward contracts, cross-currency swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A- or equivalent by S&amp;P, Moody's or Fitch. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs, as applicable, include foreign currency exchange rates, SOFR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. Certain inputs, when applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 19, Derivative instruments.\n\n## Contingent consideration obligations\n\nAs a result of our business acquisitions, we have incurred contingent consideration obligations as discussed below. The contingent consideration obligations are recorded at their fair values by using probability-adjusted discounted cash flows, and we revalue these obligations each reporting period until the related contingencies have been resolved. The fair value measurements of these obligations are based on significant unobservable inputs related to licensing rights and product candidates acquired in business combinations, and they are reviewed quarterly by management in our R&amp;D and commercial sales organizations. The inputs include, as applicable, estimated probabilities and the timing of achieving specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones as well as estimated annual sales. Significant changes that increase or decrease the probabilities of achieving the related development, regulatory and commercial events or that shorten or lengthen the time required to achieve such events or that increase or decrease estimated annual sales would result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the obligations, as applicable.

      "answer": "TMO reported a significant increase in its domestic discount rate for interest cost from 2.70% in 2022 to 5.01% in 2023, while MDT showed a more moderate increase from 3.90% to 4.73% over the same period. This suggests that TMO has taken a more aggressive stance in aligning its discount rate assumptions with rising market interest rates, which would reduce the present value of pension liabilities more sharply compared to MDT\u2019s approach. The intermediate data from PM_10k_2023 shows that increasing discount rates is a broader trend in pension accounting, with similar directional changes observed across industries, reinforcing the plausibility of TMO and MDT\u2019s adjustments as part of a systemic response to macroeconomic conditions.",

      "answer": "MDT reported an amortization of net actuarial loss of $64 million for 2022, which contributed significantly to its U.S. pension benefit cost of $39 million. In contrast, JNJ recognized a much larger net actuarial loss of $3,948 million in 2022, which was carried in accumulated other comprehensive income. This shows that while both companies experienced net actuarial losses in 2022, the scale and accounting treatment differ markedly, with JNJ holding a significantly larger unrecognized loss that could affect future pension costs.",

        "Hop 1: MDT \u2192 2022: MDT disclosed that in 2022, the amortization of net actuarial loss was $64 million, which was a key component of its U.S. pension benefit cost of $39 million.",
        "Hop 2: 2022 \u2192 Net Actuarial Loss: The 2022 net actuarial loss is a recognized financial metric that reflects the change in pension obligations due to assumptions versus actual outcomes.",

      "answer": "Danaher experienced a 60.5% gross profit margin in 2024, which was partially offset by a 230 basis point reduction due to higher raw and packaging material costs, including foreign exchange transaction costs. Abbott reported a 50.9% gross profit margin in 2024, which was positively impacted by margin improvement initiatives but also negatively affected by foreign exchange. Both companies faced pressure from material costs and foreign exchange, but Danaher's margin improvement (from 58.2% in 2023) outpaced Abbott's, which remained relatively flat compared to prior years.",

There are no significant patent or license expirations in the nex t three years that are ex pected to materially affect Abbott.\n\n## Operating Earnings\n\nGross profit margins were 50.9 percent of net sales in 2024, 50.3 percent of net sales in 2023, and 51.5 percent of net sales in 2022. The increase in 2024 reflects the favorable impacts of margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The decrease in 2023 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower sales of COVID-19 tests, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the negative impact in 2022 of the voluntary product recall in the nutritional business and the impact in 2023 of margin improvement initiatives.\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $2.8 billion in 2024, $2.7 billion in 2023, and $2.9 billion in 2022. The increase in R&amp;D expense in 2024 was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower 2024 charges for the impairment of in-process R&amp;D (IPR&amp;D) assets acquired in previous business combinations. In 2023, the decrease in R&amp;D expense was primarily driven by lower restructuring charges, lower impairment charges related to IPR&amp;D acquired in previous business combinations, and other cost reductions.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG &amp;A) expenses were $11.7 billion in 2024, $10.9 billion in 2023 and $11.2 billion in 2022. In 2024, higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The 2023 decrease in SG &amp;A expenses reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower restructuring charges in 2023, as well as the non-recurrence of 2022 expenses related to the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional Products segment.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nIn  2024, Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  certain  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and  improve  efficiencies  in  its  Diagnostic,  Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical and Nutritional businesses, including the discontinuation of its ZonePerfect product line. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $129 million, of which $62 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $21 million was recorded in Research and development, and $46  million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Payments related to these actions totaled $32 million in 2024 and the remaining liability totaled $97 million at December 31, 2024. In addition, Abbott recognized inventory related charges of $34 million and fixed asset impairment charges of $12 million related to these restructuring plans. \u00ae\n\nIn 2023, Abbott management approved plans to restructure various operations in order to reduce costs in its Medical Devices, Diagnostic, and Established Pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $144 million of which approximately $56 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $22 million was recorded in Research and development and $66 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized fixed asset impairment and inventory related charges of $31 million related to these restructuring plans.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its Medical Devices, Nutritional, Diagnostic, and Established Pharmaceutical businesses.

This creates a dependency that could disrupt supply chains if those suppliers face operational challenges.

Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including  a  stay  of  debtholder  litigation.  In  2017,  the  FOMBPR  approved  and  certified  the  filing  in  the  U.S.  District  Court  for  the District  of  Puerto  Rico  of  a  voluntary  petition  under  Title  III  of  PROMESA  for  the  government  of  Puerto  Rico  and  certain  of  its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which recently privatized its transmission and distribution infrastructure. After years of negotiations with bondholders and other creditors, the FOMBPR reached an agreement with the same and presented a Plan of Adjustment to the Title III Court. The Plan of Adjustment requires the Puerto Rico government to enact legislation authorizing the issuance of new bonds in exchange for older bonds and a reduction of the U.S. territory's debt. On October 26, 2021, Act 53-2021, known as the 'Law to End the Bankruptcy of Puerto Rico,' was enacted. From November to December 2021, the Court held several hearings regarding the approval of the Plan of Adjustment, and the Modified Eighth Plan of Adjustment was confirmed by the Court on January 18, 2022, to be effective on March 15, 2022.\n\nEach year since 2017, the FOMBPR has updated Puerto Rico's fiscal plans implementing various measures intended to achieve fiscal responsibility and to restore Puerto Rico's access to the capital markets, including significant expense reductions and suggested measures for economic growth. Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Rico's challenging economic and demographic trends. However, the government has not made significant progress during 2021 on the implementation of the fiscal and structural reforms required in the fiscal plan, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile  the  government  and  the  FOMBPR  have  authorized  emergency  relief  packages  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  it  is uncertain  how,  or  the  degree  to  which,  the  pandemic  will  impact  Puerto  Rico's  fiscal  and  structural  reforms  and  its  economy.  In addition, the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced rate. Given Puerto Rico's challenged economy, disaster recovery needs and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to Puerto Rico's economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation.\n\nWhile PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, Puerto Rico's ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters, the unreliability of its  electric  system, the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government's provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales.\n\nWe rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components.\n\nWe  rely  on  unaffiliated  third-party  suppliers  for  certain  raw  materials,  medical  devices  and  components  necessary  for  the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, we rely on a single source for the SureClick autoinjectors used in the drug delivery of Repatha, ENBREL, Aimovig, AMGEVITA and Aranesp. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin.\n\nAmong the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include:\n\n- regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others;\n- adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy;\n- unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components;",

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&amp;D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV  development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2024 was recorded in Restructuring on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs, asset impairments and asset divestments. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. Total project costs of approximately $0.6 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n32",

Meanwhile, JNJ disclosed a small reduction of $2 million in its retirement plans due to curtailments and settlements during the same year.

In contrast, Merck incurred $280 million in acquisition-related costs\u2014including severance, share-based compensation, and advisory fees\u2014specifically tied to its acquisition of Acceleron in 2021. This indicates that Merck's restructuring and integration efforts associated with the $11.5 billion Acceleron acquisition were significantly larger in scale than JNJ\u2019s ongoing severance liabilities, suggesting a more aggressive strategic realignment through M&A activity versus JNJ's more measured restructuring approach.",

Additionally, all outstanding Merck stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) (whether vested or unvested) were converted into adjusted Merck awards for current and former Merck employees or Organon awards for Organon employees (see Note 13).\n\n## 4.    Acquisitions, Research Collaborations and License Agreements\n\nThe  Company  continues  to  pursue  acquisitions  and  the  establishment  of  external  alliances  such  as  research collaborations and licensing agreements to complement its internal research capabilities. These arrangements often include upfront payments, as well as expense reimbursements or payments to the third party, and milestone, royalty or profit share arrangements, contingent  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  future  events  linked  to  the  success  of  the  asset  in  development.  The  Company  also reviews its marketed products and pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing and, as part of its portfolio assessment process, may also divest certain assets. Pro forma financial information for acquired businesses is not presented if the historical financial results of the acquired entity are not significant when compared with the Company's financial results.\n\n## 2021 Transactions\n\nIn November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, for total consideration of $11.5 billion. Acceleron is evaluating the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of proteins that  is  known  to  play  a  central  role  in  the  regulation  of  cell  growth,  differentiation  and  repair.  Acceleron's  lead  therapeutic candidate,  sotatercept  (MK-7962),  has  a  novel  mechanism  of  action  with  the  potential  to  improve  short-term  and/or  long-term clinical outcomes in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Sotatercept is in Phase 3 trials as an add-on to current standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  PAH.  Under  a  previous  agreement  assumed  by  Merck,  Bristol  Myers  Squibb  (BMS)  was granted an exclusive license to develop and commercialize sotatercept outside of the pulmonary hypertension (PH) field (for which Merck would be eligible to receive contingent milestones and royalty payments), however, Merck retains the worldwide exclusive rights to develop and commercialize sotatercept in the PH field. The agreement provides for Merck to pay 22% royalties on future sales of sotatercept in the PH field to BMS.\n\nIn  addition  to  sotatercept, Acceleron's  portfolio  includes Reblozyl (luspatercept),  a  first-in-class  erythroid  maturation recombinant fusion protein that is approved in the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood  disorders  and  is  also  being  evaluated  in  Phase  2  and  Phase  3  trials  for  additional  indications  for  hematology  therapies. Reblozyl is  being  developed  and  commercialized  through  a  global  collaboration  with  BMS.  In  connection  with  this  ongoing collaboration, Merck receives a 20% sales royalty from BMS which could increase to a maximum of 24% based on sales levels. This royalty will be reduced by 50% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. Merck is eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments including up to $20 million in regulatory milestones and up to $80 million in sales-based milestones.\n\nThe transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The Company incurred $280 million of costs directly related  to  the  acquisition  of Acceleron,  consisting  primarily  of  share-based  compensation  payments  to  settle  non-vested  equity awards attributable to postcombination service, severance, as well as investment banking and legal fees. These costs were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses and Research and development costs in 2021.",

Additionally, all outstanding Merck stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) (whether vested or unvested) were converted into adjusted Merck awards for current and former Merck employees or Organon awards for Organon employees (see Note 13).\n\n## 4.    Acquisitions, Research Collaborations and License Agreements\n\nThe  Company  continues  to  pursue  acquisitions  and  the  establishment  of  external  alliances  such  as  research collaborations and licensing agreements to complement its internal research capabilities. These arrangements often include upfront payments, as well as expense reimbursements or payments to the third party, and milestone, royalty or profit share arrangements, contingent  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  future  events  linked  to  the  success  of  the  asset  in  development.  The  Company  also reviews its marketed products and pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing and, as part of its portfolio assessment process, may also divest certain assets. Pro forma financial information for acquired businesses is not presented if the historical financial results of the acquired entity are not significant when compared with the Company's financial results.\n\n## 2021 Transactions\n\nIn November 2021, Merck acquired Acceleron Pharma Inc. (Acceleron), a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company, for total consideration of $11.5 billion.

      "answer": "In 2024, T-Mobile experienced actuarial gains for both domestic and non-U.S. pension plans due to increases in the weighted average discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation. This indicates that higher discount rates reduced the present value of their pension liabilities. Similarly, AbbVie reported an actuarial gain of $935 million for 2024, also attributable to increased discount rates, showing a parallel financial response to the same macroeconomic factor. Both companies thus benefited from the same directional movement in discount rates, which lowered their pension-related obligations.",

Cost of sales includes the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions, collaborations, and licensing arrangements, which totaled $2.4 billion in 2024 and $2.0 billion in 2023. A mortization expense in 2024 and 2023 includes $48 million and $154 million, respectively , of cumulative catch-up amortization related to M erck's collaborations with A straZeneca and Eisai, respectively . (See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on M erck's collaborative arrangements). A lso included in cost of sales are expenses associated with restructuring activities, which amounted to $495 million in 2024 and $211 million in 2023, primarily reflecting accelerated depreciation and asset impairment charges related  to  the  planned  sale  or  closure  of  manufacturing  facilities.  Separation  costs  associated  with  manufacturing-related  headcount reductions have been incurred and are reflected in Restructuring costs as discussed below.\n\nGross margin was 76.3% in 2024 compared with 73.2% in 2023. The gross margin improvement was primarily due to the favorable effects of product mix (including lower royalty rates related to Keytruda and Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales) and foreign exchange, partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets, higher restructuring costs (primarily reflecting asset impairment charges), and increased manufacturing-related costs (including inventory write-offs).\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A ) expenses were $10.8 billion in 2024, an increase of 3% compared with 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs (including compensation and benefits), and increased promotional costs (reflecting prioritization in support of key growth drivers including new product launches), as well as higher selling and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by the favorable effect of foreign exchange and lower restructuring costs.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.' Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nDiscussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n- Optum Health;\n- Optum Insight;\n- Optum Rx; and\n- UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, 'Business' and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Change Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers.\n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser ex tent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals' information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",

      "question": "How do ABBV's contingent consideration liabilities, including the $5.1 billion 2023 charge tied to Skyrizi, compare to DHR's long-term debt structure in terms of financial risk exposure and strategic flexibility?",
      "answer": "ABBV reported a $5.1 billion charge in 2023 related to contingent consideration liabilities for Skyrizi, stemming from stronger market share uptake and lower discount rates, with changes in fair value recorded in 'other expense, net' on the consolidated statements of earnings. This reflects high exposure to performance-based obligations tied to a single product. In contrast, DHR disclosed long-term debt instruments where no single debt issuance exceeds 10% of consolidated assets, indicating a more diversified and conservative debt structure. This contrast shows ABBV faces significant volatility from product performance-linked liabilities, whereas DHR maintains more predictable financial obligations, suggesting differing risk profiles and strategic flexibility in capital structure management.",

        "Hop 1: DHR \u2192 Consolidated Statements of Earnings: DHR discloses long-term debt instruments none of which exceed 10% of consolidated assets, indicating a conservative and diversified debt structure.",

        "Hop 3: Other Expense, Net \u2190 ABBV: ABBV's contingent liabilities are directly tied to performance metrics of key products like Skyrizi, introducing earnings volatility based on market dynamics and clinical outcomes."

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson's 2024 filing mentions its stake in the Pharmaceutical Segment but does not disclose specific profitability figures for that segment. In contrast, Merck's 2024 filing reports its Pharmaceutical segment profit as $44,533 million, which excludes certain categories of costs such as research and development expenses from Merck Research Laboratories, unallocated cost of sales, and general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segment. This selective inclusion of costs means that Merck's segment profit figure may present a more favorable view of operational performance compared to a fully burdened profitability metric that would include these additional expenses. Without JNJ providing similar segment-level profit details or cost allocation methodologies, a direct profit comparison between the two companies' pharmaceutical divisions remains limited to structural disclosures rather than full financial equivalency.",

      "answer": "ABBV's pension benefit obligation decreased from $8,719 million in 2020 to $7,788 million in 2021, a reduction of $931 million. This decrease followed an increase in the assumed discount rate, which contrasts with the modeled impact from the referenced actuarial analysis, where a 0.25 percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the PBO by $500 million. This inverse relationship suggests that ABBV's actual obligation was significantly influenced by changes in discount rate assumptions.

Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents will choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees.

      "answer": "MRK's U.S. Pension Benefits show a steady increase in liabilities, rising from $724 million in 2022 to $4,230 million cumulatively from 2027 to 2031. This trajectory implies growing long-term pension obligations that could be exacerbated by higher assumed rates of compensation increase, such as the 4.29% used by MRK in 2021. In contrast, DHR applies a lower 2.5% compensation increase assumption to its Non-U.S. Plans in 2021, which would likely result in slower growth in projected liabilities for those plans. This suggests that DHR may be adopting a more conservative approach to liability forecasting in its Non-U.S. Plans compared to MRK\u2019s U.S. Plans, potentially leading to different funding strategies and risk management approaches over time.",

A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value. If an impairment is identified, a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset's net book value over its fair value, and the cost basis is adjusted.\n\nAt December 31, property and equipment consisted of the following:\n\n",

      "question": "How does the $47 million allocation to other net liabilities by Amgen in the Five Prime Therapeutics acquisition compare with Merck's $32 million recognition of other net liabilities in the Themis Bioscience deal, particularly in terms of their respective acquisition accounting strategies and tax implications?",
      "answer": "Amgen allocated $47 million to other net liabilities in its acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics, a transaction accounted for as an asset acquisition due to the concentration of value in the bemarituzumab IPR&D program. This allocation was part of a broader $1.6 billion purchase price and the IPR&D expense of $1.5 billion was not tax deductible. In contrast, Merck recognized $32 million in other net liabilities as part of the $366 million acquisition of Themis Bioscience GmbH, which was treated as a business combination. Merck also recorded $72 million in deferred tax assets and $113 million in intangible assets for IPR&D, with the excess $239 million recorded as goodwill that is not tax deductible. The difference in liability allocations reflects distinct acquisition accounting strategies: Amgen's asset acquisition focused on intellectual property with immediate expense recognition, while Merck's business combination involved a broader set of assets and contingent liabilities, including potential future milestone payments.",

        "Hop 1: AMGN \u2192 Net Liabilities: Amgen allocated $47 million to other net liabilities in the $1.6 billion acquisition of Five Prime Therapeutics, an asset acquisition where the $1.5 billion IPR&D expense was immediately recognized and not tax deductible.",
        "Hop 2: Net Liabilities \u2192 Other Net Liabilities: The $47 million in other net liabilities from Amgen's acquisition is comparable to Merck's $32 million recognition of other net liabilities in the Themis Bioscience deal, both being components of their respective acquisition accounting strategies.",

The goodwill value represents expected synergies from both AMG 340 and the technologies acquired.\n\nOur  accounting  for  this  acquisition  is  preliminary  and  will  be  finalized  upon  completion  of  our  analysis  to  determine  the acquisition  date  fair  values  of  certain  assets  acquired,  liabilities  assumed  and  tax-related  items  as  we  obtain  additional  information during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date.\n\n## Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nOn April  16,  2021, Amgen  acquired  the  outstanding  stock  of  Five  Prime  for  total  consideration  of  $1.6  billion,  net  of  cash acquired.  The  purchase  price  was  funded  with  cash  on  hand.  This  transaction  was  accounted  for  as  an  asset  acquisition  because substantially all the value of the assets acquired was concentrated in the intellectual property rights of bemarituzumab, a phase 3 trialready,  first-in-class  program  for  gastric  cancer.  The  operations  of  Five  Prime  have  been  included  in  our  consolidated  financial statements commencing after the acquisition date.\n\nWe allocated the consideration to acquire Five Prime to the bemarituzumab IPR&amp;D program of $1.5 billion, which was expensed immediately in Acquired IPR&amp;D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income; deferred tax assets of $177 million; and other net liabilities of $47 million. The acquired IPR&amp;D expense was not tax deductible.\n\n## Otezla\n\nOn November 21, 2019, we acquired worldwide rights to Otezla, the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis,  along  with  certain  related  assets  and  liabilities,  from  Celgene.  Otezla  is  primarily  used  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate and is approved in more than 50 markets outside the United States, including the European Union and Japan. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under GAAP because substantially all of the value of the assets acquired was concentrated in the global intellectual property rights of Otezla. The operations of Otezla have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date.\n\nThe following table summarizes the consideration transferred and the allocation of the estimated accumulated cost, including tax adjustments, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions):\n\n",

Merck recorded $616 million in Research and development expenses in 2020 related to this transaction reflecting the upfront payment as well as a $16 million premium relating to the equity shares based on the price of Seagen common stock on the closing date. Seagen is also eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments of up to $2.6 billion, including $850 million in development milestones and $1.75 billion in sales-based milestones.\n\nConcurrent with the above transaction, Seagen granted Merck an exclusive license to commercialize Tukysa (tucatinib), a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive cancers, in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. Merck will be responsible for marketing applications seeking approval in its territories, supported by the positive results from the HER2CLIMB clinical trial. Merck will also co-fund a portion of the Tukysa global development plan, which encompasses several ongoing and planned trials across HER2-positive cancers, including breast, colorectal, gastric and other cancers set forth in a global product development plan. Merck will solely fund and conduct country-specific clinical trials necessary to support anticipated regulatory applications in its territories. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck made upfront payments aggregating $210 million, which were recorded as Research and development expenses in 2020. Seagen is also eligible to receive future contingent regulatory approval milestones of up to $65 million and will receive tiered royalties ranging from 20% to 33% based on annual sales levels of Tukysa in Merck's territories.\n\nAdditionally in September 2020, Merck acquired a biologics manufacturing facility located in Dunboyne, Ireland from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited for \u20ac256 million ($302 million). The transaction was accounted for as an acquisition of an asset. Merck recorded property, plant and equipment of $289 million and other net assets of $13 million. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.\n\nIn  July  2020,  Merck  acquired  the  U.S.  rights  to  Sentinel  Flavor  Tabs  and  Sentinel  Spectrum  Chews  from  Virbac Corporation  for  $410  million.  Sentinel  products  provide  protection  against  common  parasites  in  dogs.  The  transaction  was accounted  for  as  an  acquisition  of  an  asset.  Merck  recognized  intangible  assets  of  $401  million  related  to  currently  marketed products and inventory of $9 million at the acquisition date. The estimated fair values of the identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products were determined using an income approach. Actual cash flows are likely to be different than those assumed. The intangible assets related to currently marketed products will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of 15 years. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.\n\nAlso  in  July  2020,  Merck  and  Ridgeback  Biotherapeutics  LP  (Ridgeback),  a  closely  held  biotechnology  company, closed  a  collaboration  agreement  to  develop  molnupiravir  (MK-4482),  an  orally  available  antiviral  candidate  in  clinical development for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. See Note 5 for additional information related to this collaboration.\n\nIn  June  2020,  Merck  acquired  privately  held  Themis  Bioscience  GmbH  (Themis),  a  company  focused  on  vaccines (including a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, V591) and immune-modulation therapies for infectious diseases and cancer for $366 million.  The  acquisition  originally  provided  for  Merck  to  make  additional  contingent  payments  of  up  to  $740  million.  The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent consideration was $85 million at the acquisition date utilizing a probability-weighted estimated cash flow stream using an appropriate discount rate dependent on the nature and timing of the milestone payments. Merck recognized intangible assets for IPR&amp;D of $113 million, cash of $59 million, deferred tax assets of $72 million and other net liabilities of $32 million. The excess of the consideration transferred  over  the  fair  value  of  net  assets  acquired  of  $239  million  was  recorded  as  goodwill  that  was  allocated  to  the Pharmaceutical  segment  and  is  not  deductible  for  tax  purposes.  The  fair  values  of  the  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to IPR&amp;D were determined using an income approach. Actual cash flows are likely to be different than those assumed. In January 2021, the Company announced it was discontinuing development of V591 as discussed below. As a result, in 2020, the Company recorded an IPR&amp;D impairment charge of $90 million within Research and development expenses. The Company also recorded a reduction in Research and development expenses resulting from a decrease in the related liability for contingent consideration of $45  million  since  future  contingent  milestone  payments  have  been  reduced  to  $450  million  in  the  aggregate,  including  up  to $60  million  for  development  milestones,  up  to  $196  million  for  regulatory  approval  milestones,  and  up  to  $194  million  for commercial milestones.",

      "question": "How do Abbott's pension-related prior service costs compare to Gilead's unrealized investment gains in terms of their impact on long-term financial flexibility?",
      "answer": "Abbott reported a $8 million prior service cost for its pension plans in 2023, contributing to a total net loss of $2,314 million in accumulated other comprehensive income, indicating long-term financial obligations that will need to be amortized over time. In contrast, Gilead had $5 million in unrealized gains on its investment portfolio as of December 31, 2023, suggesting some financial flexibility from its asset holdings. While Abbott faces long-term liabilities from pension commitments, Gilead\u2019s unrealized gains provide a small buffer that could support its financial position under favorable market conditions.",

Based on sensitivity metrics from similar pension plans (e.g., Raytheon\u2019s 2024 disclosure showing a $X change in liabilities per 25 bps shift), such a decrease would meaningfully raise Pfizer\u2019s liabilities. This, in turn, would likely increase Johnson & Johnson\u2019s net periodic benefit cost, as JNJ\u2019s 2024 report shows that unrecognized gains and losses are amortized over the average remaining service period, directly impacting future benefit costs.",

These costs negatively impact operating earnings and represent a material financial burden for the segment. In contrast, CVS faces significant exposure to unpredictable medical cost trends, particularly in its Health Care Benefits segment, where forecast inaccuracies of even small percentages can lead to substantial adverse financial impacts. While CVS does not report a fixed dollar amount for regulatory compliance costs, it emphasizes high sensitivity to cost volatility, especially due to external factors like the ongoing effects of the pandemic and regulatory changes.

          "chunk_text": "our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trends. For 2022, those forecasts include adjustments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing, vaccines, direct COVID-19 treatment and deferred care. Risk-adjusted revenue has been adjusted for deferred care, and forecasted enrollment considers assumptions about the economic environment, though COVID-19 related impacts remain uncertain. During periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical costs trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19, accurately detecting, forecasting, managing, reserving and pricing for our (and our self-insured customers') medical cost trends and incurred and future health care and other benefits costs is more challenging. There can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projections reflected in our pricing, and our health care and other benefit costs (including COVID-19 related testing and vaccination and post-acute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs) are affected by COVID-19 and other external events over which we have no control. Even relatively small differences between predicted and actual health care and other benefit costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant adverse changes in our Health Care Benefits segment's operating results.\n\nA number of factors contribute to rising health care and other benefit costs, including COVID-19, previously uninsured members entering the health care system, changes in members' behavior and health care utilization patterns, turnover in our membership, additional government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes (including under the Families First Act, the CARES Act, and the American Rescue Plan Act), changes in the health status of our members, the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology, increases in the number and cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs and ultra-high cost drugs and therapies), direct-to-consumer marketing by drug manufacturers, the increasing influence of social media on our members' health care utilization and other behaviors, changes in health care practices and general economic conditions (such as inflation and employment levels). In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time, and future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this problem. Other factors that affect our health care and other benefit costs include epidemics or other pandemics, changes as a result of the ACA, changes to the ACA and other changes in the regulatory environment, the evolution toward a consumer driven business model, new technologies, influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we expected), clusters of high-cost cases, health care provider and member fraud, and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by efforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season had an earlier than average start and had a higher incidence of influenza than the 20182019 influenza season.\n\nOur Health Care Benefits segment's operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit costs through underwriting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs. Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we expect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating results.\n\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These risks are particularly acute during periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significant volatility and medical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19. Such risks are further magnified by the ACA and other existing and future legislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.\n\nThere can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.\n\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad can materially and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition, and we do not expect these conditions to improve in the near future.\n\nAdverse economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, including those caused by COVID-19, can materially and adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition, including:",

In contrast, TMO explicitly excludes acquisition-related costs, restructuring activities, and similar non-recurring items from its Adjusted Operating Income to reflect what it considers to be ongoing operational performance.

A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

In contrast, Danaher's identifiable assets in Life Sciences grew significantly, increasing from $17,572 million in 2022 to $23,730 million in 2023, which represents a 35% increase.

      "question": "How does Pfizer's risk of IPR&D impairment compare to Johnson & Johnson's amortization strategy for intangible assets, given the typical treatment of IPR&D assets in terms of amortization periods?",
      "answer": "Pfizer holds approximately $23.2 billion in IPR&D assets as of December 31, 2023, which are considered high-risk due to the uncertain nature of R&D and are not amortized but subject to impairment reviews. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson reports amortization periods for its intangible assets, with patents and trademarks amortized over 11 years and customer relationships over 19 years. This suggests that while Pfizer\u2019s IPR&D assets are not amortized and are more vulnerable to sudden value loss, JNJ relies on longer amortization schedules for its established intangible assets, reflecting a more stable asset base.",

In contrast, MRK's Animal Health segment treats R&D costs as direct expenses that are fully incurred at the segment level and included in its segment profit calculations. This means MRK\u2019s Animal Health profitability reflects the full burden of R&D spending, unlike segments where R&D is managed centrally. The difference in financial strategy suggests that MRK maintains tighter integration of R&D outcomes within Animal Health\u2019s performance metrics, while GILD manages R&D risk through capitalization post-approval, potentially smoothing earnings impact.",

          "chunk_text": "## Research and Development Expenses\n\nR&amp;D expenses consist primarily of clinical studies performed by contract research organizations ('CROs'), materials and supplies,  payments  under  collaborative  and  other  arrangements  including  milestone  payments,  licenses  and  fees,  expense reimbursements to the collaboration partners, personnel costs including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and  overhead  allocations  consisting  of  various  support  and  infrastructure  costs.  Milestone  payments  made  to  third-party collaborators are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Milestone payments made upon regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. From time to time, we enter into development and  collaboration  agreements  in  which  we  share  expenses  with  a  collaborative  partner. We  record  payments  received  from  our collaborative partners for their share of the development costs as a reduction of R&amp;D expenses.\n\nWe  charge  R&amp;D  costs,  including  clinical  study  costs,  to  expense  when  incurred.  Clinical  study  costs  are  a  significant component of R&amp;D expenses. Most of our clinical studies are performed by third-party CROs. We monitor levels of performance under each significant contract including the extent of patient enrollment and other activities through communications with our CROs. We accrue costs for clinical studies performed by CROs over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates, if required, based upon our ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the CROs. All of our material CRO contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual services completed by the CRO and certain non-cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination. Payments we make for R&amp;D services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are expensed as the services are provided.\n\n## Acquired In-Process Research and Development Expenses\n\nAcquired IPR&amp;D expenses reflect IPR&amp;D impairments as well as the initial costs of externally developed IPR&amp;D projects, acquired directly in a transaction other than a business combination, that do not have an alternative future use, including upfront payments related to various collaborations and the initial costs of rights to IPR&amp;D projects. The acquired IPR&amp;D is expensed on acquisition  date.  Future  costs  to  develop  these  IPR&amp;D  projects  are  recorded  in  Research  and  development  expenses  on  our Consolidated Statements of Income as incurred.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative ('SG&amp;A') expenses relate to sales and marketing, finance, human resources, legal and other  administrative  activities.  SG&amp;A  expenses  consist  primarily  of  personnel  costs,  facilities  and  overhead  costs,  outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses, and other general and administrative costs. SG&amp;A expenses also include the Branded Prescription Drug ('BPD') fee. In the United States, we, along with other pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded drug products, are  required  to  pay  a  portion  of  the  BPD  fee,  which  is  estimated  based  on  select  government  sales  during  the  prior  year  as  a percentage of total industry government sales.\n\nWe expense the costs of advertising, including promotional expenses, as incurred. Advertising expenses were $735 million, $795 million and $784 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nWe consider highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and an original maturity of three months or less on the purchase date to be cash equivalents.\n\n## Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\n\n## Marketable Debt Securities\n\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation  at  each  balance  sheet  date.  All  of  our  marketable  debt  securities  are  considered  available-for-sale  and  carried  at estimated  fair  values  and  reported  in  cash  equivalents,  short-term  marketable  debt  securities  or  long-term  marketable  debt securities.  Unrealized  gains  and  losses  on  available-for-sale  debt  securities  are  excluded  from  net  income  and  reported  in Accumulated  other  comprehensive  income  (loss)  ('AOCI')  as  a  separate  component  of  stockholders'  equity.  Other  income (expense), net, includes interest, amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, realized gains and losses on sales of securities and expected credit losses, if any. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. We regularly review our investments for declines in fair value below their amortized cost basis to determine whether the impairment is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Our review includes the creditworthiness of the security issuers, the severity of the unrealized losses, whether we have the intent to sell the securities and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost bases. When we determine that a portion of the unrealized loss is due to an expected credit loss, we recognize the loss amount in Other income (expense), net, with a corresponding allowance against the carrying value of the security we hold. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit losses is recognized in AOCI.",

The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of CVS's long-term debt fair value to interest rate changes compare with LLY's exposure through their investments that rely on quoted prices in active markets, given that both are influenced by market pricing dynamics?",
      "answer": "CVS estimates that an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of its long-term debt by approximately $3.5 billion. Meanwhile, LLY holds $1,379.7 million in U.S. public equity securities and $1,408.9 million in international public equity securities, which are categorized under Level 1 valuation and directly depend on quoted prices in active markets. This indicates that while CVS's debt value declines under rising rates, LLY's exposure is more directly tied to equity market volatility through its pension investments, both reflecting sensitivity to broader market pricing mechanisms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "BMY must compete for formulary inclusion with MCOs and PBMs like Optum, which controls nearly 80% of the U.S. prescription market. Optum operates Optum Rx as its PBM segment, directly competing with CVS\u2019s PBM services. CVS identifies Optum Rx (owned by UnitedHealth Group) as one of its primary PBM competitors, highlighting the significance of Optum\u2019s market position in shaping formulary access and rebate negotiations.

          "chunk_text": "In certain countries outside the U.S., patent protection is weak or nonexistent and we are challenged by generic versions shortly after we launch our innovative products. In addition, generic pharmaceutical companies may introduce a generic product before exclusivity has expired, and before the resolution of any related patent litigation. For more information about market exclusivity, refer to '-Products, Intellectual Property and Product Exclusivity.'\n\nWe believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to market them effectively in a highly competitive environment.\n\n## Pricing, Price Constraints and Market Access\n\nOur medicines are priced based on a number of factors, including the value of scientific innovation for patients and society in the context of overall health care spend, economic factors impacting health care systems' ability to provide appropriate and sustainable access and the necessity to sustain our investment in innovation platforms to address unmet medical needs. Central to price is the clinical value that this innovation brings to the market, the current landscape of alternative treatment options and the goals of ensuring appropriate patient access to this innovation and sustaining investment in creative platforms. We continue to explore new pricing approaches to ensure that patients have access to our medicines. Enhancing patient access to medicines is a priority for us. We are focused on: offering creative tiered  pricing  and  patient  support  programs  to  optimize  access  while  protecting  innovation;  advocating  for  sustainable  healthcare  policies  and  infrastructure, leveraging advocacy/payer's input and utilizing collaborations as appropriate; and improving access to care and supportive services for vulnerable patients through collaborations and demonstration projects.\n\nAn important factor on which the pricing of our medicines depends is government regulation. We have been subject to increasing international and domestic efforts by various governments to implement or strengthen measures to regulate pharmaceutical market access and product pricing and payment. In the U.S., we are required to provide discounts on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs. Federal government officials and legislators continue to face intense pressure from the public to manage the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals and have responded by pursuing legislation, such as the IRA and other rules that claim to potentially further reduce the cost of drugs for the federal government and other stakeholders. For further discussion on the IRA, refer to 'Item 1. Business-Government Regulation.' We are also required to comply with state laws that seek additional transparency into the cost of prescription drugs. We are monitoring efforts by states to seek additional rebates and limit state spending on drugs in light of budget pressures. These international, federal and state legislative  and  regulatory  developments  could  create  new  constraints  on  our  ability  to  set  prices  and/or  impact  our  market  access  in  certain  areas.  For  further discussion on the pricing pressure and its risk, refer to 'Item 1. Business-G overnment Regulation' and 'Item 1A. Risk Factors-Product, Industry and Operational Risks-Increased pricing pressure and other restrictions in the U.S. and abroad continue to negatively affect our revenues and profit margins.'\n\nThe growth and consolidation of MCOs and PBMs in the U.S., such as Optum (UHC), CVS Health (CVS) and Express Scripts (ESI), has also been a major factor in the healthcare marketplace. These PBMs control nearly 80% of the prescription market and are owned by payers UnitedHealthcare, Aetna, and Cigna, respectively. As MCOs and PBMs have been consolidating into fewer, larger entities, they have also been enhancing their purchasing strength and share of voice within the market. Over half of the U.S. population now participates in some version of managed care. MCOs can include medical insurance companies, medical plan administrators, health-maintenance organizations, Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, alliances of hospitals and physicians and other physician organizations. PBMs are third parties that support formulary management and contracting for MCOs.\n\nTo successfully compete for formulary position with MCOs and PBMs, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Exclusion of a product from a formulary can lead to its sharply reduced usage in patient populations due to higher out-of-pocket costs to patients. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete aggressively to have their products included on these formularies. Most new products that we introduce compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors. Where possible, companies compete for inclusion based upon unique features of their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy, usually provided as a rebate to the PBM, is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO and PBM formularies.",

          "chunk_text": "the Company is still able to contact declines, typically resulting in fewer IHEs scheduled during the fourth quarter of each calendar year.\n\n## Health Services Competition\n\nThe Company believes the primary competitive factors in the health services industry include: (i) the ability to negotiate favorable discounts from drug manufacturers as well as to negotiate favorable discounts from, and access to, retail pharmacy networks; (ii) the ability to identify and apply effective cost management programs utilizing clinical strategies, including the development and utilization of preferred formularies; (iii) the ability to market PBM and other health products and services; (iv) the commitment to provide flexible, clinically-oriented services to clients and be responsive to clients' needs; (v) the ability to attract and retain physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other medical personnel; (vi) the quality, scope and costs of products and services offered to clients and their members, as well as the care delivered to customers; and (vii) operational ex cellence in delivering services.\n\nThe Health Services segment has a significant number of competitors offering PBM services, including large, national PBM companies (e.g., Prime Therapeutics and MedImpact), PBMs owned by large national health plans (e.g., the Express Scripts business of Cigna Corporation and the Optum Rx business of UnitedHealth Group) and smaller standalone PBMs. The Health Services segment's MinuteClinic offerings compete with retail health clinics, urgent care and primary care offices. The Company competes for provider solutions and health information technology ('HIT') business with other large health plans and commercial health care benefit insurance companies as well as information technology companies and companies that specialize in provider solutions and HIT.\n\nThe Company's primary care operations compete with large and medium-sized local and national providers of primary care services and health system affiliated practices, for, among other things, contracts with payors, recruitment of physicians and other medical and non-medical personnel and individual patients. Principal primary care competitors for patients and payor contracts vary considerably in type and identity by market. Because of the low barriers of entry into the primary care business and the ability of physicians to own primary care centers and/or also be medical directors for their own centers, competition for growth in existing and expanding markets is not limited to large competitors with substantial financial resources.\n\nThe Company's ACO operations compete with healthcare risk management providers. Key competitors are companies that work directly with providers to enable them to successfully take risk in value-based care arrangements. Some of these competitors focus on a specific function - like analytics - while others offer more comprehensive services. Some key competitors operate nationally, while other competitors are more geographically focused.\n\nThe Company's IHE and related services operations compete with a wide variety of local and national providers of in-home, virtual and in-person diagnostic and evaluative services. Competitors include pure-play companies whose principal business is providing health risk assessments and similar services, as well as large payors, which may use a variety of different providers to perform health risk assessments across care settings or may perform some or all of their health risk assessments utilizing their own in-house capabilities.\n\n## Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment dispenses prescriptions in its retail pharmacies and through its infusion operations, provides ancillary pharmacy services including pharmacy patient care programs, diagnostic testing and vaccination administration, and sells a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise. The segment also conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings, and provides pharmacy fulfillment services to support the Health Services segment's specialty and mail order pharmacy offerings. As of December 31, 2024, the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment operated more than 9,000 retail locations, as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment filled 1.7 billion prescriptions on a 30-day equivalent basis and dispensed approximately 27.2% of total retail pharmacy prescriptions in the U.S.\n\n## Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness Products and Services\n\nA typical retail store sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of high-quality, nationally advertised brand name and proprietary brand merchandise. Pharmacy locations may also contract with Covered Entities under the federal 340B drug",

      "question": "How does Amgen's $1.2 billion net loss from the Horizon acquisition impact its exposure to post-retirement benefit liabilities compared to Johnson & Johnson's $64 million in post-retirement net losses?",
      "answer": "Amgen reported a $1.2 billion net loss from the Horizon acquisition, which includes significant amortization expenses from acquired intangible assets and inventory step-up. This large net loss could exacerbate Amgen's exposure to long-term liabilities such as post-retirement benefits, which are negatively impacted by financial underperformance. In comparison, Johnson & Johnson reported a much smaller $64 million in post-retirement net losses, indicating a relatively lower financial strain on its post-retirement obligations despite its broader provision of such benefits to U.S. retirees. The contrast in scale between Amgen's acquisition-related losses and J&J's post-retirement losses highlights differing financial pressures affecting their respective liability exposures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMGN \u2192 Net Losses: Amgen incurred a $1.2 billion net loss from the Horizon acquisition, which includes $633 million of inventory fair value step-up amortization and $479 million of intangible asset amortization.",
        "Hop 2: Net Losses \u2192 Post-Retirement Benefits: Net losses negatively impact post-retirement benefit obligations, as seen in Johnson & Johnson's $64 million in post-retirement net losses, which are part of a broader category of benefit liabilities affected by financial performance.",
        "Hop 3: Post-Retirement Benefits \u2190 JNJ: Johnson & Johnson provides post-retirement healthcare benefits to U.S. retirees and reported $64 million in net losses related to these benefits, indicating a measurable but relatively smaller financial burden compared to Amgen's acquisition-driven losses."

There are no significant patent or license expirations in the nex t three years that are ex pected to materially affect Abbott.\n\n## Operating Earnings\n\nGross profit margins were 50.9 percent of net sales in 2024, 50.3 percent of net sales in 2023, and 51.5 percent of net sales in 2022. The increase in 2024 reflects the favorable impacts of margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The decrease in 2023 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower sales of COVID-19 tests, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the negative impact in 2022 of the voluntary product recall in the nutritional business and the impact in 2023 of margin improvement initiatives.\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $2.8 billion in 2024, $2.7 billion in 2023, and $2.9 billion in 2022. The increase in R&amp;D expense in 2024 was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower 2024 charges for the impairment of in-process R&amp;D (IPR&amp;D) assets acquired in previous business combinations. In 2023, the decrease in R&amp;D expense was primarily driven by lower restructuring charges, lower impairment charges related to IPR&amp;D acquired in previous business combinations, and other cost reductions.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG &amp;A) expenses were $11.7 billion in 2024, $10.9 billion in 2023 and $11.2 billion in 2022. In 2024, higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The 2023 decrease in SG &amp;A expenses reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower restructuring charges in 2023, as well as the non-recurrence of 2022 expenses related to the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional Products segment.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nIn  2024, Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  certain  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and  improve  efficiencies  in  its  Diagnostic,  Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical and Nutritional businesses, including the discontinuation of its ZonePerfect product line. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $129 million, of which $62 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $21 million was recorded in Research and development, and $46  million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Payments related to these actions totaled $32 million in 2024 and the remaining liability totaled $97 million at December 31, 2024. In addition, Abbott recognized inventory related charges of $34 million and fixed asset impairment charges of $12 million related to these restructuring plans. \u00ae\n\nIn 2023, Abbott management approved plans to restructure various operations in order to reduce costs in its Medical Devices, Diagnostic, and Established Pharmaceutical businesses.

      "question": "How do DHR's and MDT's assumptions about non-U.S. compensation increases compare, and what might this indicate about their respective long-term pension liability exposures in international markets?",
      "answer": "DHR reports a non-U.S. rate of compensation increase at 3.0% for 2023, while MDT assumes a higher rate of 2.85% for 2024 and 2.75% for 2023 in its non-U.S. pension benefits. The increase in compensation directly affects the projected benefit obligations, as higher assumed increases lead to larger future pension payouts. Given MDT\u2019s relatively higher compensation increase assumption in its non-U.S. plans compared to DHR, MDT is likely projecting greater long-term pension liabilities for its international workforce. This suggests MDT may be anticipating more aggressive wage growth or different workforce dynamics in international markets compared to DHR.",

      "answer": "TMO reported a net actuarial loss of $200 million in 2022, which contributes to its pension liability and impacts its accumulated other comprehensive income. MDT, in contrast, amortized $64 million of net actuarial losses specifically for U.S. pension benefits in 2022, indicating a larger portion of its pension obligations were affected by actuarial assumptions. The BA 10-K shows that 2022 was a year of declining net actuarial losses overall, suggesting broader improvements in pension fund valuations. This implies that while both companies experienced pension-related losses, MDT's larger amortization suggests a more significant ongoing financial obligation, potentially requiring more aggressive funding or risk management strategies compared to TMO, whose smaller loss may indicate relatively better pension fund health or less volatility in assumptions.",

      "answer": "Eli Lilly shares equally with Boehringer Ingelheim the ongoing development and commercialization costs for the Jardiance product family in major markets, recognizing its portion as R&D and marketing expenses, while receiving royalties on net sales that may be adjusted based on sales thresholds. In contrast, Pfizer reports alliance revenues as its share of profits after deducting both cost of sales and commercialization costs, with specific alliance revenue figures like $190 million for Bavencio in 2023. Merck's framework clarifies that alliance revenue generally represents a partner's share of profits after accounting for commercialization costs, which provides context for interpreting both companies' financial reporting approaches.",

      "question": "How have the identifiable asset trends in JNJ's Innovative Medicine segment compared to Danaher's biotechnology segment investments evolved from 2021 to 2023, and what does this suggest about their respective healthcare innovation strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2021 to 2023, JNJ's Innovative Medicine segment maintained a relatively stable identifiable asset base, decreasing slightly from $58,436 million in 2022 to $58,324 million in 2023, indicating a mature and consolidated strategy focused on core therapeutic areas like Immunology and Oncology. In contrast, Danaher's biotechnology segment saw a decline in identifiable assets from $38,118 million in 2021 to $37,421 million in 2023, but with notable capital expenditures increasing from $385 million to $417 million over the same period, suggesting a more dynamic investment approach within a broader Life Sciences and Diagnostics portfolio. Given JNJ's $15.1 billion R&D investment in 2023 and its stated focus on developing innovative products across key disease areas, the stability in asset levels aligns with a long-term, internally driven innovation model, while Danaher's capital spending trends reflect a strategy that may emphasize continuous reinvestment and potential acquisitions to drive growth in its biotech division.",

      "answer": "Merck explicitly discloses its Pharmaceutical segment profits as $44,533 million in 2024, which excludes certain R&D and corporate overhead costs managed separately, such as depreciation and amortization from purchase accounting adjustments. This figure is used internally by Merck\u2019s Chief Executive Officer for resource allocation during planning and forecasting. In contrast, Pfizer\u2019s 2024 10-K does not provide a comparable breakdown of pharmaceutical segment profits, offering only consolidated financials without segment-level profit disclosures. As a result, while Merck\u2019s detailed segment reporting allows for granular analysis of its drug development and commercialization performance, Pfizer\u2019s lack of such transparency limits the ability to isolate and assess its exposure to core pharmaceutical operations, making cross-company profitability comparisons challenging.",

      "answer": "DHR's Non-U.S. Pension Benefits had a funded status of $ (524) million as of 2024, indicating a significant deficit. TMO, on the other hand, expects to pay $ 54 million in 2025, increasing to $ 66 million by 2029, with $ 405 million projected for 2030-2034. This suggests that while both companies face substantial Non-U.S. pension liabilities, TMO's expected future payments are larger in cumulative terms, potentially signaling a more extended or broader pension obligation base compared to DHR.",

By integrating Pfizer's specialty therapies into Optum Health's comprehensive care framework\u2014which includes care management, post-acute planning, and digital health tools\u2014patients could gain more coordinated access to high-cost specialty drugs alongside holistic disease management.

      "answer": "Merck's expected life assumption of 5.9 years (as disclosed in MRK_10k_2022.pdf) for stock options directly influences the valuation of equity-based compensation, with longer expected lives increasing expense estimates due to extended exposure to stock price volatility. This assumption depends on employee tenure, as noted in MDLZ_10k_2022.pdf, which states that expected life reflects how long employees are projected to hold their options. Thermo Fisher, as seen in TMO_10k_2022.pdf, bases its benefit payment projections on factors like average years employed, which directly ties into employee tenure. If workforce retention trends shift, both companies could face financial impacts: Merck through increased compensation expense if employees hold options longer than assumed, and Thermo Fisher through higher-than-expected pension or benefit liabilities if employees stay longer and draw benefits for extended periods.",

      "answer": "In 2024, Merck's Pharmaceutical segment reported profits of $44,533 million, which excludes the significant R&D expenses incurred by Merck Research Laboratories, indicating a high level of R&D investment not directly allocated to segment performance. This approach reflects a strategic focus on innovation and long-term drug development, with R&D costs managed separately to prioritize resource allocation to high-impact therapeutic areas. In contrast, Abbott's Established Pharmaceutical Products segment emphasizes geographic expansion and continuous improvement of existing products, with development often beginning post-acquisition or licensing. This strategy involves lower upfront R&D intensity and more focus on market penetration and lifecycle management of established drugs. Therefore, Merck's profitability figure indirectly highlights its heavier investment in early-stage R&D, while Abbott's approach aligns with a more incremental and geographically adaptive model.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $443 million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $440 million cash tax benefit would be available in a different tax able year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax  law . Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax  Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.\n\nAbbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the  IRS, the  IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax  positions are appropriate.\n\nThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which Abbott expects to be individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate tax ing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules. The enactment of current Pillar 2 model rules did not and is not projected to have a material impact to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n\nSee Note 15 - Taxes on Earnings to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax  rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\n\n## Research and Development Programs\n\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical device, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.\n\n## Research and Development Process\n\nIn  the  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment,  the  development  process  focuses  on  the  geographic  ex pansion  and  continuous  improvement  of  the segment's existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceutical Products does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the completion of an acquisition or licensing agreement.\n\nDepending upon the product, the phases of development may include:\n\n- Drug product development.\n- Phase  I  bioequivalence  studies  to  compare  a  future  Established  Pharmaceutical's  brand  with  an  already  marketed  compound  with  the  same  active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).\n- Phase II studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients.\n- Phase III studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use.\n- Phase IV and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications.\n\nThe specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to six or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries.\n\nIn the Diagnostic Products segment, the phases of the research and development process include:\n\n- Discovery, which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need.\n- Concept/Feasibility, during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated; testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility.\n- Development,  during  which  extensive  testing  is  performed  to  demonstrate  that  the  product  meets  specified  design  requirements  and  that  the  design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses.",

      "answer": "AbbVie capitalizes IPR&D acquired in business combinations as indefinite-lived intangible assets until regulatory approval is obtained, at which point they are amortized over their estimated useful life. In contrast, Johnson & Johnson reports a weighted average amortization period of 11 years for patents and trademarks, and 19 years for customer relationships and other intangible assets, indicating a structured amortization approach for already approved assets. This highlights a key difference in financial treatment: AbbVie defers amortization of IPR&D until approval, while JNJ applies defined amortization periods post-approval, with no amortization assigned to IPR&D itself as seen in Broadcom\u2019s disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABBV \u2192 IPR&D: AbbVie capitalizes IPR&D from business combinations as indefinite-lived intangible assets until regulatory approval, after which they become definite-lived and are amortized.",

        "Hop 3: Amortization Period \u2190 JNJ: Johnson & Johnson applies a weighted average amortization period of 11 years for patents and trademarks, and 19 years for customer relationships and other intangible assets, indicating a clear post-approval amortization policy."

Bristol-Myers Squibb reported a significant drop in alliance revenue from $730 million in 2021 to just $55 million in 2023, suggesting a potential link between rising costs and reduced alliance profitability.",

      "answer": "BMY reported a Rate of Compensation Increase of 1.4% in 2023, up from 1.2% in 2022, indicating a relatively conservative assumption about future wage growth. In contrast, MDT maintained a Compensation Increase Rate of 3.90% for 2023, significantly higher than BMY\u2019s rate, suggesting more aggressive assumptions about compensation growth. Hop 2 evidence shows that the Rate of Compensation Increase has generally increased across entities, with the value rising from 1.77% in 2022 to 1.98% in 2023. This divergence in assumptions implies that MDT may be projecting higher pension liabilities due to faster wage growth expectations, while BMY's lower rate suggests a more cautious outlook for future benefit obligations.",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson reported a decline in its Consumer Health segment identifiable assets from $27,355 million in 2020 to $25,081 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in asset base or investment in this segment. In contrast, CVS noted a 7.6% increase in front store same-store sales in 2021 compared to 2020, driven in part by strength in consumer health, including OTC test kits. This divergence suggests that while JNJ may be scaling back or experiencing asset depreciation in its consumer health business, CVS is seeing increased consumer demand and sales growth in this area, potentially gaining market traction even as JNJ's internal investment appears to contract.",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

The 2020 actuarial losses of $1.1 billion for qualified pension plans and $40 million for other post-employment plans were primarily driven by a decrease in the assumed discount rate from 2019.\n\nAbbVie's U.S. pension plan was modified to close the plan to new entrants effective January 1, 2022. In addition, a change to AbbVie's U.S. retiree health benefit plan was approved in 2020 and communicated to employees and retirees in October 2020. Beginning in 2022, Medicare-eligible retirees and Medicare-eligible dependents will choose health care coverage from insurance providers through a private Medicare exchange. AbbVie will continue to provide financial support to Medicare-eligible retirees. This change to the U.S. retiree health benefit plan decreased AbbVie's post-employment benefit obligation and increased AbbVie's unrecognized prior service credit as of December 31, 2020 by $397 million.\n\nIn connection with the Allergan acquisition, AbbVie assumed certain post-employment benefit obligations which were recorded at fair value.

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson reported identifiable assets of $25,081 million allocated to its Consumer Health segment in 2021, indicating a continued strategic investment in this area. In contrast, Pfizer exited the Consumer Healthcare segment entirely by 2021, as evidenced by the $0 revenue reported under 'Consumer Healthcare' in 2021 compared to $2,082 million in 2019. This divergence suggests that while JNJ maintained confidence in the value of consumer-facing health assets\u2014supported by $1,294 million in pre-tax income for the segment in 2021\u2014Pfizer likely reassessed the segment's strategic fit and long-term value, especially amid shifting market dynamics during the pandemic.",

      "answer": "MRK's Animal Health segment reported a 12% profit increase in 2024, driven by higher sales and lower manufacturing-related costs, despite risks such as disease outbreaks and supply chain disruptions affecting key products like Bravecto. In contrast, JNJ's MedTech segment saw a decline in income before tax from $4,669 million in 2023 to $3,740 million in 2024, even as segment sales rose from $30,400 million to $31,857 million. This divergence suggests that while MRK benefited from favorable cost management and strong demand in animal health, JNJ's MedTech segment faced margin pressures or increased expenses that offset sales growth, highlighting contrasting performance trajectories in their respective markets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MRK \u2192 Animal Health Segment: MRK's Animal Health segment faced risks such as disease outbreaks and supply chain disruptions, particularly affecting products like Bravecto, which accounted for $1.1 billion in sales in 2024. Despite these risks, the segment achieved a 12% profit increase due to higher sales and reduced manufacturing costs.",
        "Hop 2: Animal Health Segment \u2192 Segment Sales: Segment profits for MRK's Animal Health business are calculated as segment sales less cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D expenses directly incurred by the segment. The segment's 12% profit growth in 2024 was primarily driven by higher sales and lower manufacturing-related costs.",
        "Hop 3: Segment Sales \u2190 JNJ: JNJ's MedTech segment reported segment sales growth from $30,400 million in 2023 to $31,857 million in 2024, but income before tax declined from $4,669 million to $3,740 million. This indicates that despite increased sales, profitability was negatively impacted, contrasting with MRK's Animal Health segment performance."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition of the Company or its Animal Health business.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in 'Non-segment activity' in the above table. A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "answer": "CVS's Pharmacy Services segment contributed $6,859 million to adjusted operating income in 2021, reflecting its substantial role within the company's portfolio and underscoring its strategic importance as a stable and significant profit driver. This contrasts with Thermo Fisher's approach, where adjusted operating income is used as a non-GAAP metric to evaluate core operating performance, excluding items such as acquisition-related costs, restructuring activities, and amortization of intangible assets. Thermo Fisher management emphasizes this metric for forecasting and decision-making, indicating a focus on isolating recurring operational performance from one-time or non-core events. The combination of CVS's segment-level contribution and Thermo Fisher's broader financial reporting strategy shows how adjusted operating income serves dual purposes: as a performance indicator for internal business units at CVS and as a strategic evaluation tool for enterprise-wide operations at Thermo Fisher.",

A net increase in commercial paper obligations provided cash of $2.51 billion. Repayment of debt used cash of $11.74 billion, including $4.30 billion to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition of PPD. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (4.1 million shares) and the payment of $395 million in cash dividends. On September 23, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.00 billion of the company's common stock. Early in the first quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $2.00 billion of the company's common stock (3.3 million shares). At February 24, 2022, authorization remained for $1.00 billion of future repurchases of the company's common stock. As discussed in Note 10, in the first quarter of 2022 the company redeemed its 3.650% Senior Notes due 2025 for a total cash outlay of $375 million.\n\nDuring 2020, issuance of senior notes provided cash of $3.46 billion. Repayment of senior notes used cash of $710 million. The company's financing activities also included the repurchase of $1.50 billion of the company's common stock (4.5 million shares) and the payment of $337 million in cash dividends.\n\nThe company expects that for all of 2022, expenditures for property, plant and equipment, net of disposals, will be between $2.5 and $2.7 billion.\n\nIn addition to the obligations on the balance sheet at December 31, 2021, which include, but are not limited to, debt (Note 10), unrecognized tax benefits (Note 8), operating leases (Note 11) pension obligations (Note 7) and contingent consideration (Note 14), the company has entered into unconditional purchase obligations, in the ordinary course of business, that include agreements to purchase goods, services or fixed assets and to pay royalties (Note 12).\n\nThe company is contingently liable with respect to certain legal proceedings and related matters. An unfavorable outcome that differs materially from current accrual estimates, if any, for one or more of the matters described under the heading ' Product Liability, Workers Compensation and Other Personal Injury Matters, ' in Note 12 could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position as well as its results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nIn addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we use certain non-GAAP financial measures such as organic revenue growth, which is reported revenue growth, excluding the impacts of revenues from acquired/divested businesses and the effects of currency translation. We report organic revenue growth because Thermo Fisher management believes that in order to understand the company's short-term and long-term financial trends, investors may wish to consider the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation on revenues. Thermo Fisher management uses organic revenue growth to forecast and evaluate the operational performance of the company as well as to compare revenues of current periods to prior periods.\n\nWe report adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted other income/(expense), adjusted tax rate, and adjusted EPS. We believe that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to gain a better understanding of our core operating results and future prospects, consistent with how management measures and forecasts the company's core operating performance, especially when comparing such results to previous periods, forecasts, and to the performance of our competitors. Such measures are also used by management in their financial and operating decision-making and for compensation purposes. To calculate these measures we exclude, as applicable:\n\n- Certain acquisition-related costs, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, significant transaction/acquisition-related costs, including changes in estimates of contingent acquisition-related consideration, and other costs associated with obtaining short-term financing commitments for pending/recent acquisitions. We exclude these costs because we do not believe they are indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Costs/income associated with restructuring activities, such as reducing overhead and consolidating facilities. We exclude these costs because we believe that the costs related to restructuring activities are not indicative of our normal operating costs.\n- Equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities; impairments of long-lived assets; and certain other gains and losses that are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any predictability, including gains/losses on investments, the sale of businesses, product lines, and real estate, significant litigation-related matters, curtailments/settlements of pension plans, and the early retirement of debt. We exclude these items because they are outside of our normal operations and/or, in certain cases, are difficult to forecast accurately for future periods.\n- The expense associated with the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets because a significant portion of the purchase price for acquisitions may be allocated to intangible assets that have lives of up to 20 years.

      "answer": "TMO holds a stake in the Life Sciences segment, which incurred a $558 million depreciation and amortization (D&A) expense in 2023 as reported by DHR. This D&A expense, while non-cash in nature, contributes to lower operating profitability for the segment, which in 2023 stood at $1,209 million\u2014representing an operating margin of approximately 16.9%. Since TMO has a financial stake in this segment, its proportional share of this operating profit would be reduced by the capital costs embedded in this D&A figure. Meanwhile, DHR, as the reporting entity, must manage this capital intensity across its segments, which could influence reinvestment decisions or asset management strategies in Life Sciences. Therefore, the $558 million D&A expense reflects a shared financial burden that affects both TMO\u2019s proportional profitability and DHR\u2019s segment-level cash flow planning.",

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific supports pharmaceutical R&D through its Specialty Diagnostics segment, offering products such as diagnostic test kits, immunoassays, and reagents used in drug development and therapeutic drug monitoring. In 2021, Johnson & Johnson reported $1,198 million in additions to Property, Plant & Equipment specifically for its Pharmaceutical segment, reflecting significant capital investment in infrastructure. Comparing Thermo Fisher\u2019s enabling role in pharmaceutical innovation through diagnostic tools with J&J\u2019s direct capital spending highlights differing strategic approaches: one focused on supplying tools and diagnostics for drug development, and the other on expanding internal production and R&D capabilities.",

We also offer scanning electron microscopes which resolve features from the optical regime down to the nanometer length scale and are used for a wide variety of applications from materials characterization in science and engineering to applications in natural resources, manufacturing, and biological systems. Our DualBeam focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope systems are used for sample preparation, 3D characterization, nanoprototyping, and industrial failure analysis. Our focused ion beam microscopes are used in a range of process control, failure analysis, and materials research applications. We also offer electrical failure analysis instruments which are used in root cause failure analysis and quality control; microCT instruments which are micro-computed tomography solutions for quantitative analysis of a broad range of materials, providing 3D visualization of large volumes non-destructively; and a range of surface analysis instruments commonly used in the semiconductor, metals, coatings, and polymer industries as a product development and failure analysis tool. We also provide 3D visualization software that turns the data and images generated by a broad range of instruments into 3D visualizations of the microscopic sample, allowing for quantitative analysis of material properties.\n- Molecular Spectroscopy Instruments are divided into four primary techniques: FTIR, Raman, NIR and ultraviolet/visible (UV/Vis) spectroscopy. These technologies are typically used in the laboratory to provide information on the structure of molecules to identify, verify and quantify organic materials in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, polymer, chemical, and forensic sciences. Our material characterization instruments include rheometers and extruders that measure viscosity, elasticity, processability, and temperature-related mechanical changes of various materials.\n- Bulk Elemental Analysis Instruments and analyzers use XRF, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and arc spark optical emission (OES) techniques for accurate and precise analysis of bulk materials in the metals, cement, minerals, and petrochemicals industries.\n\n## Specialty Diagnostics Segment\n\nOur Specialty Diagnostics segment offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products in order to serve customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety laboratories. Our healthcare products are used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which improves patient care in a more cost-efficient manner. This segment has five primary businesses - Clinical Diagnostics, ImmunoDiagnostics, Microbiology, Transplant Diagnostics and our Healthcare Market Channel.\n\n## Clinical Diagnostics\n\nOur clinical diagnostics products include a broad offering of liquid, ready-to-use and lyophilized immunodiagnostic reagent kits, calibrators, controls and calibration verification fluids. In particular, we provide products used for COVID-19 testing; drugsof-abuse testing; therapeutic drug monitoring, including immunosuppressant drug testing; thyroid hormone testing; serum toxicology; clinical chemistry; immunology; hematology; coagulation; glucose tolerance testing; first trimester screening; tumor markers testing; and biomarkers testing for sepsis, acute myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. We also private-label many of our reagents and controls for major in vitro diagnostics companies through OEM arrangements. In many instances, we will work with customers or partners to develop new products and applications for their instrument platforms.\n\nWe have developed one of the broadest menus for drugs-of-abuse immunoassays. We also provide a broad offering of immunosuppressant drug immunoassays that can be used on a variety of clinical chemistry analyzers.\n\nOur clinical chemistry systems include analyzers and reagents to analyze and measure routine blood and urine chemistry, such as glucose and cholesterol; and advanced testing for specific proteins, therapeutic drug monitoring and drugs-of-abuse. Our diagnostic test range currently covers approximately 80 different validated methods. We also provide pre- and post-analytical automation for preparation of blood specimens before and after analysis, and specialty diagnostic tests based on patented biomarkers for sepsis, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, as well as intensive care treatments and prenatal screening.\n\n## ImmunoDiagnostics\n\nOur immunodiagnostics offerings include developing, manufacturing and marketing complete blood-test systems to support the clinical diagnosis and monitoring of allergy, asthma and autoimmune diseases.

Despite the intervening data showing a general increase in compensation rates across years (e.g., from 1.77% in 2021 to 1.98% in 2023 for the intervening entity), MDT's rate for 2024 shows a slight decrease compared to its 2023 rate of 2.75%.

      "answer": "Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) reported an adjusted operating income margin of 22.6% in 2024, reflecting strong operational efficiency. In contrast, CVS's Health Services segment generated $7,243 million in adjusted operating income in the same year, but the margin relative to its revenue ($173,605 million) is approximately 4.2%. This indicates that while TMO's business model delivers higher profitability as a percentage of revenue, CVS's Health Services segment operates at a much larger scale with lower margins.",

      "answer": "LLY experienced a $750.4 million decrease in benefit obligation in 2021 due to a rising discount rate and a $2.13 billion increase in 2020 due to a falling discount rate. In contrast, CVS saw its benefit obligation decrease from $6,462 million in 2020 to $6,009 million in 2021, a $453 million reduction. Based on HON's sensitivity framework, where a 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate reduces PBO by $475 million, LLY's change in 2021 suggests a much larger sensitivity, possibly due to a larger pension liability or a more significant rate increase. CVS's change aligns more closely with a moderate rate adjustment within the standard framework. This indicates that LLY's pension risk exposure is more volatile to discount rate movements compared to CVS.",

In contrast, ABBV capitalizes regulatory and commercial milestone payments made after regulatory approval as intangible assets and amortizes them over the product's useful life, while upfront payments and pre-approval milestones are expensed to Acquired IPRD and milestones expense. This reveals that both companies treat early-stage licensing rights similarly by expensing them immediately, but ABBV takes a longer-term view by capitalizing later-stage assets, potentially signaling greater confidence in post-approval commercial success.

          "chunk_text": "## Derivatives\n\nAll derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are classified as current or long-term based on the scheduled maturity of the instrument. Derivatives designated as hedges, are assessed at inception and quarterly thereafter, to determine whether they are highly effective in offsetting changes or cash flows of the hedged item. The changes in fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings immediately. The effective portions of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are subsequently recognized in earnings consistent with the underlying hedged item. If a derivative is no longer highly effective as a hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. The earnings impact related to discontinued cash flow hedges and hedge ineffectiveness was not material during all periods presented. If a hedged forecasted transaction becomes probable of not occurring, any gains or losses are reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. The Company also uses derivative instruments or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries  and  affiliates.  Realized  and  unrealized  gains  and  losses  from  these  hedges  are  included  in  foreign  currency  translation  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss.  Derivative cash flows, with the exception of net investment hedges, are principally classified in the operating section of the consolidated statements of cash flows, consistent with the underlying hedged item. Cash flows related to net investment hedges are classified in investing activities.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nRestructuring charges are recognized as a result of actions to streamline operations, realize synergies from acquisitions and reduce the number of facilities. Estimating the impact of restructuring plans, including future termination benefits, integration expenses and other exit costs, requires judgment. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Restructuring charges are recognized upon meeting certain criteria, including finalization of committed plans, reliable estimates and discussions with local works councils in certain markets.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nLoss  contingencies  from  legal  proceedings  and  claims  may  occur  from  government  investigations,  shareholder  lawsuits,  product  and  environmental  liability, contractual claims, tax and other matters. Accruals are recognized when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Gain contingencies (including contingent proceeds related to the divestitures) are not recognized until realized. Legal fees are ex pensed as incurred.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRefer to '-Note 2. Revenue' for a detailed discussion of accounting policies related to revenue recognition, including deferred revenue and royalties. Refer to 'Note 3. Alliances' for further details regarding alliances.\n\n## Research and Development and Acquired IPRD\n\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Clinical study and certain research costs are recognized over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. Research and development costs are presented net of reimbursements from alliance partners.\n\nAcquired IPRD expenses include upfront payments, contingent milestone payments in connection with asset acquisitions or in-license arrangements of third-party intellectual property rights, as well as any upfront and contingent milestones payable by BMS to alliance partners prior to regulatory approval.\n\nThe Company's Acquired IPRD by type of transaction was as follows:\n\n",

Clinical trial costs incurred by third parties are expensed as the contracted work is performed.\n\n## Acquired IPR&amp;D and Milestones Expenses\n\nIn an asset acquisition, payments incurred prior to regulatory approval to acquire rights to in-process R&amp;D projects are expensed as acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings unless the project has an alternative future use. These costs include upfront and development milestone payments related to R&amp;D collaborations, licensing arrangements, or other asset acquisitions that provide rights to develop, manufacture and/or sell pharmaceutical products. Where contingent development milestone payments are due to third parties, prior to regulatory approval, the payment obligations are expensed when the milestone results are achieved. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the remaining useful life of the related product.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nAbbVie utilizes the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method requires, among other things, that results of operations of acquired companies are included in AbbVie's results of operations beginning on the acquisition date and that assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Contingent consideration liabilities are recognized at the estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of assets acquired and l i a bi l i ti es  a s s umed i n certain cases may be subject to revision based on the final determination of fair value during a period of time not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. Legal costs, due diligence costs, business valuation costs and all other business acquisition costs are expensed when incurred.\n\nIn a business combination, the fair value of IPR&amp;D projects acquired is capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until the underlying project receives regulatory approval, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite-lived intangible asset, or discontinuation, at which point the intangible asset will be written off. R&amp;D costs incurred by the company after the acquisition are expensed to R&amp;D as incurred.\n\n## Collaborations and Other Arrangements\n\nThe company enters into collaborative agreements with third parties to develop and commercialize drug candidates. Collaborative activities may include j oi nt research and development and commercialization of new products. AbbVie generally receives certain licensing rights under these arrangements. These collaborations often require upfront payments and may include additional milestone, research and development cost sharing, royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development and commercialization. Upfront payments associated with collaborative arrangements and subsequent payments made to the partner for the achievement of development milestones prior to regulatory approval are expensed to acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Regulatory and commercial milestone payments made to the partner subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the estimated useful life of the related asset. Royalties are expensed to cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of earnings when incurred.\n\n## Advertising\n\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. Advertising expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, $2.2 billion in 2023 and $2.0 billion in 2022.\n\n## 57 | 2024 Form 10-K",

      "question": "How do JNJ's capital expenditures in Medical Devices compare with ABBV's supply chain strategy, particularly considering JNJ's consistent investment in this segment over the past three years?",
      "answer": "JNJ consistently allocated significant capital to its Medical Devices segment, with additions to Property, Plant & Equipment amounting to $1,933 million in 2021, $1,980 million in 2020, and $1,912 million in 2019, indicating sustained investment in infrastructure and production capabilities. This contrasts with ABBV\u2019s approach to Medical Devices, which relies heavily on third-party suppliers for manufacturing and component sourcing, as disclosed in their 2022 10-K. ABBV maintains alternate supply relationships and inventory buffers to mitigate disruption risks, suggesting a more outsourced and flexible model compared to JNJ's direct capital investment in the segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements\n\nIn addition to its independent efforts to develop and market products, AbbVie enters into arrangements such as acquisitions, option-to-acquire agreements, licensing arrangements, option-to-license arrangements, strategic alliances, co-promotion arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements and joint ventures. The acquisitions and option-to-acquire agreements typically include, among other terms and conditions, non-refundable purchase price payments or option fees, option exercise payments, milestones or earn-outs and other customary terms and obligations. The licensing and other arrangements typically include, among other terms and conditions, nonrefundable upfront license fees, option fees and option exercise payments, milestone payments and royalty and/or profit sharing obligations. See Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements-Other Licensing &amp; Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n## Third Party Agreements\n\nAbbVie has agreements with third parties for process development, product distribution, analytical services and manufacturing of certain products. AbbVie procures certain products and services from a limited number of suppliers and, in some cases, a single supply source. In addition, AbbVie has agreements with third parties for active pharmaceutical ingredient and product manufacturing, formulation and development services, fill, finish and packaging services, transportation and distribution and logistics services for certain products. AbbVie does not believe that these manufacturing related agreements are material because AbbVie's business is not substantially dependent on any individual agreement. In most cases, AbbVie maintains alternate supply relationships that it can utilize without undue disruption of its manufacturing processes if a third party fails to perform its contractual obligations. AbbVie seeks to maintain sufficient inventory of product to minimize the impact of any supply disruption.\n\nAbbVie is also party to certain collaborations and other arrangements, as discussed in Note 5, \"Licensing, Acquisitions and Other Arrangements-Other Licensing &amp; Acquisitions Activity,\" to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"\n\n## Sources and Availability of Raw Materials\n\nAbbVie purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world. In addition, certain medical devices and components necessary for the manufacture of AbbVie products are provided by unaffiliated third party suppliers. Despite the disruption to the global supply chain caused by COVID-19, AbbVie has continued to supply patients with no material supply impact, except for the previously-disclosed near-term supply issues impacting Lupron. Given the general increased global volatility due to the pandemic, AbbVie is monitoring and taking actions to mitigate potential supply shortages which may impact the fulfillment of product demand.\n\n## Research and Development Activities\n\nAbbVie makes a significant investment in research and development and has numerous compounds (and complementary devices) in clinical development, including potential treatments for complex, life-threatening diseases. AbbVie's ability to discover and develop new compounds is enhanced by the company's use of integrated discovery and development project teams, which include chemists, biologists, physicians and pharmacologists who work on the same compounds as a team. AbbVie also partners with third parties, such as biotechnology companies, other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions to identify and prioritize promising new treatments that complement and enhance AbbVie's existing portfolio. AbbVie also supplements its research and development efforts with acquisitions.\n\nThe research and development process generally begins with discovery research which focuses on the identification of a molecule that has a desired effect against a given disease. If preclinical testing of an identified compound proves successful, the compound moves into clinical development which generally includes the following phases:\n\n- Phase 1- involves the first human tests in a small number of healthy volunteers or patients to assess safety, tolerability and doses for later phases.\n- Phase 2- tests different doses of the drug in a disease state in order to assess efficacy.\n- Phase 3- tests a drug that demonstrates favorable results in the earlier phases in a significantly larger patient population to further demonstrate efficacy and safety in order to meet requirements to enable global approval.\n\nPreclinical data and clinical trials from all of the development phases provide the data required to prepare and submit an NDA, a Biological License Application (BLA) or other submission for regulatory approval to the FDA or similar",

      "answer": "ABBV reported $5.1 billion in 2023, $2.8 billion in 2022, and $2.7 billion in 2021 related to changes in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities from the DJS acquisition, which directly impacted 'other expense, net' in their consolidated statements of earnings. These liabilities introduce earnings volatility tied to Skyrizi sales forecasts and discount rate assumptions. In contrast, ABT's consolidated statements of earnings were audited by Ernst & Young LLP, who opined that ABT maintained effective internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. This suggests ABT has strong financial reporting controls that would help ensure consistency and accuracy in earnings outcomes, contrasting with ABBV's exposure to earnings volatility from contingent liabilities.",

      "answer": "PFE's top three U.S. wholesaler customers represented 24%, 30%, and 25% of total trade accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively, indicating a high concentration of receivables. In contrast, DHR's Cytiva segment held $482 million in trade accounts receivable in 2022, which was a significant portion of DHR's overall segment-level trade receivables of $487 million. Given that Cytiva is a core part of DHR's Life Sciences segment and was acquired for $20.7 billion with $10.2 billion in recorded goodwill, the financial dependency on Cytiva's performance is substantial, mirroring PFE's dependency on its top customers in terms of receivables concentration.",

The Company preliminarily recorded approximately $6.1 billion of goodwill related to the Aldevron Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2021, in addition to the Aldevron Acquisition, the Company acquired 13 businesses for total consideration of approximately $1.4 billion in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The Company preliminarily recorded an aggregate of approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the 13 other businesses acquired in 2021 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $100 million.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company's ('GE') Life Sciences division, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of acquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the 'Cytiva Acquisition'). Cytiva is a leading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and manufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company's Life Sciences segment results beginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to continue to provide additional sales and earnings growth opportunities for the Company's Life Sciences segment by expanding the business' geographic and product line diversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company's current biologics workflow solutions. To fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company divested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and transaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per diluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019. The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public offerings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ('MCPS Series A'), approximately $10.8 billion of proceeds from the 2019 issuance of euro-denominated and U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt, and approximately $6.9 billion from the aggregate of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, borrowings under the Company's Five-Year Facility (as defined below) and cash on hand. The Company recorded approximately $10.2 billion of goodwill related to the Cytiva Acquisition.\n\nDuring 2020, in addition to the Cytiva Acquisition, the Company acquired four businesses for total consideration of $256 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of the Company's Life Sciences and Environmental &amp; Applied Solutions segments. The Company recorded an aggregate of $231 million of goodwill related to these acquisitions. The aggregate annual sales of the five businesses acquired in 2020 at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were approximately $3.3 billion.\n\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five business for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these businesses at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the company's revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior to the acquisition, were $72 million.

      "answer": "T-Mobile\u2019s non-U.S. pension service cost discount rate rose from 0.65% in 2021 to 3.62% in 2023, while Johnson & Johnson\u2019s service cost discount rate increased from 2.14% to 4.85% over the same period. This upward trend aligns with broader market interest rate increases, as seen in the market data showing a rise from 0.72% to 3.27% for the service cost discount rate. Higher discount rates generally reduce the present value of future pension obligations, potentially easing pension cost pressures for both companies.",

      "answer": "Abbott focuses on geographic expansion and continuous improvement of existing pharmaceutical products without primary research, with development timelines ranging from one year for bioequivalence studies to over six years for complex formulations or geographic expansions (chunk 1). This approach likely prioritizes predictable returns through market penetration rather than high-risk innovation. In contrast, Merck's pharmaceutical segment profits grew by 15% in 2024, driven by higher sales, and the company is investing in high-potential collaborations like mRNA-4157 (V940), which involves a shared $250 million development cost and equal profit sharing with Moderna (chunk 3). This indicates a strategy of pursuing innovative therapies to drive future profit growth. While Abbott emphasizes cost control and market expansion of existing products, Merck is leveraging R&D partnerships to enhance its pharmaceutical segment's profitability through cutting-edge treatments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nIn October 2024, Abbott received a SNOD from the IRS for the 2020 Federal tax year assessing an additional $443 million of income tax. The primary adjustments proposed in the SNOD are substantially similar to the income allocation adjustments included in the 2017/2018 and 2019 SNODs. Abbott believes that the income reallocation adjustments proposed in the SNOD are without merit. The SNOD also contains other proposed adjustments and omissions that Abbott believes are erroneous and unsupported. In addition to the tax assessment for the 2020 tax year, the 2020 SNOD also contested a deduction for which an estimated $440 million cash tax benefit would be available in a different tax able year as allowed under applicable U.S. tax  law . Abbott filed a petition with the U.S. Tax  Court contesting the SNOD in December 2024.\n\nAbbott intends to vigorously defend its filing positions through ongoing discussions with the  IRS, the  IRS independent appeals process and/or through litigation as necessary. Abbott reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. Abbott continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax  positions are appropriate.\n\nThere are numerous other income tax jurisdictions for which tax returns are not yet settled, none of which Abbott expects to be individually significant. Reserves for interest and penalties are not significant.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation &amp; Development (OECD) has proposed a two-pillared plan for a revised international tax system. Pillar 1 proposes to reallocate tax ing rights among the jurisdictions in which in-scope multinational corporations operate. Abbott is continuing to analyze the Pillar 1 proposal. Pillar 2 proposes to assess a 15 percent minimum tax on the earnings of in-scope multinational corporations on a country-by-country basis. Numerous countries have enacted legislation to adopt the Pillar 2 model rules. The enactment of current Pillar 2 model rules did not and is not projected to have a material impact to Abbott's consolidated financial statements.\n\nSee Note 15 - Taxes on Earnings to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective tax  rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate.\n\n## Research and Development Programs\n\nAbbott currently has numerous pharmaceutical, medical device, diagnostic and nutritional products in development.\n\n## Research and Development Process\n\nIn  the  Established  Pharmaceutical  Products  segment,  the  development  process  focuses  on  the  geographic  ex pansion  and  continuous  improvement  of  the segment's existing products to provide benefits to patients and customers. As Established Pharmaceutical Products does not actively pursue primary research, development usually begins with work on existing products or after the completion of an acquisition or licensing agreement.\n\nDepending upon the product, the phases of development may include:\n\n- Drug product development.\n- Phase  I  bioequivalence  studies  to  compare  a  future  Established  Pharmaceutical's  brand  with  an  already  marketed  compound  with  the  same  active pharmaceutical ingredient (API).\n- Phase II studies to test the efficacy of benefits in a small group of patients.\n- Phase III studies to broaden the testing to a wider population that reflects the actual medical use.\n- Phase IV and other post-marketing studies to obtain new clinical use data on existing products within approved indications.\n\nThe specific requirements (e.g., scope of clinical trials) for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different countries and geographic regions. The process may range from one year for a bioequivalence study project to six or more years for complex formulations, new indications, or geographic expansion in specific countries.\n\nIn the Diagnostic Products segment, the phases of the research and development process include:\n\n- Discovery, which focuses on identification of a product that will address a specific therapeutic area, platform, or unmet clinical need.\n- Concept/Feasibility, during which the materials and manufacturing processes are evaluated; testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility.\n- Development,  during  which  extensive  testing  is  performed  to  demonstrate  that  the  product  meets  specified  design  requirements  and  that  the  design specifications conform to user needs and intended uses.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in 'Non-segment activity' in the above table. A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "question": "How does the contribution of $5,110 million from CVS's Health Care Benefits segment to its total Adjusted Operating Income of $17,534 million in 2023 compare with DHR's obligations for health care benefits provided to retired employees, particularly in the context of long-term funded status and financial strategy?",
      "answer": "CVS's Health Care Benefits segment contributed $5,110 million to its Adjusted Operating Income of $17,534 million in 2023, representing approximately 29% of the company's total performance metric. This contrasts with DHR's long-term obligations for health care benefits provided to retired employees, which are part of its broader postretirement benefit plans. DHR has ceased benefit accruals for U.S. pension plans since 2012 and follows a funding policy influenced by legal requirements, asset returns, and market conditions. While CVS leverages its Health Care Benefits segment as a significant contributor to financial performance, DHR manages its obligations more conservatively, aligning with its strategy to control long-term liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DHR \u2192 Health Care Benefits: DHR provides health care benefits to retired employees as part of its postretirement benefit obligations, with funding decisions influenced by legal, financial, and market factors.",

      "answer": "Medtronic's net periodic pension cost is highly sensitive to changes in the expected rate of return, with a 100-basis-point increase reducing the cost by $79 million. Merck, on the other hand, has increased its expected rate of return for its U.S. pension and postretirement plans from 7.00% in 2023 to 7.75% in 2024. This suggests that both companies are adjusting their pension strategies in response to market expectations, but Medtronic's financial exposure to changes in the expected return is quantifiably significant, whereas Merck's updated assumption reflects a forward-looking strategic shift.",

The following factors impacted year-over-year operating profit margin comparisons.\n\n## 2021 vs. 2020 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by:\n\n- Higher 2021 core sales volumes, an increased proportion of sales of higher margin product lines, incremental year-overyear cost savings associated with continuing productivity improvement initiatives and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in 2021, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales, service and marketing growth investments and incremental year-over-year material and labor costs - 560 basis points\n- 2020 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue, transaction costs deemed significant and integration preparation costs, net of 2021 acquisition-related fair value adjustments to inventory and deferred revenue in each case related to the acquisition of Cytiva - 210 basis points.\n- The incremental accretive effect in 2021 of acquired businesses, net of product line dispositions which did not qualify as discontinued operations - 60 basis points",

          "chunk_text": "- the ongoing expansion of the Company's diagnostic testing program which began in April 2020, an immaterial impact from COVID-19 vaccinations which began in December 2020 and no OTC test kit sales.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 9.3% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by the 9.3% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales increased 7.6% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to strength in consumer health, including the sale of OTC test kits, as well as increased beauty and personal care sales in 2021.\n- Other revenues increased 94.0% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to increased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in 2021.\n\n## Store impairments\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of approximately $1.4 billion related to the write-down of operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned closure of approximately 900 retail stores between 2022 and 2024. See Note 6 ''Leases'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\n- During 2021, the Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. See Note 5 ''Goodwill and Other Intangibles'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Retail/LTC segment include store payroll, store employee benefits, store occupancy costs, selling expenses, advertising expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.9 billion, or 10.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with increased volume including COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits. These increases were partially offset by gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021, the absence of incremental expenses associated with the Company's initial COVID-19 pandemic mitigation efforts incurred in 2020 and the impact of cost savings initiatives in 2021.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained relatively consistent at 20.1% and 20.0% in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 24.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the increased prescription and front store volume described above, improved generic drug purchasing and gains from anti-trust legal settlements of $231 million recorded in 2021. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's capabilities and colleague compensation and benefits.\n- As you review the Retail/LTC segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income benefited from the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales which contributed approximately 30% of the segment's adjusted operating income in 2021.\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Retail/LTC segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n- The increased use of generic drugs has positively impacted the segment's adjusted operating income but has resulted in third-party payors augmenting their efforts to reduce reimbursement payments to retail pharmacies for prescriptions. This trend, which the Company expects to continue, reduces the benefit the segment realizes from brand-to-generic drug conversions.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Retail/LTC segment's pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well",

      "answer": "CVS's Health Services segment balance increased by $10,451 million in 2023, primarily driven by acquisitions, including the $10,342 million acquisition contribution. During the same period, TMO's Adjusted Operating Income declined from $10,985 million in 2022 to $9,810 million in 2023, a decrease of $1,175 million. This contrast suggests that while CVS was expanding its Health Services segment through strategic M&A activity, TMO experienced a contraction in its adjusted operating performance, potentially signaling differing strategic or operational outcomes in the broader healthcare and life sciences market.",

      "answer": "Merck's long-term obligation asset allocation strategy targets a diversified portfolio with 30%-45% in U.S. equities, 15%-30% in international equities, 35%-45% in fixed-income investments, and up to 5% in cash and other investments, aiming to balance risk and return over the long-term with an expected annual standard deviation of approximately 11%. In contrast, Thermo Fisher reports cumulative basis adjustments related to fair value hedges under long-term obligations, which include the fair value of interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and currency exchange contracts. These adjustments reflect the financial impact of hedging instruments on long-term liabilities, directly influencing the company's balance sheet reporting and risk exposure. The comparison reveals that while Merck focuses on asset allocation to manage long-term obligation risks, Thermo Fisher uses derivative instruments and basis adjustments to hedge and report associated liabilities.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealthcare (UNH) reported a total backlog of $32.1 billion as of December 31, 2023, which includes anticipated revenue from signed contracts and expected renewals, with $18.7 billion expected to be realized within 12 months. This backlog is equivalent to remaining performance obligations (RPO), a metric also used by Pfizer (PFE), which disclosed $6 billion and $3.4 billion in RPO for Comirnaty and Paxlovid, respectively. While both companies use RPO to reflect unfulfilled firm orders, UNH's backlog is significantly larger in scale and spans a broader range of healthcare and technology services, whereas PFE\u2019s obligations are primarily tied to specific pharmaceutical products with delivery timelines extending through 2028.",

        "Hop 1: UNH \u2192 Backlog: UNH disclosed a total backlog of $32.1 billion, with $18.7 billion expected to be realized within 12 months, primarily related to Optum Insight contracts.",
        "Hop 2: Backlog \u2192 Remaining Performance Obligations: Backlog is defined as equivalent to remaining performance obligations (RPO), indicating the value of unfulfilled firm orders.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "Given Pfizer's performance-based compensation structure that can payout up to 200% of target awards, how does its fully unfunded U.S. pension obligations ($627M projected benefit obligation vs. $0 plan assets in 2024) compare with Merck's pension funding strategy, which shows declining assets in U.S. plans ($2M total assets in 2024 down from $3M in 2023)?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's performance-based compensation structure, which allows for payouts up to 200% of target awards, may increase financial pressure given its fully unfunded U.S. pension obligations where the 2024 projected benefit obligation stands at $627M with $0 in plan assets. In contrast, Merck maintains a smaller but declining U.S. pension asset base, with total assets dropping from $3M in 2023 to $2M in 2024. This suggests divergent strategies in managing long-term liabilities, with Pfizer bearing full unfunded exposure while Merck shows modest asset support that is decreasing over time.",

      "answer": "Johnson & Johnson incurred a $1.25 billion in-process R&D expense to secure global rights to the NM26 bispecific antibody, which highlights its strategic focus on advancing high-potential pipeline assets within the Innovative Medicine segment. This aligns with JNJ\u2019s broader approach of prioritizing R&D investments in promising therapeutic areas, as evidenced by its restructuring efforts in 2023 and 2024, which included exiting certain development programs in infectious diseases and vaccines. Meanwhile, Thermo Fisher Scientific\u2019s disclosure of its own Research and Development Expense indicates an ongoing commitment to innovation, although the nature and scale of specific pipeline investments are not detailed in the provided evidence. Thus, while both companies emphasize R&D, JNJ's approach appears more targeted and transformational in 2024, whereas Thermo Fisher\u2019s strategy remains more generalized in the disclosed data.",

Meanwhile, Merck's Januvia/janumet revenue declined by 33% in 2024, with foreign exchange contributing to a 4 percentage point difference between reported (-33%) and constant currency (-29%) performance.

There are no significant patent or license expirations in the nex t three years that are ex pected to materially affect Abbott.\n\n## Operating Earnings\n\nGross profit margins were 50.9 percent of net sales in 2024, 50.3 percent of net sales in 2023, and 51.5 percent of net sales in 2022. The increase in 2024 reflects the favorable impacts of margin improvement initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The decrease in 2023 reflects the unfavorable effects of lower sales of COVID-19 tests, foreign exchange, and higher costs for various manufacturing inputs, partially offset by the nonrecurrence of the negative impact in 2022 of the voluntary product recall in the nutritional business and the impact in 2023 of margin improvement initiatives.\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $2.8 billion in 2024, $2.7 billion in 2023, and $2.9 billion in 2022. The increase in R&amp;D expense in 2024 was primarily driven by higher spending on various projects, partially offset by lower 2024 charges for the impairment of in-process R&amp;D (IPR&amp;D) assets acquired in previous business combinations. In 2023, the decrease in R&amp;D expense was primarily driven by lower restructuring charges, lower impairment charges related to IPR&amp;D acquired in previous business combinations, and other cost reductions.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG &amp;A) expenses were $11.7 billion in 2024, $10.9 billion in 2023 and $11.2 billion in 2022. In 2024, higher selling and marketing spending to drive growth across various businesses was partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign exchange. The 2023 decrease in SG &amp;A expenses reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower restructuring charges in 2023, as well as the non-recurrence of 2022 expenses related to the voluntary product recall in the Nutritional Products segment.\n\n## Restructurings\n\nIn  2024, Abbott  management  approved  plans  to  streamline  certain  operations  in  order  to  reduce  costs  and  improve  efficiencies  in  its  Diagnostic,  Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceutical and Nutritional businesses, including the discontinuation of its ZonePerfect product line. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $129 million, of which $62 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $21 million was recorded in Research and development, and $46  million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Payments related to these actions totaled $32 million in 2024 and the remaining liability totaled $97 million at December 31, 2024. In addition, Abbott recognized inventory related charges of $34 million and fixed asset impairment charges of $12 million related to these restructuring plans. \u00ae\n\nIn 2023, Abbott management approved plans to restructure various operations in order to reduce costs in its Medical Devices, Diagnostic, and Established Pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $144 million of which approximately $56 million was recorded in Cost of products sold, $22 million was recorded in Research and development and $66 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses. In addition, Abbott recognized fixed asset impairment and inventory related charges of $31 million related to these restructuring plans.\n\nIn 2022, Abbott management approved plans to streamline operations in order to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in its Medical Devices, Nutritional, Diagnostic, and Established Pharmaceutical businesses. Abbott recorded employee related severance and other charges of $234 million of which $59 million was recorded in  Cost of products sold, $36 million was recorded in  Research and development and $139 million was recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses.

      "answer": "BMY operates as a single segment focused on pharmaceuticals, with its CEO allocating resources based on consolidated net income rather than segmented performance metrics. In contrast, MRK explicitly breaks out its pharmaceutical segment profits, which totaled $44,533 million in 2024, and clarifies that R&D expenses from Merck Research Laboratories are not allocated to segment profits. This means that while both companies are centered on pharmaceutical operations, MRK provides a more segmented financial view that excludes certain centralized R&D costs from its segment reporting, unlike BMY which does not disclose such segmented profit metrics and instead evaluates performance on a consolidated basis.",

All  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  are  eliminated.  Material  subsequent  events  are evaluated and disclosed through the report issuance date. Refer to the Summary of Abbreviated Terms at the end of this 2024 Form 10-K for definitions of capitalized terms used throughout the document.\n\nAlliance and license arrangements are assessed to determine whether the terms provide economic or other control over the entity requiring consolidation of an entity. Entities controlled by means other than a majority voting interest are referred to as variable interest entities and are consolidated when BMS has both the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impacts its economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entity.\n\n## Business Segment Information\n\nBMS operates in a single segment engaged in the discovery, development, licensing, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of innovative medicines that help  patients  prevail  over  serious  diseases. A  global  research  and  development  organization  and  supply  chain  organization  are  responsible  for  the  discovery, development, manufacturing and supply of products. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell the products. The business is also supported by global corporate staff functions.  Consistent with  BMS's operational structure, the  Chief  Executive  Officer ('CEO'), as the chief operating decision maker, uses consolidated net income or loss as reported on the income statement when managing and allocating resources at the corporate level. Managing and allocating resources at the global corporate level enables the CEO to assess both the overall level of resources available and how to best deploy these resources across functions,  therapeutic  areas,  regional  commercial  organizations  and  research  and  development  projects  in  line  with  our  overarching  long-term  corporate-wide strategic goals, rather than on a product or franchise basis. The determination of a single segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the CEO for purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting future periods.  For further information on product and regional revenue, see '-Note 2. Revenue.'\n\nThe following table represents the significant segment expenses regularly provided to the CEO:\n\n",

The chief operating decision maker (M erck's Chief Executive Officer) uses segment profit to allocate resources predominately during the planning and forecasting process. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, research and development expenses incurred by M erck Research Laboratories, the Company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utilized by these divisions and, therefore, they are not included in segment profits. In addition, costs related to restructuring activities, as well as the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments are not allocated to segments.",
